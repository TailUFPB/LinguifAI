miami  reuters    the man answering a volunteer s knock on the door in the kendall section of miami dade county on saturday was emphatic  not only would he vote but  esperamos que la presidenta gane    spanish for  we hope madam president wins   volunteers across florida made a last minute push to get voters to the polls this weekend with early voting ending on sunday ahead of election day on tuesday  pitting republican donald trump against democrat hillary clinton  or  la presidenta   as the man at the door called her  latino voters like the man in kendall and elsewhere could have an outsized influence in tuesday s election  early voting data may portend a jump in the number of hispanic voters this year  especially in the key swing states of nevada and florida  and clinton would likely be the biggest beneficiary  clinton has polled much stronger among latino voters nationwide  a washington post univision poll released last week gave her  percent of the hispanic vote to trump s  percent  trump has fared poorly with america s largest minority voting group  having repeatedly angered hispanics with disparaging comments about their communities   a recent poll conducted by the firms the tarrance group and bendixen and amandi found that hispanic registered voters in florida favor clinton  percent to  percent  in nevada the gap was even wider    percent for clinton and  percent for trump  in florida  the clinton campaign estimates early latino voting is up  percent  or more than twice as much  compared to   according to a field report dated wednesday  democratic strategist steve schale  a florida expert  estimated that   more hispanics had voted early or by mail as of wednesday than had voted early or by mail in the entire  election  according to a post on his blog   and keep in mind  because hispanic is a self identifying marker  studies have found that the real hispanic vote is larger than the registration  so while hispanics might make up   percent of the voters who have voted so far  in reality  the number is larger   he wrote  despite the surge in early voting  there is no certainty about which candidate people chose for president  there is also no guarantee that the higher latino turnout rate will continue on election day and that they and other minority voters will make enough of a difference to swing florida and other states   trump kicked off his maverick campaign last year by describing mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals  and made a tough stance on immigration a signature part of his vision for america  he called for a wall to be built on the border and said an american born federal judge could not do his job because of his mexican heritage  that rhetoric might be hurting him in an increasingly diverse florida  where many election watchers believe trump must win to have a chance to secure the minimum  votes in the electoral college needed to claim the white house   daniel smith  a political science professor at the university of florida who also does voting research  said democrats have a strong lead among hispanics who have voted early in florida    from my perspective this is hispanics in florida reacting viscerally to donald trump   said smith   his scorched earth campaign against immigrants and especially hispanics is coming home to roost in florida   the state of nevada does not note race or ethnicity on its voter registration but other data there suggest latinos also are turning out in force  for one thing  clark county has seen a surge in early voting  between in person and absentee voting  registered democrats have now returned over   more ballots than registered republicans there  those figures do not indicate which candidate voters picked  only the party with which the voters are registered  friday alone saw   votes in person in clark county  photos making the rounds on social media showed especially long lines at a cardenas market voting site  which stayed open late to accommodate the surge of voters  clark county  which includes las vegas  has a large latino population     percent  compared to   percent for nevada as a whole  according to the u s  census  even more republican votes elsewhere in the state are so far not enough to counterbalance that democratic lead in clark county  overall  the democrats have cast around   more ballots in nevada than republicans  that s not an accident  said artie blanco  the nevada state coordinator for the progressive group for our future  her organization and others banded together in a major get out the vote push  especially among voters of color  and the coalition s data suggest that the effort paid off  twenty two percent of democrats who voted on friday had a conversation with someone from that progressive coalition at some point after oct    blanco said  among latino voters on the last three voting days  the coalition had conversations with  percent of them after oct    according to the group s data  trump on saturday took a jab at the early voting turnout in nevada   they didn t get the kind of vote that they needed to stop us on tuesday   trump said in reno   tuesday is our day in this state   he said reno and northern nevada could  carry us all the way to washington    but blanco said the votes were instead the result of major work to bring out voters  especially people of color and that progressive organizations were not done yet   we have all these voters that we need to now go back and say   you ve got one day    she said of those who had not yet cast ballots
