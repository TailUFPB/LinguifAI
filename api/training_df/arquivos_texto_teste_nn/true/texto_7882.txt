sydney singapore  reuters    investors and traders in asia indicated on monday they are mostly increasing their bets on democratic nominee hillary clinton winning the u s  presidential race after the second of three debates with republican party nominee donald trump   some  though remain cautious  saying there was still a chance of a surprise trump win  they said many in the markets were wary after being burned by the shock  brexit  vote in june  msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan edged up around   percent by mid afternoon in singapore on monday  while wall street index futures were little changed after clinton exchanged barbs with republican party nominee donald trump in the televised event  which was shown live across trading rooms during asia s morning   the  minute debate quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a  video that emerged on friday in which trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women   the controversy has caused some senior republicans to withdraw their support for him    for those that think that trump has a very  very low chance of winning the u s  elections it might be a good time to go long on global equities   said itay tuchman  citi s head of markets for australia and new zealand  markets could be prematurely pricing in a clinton victory  as they did during the  brexit  vote in june  when the united kingdom voted unexpectedly to leave the european union  said lee jin yang  research analyst for aberdeen asset management in singapore   we need to remember that brexit only became a key focus one week before the vote  the market had priced in near zero probability of it happening but it did    according to a cnn online poll  clinton won the debate by   percent to  percent  but josh crabb  head of asian equities at old mutual global investors in hong kong  said he is wary of such polls   especially after brexit    the way that mainstream media  and a lot of commentators  interpret the outcome of the debate may be different to what the voting public in general takes away   crabb said   that is a concern because often  a lot of these polls have not been quite as accurate as people are expecting   mathan somasundarum  a strategist at stock brokerage baillieu holst in sydney  said a clinton victory would reduce the risk of the united states adopting a strong trade protectionist policy  trump has been highly critical of the nafta trade deal with mexico and canada as well as the trans pacific partnership  which has yet to be ratified by the u s  congress  he has promised to build a border wall and make mexico pay for it   i would expect the u s  dollar to weaken and you would expect then there is some pressure coming off emerging markets  and then commodities  which  are a  proxy for emerging markets   somasundarum said   china  commodities and the aussie dollar should do better   while the markets had already begun to price in a clinton victory even before the republican party s crisis over trump s  remarks  some are beginning to game out what would happen if the democrats won both houses of congress  which are now republican controlled   the possibility of the democrats controlling congress and the white house is a concern to some in the markets as they see it leading to more regulation of businesses and higher taxes   over time  people will start thinking  is this going to mean a big difference in the way taxation works  is it going to mean more government involvement    said crabb at old mutual global in hong kong   but the immediate reaction will be a relief rally   angus gluskie  managing director of white funds management in sydney  said while markets usually view one party dominating the government as a risk  it could be different this time   investors have been disappointed by the political stalemate over recent years  which has prevented meaningful and well needed changes being pursued   gluskie said  steven friedman  senior investment strategist at bnp paris bas investment partners in new york  said he saw little in the debate that represented a game changer for either candidate   this obviously plays to clinton s advantage  given her lead in the polls   he said  strategists in a recent reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on nov   by clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year  largely because her positions   unlike her opponent s   are well known   chris brankin  chief executive at stock brokerage td ameritrade asia  said he thought trump was much better prepared for the town hall debate in st  louis than he was for the first debate  and that could give markets some pause    i have always said markets  know what they get  with hillary  as she as always been seen as pro wall street and trump is a bit of an unknown for investors     after tonight s debate i still think there are a lot of questions as who will be elected into office next month and markets are probably going to remain range bound till after the u s  elections
