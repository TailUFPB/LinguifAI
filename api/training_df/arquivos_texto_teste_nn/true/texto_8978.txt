turnberry  scotland  reuters    u s  presidential candidate donald trump thrust himself into the heart of britain s vote to leave the european union on friday  calling it a  great  development and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign  in scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns  the wealthy new york businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the  brexit  vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order  it s an argument he said fit in with his own campaign to shake up washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration   people want to take their country back  they want to have independence in a sense  you see it with europe  all over europe   trump    the presumptive republican nominee  told a news conference at the trump turnberry golf course   he said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more european countries might want to break with the  nation european union  americans  he said  would have a chance  to re declare their independence  and  reject today s rule by the global elite  when they vote on nov     so i think you re going to have this happen more and more  i really believe that  and i think that it s happening in the united states  it s happening by the fact that i ve done so well in the polls   he said  trump s rival  democratic candidate hillary clinton  said in a statement   this time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm  steady  experienced leadership in the white house to protect americans  pocketbooks and livelihoods  to support our friends and allies  to stand up to our adversaries  and to defend our interests     it also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country  not tear each other down   said clinton    a former u s  secretary of state  who had openly favored britain s remaining in the eu      more than half a million britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar trump from entering britain  where he has business interests  in response to his call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states  british lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech  trump assailed as inappropriate democratic president barack obama s open appeals to britain not to split off  shaking off a tradition of not commenting on u s  politics from foreign soil  trump said obama had been embarrassed   it s something he shouldn t have done  it s not his country  it s not his part of the world  he shouldn t have done it  and i actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail   trump said  democrats and republicans both took stock of a decision that seemed to indicate trump s campaign had tapped into a global wave that might be hard to contain  joined by his sons don jr  and eric and daughter ivanka  who help manage his business affairs  trump arrived in his signature helicopter near his clubhouse resort  a scottish flag blowing in the wind  the candidate praised his children s business acumen  his scottish born mother and the golf course itself  dismissing complaints from republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home  as it happened  by turning up when he did  trump drew global televised attention to his views on the brexit vote within hours of britons waking up to the surprising result   i said this was going to happen and i think that it s a great thing   said trump  who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the eu  trump had exchanged insults with british prime minister david cameron  who supported staying in the eu and said on friday after the vote he would resign by october  cameron had called trump s anti immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong   i think david cameron is a good man  he was wrong on this   he didn t get the mood of his country right  he was surprised   trump said  predicting that britain and the united states would remain  great allies   wearing a white hat emblazoned with his  make america great again  campaign slogan  trump walked up to the news conference with bagpipers heralding his arrival  his visit to turnberry  to be followed by a stop at his resort in aberdeen on saturday  coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in britain and dealt the biggest blow to the european project of greater unity since world war two  some scots who are turnberry members and who sat in the front row at trump s news conference muttered  no  whenever the subject of scotland leaving the eu came up  scotland voted by a margin of  percent to  percent to remain in the eu  a result sharply at odds with britain as a whole  which voted  percent to  percent to leave  trump  who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with  percent of americans in an opinion poll  defeated a crowded field of opponents for the republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another  the latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week  a month before the party convention  trump invested   million in renovating the resort and golf course on scotland s west coast   km   miles  southwest of glasgow
