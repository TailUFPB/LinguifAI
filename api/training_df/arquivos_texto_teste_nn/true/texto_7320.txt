nogales  mexico  reuters    donald trump s election victory and his plans to crack down on illegal immigration is so troubling for the groups of men gathered just south of a rusty  towering fence on the u s  mexico border that some are even considering going home  for most poor central americans and mexicans at travelers   shelters in the desert town of nogales  trump s threats to build a wall along the whole border and deport millions of illegal immigrants have not made them abandon their harrowing journeys and hopes of a better life in the north   but for some like juan alberto lopez  the prospect of living in a country they believe will become more hostile to people like them no longer holds enough appeal to make the risky crossing across the desolate arizona borderland   now everything s changed   said the despondent lopez    as he sat staring blankly at the ground in outside one migrant center  under a cobalt sky  lopez hails from the southern state of chiapas  mexico s poorest  and lived for two years in arizona and utah working in construction before being deported in january  under one of trump s proposals  he would face a two year federal prison sentence for returning after deportation  he had decided to go back to the united states when democratic candidate hillary clinton was projected to win the election  now  he plans to seek work in nogales instead  or go home    they re going to detain all the migrants  and if it s like that  it s better to stay here with your own people  be happy  and just endure it   he added  echoing the sentiments of a third of more than a dozen migrants interviewed by reuters in nogales following trump s victory  in running for president  trump promised to deport millions of illegal immigrants as well as build a wall along the border to stop others entering the united states  and make mexico pay for it  his uncompromising stance helped drive a rush over the u s  border as some migrants calculated it was better to cross over before the election in case trump won  that could continue in coming months even as some like lopez decide they no longer want to live in the united states  during fiscal year   which ended in september  the number of people detained along the u s  mexico border surpassed    a  percent jump from last year  although it was less than in   official u s  data published last month showed   i really don t care about president trump  i m always going to cross regardless of any walls he wants   said alexi solano    a migrant from el salvador  whose wife and young son are already in los angeles   that doesn t matter to us  what we want is to be together with our families   mexico s deputy interior minister for migration  humberto roque villanueva  said he expected that flow to peak in  as trump will ramp up already tough deportation policies applied by president barack obama   a certain radicalization of the north american immigration policy is coming   roque villanueva said  in nogales  a city of   dotted with factories of multinational firms like motorola and b e aerospace  migrants say people smugglers typically charge    per person for a one way ticket across the border  as with long stretches of the   mile    km  border  a  foot tall fence already exists along the international boundary here  built in  and made up of thick rust colored metal beams that follow the rocky terrain for miles to the west and east of the city   beyond the fence on the u s  side  a parallel set of wooden posts are topped with cameras and sensors  in the distance  u s  immigration vehicles slowly patrol the border   some  miles   km  to the east of town  the towering fence comes to an end and is replaced with a waist high barrier that mainly serves to stop trucks plowing through the desert  while some migrants trudge around the barricade  risking weather exposure on foot through rugged terrain menaced by drug cartel thugs and poisonous snakes  others opt to ride hidden in trucks that drive through official crossings  a route made possible  several said  by bribes  maria engracia robles  a roman catholic nun who runs el comedor center for deportees and migrants within sight of the border fence in nogales  thinks trump s victory will likely bring more hardship and worries about the challenges that mass deportations would bring    more anguish  tears  laments  and lots of people in mexico without work  without anything to do and no place to go   said robles  whose center provides free meals  clothes and basic medical care  braced against the dry wind  dozens of hungry migrants line up around el comedor s entrance for breakfast each morning  on thursday  two men just inside the shelter could be overheard on mobile phones asking for a coyote  or human trafficker  to attempt another crossing   here there is no work  and salaries are terrible   said robles   the u s  mexico border is home to the largest per capita wage differential of any land border on the planet  with average u s  wages about five times higher than mexican wages   further south  in central america  incomes are even lower  and crime worse  fueling a surge of migration in recent years  more central american migrants were apprehended on the u s  southern border than mexicans this year    jose flores    a honduran migrant who set out for the united states three months ago  ticked off the perils posed by violent gangs and dismal job prospects in his home country   i imagine it s going to get a lot harder to cross   he said   but what hasn t changed is we re looking for a better life    this story has been refiled to fix typo in  paragraph
