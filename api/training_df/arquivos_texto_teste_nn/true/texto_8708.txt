 washington  reuters    merrick garland hit an unwanted milestone on tuesday as the federal appeals court judge s nomination to the u s  supreme court reached its  day with no senate action  tying for the longest pending nomination ever to the high court   in a move with little precedent in american history  the republicans who control the senate have simply refused to take any action on president barack obama s nomination of garland    for a lifetime job on the nation s top court   having been nominated on march  to replace conservative justice antonin scalia  who died on feb    garland  chief judge of the federal appeals court in washington  has now matched louis brandeis for the longest time between nomination and senate action   in   the senate voted to confirm brandeis  making him america s first jewish justice   the u s  constitution assigns the senate the power to confirm the president s nominations to the supreme court  the senate s inaction on garland has made the court vacancy a key political prize in a presidential election year   republicans  hopeful of winning back the white house from the democrats in the nov   election  insist that obama s successor name scalia s replacement  who could have a lasting effect on the ideological balance of a court now split with four liberals and four conservatives   obama has appointed two of the current justices  liberals elena kagan and sonia sotomayor   the white house and its allies made another push on tuesday to highlight republican intransigence    now  despite chief judge garland s extraordinary qualifications  republicans in the senate have refused to do their job  and chief judge garland s nomination has now been pending longer than any supreme court nominee in history who s nomination was not otherwise withdrawn   white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters    despite his outstanding record and qualifications  republicans have obstructed judge garland s nomination in a way faced by no other supreme court nominee in our nation s history   added senate democratic leader harry reid   the senate is on recess until september   for the rival presidential hopefuls  republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton  the supreme court vacancy is both a political problem and an opportunity   in addition to scalia s replacement  the next president conceivably could nominate as many as three more justices  three of the court s current eight members already are over age   that means obama s successor could influence the court s ideological direction for decades   some conservatives view trump with suspicion  but the wealthy new york real estate developer has already floated names of conservative potential nominees in a bid to mollify some on the right   garland has established a reputation as a centrist in  years as an appellate judge  some liberal democrats have said clinton  if elected  could put forth a nominee more liberal than garland  so republicans would be smart to approve him before obama leaves office on jan     such arguments have not swayed republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who refuses to let garland come to a vote   the development most likely to prod senate action is the result of the presidential election  some republican senators have said if clinton wins  the senate should confirm garland in a  lame duck  post election session out of fear clinton would name someone far more liberal  if clinton wins  she also could renominate garland upon taking office   garland s nomination is unusual because there has been no controversy over his suitability to sit on the supreme court  as there have been with some nominees in the past  he is widely respected in the legal community and has been praised by both democrats and republicans as a moderate   the white house tried to persuade republicans to accept garland when he was first nominated in march  he met with  of the  senators  but the effort fizzled  and republicans largely followed mcconnell s lead   the white house since then has tried to keep the garland nomination in the public eye  with limited success  obama wrote an opinion piece in the wall street journal on monday  pushing for senate action   a white house allied group called the constitutional responsibility project is running a  we need nine  campaign that refers to the number of justices on a fully staffed court  it has bought ads in cleveland  where the republican presidential nominating convention began on monday  calling for senators to  do your job  and bring garland s nomination to a senate vote   in the meantime  garland is nowhere to be seen  his last public appearance was on june  when he spoke at an elementary school commencement event in washington   when nominated  garland stepped aside from pending cases before the appeals court where he works  his only official duties now are administrative as the court s chief judge  a court official said garland will continue to not participate in cases while the nomination is pending
