new york  reuters    republican lawmakers and the federal reserve may be ready to strike a compromise deal on legislation that would give congress greater scrutiny over the central bank  now that there is no longer the threat of a presidential veto  but it would likely stop short of dictating rules on setting interest rates  donald trump s victory in the presidential election will give the republicans control over both the white house as well as both houses of congress next month  removing a likely veto on legislation to overhaul governance of the fed by a democratic president  even so  republicans will need support from senate democrats now that their senate majority has shrunk to a   split in the november polls   republicans who have been pushing for limits on the fed s ability to decide policy believe the central bank has overstepped its mandate by using extraordinary measures to stimulate the economy since the financial crisis  and they say reforms are a priority next year  interviews with lawmakers  aides and top fed officials indicate there could be common ground for a deal  marking a possible departure from the central bank s resolute opposition to reform   there are different paths to a workable solution   said representative bill huizenga  a republican who chairs the house of representatives subcommittee on monetary policy and trade  huizenga  who last year introduced legislation to tie policy decisions to a benchmark rule or risk  audits  by a congressional watchdog  told reuters that he was  open to what exactly  the audits would look like   but it needs to be early  if not the first thing that we do    the trump administration and the federal reserve declined to comment on the potential for legislation or their positions   huizenga s bill last year would force the fed to operate under a directive rule like the one named after conservative economist john taylor  which prescribes interest rates based on levels of inflation  employment and growth  that would be a sea change from the way the fed has long operated  in which it reviews economic conditions as it weighs decisions on interest rates  but is free to set policy as it deems appropriate  the bill would leave room for discretion but would open the door for congress to launch real time reviews of rate decisions if the central bank strayed too far from the rule  something fed chair janet yellen called a  grave mistake  that would damage the bank s credibility and distract its focus on longer term economic goals  under a strict taylor rule  the key federal funds rate   the rate at which banks lend money to other banks on an overnight basis   would be one to two percentage points higher now than it is  based on calculations by the federal reserve bank of cleveland   huizenga s proposal is now part of a broader bill championed by jeb hensarling  the influential republican chair of the house financial services committee  to winnow back financial regulations  hensarling has called fed reform a top priority and said he was willing to negotiate  because any such legislation would typically require a supermajority to pass the senate  republicans   who now hold only a simple majority   will need to compromise in order to win the support of some democrats  the fed could find other ways to satisfy demands for more insight  it could use its existing semi annual reports to congress to cite an array of well known monetary policy rules and explain how it arrived at its decisions with reference to those rules   that could provide the desired transparency and even side step the threat of probes by a congressional watchdog  another alternative would be to make these audits scheduled  and not ad hoc  which could help curb any partisan challenges to policy in real time and preserve the fed s flexibility during crises  still  those regular reviews would allow congress to see how federal reserve policymakers sifted through economic data and forecasts to reach rate decisions  now that the fed has begun raising rates  republicans complain it has offered a shifting set of reasons to move slowly  including political turmoil and market volatility overseas   a hint of how compromise could be achieved came this summer when the cleveland fed published a list of seven well known policy rules and showed that their recommended rates varied between   percent and   percent   the fed s policy rate is now     percent and is expected to rise a quarter point this week    we do look at a number of rules     but monetary policy isn t a simple thing   cleveland fed president loretta mester said in a recent interview   i hope that any change that congress pushes through is done in a thoughtful way and doesn t disrupt the benefits that we have in the current system    while there is no explicit reference to the fed s swollen balance sheet in proposed legislation  hensarling and other critics have called for a firm plan to sell off the    trillion in treasury and mortgage bonds the central bank amassed in the wake of the  financial crisis  the bond purchases were extraordinary measures taken to stimulate growth  many republican lawmakers say bond purchases inappropriately increases the fed s role in the economy and amounts to financing of the government  a measure that is banned under statutes  critics say the fed s plan to shed assets once interest rates have started normalizing is too vague  suggesting that could work its way into increased congressional oversight   the fed maintains that its policies have been transparent in the face of a deep recession and frustratingly slow recovery  yellen and her colleagues also say the fed can best achieve its twin mandate of price stability  which it targets at  percent inflation  and maximum sustainable employment when free of short term political interference  it is close to both goals now  taken together  republicans  pursuit of reforms makes future fed policy  a big global uncertainty   said peter hooper  a former fed official who is chief economist at deutsche bank securities  it could lead to more aggressive rate hikes than the roughly two per year currently expected  and quicker trimming of the balance sheet  he said   selling bonds  or even halting purchases of those maturing  would raise market yields and amount to tighter monetary conditions  getting a fed reform bill into trump s hands  will require a consensus   said representative frank lucas  another republican on the house monetary policy subcommittee   to get there we would need to explain to the senate that this would not constrain the fed in any future crisis    lucas acknowledged concerns that the taylor rule would  dramatically alter  the fed s flexibility  and told reuters his staff was considering possible adjustments to proposed bills   that would appear to be something huizenga could live with   they are already doing the analysis  so maybe it s asking them to share that analysis   huizenga told reuters  adding he hoped the election of trump caused fed leadership to  rethink its stiff arming  of reforms
