jerusalem  reuters    u s  president donald trump called on  israel to be reasonable with respect to peace   spelling out in his own words his administration s stance that new settlements on palestinian land may not be helpful in an interview with an israeli newspaper   trump s comments to israel today come as he tones down his pro israel bravado ahead of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s trip to the white house on feb     i want israel to be reasonable with respect to peace  i want to see peace happen   trump said in the interview published on friday   i would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties  and i think we have a good chance of doing that    during his  election campaign  trump signaled his presidency would be a boon for israel and tough on palestinians  he talked of moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem  naming an ambassador who backs israel s settlement program and exerting no pressure on israel for peace talks  now trump is adopting a more measured stance  even though the white house did not join the widespread criticism this week of a new israeli law which retroactively legalizes about   existing settler homes  its pro israel approach shows signs of being more nuanced    they  don t help the process  i can say that   trump told the israeli daily owned by u s  casino mogul sheldon adelson  a netanyahu supporter and republican party donor   every time you take land for settlements  there is less land left   trump said   i am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace   the president said his administration was  looking at some other options  regarding the settlements        he also said he was still studying the case for relocating the u s  embassy to jerusalem  a move that could anger the arab world    the embassy is not an easy decision  it has obviously been out there for many  many years  and nobody has wanted to make that decision  i m thinking about it very seriously  and we will see what happens   trump said
