washington  reuters    president donald trump s administration on sunday tempered a key element of his move to ban entry of refugees and people from seven muslim majority countries in the face of mounting criticism even from some prominent republicans and protests that drew tens of thousands in major american cities  trump signed the directive on friday  but the policy appeared to be evolving on the fly  democrats and a growing number of republicans assailed the move and foreign leaders condemned it amid court challenges and tumult at u s  airports  the president s critics have said his action unfairly singled out muslims  violated u s  law and the constitution and defiled america s historic reputation as hospitable to immigrants  in a fresh defense of the action on sunday  trump said his directive was  not about religion  but keeping america safe  trump has presented the policy as a way to protect the country from the threat of islamist militants  u s  homeland security secretary john kelly said in a statement that people from the seven countries who hold so called green cards as lawful permanent u s  residents would not be blocked from returning to the united states from overseas   as some had been after the directive  all green card holders who were detained at u s  airports had been admitted into the country by late sunday  a u s  official familiar with the process told reuters  the source could not provide a figure of how many people whose re entry had been delayed  in some cases for hours  outside the white house  where some viewing stands from trump s jan   inaugural parade still stood  several thousand protesters denounced him  carrying signs such as  deport trump  and  fear is a terrible thing for a nation s soul   protests also were staged in cities and airports in new york  los angeles  boston  houston  dallas and elsewhere  the republican president on friday put a four month hold on allowing refugees into the country  an indefinite ban on refugees from syria and a three month bar on citizens from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen   border and customs officials struggled to put trump s directive into practice  confusion persisted over details of implementation  in particular for the people who hold green cards  senator bob corker  the republican chairman of the u s  senate foreign relations committee and a trump supporter  said the president s order had been poorly implemented  particularly for green card holders   the administration should immediately make appropriate revisions  and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated   corker said  trump defended his action   to be clear  this is not a muslim ban  as the media is falsely reporting   trump said in a statement on sunday   this is not about religion   this is about terror and keeping our country safe  there are over  different countries worldwide that are majority muslim that are not affected by this order   he added   we will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next  days   the department said on saturday trump s action did apply to people with green cards who were returning to the united states from the seven nations  while a white house official said green card holders who had left the united states and wanted to return would have to visit a u s  embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening  white house chief of staff reince priebus then went on the sunday morning news programs to say those people would not be blocked   as far as green card holders moving forward  it doesn t affect them   priebus said on the nbc program  meet the press   priebus added that these green card holders would be subjected to  more questioning  by u s  customs and border patrol agents when they try to re enter the united states  until a better program is put in place over the next several months   in an apparent indication that kelly s instructions were being implemented  some green card holders arriving in the united states said they had no trouble clearing customs   mahdi tajsarvi  an engineer who lives in virginia  said he and his wife  arezoo hosseini  both iranian citizens with u s  green cards  were asked a few routine questions by authorities at dulles international airport outside washington on sunday evening and let through within a few minutes  priebus also said customs and border patrol agents would  have  discretionary authority  when they encountered someone arriving who they suspect  is up to no good  from certain nations  asked why saudi arabia  afghanistan  pakistan and egypt were not included on trump s list  priebus said that  perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward   u s  judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing trump s directive  but lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on sunday to follow the judges  rulings  u s  senators john mccain and lindsey graham  prominent republican foreign policy voices  said in a joint statement trump s order may do more to help recruit terrorists than improve u s  security   ultimately  we fear this executive order will become a self inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism   they said  adding the united states should not stop green card holders  from returning to the country they call home    this executive order sends a signal  intended or not  that america does not want muslims coming into our country   the added  trump blasted the two senators in a twitter statement  calling them  sadly weak on immigration   in a another twitter message earlier on sunday  trump said the united states needed  strong borders and extreme vetting  now    christians in the middle east have been executed in large numbers  we cannot allow this horror to continue   added trump  who successfully tapped into americans  fear of attacks during his election campaign  trump s tweet did not mention that many more muslims have been killed in the bloody syrian civil war and other violence in the targeted countries  condemnation of trump s action poured in from abroad  including from traditional allies of the united states  in germany  which has taken in large numbers of people fleeing the syrian civil war  chancellor angela merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and  does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion   her spokesman said on sunday  canada will offer temporary residency to people stranded in the country as a result of trump s executive order on immigration  canadian immigration minister ahmed hussen said  briefing reporters at the white house on condition of anonymity  a u s  administration official rejected criticism of the way trump s plan had been carried out  saying   so it really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level   chuck schumer  the top democrat in the republican led u s  senate  had a different view  calling trump s administration incompetent   one hand doesn t know what the other is doing   schumer said   i think banning refugees  banning immigrants  banning religions like islam or any other religion  is un american   said will turner    draped in a u s  flag among a crowd of several thousand people in front of the white house chanting   no hate  no fear  refugees are welcome here   an official of the conservative billionaire industrialist koch brothers  political network of donors criticized trump s immigration order at the donors  winter gathering in indian wells  california   our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds  this is a hallmark of free and open societies   brian hooks said in a statement  civil rights and some religious groups  activists and democratic politicians have promised to fight trump s order and schumer said his party would introduce legislation to overturn it  republicans control both the house of representatives and the senate  priebus said that of   people who arrived from foreign countries on saturday   people were detained for further questioning  and most of them were moved out  with just a  couple dozen more that remain  detained    it wasn t chaos   he said  judges in california  massachusetts  virginia and washington state  each home to international airports  issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on saturday night by u s  district judge ann donnelly in new york s brooklyn borough in a case involving two iraqis caught by the order as they flew into the country  attorneys general from california  new york   other states and washington  d c   condemned and pledged to fight what they called trump s  dangerous  and  unconstitutional  order
