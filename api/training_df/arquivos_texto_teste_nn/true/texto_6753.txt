washington  reuters    u s  securities and exchange commission chair mary jo white on monday defied requests by senate republicans to delay adopting new rules on everything from derivatives to mutual funds until after president elect donald trump takes office  in a letter to the senate banking committee s top two republicans  chairman richard shelby and mike crapo of idaho  white stressed it was  incumbent  on the sec to  exhibit a spirit of firm independence  in performing its regulatory duties  without fear or favor    white s dec   letter  which was reviewed by reuters  comes in response to a request last month by shelby and crapo for the sec to cease adopting rules until after trump had a chance to review the agency s agenda   republicans in congress have been pressing agencies across the federal government to wind down their rulemaking activities     trump has vowed to kill many regulations put on the books during the obama administration  including the dodd frank wall street reform law   white  an independent  is slated to step down from her post at the end of democratic president barack obama s term in january   the senate failed to confirm obama s two nominees for vacant commissioner slots at the sec before it recessed last week  which means that after white departs next month  the sec will only be left with two commissioners   one democrat and one republican   even before she leaves  she could still fail to get the rules passed if she cannot get a quorum of commissioners to agree  trump has yet to announce a nominee for sec chair  but many of the people working on his financial regulatory transition team  such as former sec commissioner paul atkins  have been highly critical of many of the sec s rules and dodd frank more broadly  in white s letter on monday  she provided shelby and crapo with a list of all the rules currently ready for a vote   among the rules on the list are derivatives reforms mandated by dodd frank  such as capital and margin requirements for swap dealers  as well as a more controversial one that would limit how mutual funds and exchange traded funds use derivatives to leverage returns  the letter did not say when the sec might vote on the rules  the agency could do it during an open meeting or behind closed doors  an sec spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing   i am not insensitive to the issues raised by your letter and have carefully considered what impact  if any  the election should have on the current work of the commission   white wrote  she added that she had confirmed that the sec  historically has proceeded with its work during comparable post election periods       in support of her position  white included footnotes in her letter citing prior statements by republican sec commissioner mike piwowar  who is poised to become acting chair in january  in which he voiced support for completing new derivatives rules  this is not the first time the sec has faced criticism on efforts to complete rules before a change in leadership at the regulator  in   a federal appeals court sided with the u s  chamber of commerce in a dispute with the sec over controversial rules requiring the majority of mutual fund board directors to be independent  the court sent the rule back to the sec with a directive to consider its costs   then sec chairman william donaldson promptly scheduled a meeting and the sec re adopted it a day before his resignation  saying the rule would not be overly costly  the rule was subsequently overturned a second time  and the court chided the sec for failing to follow proper rulemaking procedures  even if white is successful in adopting final rules in the coming weeks  congress may have a way to undo them when trump takes office on jan    by law  congress can vote to reverse regulations within  legislative days of them becoming final   which could be easier to accomplish under a republican controlled congress and white house
