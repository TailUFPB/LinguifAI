washington  reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump reiterated his promise in sunday s debate to kill the  carried interest  tax loophole that benefits hedge fund managers and others   but his tax plan offers other goodies for wall street  a nonpartisan tax research group said on tuesday  trump and democratic rival hillary clinton s tax plans differ like mirror images  especially when it comes to how they treat investment fund managers and other wealthy americans  according to separate reports by the tax policy center  trump s tax plan would reduce federal tax revenues by    trillion over a decade  with about three quarters of the decrease coming from lower business taxes  the center said  those with incomes in the top   percent would see an average tax cut of nearly    million   clinton would raise revenue by    trillion almost entirely through higher taxes on the wealthy  including a  percent surcharge on those with incomes of more than   million  the clinton campaign said the analysis showed she would require  the wealthy  wall street and large corporations to pay their fair share        the trump campaign denounced it as  a fraudulent analysis  plagued by software problems  the wall street carried interest loophole allows financial managers at private equity  hedge fund and other qualifying firms to pay a capital gains tax rate on their income instead of the higher income tax rate  clinton would close the loophole with no compensating benefits for those hit  the center said  under trump s proposal  the center said hedge funds and private equity partnerships would qualify for a special  percent business tax rate  depending on their size  the center said  that would be well below trump s proposed top income tax rate of  percent and less than the   percent rate that funds now pay under carried interest rules   literally  he is getting rid of carried interest   said eric toder  co director of the center  which is a collaboration of the urban institute and the brookings institution   the question is what else is there in the plan that affects hedge funds  and the reduction in the business income tax rate to  percent gives them a much better deal   toder said  large investment fund managers would lose any advantage because the trump plan would subject them to an additional  percent dividend tax  the center said  analysts said trump had not said what constitutes a large business   our plan has explicit safeguards to keep hedge funds from abusing the business rate   it s hillary who plans secret benefits for wall street  not us   trump national policy director stephen miller said in a statement
