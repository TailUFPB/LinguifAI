 reuters    fbi director james comey undercut some of the main arguments hillary clinton has made in defense of her use of an unauthorized private email system while she was u s  secretary of state   the federal bureau of investigation began investigating clinton s email system after government watchdogs found that some of her messages contained classified government secrets last year  comey is recommending that clinton not face criminal charges  but in an unusual step  he used a news conference to give a public rebuttal on tuesday of the defenses offered by clinton over the last year  here are seven times that comey contradicts clinton  clinton said  clinton said in march  that she returned  anything that could be possibly viewed as work related   she later swore under oath that she returned all her work emails to the state department in   some   in all  comey said  the fbi recovered  several thousand  work emails that were not returned to the state department  comey has  reasonable confidence  that there was no deliberate effort to withhold these messages    clinton said  clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any classified information through her private email system  and that emails being released to the public that were now marked classified were being retroactively  upgraded   comey said  the fbi found  emails in  email chains that contained information that was classified at the time the messages were sent  eight of those chains contained top secret information  the highest level of government classification  another  chains contained secret information  and eight contained confidential information  clinton said  clinton has repeatedly said she did not send or receive any emails that were  marked  classified  comey said  a  very small number  of emails were marked as containing classified information   but even if information is not marked  classified  in an email  participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it   comey said  clinton said       the  security and integrity  of the email system were taken seriously  and  robust protections  were put in place  according to her staff in march   comey said  the system was  not even supported by full time security staff  like those found at departments and agencies of the u s  government  or even with a commercial service like gmail   clinton said  clinton said there is no evidence there was ever a breach of her email system  comey said   it would be unlikely to find  direct evidence  of clinton s email system being hacked  but the fbi believes  it is possible that hostile actors gained access    hostile actors  also gained access to some people clinton corresponded with on her email system  clinton said   i m certainly well aware of the classification requirements   clinton said in march   comey said  clinton and her colleagues were  extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information   clinton said  clinton has maintained that her email system was allowed and that she did nothing wrong  she has also said it was a  mistake  and apologized for it  comey said   there is no evidence that clinton and her colleagues intended to break the law  but people who engage in similar activity are  often subject to security or administrative sanctions
