washington  reuters    democrats pushing for gun curbs after the latest mass shooting in the united states are co opting a republican mantra to build public support and defang opposition  it s time to get tough on national security  shoring up national security has long been a pillar of republican orthodoxy  as has staunch opposition to gun control  but the massacre of  people in orlando  florida  last sunday  the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history  by a gunman who pledged loyalty to islamist militants may be leaving republicans on shakier ground  with national security driving the debate  democrats see a more powerful argument than simply advocating the need to curb gun violence in a country of  million that has more than  million weapons  although the orlando gunman  omar mateen  is believed to have had no help from extremist islamist groups in targeting a gay nightclub  he had been investigated by u s  authorities for possible links to terrorism and subsequently cleared  that prompted democrats to clamor for legislation to expand background checks and prevent people on u s  terrorism watch lists from buying guns  votes on four measures were scheduled monday in the u s  senate  two sponsored by democrats and two by republicans  many republicans  and some democrats  oppose strict gun curbs partly on constitutional grounds   every senator is now going to have to say  whether they re for terrorists getting guns or against terrorists getting guns   democrat senator chuck schumer told reporters on thursday   the terrorists that we need to fear are not on the streets of aleppo  or mosul or fallujah  they re on the streets of the united states and they will have guns unless we pass tough laws   added senator ed markey  a massachusetts democrat  president barack obama  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and homeland security secretary jeh johnson all took the tack this week that gun measures were a safeguard against terrorism  republicans have long criticized obama for not being tough enough on national security and doing more in the fight against islamic state  the orlando massacre and the san bernardino  california shooting in december by a couple inspired by islamic state  captured the attention of the american public in a way previous mass shootings have not  said tom diaz  a former member of the national rifle association gun rights lobby who now backs gun control   they ve changed the dynamic of this whole issue   said diaz  an author and expert on terrorism and the gun industry  that shift in sentiment has heartened the families of the  elementary school children and six staff members killed in newtown  connecticut in   who championed the last big  and ultimately unsuccessful push  on gun control  about  percent of americans  including eight out of  democrats and nearly six out of  republicans  favor at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns  according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted from monday to thursday  that was up from  percent in late  and late   diaz believes republicans must look as if they care about keeping guns out of the hands of so called homegrown extremists  while balancing issues of due process and the constitution s second amendment right to bear arms that form the backbone of the nra s opposition to gun control  republicans say new laws won t necessarily keep weapons out of the hands of people intent on doing harm  and are keen to avoid twinning the two issues    this is not a gun control issue   u s  senator ted cruz  said on thursday   this is a terrorism issue   republican strategist ron bonjean said democrats  must be careful about overplaying their hand with rhetoric that could sound like government overreach to americans who believe in the second amendment   even if the current efforts fail  the new push on national security may prove democrats  best shot at eventually luring republican support on an issue that has floundered for decades   this is a chance for the democrats to talk in tough terms about safety and security and also to link that to the gun issue   said robert spitzer  political science professor at state university of new york at cortland some notable republicans appeared willing this week to engage in the debate on gun control  the party s presumptive presidential nominee  donald trump  vowed to meet with the nra to talk about ways to bar people on certain government watch lists from buying guns  the top republican in the senate  majority leader mitch mcconnell  said he was open to suggestions from experts on how to prevent terrorism suspects from acquiring firearms and called the orlando shooting a  calculated act of terror   but it was unclear whether trump or mcconnell would throw their weight behind any measures acceptable to democrats  democratic u s  representative jim himes said he did not hold out great hope that the gun legislation would advance   the reason you won t see a compromise anytime soon is because congress actually acting in the wake of orlando would be a tacit admission on the other side that guns had something to do with what happened in orlando as opposed to isis   he said  using an acronym for islamic state
