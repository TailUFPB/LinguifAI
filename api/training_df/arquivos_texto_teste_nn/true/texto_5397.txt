washington  reuters    president donald trump  after nearly a month in power  has yet to unveil major legislation or publicly endorse bills from others  getting republicans off to a slow start on the sweeping reforms they promised on the campaign trail   as trump and republicans ricochet from crisis to crisis  lawmakers have lowered expectations for legislative action in  on tax reform  health care  financial regulation  jobs and infrastructure  with some urging more white house guidance  trump has spelled out few specifics on such issues in his more than two dozen executive orders  proclamations and memoranda  a temporary ban on u s  entry by refugees and people from seven muslim majority countries was blocked in court  ambitious campaign promises by trump helped the republicans make a clean sweep of the white house  the senate and the house of representatives in november s national elections   movement on legislation could come soon now that the senate has confirmed nine of trump s cabinet nominees and is poised to approve others soon  despite delays by democrats   but concern is mounting among some republicans and moderate democrats who had hoped for more at this stage  on taxes  for instance  republican senator lindsey graham told reuters   what i d like to see the administration do is lead on this issue   the white house needs to  either come out with their own tax cut plan or weigh in pretty quickly   he said   i m getting unnerved that there s lack of coordination   last week  trump promised a  phenomenal  tax plan within weeks but offered no details  nor has he firmly endorsed or opposed tax reform proposals being debated in congress   at a party retreat last month  lawmakers warmed to remarks by trump that seemed to show support for a house republican  border adjustment  tax to encourage exports and discourage imports  house of representatives speaker paul ryan issued a statement saying congress and trump were  on the same page   but the enthusiasm was short lived  the white house later said border adjustment was only one option  after a week  ryan said tax reform legislation would not appear until mid   democratic representative jim himes  who has talked about working with republicans  said in an interview that promises of  day one  action have rung hollow   instead  we are torn apart by poorly drafted executive orders  tweets  russian ties to the white house   he said   at a press conference on thursday  trump said he would submit an  initial plan  on health care in march and tackle tax reform after that  he said   tax reform s going to happen fairly quickly  we re doing obamacare  we re in the final stages   trump s legislative record lags some  but not all  recent presidents  democrat barack obama laid out an economic stimulus plan days after his january  swearing in and signed it into law less than a month later  republican george w  bush sent a tax cut proposal to congress less than three weeks after taking office in january   it was enacted four months later  democrat bill clinton fulfilled a central campaign promise in his first weeks in office when he enacted a family leave bill on feb      republican george h w  bush accomplished little of note in his first  days  while his predecessor republican ronald reagan sent dozens of detailed budget cut plans to congress less than a month after his  swearing in   in an oct   campaign speech  trump vowed to work with congress to introduce  broader legislative measures  in the first  days of his administration to reform the tax code  repeal and replace the affordable care act  boost job creation  curb job offshoring  spend   trillion on infrastructure and build a wall along the u s  mexico border   in his first  days  trump has not yet offered any legislation to advance these goals  investors have not been deterred  the dow jones industrial average has surged roughly  percent since he was elected   right now there is a lot of hope in the market  but so far i haven t seen trump show that he knows how to manage policy or have much of a plan   said thyra zerhusen  co chief investment officer of fairpointe capital in chicago   proceeding well    hensarling trump signed a bill into law on tuesday repealing an obama administration anti corruption rule that required oil and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign officials  republican representative jeb hensarling  who attended the signing ceremony  said   things are proceeding well   legislation to repeal the affordable care act  known as obamacare  and replace parts of it will be unveiled after a  day house recess that begins on friday  ryan said on thursday  republicans have been struggling to come up with a detailed plan for replacing obama s signature domestic policy that they have vowed to repeal  at the outset of trump s term  republican lawmakers  lobbyists and tax experts were planning to repeal obamacare in february  then begin revamping the tax code in march  now  house republicans say they may pass a tax reform bill by august  that would force the senate to take up the issue at the start of the  midterm election season  a bad time for lawmakers to be making hard decisions  from the start of the new administration  some republicans had jitters about trump s moves  such as his battle with the media over the size of the crowd at his swearing in ceremony   he should be talking about how we re going to be reforming healthcare   republican representative charlie dent told reporters on jan     i hope he gets more focused on policy
