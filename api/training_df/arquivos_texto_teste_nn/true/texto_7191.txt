washington  reuters    the u s  congress could as soon as january start to dismantle president barack obama s transformation of student loan rules by blocking freshly minted regulations designed to help students who say they were defrauded by for profit colleges  the new measures  which lay out loan relief procedures for the students  were issued by the department of education just days before the election  that is recent enough to allow the new republican led congress to disapprove them under a  law called the congressional review act  it gives congress  legislative days to reverse regulations with a simple vote  republicans opposed the rule when it was proposed  lamar alexander  who chairs the senate committee on education  is considering introducing a resolution that would overturn the so called  borrower defense  rule  according to a spokeswoman   even without a legislative reversal  president elect donald trump  who ran on an anti regulation platform and started his own for profit school  could instruct agencies to be more restrictive in how they interpret this rule and others aimed at easing student loan burdens  students who attended the now defunct trump university did not qualify for federal loans and are not eligible for loan relief  trump is facing civil lawsuits alleging fraud related to the school  after he was elected president  the stocks of for profit education companies rose  the borrower defense rule was inspired by the meltdown of corinthian colleges inc  in   according to rohit chopra  who worked on the corinthian case at the consumer financial protection bureau and later moved to the department of education as a special adviser  in recent months  itt tech  inc  has also folded  leaving students adrift  by law  students at struggling technical and professional colleges are already allowed relief on federal loans  but the new rule creates a path for getting that relief  students can make a fraud claim to the education department and then apply for a refund of federal money they borrowed and then paid to the school  it is the payment on a fraud complaint   sometimes made in the absence of any actual conviction   that rankles republicans  they also dislike that the rule leaves students free to file class action suits against the schools  instead of arbitrating all disputes  said neal mccluskey  who follows higher education at the cato institute  a libertarian think tank   it is not clear how many students   or how much in loans   would be affected by the new rule  the education department says it has already approved   million in relief to more than   applications from students who borrowed to attend corinthian  the projected  year federal government expenses associated with the rules total   billion   congressional disapproval resolutions have failed in the past  because obama vetoed them  but in   anti regulation republicans will control the house  the senate and the white house  and it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule   education secretary john king defends the rule  saying his department went through a very thorough rule making process and addressed thousands of comments in the final version of the regulations   the fact remains that students need some sort of process for student loan discharge in the case of a school closure or fraud   said justin draeger  president of the national association of student financial aid administrators   i m not sure it s as easy as simply voiding the entire regulation   there are other higher education reforms a trump administration might undo  said elizabeth baylor  director for post secondary education at left leaning center for american progress  many borrower programs instituted under obama are at the education secretary s discretion  and trump could appoint someone stricter on granting relief  a new secretary could also simply discontinue programs  she said   in the same vein  steve gunderson  president of career education colleges and universities  says congress could block the new rule without a resolution  either through an upcoming budget bill or education legislation
