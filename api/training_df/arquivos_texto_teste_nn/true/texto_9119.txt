washington  reuters    democratic president barack obama denounced donald trump for his proposed u s  ban on muslim immigrants on tuesday  joining hillary clinton in portraying the republican presidential candidate as unfit for the white house  clearly annoyed  obama responded to trump s proposed suspension of immigration from countries with a  history of terrorism  after sunday s killing of  people in an orlando  florida  nightclub   obama and clinton  the democrat he has endorsed to succeed him in a nov   election  made nearly simultaneous speeches  the gunman was u s  born omar mateen    whose parents immigrated from afghanistan  trump had criticized obama for not using the term  radical islamic terrorism  to describe islamic state militants   what exactly would using this label accomplish  what exactly would it change   obama replied   someone seriously thinks we don t know who we re fighting      there s no magic to the phrase  radical islam   it s a political talking point  it is not a strategy    calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away  this is a political distraction   said obama  criticizing the  yapping  and  loose talk  he said he hears from republicans  obama  who canceled a joint campaign appearance with clinton planned on wednesday in wisconsin due to the events in orlando  appeared to be enjoying his role in the campaign to select his successor  he tangled with trump in   producing his birth certificate to refute trump s claim that the president was not born in the united states   we now have proposals from the presumptive republican nominee for president of the united states to bar all muslims from immigrating to america  we hear language that singles out immigrants and suggests entire religious communities are complicit in violence   obama said   where does this stop    on tuesday  trump was unrelenting in his criticism of obama  saying in a statement that obama  claims to know our enemy  and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies  and for that matter  the american people    when i am president  it will always be america first   said trump  aides said trump  who on monday said obama should resign for failing to handle the threat properly  would have more to say at a rally later in greensboro  north carolina  the crossfire overshadowed the last democratic presidential primary on tuesday in washington  d c  clinton was to meet rival bernie sanders late in the day with sanders apparently inching toward ending his candidacy  clinton  obama s former secretary of state  addressed supporters in pittsburgh  the candidate said trump s proposal bolstered her case that he was temperamentally unfit to serve as president  saying the commander in chief  is a job that demands a calm  collected and dignified response  to events like the orlando massacre  clinton said trump seemed to suggest on monday in a television interview that obama might have somehow been responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history  a point that trump said he did not make   i have to ask  will responsible republican leaders stand up to their presumptive nominee or will they stand by his accusation about our president   she said  the biting criticism was likely to increase the discomfort among many establishment republican leaders about trump with little more than a month until party figures gather in cleveland july   to formally nominate him  house speaker paul ryan  the top u s  elected republican who was his party s  vice presidential nominee  on tuesday distanced himself from the proposed muslim ban in a further sign of establishment unease with trump s agenda   i do not think a muslim ban is in our country s interests   said ryan  who last year criticized trump s original proposal for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  ryan and like minded leading republicans have struggled to reconcile their desire to unify the party before a tough fight against clinton while at the same time separating themselves from some of the positions and rhetoric of trump  who defeated  rivals to win the presidential nomination battle  u s  senator bob corker of tennessee  who sources say is among the republicans that trump is considering for his vice presidential nominee  said he was  discouraged  by the way the trump campaign was going   it wasn t the type of speech one would expect   corker said of trump s monday speech in new hampshire  trump has been resolute in demanding tighter immigration policies  and the orlando attack has prompted him to intensify his rhetoric as he tries to win more support from americans with deep security fears  trump noted that mateen s parents were born in afghanistan  pointing to specific incidents such as the sept      attacks  he said threats were posed by people with roots in pakistan  saudi arabia and somalia  trump on tuesday met at trump tower in new york with a host of republican governors  including oklahoma s mary fallin  who a source close to the campaign said was also on trump s short list to be his vice presidential running mate  a republican official said others in the meeting included the governors of mississippi  arizona  arkansas  nebraska and tennessee  as well as new jersey s chris christie  a close trump adviser and former presidential rival  trump was celebrating his  birthday on tuesday  clinton is
