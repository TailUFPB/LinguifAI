washington  reuters    u s  representative peter defazio on wednesday unveiled legislation to tax financial trades that will likely wither in congress but could stoke partisan fires in the presidential election  the oregon democrat s bill would levy a   percent tax on most financial trades  and is intended to discourage  risky trading behaviors   defazio expects that will collect more than   billion in revenue in the next decade  which he said could be used to fund free higher education or infrastructure repairs  when the democratic party gathers in philadelphia for its national convention at the end of the month  it will adopt a platform that calls for taxing trades  many liberals in the party embrace the proposal as a way to curb speculative trading  which they say led to both the   financial crisis and the  stock market  flash crash   the party s left wing  led by u s  senator bernie sanders  who ran against hillary clinton for the presidential nomination  meanwhile  has pushed for free university education   thanks to the reckless greed of wall street over the past few decades  the american economy is a grossly unbalanced playing field   said defazio   the only way we can level it is if we rein in reckless speculative financial trading and curb near instantaneous high volume trades that create instability in the stock market and our national economy   the legislation is supported by democratic party stalwarts  including the afl cio labor union federation  the americans for financial reform coalition  the communications workers of america union  and advocacy group public citizen  the center for economic and policy research said it also backs the bill  it will likely not get far  republicans control both chambers of congress  and most say that wall street regulation passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis has been overly restrictive  in addition  the republican party generally favors having fewer taxes   i am opposed to any taxes that would raise the cost of financial transactions   said randy neugebauer  the republican chairman of a house subcommittee on financial institutions  noting that the bill would tax stock  bond and derivatives trades   currently  the top u s  securities regulator  the securities and exchange commission  charges a tax on security futures of less than half of a penny to recover the costs of regulating markets and financial professionals  the idea for the tax can be traced back to economist john maynard keynes  who wrote in  after another devastating financial crisis   the great depression   that a transfer tax on all transactions might mitigate speculation   this version of the story corrects reference to center for economic and policy research in  paragraph  which had been incorrectly described as a democratic stalwart
