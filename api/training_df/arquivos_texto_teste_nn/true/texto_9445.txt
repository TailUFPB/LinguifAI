oklahoma city  reuters    republican state lawmakers in oklahoma have introduced a resolution urging the state s congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach president barack obama over a white house recommendation that schools accommodate transgender students  the obama administration told u s  public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice  the recommendation upset republicans and raised the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority  the oklahoma resolution  introduced on thursday night  calls on the state s members of the u s  house of representatives to file articles of impeachment against obama  the u s  attorney general  the u s  secretary of education and others over the policy  a vote has not yet been scheduled on the resolution  legal experts told local media the impeachment call is on shaky ground since the recommendation offered non binding guidance and did not have the force of law  lawmakers in the socially conservative state took up another measure on friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students  that bill  introduced on thursday night and referred to a senate committee on friday  could force schools into costly construction  which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a    billion state budget shortfall   state representative john bennett  a republican  said in a statement the white house policy was  biblically wrong   and a violation of state sovereignty  the oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms  athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs    it also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes   impeachment advocates say obama overstepped his constitutional authority  troy stevenson  executive director of freedom oklahoma  an lgbt advocacy group said the measure promoted fear mongering and was out of place  in a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis  our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth   he said in a statement   the measure was introduced just hours after state lawmakers approved a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them   governor mary fallin  an anti abortion republican  vetoed the bill because it would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge  her office said
