new york  reuters    defying opinion polls and expert predictions  democratic hopeful bernie sanders aims to seize the party s white house nomination from hillary clinton s grasp with a last ditch come from behind triumph in california  by far the most populous u s  state  california is the largest prize of the state by state nominating contests  and the vote on june  is one of the last before democrats convene in july to select a nominee for the nov   presidential election  an aggressive schedule of large rallies is planned along with heavy purchases of tv  radio and online advertising in three languages and a  far  far more expensive  campaign effort than in any other state  sanders campaign sources disclosed   i think they re still riding rainbow unicorns if they think there s a path   said steve schale  a florida based strategist  of sanders  bid for the white house  california has been a reliable source of campaign funds for clinton  and opinion polls show her ahead there by as many as  percentage points  the statistical analysis media site fivethirtyeight gives her a  percent chance of winning the state primary          the sanders campaign push aims to net as much as a  point win in california  helping him deny the front running clinton the   convention delegates she needs to clinch the nomination and give him the momentum to force a contested convention where he can try to win over the  superdelegates   those not decided by a state nominating contest and free to support anyone  the campaign sources said  sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  has eroded clinton s lead in california  according to a field poll released on friday  clinton led sanders by only  points in that survey  down from a double digit lead earlier this year   with california what we re going to do is something that  sanders  really likes to do  barnstorm the place   said tad devine  sanders  senior adviser  acknowledging sanders  underdog status against clinton  the former secretary of state  that means two or three large scale rallies a day for weeks  possibly starting in late april to target early voters  he said  such rallies are a sweet spot for the  year old new york born democratic socialist s firebrand speaking style championing the working class and vowing to erase economic inequality  at a late march event in the bronx  he drew   people  clinton leads in pledged convention delegates   those allocated to candidates on the basis of the state primaries and caucuses   with   to   for sanders   a candidate needs   delegates to clinch the nomination  california has  delegates  to be divided proportionally according to the june  primary vote  the clinton campaign plans to put up a fight  local and national surrogates will speak out in english and spanish and staff will beef up offices up and down the west coast as the california vote nears  her campaign said   we re fighting for every vote by talking to californians about why hillary clinton is the only candidate in this race who will break down the barriers that hold people back and deliver real results   amanda renteria  hillary for america national political director  said in a statement to reuters    headed into the june  primary  our volunteers and supporters are knocking on doors and hitting the phones to share with friends  family and neighbors hillary clinton s plans to create more good paying jobs in california  keep our streets safe from gun violence  protect our environment  reform our immigration system and ensure all californians have access to a good education and quality affordable health care   sanders has won seven of the last eight state nominating battles but faces a potentially rougher road in big states like new york  where clinton was a u s  senator and which holds an april  primary  sanders aims to overcome the edge that clinton  wife of former president bill clinton  has enjoyed with minorities  larry cohen  a senior adviser to the campaign  said the campaign aims to match or outdo the   volunteers it enlisted in new york by drawing on the labor for bernie volunteer group  local and national unions and other groups   we ll certainly do spanish language advertising   sanders  campaign manager jeff weaver said  devine said that vietnamese was also part of the plan  the languages are nods to california s large populations of latino and asian voters  weaver compared california to michigan  where sanders notched a surprise win in early march after advertising in arabic to woo the state s heavy concentration of muslims  the campaign has yet to set a budget for california  but given the state s size  the effort will be  hugely expensive   far  far more expensive than any other state that we ve done   weaver said   in california so far  the campaign has raised about    million from more than   donors  the most sanders has received from any one state  according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance disclosures  clinton has raked in significant sums also in california   an analysis of campaign reports filed with the federal election commission indicate her campaign raised      from donors in california from the time she entered the race in  until the end of february
