washington  reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump ratcheted up tensions in his party on tuesday by denying two leading figures  house of representatives speaker paul ryan and senator john mccain  support in their re election bids  trump told the washington post in an interview that he could endorse neither ryan  the top u s  elected republican  nor mccain  a u s  senator from arizona and a former republican presidential nominee  as they face challenges in their states  primary contests ahead of the nov   general election  both ryan and mccain had criticized trump s feud with the family of army captain humayun khan  who died in the line of duty in iraq in  and was awarded the bronze star medal for bravery after his death  the discord comes just two weeks after the republican national convention in cleveland that formally nominated trump for president  it is the latest rift in a party already frayed by internal dissent over its standard bearer  seen in stark relief at the convention where mccain was among high level party members who essentially snubbed trump by choosing not to attend  mitt romney  the  republican nominee  and former presidents george h w  bush and george w  bush also did not attend the convention  trump has had a running dispute with khizr and ghazala khan since they took the stage at last week s democratic convention to cite their son s sacrifice and criticize trump s proposed ban on muslims entering the united states  the uproar has led many republicans to distance themselves from trump and voice support for the khan family     trump  mirroring the language ryan used about supporting the nominee before his eventual endorsement  told the newspaper he was  not quite there yet  on endorsing ryan in next tuesday s wisconsin primary  and that he had  never been there  with mccain  who will be on the ballot in primary elections in arizona later this month  mccain had a  very friendly  meeting with trump s vice presidential running mate  mike pence  on tuesday in arizona  where pence was visiting  a mccain spokeswoman said   trump said ryan had sought his endorsement  but that as of now he is only  giving it very serious consideration   ryan s campaign office quickly responded that  neither speaker ryan nor anyone on his team has ever asked for donald trump s endorsement     and we are confident in a victory next week regardless   campaign spokesman zack roday said in a statement    ryan is favored to win against primary challenger paul nehlen  who trump praised as running  a very good campaign   in a mid july survey by harper polling  ryan was ahead of nehlen by nearly  points  trump  a former reality tv star  has troubled many in the republican establishment with his off the cuff  often insulting style  and controversial policies  including the proposed ban on muslims and his plan to build a wall along the mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants  president barack obama on tuesday blasted trump as unfit to be president and questioned why any republican would support the new york businessman  who is seeking his first public office   the question i think that they have to ask themselves is  if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable  why are you still endorsing him   obama  a democrat  said at a white house news conference with singapore s prime minister  lee hsien loong  the chorus of complaints against trump grew on tuesday  representative richard hanna of new york became the first republican in congress to endorse democratic nominee hillary  although several other republicans in congress have said they will not support trump  hanna  who is retiring from the house of representatives rather than seek re election  said his decision was prompted by trump s attacks on the khan family  he called trump  deeply flawed in endless ways    unrepentant  and  self involved   new jersey governor chris christie  a trump ally once viewed by trump as a potential running mate  called criticisms of the khan family  inappropriate   trump s son eric told cbs news on tuesday that his father s comments about the khans have been  blown hugely out of proportion       trump has fallen behind clinton in opinion polls made public since the parties held their nominating conventions last month  clinton extended her lead over trump to  percentage points  according to a reuters ipsos poll released on tuesday  from  points on friday  about  percent of likely voters favor clinton   percent favor trump  and  percent picked  other   trump also has trailed clinton in fundraising  clinton reported raising nearly   million in july for her campaign and the democratic party  with more than half the donations coming from new donors  interviewed on the fox business television network  trump brushed off billionaire investor warren buffett s blistering critique of his business acumen  buffett  chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire hathaway inc  scorned trump s  move to list trump hotels and casino resorts on the new york stock exchange  saying the business lost money for the next decade and that a monkey would have outperformed trump s company  trump  who has said his business success qualifies him to lead the country  defended his record running his hotel and casino business in atlantic city  new jersey   i had great timing  i got out   after seven years  he told the network  on tuesday   i took a lot of money out of atlantic city  which is what i m supposed to do  i m a businessperson
