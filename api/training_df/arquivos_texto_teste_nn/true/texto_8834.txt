washington  reuters    fbi director james comey told u s  lawmakers on thursday that fbi employees who mishandled classified material in the way hillary clinton did as secretary of state could be subject to dismissal or loss of security clearance    comey addressed the issue at a house of representatives committee hearing that lasted nearly five hours after house speaker paul ryan said in a letter to director of national intelligence james clapper that clinton should be denied classified briefings during her campaign for the presidency  comey  who said on tuesday he would not recommend that the presumptive democratic presidential nominee face criminal charges  was asked at the hearing if clinton should face administrative punishment for the way she handled her email   i don t think that s for me to recommend   he said  comey did say his employees in the federal bureau of investigation would face discipline for the same behavior   they might get fired  they might lose their clearance  it might get suspended for  days   comey said   there would be some discipline   presidential candidates normally get access to classified information once they are formally nominated  as director of the fbi  comey does not have the authority to revoke clinton s security privileges  a group of republican senators on thursday asked the state department to immediately suspend clearances for clinton and several current and former aides based on the agency s findings   the state department said on thursday it would conduct an internal review of clinton s handling of the emails now that the fbi investigation was over  the department said in april it had suspended plans for a review at the fbi s request   i cannot provide specific information about the department s review  including what information we are evaluating  we will aim to be as expeditious as possible  but we will not put artificial deadlines on the process   state department spokesman john kirby said in a statement  a clinton spokesman on thursday criticized the congressional hearing for its  partisan motivations   and expressed confidence that comey s testimony had shut down any lingering  conspiracy theories  on the matter    director comey s testimony clearly knocked down a number of false republican talking points and reconciled apparent contradictions between his previous remarks and hillary clinton s public statements   spokesman brian fallon said in a statement   the issue of clinton s use of private email servers has cast a cloud over her campaign for the nov   presidential election  raising questions among voters about her trustworthiness and judgment and giving her republican presidential rival  donald trump  an avenue of attack  comey s testimony marked the first time he took questions publicly since his announcement the fbi was not recommending charges against clinton  u s  attorney general loretta lynch accepted the fbi recommendation and was to appear at another hearing next tuesday   comey had disappointed some republicans by only rebuking clinton  not recommending charges against her  for what he called her  extremely careless  handling of classified information while using private email servers   under persistent questioning at the hearing of the house oversight committee  comey said clinton did not break the law   the question i always look at is  is there evidence that would establish beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody engaged in conduct that violated a criminal statute  and my judgment here is there is not   comey said     comey also said clinton knew her email server at her home in chappaqua  new york  was not authorized to receive classified information  but clinton may not have had sufficiently sophisticated understanding to know the emails that passed through her personal server were classified  comey said  only three of the fbi reviewed emails were explicitly marked as classified and those were marked with a  c  in the body of the email  not in the header  he said  comey said his fbi team conducted its investigation of clinton  in an apolitical and professional way  and he had no reason to believe she had lied to the fbi  clinton had said publicly she never sent or received any classified information   i think there is a legitimate concern that there is a double standard  if your name isn t clinton or you are not part of the powerful elite that lady justice will act differently   u s  representative jason chaffetz  chairman of the house oversight committee  said to comey at the beginning of the hearing  a democratic member of the committee  representative elijah cummings of maryland  defended comey s actions by saying   i firmly believe your decision was based on conviction  not convenience   comey  a republican who was appointed by democratic president barack obama and also served in the administration of former republican president george w  bush  has built a reputation as a straight shooter who does not bend to pressure from either party  he has differed sharply with the obama administration  including over the case of general david petraeus  who pleaded guilty after he knowingly shared classified information with his biographer and lover  comey recommended petraeus be charged with a felony  but then attorney general eric holder downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor  the hearing took place as trump met with republican lawmakers on capitol hill to get them behind his candidacy  discussing a variety of issues  including his campaign style   i m going to make you proud   trump told house republicans  according to a participant  representative bill flores
