washington  reuters    after struggling to find a consistent message and consolidate party support  donald trump is honing his attack on democratic presidential rival hillary clinton and the foundation bearing her family s name in hopes of making it a rallying cry for fellow republicans  trump began hammering the democrat this week over the clinton foundation  an organization created by her and her husband former president bill clinton that funds aid programs in developing countries   on monday  trump called for the foundation to be shut down and for a special prosecutor to be named to investigate it  in particular  he accused clinton of having turned the charity into a  pay for play  scheme in which wealthy donors to the organization got favors from the state department while clinton was secretary of state from    the clinton campaign denied that  saying clinton never took any action because of donations to the foundation  after a primary campaign that left the party bitterly divided  trump has struggled to find an attack line that fellow republicans can rally behind  his criticism of the parents of a dead muslim american soldier who spoke at the democratic national convention drew strong rebukes from many in his own party  his attacks on clinton s health have been dismissed as conspiracy theories   clinton  who leads in nearly every national and swing state opinion poll ahead of the nov   election  has largely avoided criticism about the foundation  although there was a spate of media investigations last year after she announced she was running for president  her main democratic rival  u s  senator bernie sanders  did not attack her on that front during the primary campaign  the focus on the foundation is likely to build some confidence among republicans that trump s campaign is healing internal divisions  last week  trump shook up his campaign s top leadership  putting steve bannon and kellyanne conway in top jobs  campaign chairman paul manafort resigned  chris collins  a republican member of congress  said supporters have been urging trump to focus on clinton    anything we can do to put her character forefront in the campaign is going to help donald trump   collins said in a phone interview  republican chairman reince preibus said if trump continues  to remain  measured   he could be  tied or ahead  in the polls by the first week in september  recent reuters ipsos opinion polls have found clinton increasing her lead over trump during august  the latest poll  on monday  showed clinton at  percent  and trump at  percent  clinton s campaign has pushed back at the attack  clinton spokesman robby mook said the foundation will not shut down given its humanitarian work  and he did not see it hurting clinton s lead in polls   this is an absurd call by donald trump  it is an act of desperation on his campaign given the turmoil that we ve seen from his campaign in recent weeks   he told msnbc  trump abandoned plans to deliver a policy speech on thursday about immigration  the postponement came as signs of internal disagreement on his immigration policy became public  but the move also allowed him to focus on what he and his advisers see as a clinton weakness   the foundation has long been a potential liability for clinton  the fact it accepted corporate and foreign donations sparked criticism that it represented a conflict of interest while clinton was secretary of state  on sunday  the foundation announced it would no longer accept foreign donations if clinton is elected and that the group is prepared to hand off programs to other charity organizations  democrats are hopeful trump is making an issue of the foundation too late for it to make a difference   most american voters already have an opinion of hillary clinton  said jim manley  a democratic strategist who once worked for senate minority leader harry reid    the views are pretty hardened on both sides  and i don t think anything is going to move that needle   he said  both clinton and trump have unusually high  unfavorable  ratings among voters  although trump currently scores worse on that score  opinion polls show   the dual controversies over the foundation and over clinton s use of a private server and email account while secretary of state dovetailed on monday  conservative legal group judicial watch sought to make the case that previously unreleased emails provide evidence that clinton offered access to donors to the foundation while she was secretary of state
