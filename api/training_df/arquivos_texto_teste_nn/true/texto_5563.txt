washington  reuters    donald trump s supreme court nominee  neil gorsuch  on wednesday described as  demoralizing  and  disheartening  the u s  president s twitter attacks on a judge who suspended trump s travel ban on seven muslim majority countries  a spokesman for gorsuch said  gorsuch s comments came as a federal appeals court in san francisco was expected to decide in coming days on the narrow question of whether u s  district judge james robart acted properly in temporarily halting enforcement of trump s ban  a republican strategist hired by the white house to help guide gorsuch s nomination through the u s  senate said that gorsuch  himself an appeals court judge  used those words when he met with democratic senator richard blumenthal  trump  who took office on jan    took to twitter over the weekend to condemn the friday night order by robart that placed on hold the president s jan   temporary travel ban on people from the seven countries and all refugees   trump called robart a  so called judge  whose  ridiculous  opinion  essentially takes law enforcement away from our country   trump s administration appealed robart s ruling to a three judge federal appeals panel  which heard oral arguments  on tuesday   presidents are usually hesitant to weigh in on judicial matters out of respect for the u s  constitution  which ensures a separation of powers among the president s executive branch  congress and the judiciary   the republican led senate on wednesday confirmed immigration hardliner republican senator jeff sessions to be the next attorney general despite strong democratic opposition  trump says his executive order aims to head off attacks by islamist militants  the order  the most divisive act of trump s young presidency  sparked protests and chaos at u s  and overseas airports  critics said the ban unfairly targeted people for their religion   i don t ever want to call a court biased   trump told hundreds of police chiefs and sheriffs from major cities at a meeting in a washington hotel on wednesday   so i won t call it biased  and we haven t had a decision yet  but courts seem to be so political    trump nominated gorsuch on jan   to succeed conservative justice antonin scalia on the nine member supreme court  scalia died a year ago this month   blumenthal  a member of the judiciary committee that will hold a confirmation hearing on gorsuch  said the nominee had a responsibility to reassure americans that he would be an open minded and independent jurist by going public with his concerns about trump  the appeals court decision on whether to reinstate the ban  will be just a first step in a fast moving case  the courts will ultimately have to address questions about the extent of the president s power on matters of immigration and national security  traditionally  judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch s authority in such matters  legal experts say  although some note that the implementation of trump s order presents unique issues  trump s order barred travelers from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen from entering for  days and all refugees for  days  except those from civil war torn syria  who are subject to an indefinite ban  also at issue is whether the order violates a provision of the u s  constitution that prohibits laws favoring one religion over another  along with relevant discrimination laws   trump  a republican  has made extensive use of presidential directives that bypass congress and has appeared to be taken aback by legal challenges to his travel order  he praised a federal judge in boston who earlier ruled in his favor on the travel ban as a  highly respected  jurist whose findings were  perfect    last year  trump accused indiana born u s  district judge gonzalo curiel of bias in overseeing a lawsuit against one of trump s businesses  trump university  because of his mexican heritage  democrats and other critics have called trump s comments toward the judiciary an attack on a core principle of american democracy  that the courts are independent and uphold the rule of law   at the meeting with law enforcement officials  trump read from the law he cited to justify the travel ban  quoting it in fragments and sprinkling in bits of interpretation  he said the law clearly allowed a president to suspend entry of any class of people if he determined them to be a detriment to national security  the matter is likely to go to the u s  supreme court  which is ideologically split with four liberal justices and four conservatives pending senate action on trump s nomination of gorsuch  a conservative jurist  u s  state department figures showed that  refugees had been admitted to the united states since robart s order went into effect  including  on wednesday  of those admitted   were from war torn syria
