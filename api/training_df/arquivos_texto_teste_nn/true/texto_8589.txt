washington  reuters    a committee that raises money for democratic candidates for the u s  house of representatives confirmed on friday it had been hacked in an intrusion possibly linked to russian hackers  similar to an earlier breach targeting another democratic party group  in an incident that escalated concerns about the potential for russian meddling in u s  politics  reuters first reported on thursday that the u s  federal bureau of investigation is probing the hack at the democratic congressional campaign committee  or dccc  the intrusion took place from at least june  to june   though it may have been longer  according to analysis conducted by u s  network security company fireeye   the committee said in a statement it has hired cyber security firm crowdstrike to investigate   we have taken and are continuing to take steps to enhance the security of our network   the committee said   we are cooperating with federal law enforcement with respect to their ongoing investigation   the dccc hack may be related to an earlier hack against the democratic national committee  which raises money and sets strategy for democratic candidates nationwide  the dnc and dccc occupy the same office building in washington  potential links to russian hackers in both incidents were likely to heighten accusations  so far unproven  that moscow is trying to meddle in the u s  presidential election campaign to help republican nominee donald trump  the kremlin denied involvement in the dnc cyber attack  in june  a bogus website was registered with a name resembling a dccc donation site  for some time  donation related internet traffic that was supposed to go to a donation processing firm instead went to the fake site  the dccc intrusion may have been used to compromise the computer systems of donors who visited the spoof site  rather than to collect their personal information  said john hultquist  manager of cyber espionage analysis at fireeye  several major democratic donors contacted by reuters on friday said they had not been notified of the hack and were not concerned about their information being accessed    i m less concerned about that than i am about my amex being hacked   said john morgan    a florida attorney  cindy miscikowski    a california donor  said she would be upset if hackers got her bank information  but otherwise she was not worried because donations are disclosed publicly     the timeframe of the dccc hack would place it days after the dnc went public with its breach and said the hackers had been kicked out of its systems   sources said the numerical internet address of the spurious dccc site resembled one used by a russian government linked hacking group  one of two suspected in the dnc breach  rich barger  co founder of security intelligence firm threatconnect inc  said his analysis of the fake donation site tied it to the group linked to russian military intelligence   he said the web domain name was set up through a service that accepts bitcoin  with a contact email address that had been used to set up websites involved in a major german hack  which also was attributed to the russian group  cyber experts and u s  officials said this week there was evidence that russia engineered the dnc hack to release sensitive party emails and influence u s  politics  the dnc hack raised concerns among democrats at the party s convention in philadelphia  where hillary clinton was nominated as the party s candidate in the nov   presidential election  the new hack at the dccc could add pressure on the obama administration to make a public accusation or retaliate  the justice department and other agencies have said it is important for deterrence to  name and shame  cyber adversaries   any efforts on a nation state s part to interfere with u s  politics through cyber attacks would appear to cross a line that would demand a response from the u s  government   said d j  rosenthal  a former justice department and national security council official  a former white house official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said any formal accusation would require overwhelmingly certain evidence  staffers for the republican national committee and the democratic senatorial campaign committee said separately that those campaign organizing groups had not been hacked
