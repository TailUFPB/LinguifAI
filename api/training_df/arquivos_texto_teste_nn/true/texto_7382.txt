washington  reuters    some republican foreign policy veterans who came out against donald trump during the presidential campaign said on wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory  but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening  trump s stunning upset over democrat hillary clinton has created a new dilemma for the republican national security establishment  much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own party s candidate  declaring him unfit to lead  they must now decide whether to return to the fold  some career diplomats  intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a trump presidency would violate their principles  or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside  however  state department spokesman mark toner said   i wouldn t expect a mass exodus   about  of the republican party s most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in march and august in outright opposition to trump s candidacy  one said he was  utterly  unqualified for the white house  the other warned that he would be  the most reckless president in american history   while neither letter said the former officials would never work for trump  their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow republicans from supporting him  trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of  the failed washington elite  who  deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place   a number of the signatories contacted by reuters on wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of trump and would not work for him  however  they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration  which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of syria s civil war  the fight against islamic state  a newly assertive russia and the rise of china   i don t expect to be asked  i wouldn t serve  but there are others who will  it will be a matter of individual conscience   said eliot cohen  who served as counselor to former secretary of state condoleezza rice and helped spearhead the march letter  which was posted on a blog called war on the rocks and created a stir among republicans   i m concerned about his ignorance  the belligerence  the misunderstanding of how the world works   cohen said of trump  a wealthy real estate developer and former reality tv host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward washington insiders  max boot  a foreign policy adviser to republican mitt romney s  presidential campaign and a supporter of the u s  led iraq invasion in   said   i won t have anything to do with trump  but i don t know about others  i hope good people go into the government   but others appeared to waver  with some saying decisions on whether to join the trump administration could depend on how the president elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts  among the trump allies said to be in consideration are former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich and one time united nations ambassador john bolton for secretary of state  and general michael flynn  a former head of the defense intelligence agency  for national security adviser  dov zakheim  a former pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters  said trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs   he will want to show that he is not dividing the republican party  so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him   zakheim said  asked whether he expected to be offered a post  he said   i have no idea  as it s not up to me   bryan mcgrath  a retired us navy officer and co organizer of the war on the rocks letter  said he did not expect that those who signed it  were signing away employment rights  that they weren t going to work in a trump administration   if the president asks for your service  he said   you have to take that request seriously   patrick cronin  an asia expert and former third ranking official at usaid under president george w  bush  said that despite his earlier opposition to trump  he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice  but he said he was not interested in joining the administration  michael mcfaul  president barack obama s former ambassador to moscow and a clinton supporter in the election   said the republicans had a  deep bench of experience  for enlisting foreign policy experts  even as trump prepares to form his foreign policy team  some career diplomats  intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post election quandary  some said privately before tuesday s vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under trump  who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning u s  led alliances  praising russian president vladimir putin  suggesting that japan and south korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture  other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who he names to senior posts  saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president   if he keeps some of his campaign promises  about the use of torture  for example  many of us have discussed whether we are honor bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside  it s too early to say   one cia officer said  speaking on condition of anonymity
