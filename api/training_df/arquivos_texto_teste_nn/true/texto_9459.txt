new york washington  reuters    u s  lawmakers on thursday began coalescing around revised bipartisan legislation to help address puerto rico s unpayable debt burden  which now threatens a full blown humanitarian crisis  released close to midnight on wednesday  the house natural resources committee s revised bill includes a strong oversight board to direct how and when the island pays its bills and leaves many earlier proposals in place   puerto rico has already defaulted on some of its roughly   billion in debt while trying to cope with a  percent poverty rate among its   million u s  citizens  in addition  it is reeling from a zika virus outbreak that is hurting its critical tourism industry  language allowing puerto rico to cut repayments to creditors without their consent  known as a  cram down   remains  the bill does not prioritize pensioners over bondholders  but the language remains muddied  one analyst surmised   tonight  we introduced legislation to responsibly address the crisis in puerto rico  the revised bill incorporates technical refinements and input from all stakeholders   committee chairman rob bishop said in a statement  for a link to a factbox on the bill  click  while both republican and democratic leaders of the u s  house of representatives welcomed the bill after several delays  how more conservative republican lawmakers view the legislation is an open question  a vote on the bill by the house is expected in the first week of june  ahead of a looming    billion debt payment due on july   in recent months  the debt crisis has threatened a deepening humanitarian crisis as hospitals close wards  social services decline and emigration saps more economic activity   after long bipartisan negotiations  we believe we have achieved a restructuring process that can work   u s  house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement on thursday  house speaker paul ryan  who faces opposition to the bill from within his own republican ranks  highlighted the bipartisan effort as he will need democrat votes to get it passed   right now  the stability of the u s  territory is in danger  as the puerto rican government continues to default on major loan payments  we have insisted that our response meet basic principles  and first among them is protecting taxpayers from a bailout   ryan said in a statement  the bill  formally known as the puerto rico oversight  management and economic stability act  promesa   seeks to return the island to solvency  rebuild a base for economic growth and maintain its ability to access capital markets in the future  the white house called the bill an  important first step  in creating a fair process for restructuring puerto rico s debt and economy after a decade of recession  the u s  territory s governor  alejandro garcia padilla  said he was encouraged by the bill but chafed at the oversight board  which he believes undermine the island s self governance  choosing the members of the oversight board has been a sticking point in the talks leading up to the introduction of the bill  u s  treasury secretary jack lew said on thursday he was pleased the bill includes  restructuring tools for puerto rico that are comprehensive and workable  but expressed disappointment that proposals to promote economic growth were left out of what he called a  tough bipartisan compromise          in the early drafts of the bill  senator orrin hatch of utah  the chairman of the powerful senate finance committee  said he was not satisfied  meaning a potential hurdle for passing the bill could remain  a conservative tea party favorite  representative raul labrador of idaho  said he was reviewing the bill but told reuters he thought a majority of republicans would  support it through both houses of congress   many creditors lobbied for a bill that does not create new precedents for how they might be treated in a restructuring which would potentially set up future legal fights on the u s  mainland that are far away from the island s current crisis   the bill  which creates a control board and allows for bankruptcy  is highly controversial and does not definitively protect any creditors  we believe the legislation is more positive for both go and cofina creditors than the legislation previously under review   wrote heights securities analyst daniel hanson  hanson said the bill lacks clarity over the treatment of constitutionally protected bondholders versus pensioners  a local bondholder group said it supported the bill   as imperfect as it may be  the bipartisan bill is the  pause  that is desperately needed so everyone can come together to forge a bright future for all americans living in puerto rico   said jorge irizarry  president of the backyard bondholders  which represents more than   resident bondholders in puerto rico    go  or general obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the island and are senior to all debt  while cofina debt is backed by sales tax revenues   this territories clause bill  which will bring all creditors to the table and establish a strong and independent fiscal oversight board  should appeal to conservatives who were concerned about a  bailout  or  contagion    the cofina senior bondholders ad hoc group said in a statement   investors bid up prices on puerto rico s benchmark july  go debt to   a gain of   point in price to yield   percent  according to msrb data
