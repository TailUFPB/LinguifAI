washington  reuters    early optimism among business lobbyists and executives that donald trump s election heralded better days has slowly given way to uncertainty as the president elect fires off mixed and sometimes confusing messages on healthcare  taxes and trade  an initial euphoria in the business world fueled a powerful post election stock rally  some of that has frayed as questions arise over the nuts and bolts of trump s campaign promises  although many in the business community said they remained optimistic  doubts deepened over the weekend as trump declared he would replace president barack obama s signature healthcare plan known as obamacare with  insurance for everybody    a goal far beyond republican designs   and criticized a key component of a plan in congress to overhaul corporate taxes  in a later interview  he appeared to adjust both stances  possibly adding to the confusion   it is fair to say that since the election  there has been mounting uncertainty about exactly what the specific policies are likely to be with regard to tax reform and replacing obamacare   a financial industry official said  expectations for faster growth  tax reform and a quick repeal of obamacare  officially known as the affordable care act  have  given way to  we are not really sure what he means by that    the official said  a veteran republican financial lobbyist said she was under constant pressure from clients to predict what the new administration was planning but had no reliable answers   trump appears to have thrown a wrench into republican plans to repeal obamacare with mixed signals on the details and timing of a replacement plan  congressional republicans have focused on limiting government involvement in the healthcare system and eliminating the law s individual mandate that forces people to have insurance   but trump told the washington post he was almost done with a plan to replace obamacare with  insurance for everybody   while forcing drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices for medicare and medicaid  trump s recent attack on the border adjustment tax was another sign of his unpredictability  the financial lobbyist said  that measure would tax imports and exempt exports in an effort to encourage companies to keep jobs and production in the united states  in an interview with the wall street journal on friday  trump called the proposal  too complicated    anytime i hear border adjustment  i don t love it   trump told the journal   because usually it means we re going to get adjusted into a bad deal  that s what happens   chris krueger  an analyst at the investment firm cowen and co  said trump s comments to the newspaper about the border adjustment proposal were  breathtaking    trump is like a policy bull who seems to bring his own china shop with him to destroy it with every interview   krueger wrote in a research note   in an interview with the news outlet axios on tuesday  trump appeared to adjust both positions  he said the border adjustment idea was still  on the plate   as for obamacare  he said his comments were in response to proposals in which  people with no money aren t covered   which he said were unacceptable  lobbyists said the trump transition team s lack of interest in their input was clear in the past two weeks as it summoned trade groups to daily  listening sessions  at the american enterprise institute think tank  the agriculture  financial   transportation and tech industries were among the sectors that got a one hour session  according to participants  in the sessions  wall street lobbyists were encouraged to talk fast  a giant television screen overhead counted down two minutes of allotted time   it was a goat rodeo  we all got a couple minutes to speak  what can you really say in that time   said another financial services lobbyist   they wanted to check the box    we re listening to wall street   but who even knows where these transition people will be in a few days    lobbyists also have been alarmed that the transition team has not included them in preparations for confirmation hearings for many nominated cabinet officials  including potential treasury secretary steven mnuchin   if you want someone to explain how elizabeth warren can hammer you  different ways  ask a lobbyist   said the financial services lobbyist  referring to the democratic u s  senator from massachusetts and frequent critic of wall street  even trump s website sowed confusion about his intentions  a promise to dismantle the dodd frank regulatory reforms was removed at the end of last year and has not been replaced  a trump representative blamed a redesign  but bank lobbyists are not so sure   other content made it through the redesign  some companies have been reassured by trump s cabinet nominees  who are seen as more predictable and supportive of the business establishment than the impulsive president elect  senator jeff sessions  trump s pick for attorney general  has deep differences on values with the technology sector but is seen as an important trump counterweight because he is a  deliberate decision maker not prone to big dramatic mood swings   a source at one major silicon valley firm said  many lobbyists and business officials said they remained optimistic and cautioned against reading too deeply into tweets or comments that trump makes on policy    if obama or bush opined on a policy     most of washington assumed that raising that question was a well vetted intentional decision to send a signal   a senior u s  chamber of commerce official said  trump  by contrast  may simply be raising policy issues because he has questions on them  the chamber official said  the same financial industry official who acknowledged the uncertain climate also said he was still optimistic   there were a lot of candidates who were interviewed  there were names floated out there and     it was kind of a chaotic process   the official said  referring to the process of picking candidates to fill cabinet and other administration positions   but overall  i think one can make the observation that in making the final selections  trump has shown     a very surprising even handedness
