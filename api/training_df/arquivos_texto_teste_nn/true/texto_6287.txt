rebukes from berlin and hit the automakers  shares  in an interview with german newspaper bild  published on monday  trump criticized german carmakers such as bmw  bmwg de   daimler  daign de  and volkswagen  vowgp de  for failing to produce more cars on u s  soil   if you want to build cars in the world  then i wish you all the best  you can build cars for the united states  but for every car that comes to the usa  you will pay  percent tax   trump said in remarks translated into german   i would tell bmw that if you are building a factory in mexico and plan to sell cars to the usa  without a  percent tax  then you can forget that   trump said  volkswagen  vw  shares closed down   percent  while bmw and daimler s shares ended   percent lower  under pressure to deliver on campaign promises to revive u s  industrial jobs  trump has turned his fire on carmakers that use low cost mexican plants to serve the u s  market  he has also warned japan s toyota   t  it could be subject to a  big border tax  if it builds its corolla cars for the u s  market at a planned factory in mexico  all three german carmakers have invested heavily in mexico  but also pointed out on monday that they manufacturer in the united states as well   bmw executive peter schwarzenbauer told reporters the company was sticking to plans to invest around   billion in a new plant in mexico  which is due to go into production in  and create at least   jobs   the president s powers are considerable  he can legally impose tariffs of up to  percent for  days  trump is not constrained by congress   said simon evenett  professor of international trade at switzerland s university of st gallen   even if foreign companies object and seek to challenge the legality of tariffs  it will take at least  months to get decided  corporate strategies will be disrupted by then   while investing in mexico  german carmakers have quadrupled light vehicle production in the united states over the past seven years to   units  more than half of which are exported from there  germany s vda automotive industry association said   in the long term  the united states would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers   vda president matthias wissmann said in a statement  german carmakers employ about   workers in the united states and german automotive suppliers about   more  the vda said   speaking in tabloid newspaper bild  german economy minister sigmar gabriel said that rather than trying to penalize german carmakers  the united states should instead respond by building better and more desirable cars  norbert roettgen  head of germany s foreign affairs committee  said berlin needed to take trump s comments seriously   he seems to be absolutely focused on short term job interests and security interests     not that he is looking for free trade so much  but more for protection   he told reuters  daimler s mercedes benz and bmw already have sizeable factories in the united states where they build higher margin sports utility vehicles  suvs  for export to asia and europe  around  percent of bmw s production from its factory in spartanburg  south carolina  is exported overseas  bmw builds the      and  models in the united states   it is surprising that trump singles out the carmaker that exports more vehicles from the united states than any other manufacturer   evercore isi analysts said  a bmw spokeswoman said the planned plant in the central mexican city of san luis potosi would build the bmw  series from   with the output intended for the world market  the plant would be an addition to existing  series production facilities in germany and china  in june last year  bmw broke ground on the plant  pledging to invest    billion in mexico by  for annual production of   cars  daimler has said it plans to begin assembling mercedes benz vehicles in  from a   billion facility shared with renault nissan  rena pa    t  in aguascalientes in mexico  a spokesman for daimler declined to comment on trump s remarks   last year  vw s audi division inaugurated a    billion production facility with   vehicle production capacity near puebla  mexico  audi said it would build electric and petrol  suvs in mexico  audi declined to comment on monday  vw also declined to comment on trump s remarks but noted it was investing another   million in its u s  plant in chattanooga  tennessee  trump called germany a great car producer  saying mercedes benz cars were a frequent sight in new york  but claimed there was not enough reciprocity  germans were not buying chevrolets at the same rate  he said  calling the business relationship an unfair one way street   chevrolet sales have fallen sharply in europe since parent company general motors  gm n  in  said it would drop the chevrolet brand in europe by the end of   since then  gm has focused instead on promoting its opel and vauxhall marques  asked by reuters whether trump could take any steps to make it easier for gm to sell more american made cars in europe  gm chief executive mary barra said the company aimed to build cars in markets where they are sold   we re a global company so we re going to continue that focus just because from an economic perspective that generally turns out to be the best framework   she said   i think there is a lot that we can work on with president elect trump
