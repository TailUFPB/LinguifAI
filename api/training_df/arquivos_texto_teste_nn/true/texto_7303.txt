washington  reuters    u s  officials are striving to put finishing touches on a slew of banking rules before president barack obama leaves office and hands regulatory power to donald trump who has vowed to rewrite the existing financial rule book  president elect trump will take over on jan   and his fellow republicans will have control of congress and government agencies  allowing the new administration to block or roll back many of the last minute changes  but by completing far advanced work on some banking standards in the next  weeks  obama officials would raising the chances that some elements of the regulatory framework will survive  some rules are meant to flesh out the dodd frank act of  designed to prevent the next global financial crisis  trump campaigned on a pledge to scrap the law but now he says only some provisions must go to lighten the regulatory burden  the federal reserve is working on rules to govern matters such as executive pay  market stability and what investments wall street may hold  last month  securities and exchange commission chair mary jo white said her agency would  in the near term  finish a rule on one thorny issue  how mutual funds manage derivatives  the sec and bank regulators have also for years struggled to finalize a rule that would tie more banker pay to the long term health of their firms rather than short term performance of wall street firms  with only about  working days until the handover  it is not clear which  if any  of those standards will get across the finishing line   just look at the calendar   said tom quaadman of the chamber of commerce   these are intricate rules and there s not much time   the executive pay rule exemplifies the challenge  six federal agencies have a say on the compensation standard meant as part of dodd frank and a final draft has not yet been offered  industry officials told reuters  it would be nearly impossible to circulate a final rule and get the agencies to endorse it while still satisfying standards for clearing such paperwork  several lobbyists who have opposed the rule said  banking regulators declined to comment on when the compensation rule might be completed  simple logistics also pose a challenge  new federal rules come into force once they have been published in the federal register and employees there typically need several days to typeset a rule  that means obama officials need to lodge paperwork with the federal register at the beginning of the inauguration week at the latest  some sixteen copy editors are due to forego leave and be on hand in the coming weeks to process final rules expected from dozens of agencies  said an official familiar with the operation  but not authorized to speak to the media   these days  people do not spend a lot of time hanging around the coffee maker   he said  some freshly minted rules also face the prospect of getting erased under a  law known as the congressional review act  which allows congress to block a regulation within  working days of being drafted  one such rule allows students who were defrauded by for profit colleges to seek loan forgiveness  the department of education finalized it days before the nov   election  meaning republicans who have raised objections to it will have a chance to block it  president george w  bush was the first to trigger the review act when he block labor regulations that his predecessor bill clinton had enacted at the end of his term
