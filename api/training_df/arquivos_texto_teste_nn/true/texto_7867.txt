washington  reuters    hillary clinton s campaign is confronting an emerging risk to her presidential ambitions   if donald trump continues to trail her in opinion polls many democrats may simply stay at home on election day  without enough popular support  clinton would enter the white house lacking the political capital she would need to drive through her agenda  in the worst case scenario it could cost her the presidency if republicans turn out in big numbers on nov         clinton  the democratic nominee  has spent much of her campaign sounding the alarm over the prospect of a president trump  she has struggled to lay out a compelling vision for her presidency and has failed to excite key constituencies  including millennials  minority voters and liberal democrats  opinion polls show that many voters are backing clinton primarily to stop trump  the republican nominee  from getting into the white house  if they believe he has no hope of winning  then what would their motivation be to turn up at the polls   in a recent reuters ipsos poll about half of all clinton supporters said they were backing her to keep trump from winning  by contrast  just   percent said it was because of clinton s policies and just   percent said it was because they like her personally    turnout is correlated with levels of competition   said michael mcdonald  an elections expert at the university of florida   the higher the competition  the higher the turnout   the young americans  blacks  latinos  and low income voters who make up much of the democratic base often need to feel motivated by a particular candidate or issue to turn out  mcdonald said  as was the case with president barack obama s candidacy in    clinton s campaign has long worried about voter complacency and has at every turn pushed the notion that the race is close and that trump is unfit to be president  with her lead growing  that task grows more difficult  a reuters ipsos  state survey  carried out before friday s release of a video tape in which trump makes vulgar remarks about women  gave the democratic nominee a  percent chance of winning the election  an nbc wall street journal poll on monday showed clinton with an  point lead nationally over trump  low democratic voter turnout could leave trump an opening in swing states  and should clinton win the election  a slim margin of victory could compound the challenge she will face in trying to govern a deeply divided nation   clinton s campaign  however  will be able to rely on an extensive and well funded voter mobilization effort  one that is expected to give her an edge over trump s smaller organization   the clinton campaign insisted on monday the race will remain tight  it sent out a new fundraising pitch to supporters  contending that trump is  an authoritarian threat  for saying at sunday s presidential debate that she would be in jail if he was president   clinton must also contend with anger among liberal democrats over leaked excerpts of paid speeches she made to banks and big business  the excerpts appeared to confirm their fears about her support for global trade and tendency to cozy up to wall street  some liberals have also been waiting for clinton to make a more positive case for her own presidency   this election cannot be just a referendum on donald trump   said arun chaudhury  creative director of revolution messaging  a left leaning consulting firm that oversaw the online media operation of former clinton rival  senator bernie sanders   clinton s central message  he said  has been that  everyone has to step up and stop donald trump from being president  not step up and make hillary clinton president     the best campaign messages are comparative in nature   said ben turchin  a democratic pollster who worked for sanders  campaign   she can win by a bigger margin by giving a little more of an affirmative case for her presidency   while clinton frequently goes on the attack against trump  calling him racist  sexist and dangerous  her campaign insists it has been trying to get a positive  policy oriented message out   it is hard in this campaign when you re running against him and he generates so much controversy and therefore headlines   jennifer palmieri  clinton s communications director  told reuters   it s hard to break through on any one day  and that s why we just have to keep at it   the two candidates  central campaign slogans reflect their differing appeals to the electorate  where trump s is the change oriented  make america great again   clinton s is a more stolid  stronger together   which speaks to rallying existing democratic voters around her candidacy   and is a harder sell   clinton s campaign seems to have recognized the need for some adjustments to its message   since the presidential race intensified last month  clinton has returned to the style of campaigning that helped her win early states in the democratic nominating contests  holding smallish events focused on issues of most concern to core democratic constituencies such as women and young voters   turchin  the former sanders pollster  said clinton s efforts at fashioning a positive message were improving  although she is still having difficulty attracting the support of  to  year old voters  among others    you ve got to make the hard case over and over again   he said   she s got to convince people she shares their values
