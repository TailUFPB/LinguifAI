washington  reuters    president donald trump on thursday nominated former national labor relations board member r  alexander acosta to serve as u s  secretary of labor  one day after trump s original choice withdrew  acosta is dean of the florida international university college of law in miami and is trump s first hispanic nominee   acosta has had a decades long public service career  serving in three presidentially appointed and senate confirmed positions  and is expected to face a smooth confirmation process   mr  acosta s nomination is off to a good start because he s already been confirmed by the senate three times   said senator lamar alexander  who chairs the senate committee on health  education  labor and pensions that will be vetting the nomination  acosta was appointed to the national labor relations board  nlrb  by former republican president george w  bush  who also appointed him to be assistant attorney general in the justice department s civil rights division   he was then appointed to be u s  attorney for the southern district of florida  where he went after high profile defendants such as jack abramoff and ubs  resulting in the swiss bank paying more than   million in fines for a tax avoidance scheme  acosta also previously served as a law clerk to samuel alito from  to   when the conservative supreme court justice was a judge at the  u s  circuit court of appeals   i thank the president and his staff for their confidence in me and i am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the american worker   acosta said in a statement  while at the nlrb  acosta signed hundreds of opinions  those familiar with his work describe him as a careful and cautious public servant whose career trajectory suggested he may someday vie for a federal judgeship  because he has already gone through multiple vettings by the u s  senate  it is unlikely there will be any surprises in his background that could derail his nomination  the choice of acosta  a traditional republican conservative  is seen by some as a sign that trump was forced to give up a more aggressive policy on worker issues  trump s first labor secretary pick  andrew puzder  the chief executive officer of cke restaurants inc  was outspoken in opposition to issues such as overtime pay  minimum wage hikes and even discussed the superiority of robots over human workers  he removed his name from consideration on wednesday amid concerns he could not garner enough senate votes to be confirmed    this is the humbling of donald trump   said seth harris  a former acting labor secretary during the obama administration  who said puzder would have been a  radical disruptor  but acosta won t be  acosta has been a staunch defender of the civil rights of muslims who faced a backlash after the sept      attacks on the united states  in a  congressional hearing  acosta applauded how the justice department responded to civil rights violations  saying they helped assure muslim americans that  their government would protect their rights   some progressive groups were already responding negatively to the acosta appointment  with allied progress alleging he had mismanaged the department of justice s civil rights division when he ran it   in   an internal justice department report faulted acosta for failing to rein in a staffer who engaged in improper politicized hiring  however  the response to acosta s nomination from union groups who had staunchly opposed puzder was much more measured on thursday   unlike andy puzder  alexander acosta s nomination deserves serious consideration   said afl cio president richard trumka    in one day  we ve gone from a fast food ceo who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it
