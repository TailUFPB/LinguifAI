oslo washington  reuters    donald trump s vow to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected u s  president caused dismay abroad on wednesday  with supporters of the deal saying it was in his interests to embrace a plan that seeks to end dependence on fossil fuels  u s  insistence on renegotiation could unravel a  nation compromise to curb greenhouse gas emissions reached in paris in december after fraught talks between nations as different as china  the united states  small island states and opec members   the paris agreement is as much in the united states  interests as any other country   said tony de brum  ambassador for climate change of the marshall islands who  as his country s foreign minister  helped broker the u n  deal   seeking to unravel it would not only threaten the u s  economy  damage its environment  and weaken its security  but it would do a great disservice to all of humanity   he said  trump  the presumptive republican presidential nominee  told reuters on tuesday he was  not a big fan  of the climate accord   he said china and other countries would not stick to the  one sided  deal  which seeks to transform the world economy from fossil fuels in coming decades to slow global warming   i will be looking at that very  very seriously  and at a minimum i will be renegotiating those agreements  at a minimum  and at a maximum i may do something else   he said  trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by china to hurt the competitiveness of u s  business  government officials meeting in bonn  germany  from may   to find ways to implement the deal  raised concerns about trump s comments but doubted he would take serious action  that s because the deal imposes no real constraints on the united states   it lets all nations define their own actions for fighting climate change  president barack obama has promised to cut emissions by   but his successors will face no penalties if they do not comply  meaning little incentive to challenge the u n  deal  many officials also say it is in u s  interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions  partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels also means less air pollution  a big cause of disease  even many nations traditionally sceptical that man made greenhouse emissions stoke climate change  like opec countries  have gone along with the paris agreement  george david banks  a senior climate change adviser to president george w  bush and a trump supporter  said trump could try to force countries like china to pledge deeper emissions cuts by renegotiating the agreement  that s wishful thinking  according to john coequyt  director of green group the sierra club s international climate campaigns   you can t get more than  countries to renegotiate a deal they are implementing   he said  the paris agreement will formally enter into force when  nations representing at least  percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it  china and the united states  representing  percent  say they will join this year  if the deal enters into force before the next u s  president takes office next year  it will in theory be harder to pull out  article  says any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of entry into force   the length of a u s  presidential term  trump s easiest option is to neglect the deal if elected  legal experts say  trump could ignore the targets set by obama and promise instead to help developing nations cope with global warming  the paris agreement s flexible approach  allowing all to set their own goals  is radically different from the u n  s  kyoto protocol  which set mandatory targets for developed nations to cut emissions until   the united states did not take part in kyoto   president george w  bush denounced it as an economic straitjacket that  he said  unfairly omitted targets for developing nations led by china and india  former french foreign minister laurent fabius  who helped broker the paris deal  said this month that the u s  election was critical to its future   if a climate change denier was to be elected  it would threaten dramatically global action against climate disruption   he said  but u s  chief climate envoy jonathan pershing said last week that other nations were likely to push ahead with the paris agreement whoever wins the white house
