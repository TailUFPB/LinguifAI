charlotte  n c  los angeles  reuters    republican u s  presidential candidate donald trump on friday charged that the women accusing him of sexual misconduct fabricated their stories to damage his campaign after two more women came forward with allegations that he had groped them  the new accusations were made by a contestant on his reality tv show  the apprentice   who cited a  incident  and by a woman who described an incident from the early   with the allegations against trump dominating the campaign  opinion polls show trump trailing democratic rival hillary clinton  a reuters ipsos opinion poll taken oct    and released on friday showed trump behind clinton by  percentage points among likely voters in the nov   election  trump has spent more and more time at his rallies denying allegations of groping since a video from  became public a week ago showing him bragging about groping and making unwanted sexual advances  on friday  in addition to his denials  he suggested that he never would have found two of the women who have made allegations attractive  summer zervos  who competed on the fifth season of  the apprentice  in   appeared at a news conference with celebrity attorney gloria allred in los angeles  saying trump kissed her  touched her breast and tried to get her to lie down on a bed with him during a meeting about a possible job   he put me in an embrace and i tried to push him away  i pushed his chest to put space between us and i said   come on man  get real   he repeated my words back to me   get real   as he began thrusting his genitals   zervos said  zervos said she thought trump was going to take her to dinner to discuss a job  but the meeting took place in his bungalow at the beverly hills hotel   i wondered if the sexual behavior was some kind of test and whether or not i had passed  by rejecting it  she said  but trump later offered her a job at a golf course for half the salary she had requested  trump released a statement denying her allegations   i vaguely remember ms  zervos as one of the many contestants on  the apprentice  over the years  to be clear  i never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago   trump said   that is not who i am as a person  and it is not how i ve conducted my life   at his last event of the day on friday  in charlotte  trump suggested that his accusers were fabricating their stories for publicity or to damage his campaign   it s not hard to find a small handful of people willing to make false smears   he said   trump said the women may be motivated for financial reasons or political reasons or  the simple reason they want to stop our movement   earlier friday  the washington post published an interview with a woman who said trump put his hand up her skirt in a crowded new york nightclub in the early  in an unwanted advance   he did touch my vagina through my underwear  absolutely   kristin anderson said in a video interview on the newspaper s website   it wasn t a sexual come on  i don t know why he did it  it was like just to prove that he could do it   she told the newspaper  anderson could not be reached for comment  trump s white house campaign has been scrambling to recover from the release a week ago of the  video  while trump said the video was just talk and he had never behaved in that way  several women subsequently went public with allegations of sexual misconduct against the new york real estate magnate going back three decades  national opinion polls have shown that women voters have been fleeing trump in large numbers  putting his campaign in free fall  late on friday  the trump campaign put forward a british man who disputed the account of one of the accusers  jessica leeds   leeds  who is now   said trump groped her on a flight to new york  in or around   her account was published in the new york times earlier this week and she has since been interviewed on cnn  the new york post reported that the man  anthony gilberthorpe  contacted the trump campaign after leeds went public with her story  and said he was sitting near leeds and trump in first class on the same flight    i was there  i was in a position to know that what she said was wrong  wrong  wrong   said gilberthorpe  who is now  and would have been a teenager at the time  trump had been promising that he would soon provide information showing the allegations against him were false  gilberthorpe is known in britain for his claims that he provided underage boys to british politicians for sex parties in the   trump    mocked leeds on friday   believe me  she would not be my first choice  that i can tell you   he said  he called natasha stoynoff  a reporter who wrote in people magazine that trump kissed her and pinned her against a wall  a  liar  and told the rally to  check out her facebook page  you ll understand   many republicans have sought to distance themselves from trump  the most senior of them  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  angered trump when he announced this week he would no longer campaign for trump or defend him but would focus on trying to preserve the republican majorities in both the house and the senate in the election  ryan gave a campaign speech in madison  wisconsin  on friday without mentioning trump s name once  he urged college students to look beyond the  ugliness  of the presidential campaign to focus on issues such as tax and healthcare reform   the kind of election we really want to have  it s not the one we re necessarily having right now   ryan said  urging students to  take the high ground   trump on friday also accused mexican billionaire carlos slim  the top shareholder in the new york times company  of helping to generate the reports of sexual misconduct  he said slim  as a donor to the clinton foundation charity and who holds a   percent stake in the times  has an interest in helping clinton s white house campaign  arturo elias  slim s spokesman and son in law  said slim had  absolutely no contact  with the newspaper s reporters or editors on their trump campaign coverage and  zero  contact with the paper s news operations  new york times publisher arthur sulzberger jr  said in a statement   carlos slim is an excellent shareholder who fully respects boundaries regarding the independence of our journalism  he has never sought to influence what we report       trump s allegation about slim was the latest chapter in a running series of skirmishes he has had with mexico and mexicans  trump kicked off his campaign last year accusing mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states  and promised to build a wall along the southern u s  border and said he would make mexico pay for
