washington  reuters    fast food executive andy puzder  president elect donald trump s choice to head the labor department  could be in a position to  undermine the agency s new rule on retirement advice which has long been opposed by the financial industry      puzder has not publicly commented on the fiduciary rule  which is due to go into effect in april  but a glimpse into the  k  plans he offers his own employees at cke restaurants may provide a few clues about his philosophy    the plan is less generous than some of its fast food competitors  according to data and analysis from brightscope inc  a research company that rates  plans  in   cke opted not to match the retirement contributions of the plan s participants  according to labor department data  the plan also carries high fee investments  has low participation and generally scores worse than many of its rivals even in the notoriously high turnover  low benefit fast food industry  according to brightscope   the cke plan suggests that puzder will bring  more of an industry friendly perspective to the office   said mike alfred  managing director at brightscope  which ranks it below those at jack in the box  mcdonalds and yum  brands inc  a spokeswoman for cke  a privately held company that owns and operates fast food chains including carl s jr  and hardee s   referred all questions to a member of trump s transition team   a spokeswoman for the transition team did not have an immediate comment  the plan could be a sign that cke chief executive officer puzder will seek to delay   or even potentially support reversing the fiduciary rule if he is confirmed in his new position by the senate      the rule requires retirement advisers to put their clients  interests ahead of their own by eliminating conflicts of interest that can lead some brokers to recommend investments that will get them a higher commission or fee          it applies to  k  type plans as well as privately held individual retirement accounts  the financial sector has opposed the rule  saying it may drive up the cost of getting good retirement advice and leave consumers with access to fewer products   but companies have already put money into getting ready for it  with some changing their broker compensation plans  with so much money already invested  financial firms may not wish to see it reversed now  said barbara roper  director of investor protection for the consumer federation of america   it s not just a slam dunk to reverse course   she said  should puzder want to take action against the rule  his quickest move could be to delay its implementation while the labor department and the securities and exchange commission  which has considered a comparable rule for all investment advisers  take another look  one way to delay it could entail declining to enforce the rule  the rule likely will get delayed  cowen and company  research analyst jaret seiberg wrote in a note to clients on thursday  puzder  does not sound like the type of individual who would be supportive of a fiduciary duty regime    trump s adviser anthony scaramucci of skybridge capital has pledged to repeal it the rule is already in jeopardy  several financial trade groups  including the chamber of commerce  have filed lawsuits to kill it   republican members of congress are gunning to have it repealed and may be able to muster enough votes without the fear of a veto after trump becomes president  missouri republican rep  ann wagner  a chief architect of a bill that would largely derail the fiduciary rule  on friday praised trump s plan to nominate puzder   i look forward to working with andy next year to repeal the fiduciary rule   she said in a statement  progressive groups who support the rule are vowing to fight for its survival and plan to try and highlight its populist appeal for everyday americans   the thing that we will try to do    is make incredibly clear that anyone who votes on the wrong side of this is putting themselves with corporate america up against the american public   said lisa gilbert  a director of public citizen s congress watch division who closely follows the issue
