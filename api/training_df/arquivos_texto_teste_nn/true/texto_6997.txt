 washington  reuters    the united states should prepare to use greater military power and covert action in syria to help forge a political settlement to end the country s civil war  according to a bipartisan report to be released on wednesday   produced by a task force led by former u s  secretary of state madeleine albright  a democrat  and former u s  national security adviser stephen hadley  a republican  the report amounts to a bipartisan rejection of president barack obama s decision to limit u s  military engagement in the nearly six year civil war   largely drafted before republican donald trump s victory over democrat hillary clinton in the nov   u s  presidential election  the paper  which has not been presented to trump  makes a case for deeper u s  involvement in the middle east   an interview with madeleine albright and stephen hadley in this week s war college podcast     isolationism is a dangerous illusion   said the report  which was obtained by reuters on tuesday  it calls for outside nations to help wind down conflicts in iraq  libya and yemen and back home grown reform throughout the region   its key recommendation for syria may be moot when trump takes office on jan   if government forces seize eastern aleppo  the opposition s most important urban stronghold  syrian president bashar al assad has been dramatically strengthened by russian military support over the past  months    the united states should be prepared to employ air power  stand off weapons  covert measures and enhanced support for opposition forces to break the current siege of aleppo and frustrate assad s attempts to consolidate control over western syria s population centers   the report said   it is unclear what policy trump will pursue on syria  in an oct   interview  he told reuters a more aggressive military policy advocated by clinton could  lead to world war three   because of the potential for conflict with russian forces   trump also made clear his priority was fighting islamic state militants rather than unseating the syrian president  saying   assad is secondary  to me  to isis    the syrian army and its allies aim to seize all of eastern aleppo before trump takes office on jan    keeping to a russian backed timeline after big gains in recent days  a senior official in the military alliance supporting assad said   the united states has two main lines of effort in syria  a covert cia operation that backs opposition forces trying to oust assad and a wider military operation that uses air strikes and special forces to target islamic state and al qaeda fighters   the report argues u s  backed opposition forces should also be allowed to strike assad government targets   asked whether a greater u s  military effort might yield a bloodier proxy war rather than a political solution  hadley told reuters   it may not work  but one of the things we know is that what s now going on isn t working
