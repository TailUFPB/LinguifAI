washington  reuters    faced with a growing test of resolve for a new u s  president who vowed while campaigning to get tough on north korea  donald trump s aides are pressing to complete a strategy review on how to counter pyongyang s missile and nuclear threats  pyongyang s latest missile launches and the assassination in malaysia of north korean leader kim jong un s estranged half brother have added urgency  driving home the need for washington to confront the security challenge  all options are on the table  ranging from tighter sanctions aimed at pushing north korea back into disarmament talks  to a return of u s  nuclear weapons to south korea  and even pre emptive air strikes on north korean missile installations  senior u s  administration officials said  they added a consensus was forming around relying for now on increased economic and diplomatic pressure   especially by pressing china to do more to rein in north korea   while deploying advanced anti missile defenses in south korea and possibly in japan  as well  among the other possibilities  one u s  official said  was returning north korea to the u s  list of countries that support terrorism   that would be a response to the suspected use of nerve gas to kill kim s brother at a malaysian airport last month  it would subject pyongyang   already heavily sanctioned by the united nations and individual states  so far to little effect   to additional financial sanctions that were removed when it was taken off the list in       for now  u s  officials consider pre emptive military action far too risky  given the danger of igniting a regional war and causing massive casualties in japan and south korea and among tens of thousands of u s  troops based in both allied countries  such ideas could gain traction  however  if north korea proceeds with a threatened test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the united states  just before he took office in january  trump tweeted   it won t happen   when kim said north korea was close to testing an icbm  trump also could opt for escalating cyber attacks and other covert actions aimed at undermining the north korean leadership  a u s  government source said  the review is expected to be completed by the end of the month  officials said  decisions could be held up  however  by the slow pace at which trump has been filling national security jobs  trump is known to have little patience for detailed foreign policy discussions  but officials said he seemed to have heeded a warning from his white house predecessor  barack obama  that north korea would be the most urgent international issue he would face   so much so that he requested intelligence briefings on the issue  while officials have stressed the need to persuade china to do more to pressure north korea  trump s first concrete response to north korea s missile tests has been to start installing an advanced anti missile defense system in south korea  which has incensed beijing  diplomats said the move might reassure u s  allies but could backfire by antagonizing china  which regards the system as a threat  and make it less willing to step up sanctions on its neighbor   you have to adjust and calibrate all the options based on the facts on the ground   said an administration official  who added that media reports highlighting military options were overblown   the ability to have sanctions that pack some punch and are more dynamic than we have had in the past is going to be dependent to some extent on chinese cooperation   he said  chinese diplomats argue that beijing is doing all it can  bonnie glaser at washington s center for strategic and international studies said china could close banks that conduct illicit financial transactions with north korea  prosecute front companies facilitating business  cut off oil exports and expel north korean workers  glazer said she saw no good military option  while past talks have failed  she would not be surprised if trump wanted to try diplomacy  one idea could be to discuss a freeze in north korea s nuclear and missile programs  which would fall short of current demands for nuclear disarmament   north korea may insist on being recognized as a nuclear weapons state as a precondition  in which case the u s  would have to decide whether to make that concession   she said  evans revere  a former senior diplomat who dealt with korea under president george w  bush  said washington should pressure north korea with sanctions  military deployments and covert operations   doing this would     compel the regime to rethink its course and make it more likely to return to dialogue and denuclearization  lest it risk collapse   he said  whether trump will be willing to tolerate the level of risk needed to make such a strategy work remains unclear   this is an administration that is more inclined to be averse to regime change than previous administrations   the first administration official said   that s from the top down    this administration intends to come up with options based on the cards we are dealt  not try to change the deck entirely  which is what regime change is
