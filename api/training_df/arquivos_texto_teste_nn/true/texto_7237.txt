london  reuters    investors who sent copper to a  month peak on hopes for a splurge of u s  infrastructure spending by donald trump may end up underwhelmed given that the plans  even if successful  would add only modestly to world demand   china dominates the global copper market  accounting for half of all demand  and an uptick in consumption there following further stimulus is much more relevant to the market  that  together with less mine supply than expected  would support slightly firmer prices  but not the wild frenzy that erupted after the u s  election last week  investors and analysts said   the infrastructure ambitions of trump i think are meaningless in terms of the course and direction of commodities   said scottish hedge fund manager hugh hendry  founder and chief investment officer of eclectica asset management  which has around   million under management   copper prices soared about  percent from the start of the month to a peak of    a ton last friday  but have since retreated to    by wednesday   still nearly a fifth higher since the start of   experts brush off the impact on copper of plans by the incoming u s  president to spend   trillion over  years on building infrastructure  even as they are more upbeat on the plan s impact on the u s  steel sector  unlike copper  steel prices are set regionally  and an infrastructure spending spree coupled with even stronger trade protectionism would initially be a big boost for the u s  steel market  even though longer term the fear is that steel price inflation will cripple demand growth  copper consumption in the united states has slid  percent over the past  years to   million tonnes last year  according to the u s  geological survey   that compares to  million in china  thomson reuters gfms data shows   even an assumed  percent increase in infrastructure related copper consumption would hardly matter on a global scale   said analyst carsten menke at julius baer in switzerland   this is not least due to the fact that part of the increase in copper demand would be met by increasing recycling  considering that existing infrastructure would be replaced rather than expanded   a position paper by trump s advisors about his infrastructure plans  bit ly   published before the election did not mention specific projects  but referred to the broad sweep of possibilities including bridges  airports and digital superhighways   even if trump s infrastructure plan goes ahead  the impact on physical markets is likely to be only modest   said robin bhar  head of metals research at societe generale   if spending goes toward building roads and bridges  this wouldn t be as beneficial for metals demand as extra spending on sectors such as power  transportation and capital infrastructure projects   bhar said in a note  more important is whether stronger demand in china on the back of stimulus earlier this year persists  china s real estate sector is a prime driver of demand for industrial metals including copper  but investment has slowed and builders started fewer new homes year on year in september  the first such decline since december    these are lead indicators for copper demand by six to  months  but have clearly turned sharply negative   liberum analyst richard knights said in a note  hendry  although dismissing the impact of infrastructure spending on commodities  says a wider fiscal stimulus could boost overall economic growth and give the sector a lift   a trillion plus tax cuts are not  meaningless  and would certainly seem to be the first dramatic and politically supported step   he told the reuters global investment outlook summit   that s a world where commodities  you have to imagine  retain their outperformance
