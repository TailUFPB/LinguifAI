  this november  story has been refiled to clarify that keyes comment in  paragraph from end was said in jest  by andy sullivan and michelle conlin washington  reuters    in a bitterly divisive presidential election  at least one thing united u s  voters  a feeling that the country s economic and political systems were tilted against them  a reuters ipsos election day poll of   voters found an electorate burning with resentment against wall street  politicians and the news media  increasingly alienated from a country that is changing in ways it doesn t like  this sense of alienation transcended partisan boundaries  uniting supporters of republican victor donald trump and his  democratic rival  hillary clinton   this is rage against the machine   said carrie sheridan  a former supporter of democratic president barack obama  as fellow trump supporters celebrated the real estate mogul s victory early wednesday by pouring champagne on each other at his   million luxury hotel near the white house  some  percent of poll respondents  republicans and democrats alike  agreed that the country needs a  strong leader  to take the country back from the rich and powerful   seven out of ten agreed that the economy is  rigged  to benefit wealthy insiders  most backed the notion that their leaders were out of touch   percent of trump supporters and  percent of clinton supporters agreed that traditional politicians didn t care about people like them   graphic of reuters ipsos poll  tmsnrt rs    this sense of disconnection ran deepest among trump supporters  some  percent agreed with the idea that  more and more  i don t identify with what america has become   while  percent said they felt like strangers in their own country  most clinton supporters said they didn t share those sentiments  nine out of ten trump supporters said mainstream media is more interested in making money than telling the truth   trump  who travels in his own  jet  might seem like an unlikely candidate to benefit from this anti elite sentiment   but by  p m  eastern time  lines had formed at the velvet ropes by  p m  eastern time outside trump s new hotel in between the white house and the u s  capitol  where a steak costs   and wine is sold by the spoonful    these are shadow voters  voters who have never voted before   said preston parry    who was watching the results with a throng of friends  all of them wearing suits and trump campaign trucker hats  despite his gilded lifestyle  trump capitalized on working class fears of a rapidly changing country  styling himself as a  blue collar billionaire   he promised to bring back manufacturing jobs back to forgotten factory towns and sharply curtail immigration   he drew overwhelming support from white working class voters in rust belt states like ohio and pennsylvania  winning enough states to capture the white house even as he lost the popular vote  trump s scathing characterization of clinton as a corrupt career politician also resonated in an year when many voters said they were primarily casting a vote against one of the candidates  some  percent of trump supporters said they backed him because they didn t want clinton to win  while  percent of clinton supporters said they were motivated primarily to stop trump from reaching the white house   those who made up their minds in the last week of the campaign were more likely to cite opposition to one of the candidates as their main reason for voting  politicians like clinton are  taking away from what we were as a country and saying we should change because of the people coming in  the immigrants and refugees   said john scherer  a  year old former maintenance worker in portsmouth  ohio  scherer s sentiments were widely shared by trump supporters  as  percent agreed with the idea that immigrants threaten traditional american beliefs and customs  three quarters of clinton backers  by contrast  said immigrants strengthened u s

while only  percent of clinton supporters agreed  according to the reuters ipsos tracking poll  those figures could quickly turn on their head as the reality of a trump presidency sinks in  across the

over evil    in st  petersburg  florida  cafe owner amanda keyes    said racist and sexist attitudes are going to take many years to overcome   misogyny will continue to bubble through the country but
