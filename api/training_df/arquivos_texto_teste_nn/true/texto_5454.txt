washington  reuters    u s  senate democratic leader charles schumer called on tuesday for an independent probe of what he called potential criminal violations surrounding the resignation of national security adviser michael flynn   speaking to reporters in the u s  capitol  schumer said law enforcement officers should question officials from president donald trump s campaign  transition team and administration staff  including trump himself  about events leading up to flynn s departure on monday  he said flynn  and potentially other trump officials  could have violated federal prohibitions against citizens negotiating with foreign governments or receiving gifts and other benefits without authorization   what i am calling for is an independent investigation with executive authority to pursue potential criminal actions   schumer said   there are potential violations of law here by general flynn and potentially others   flynn quit after only three weeks in the job  following disclosures that he discussed u s  sanctions on russia with moscow s ambassador to the united states before trump took office and later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  schumer appeared unlikely to win support for such a probe from his senate republican colleagues  who expect the scandal to be investigated by the senate intelligence committee    the intelligence committee is already looking at russian involvement in our election     it s highly likely they d want to take a look at this episode  they have the jurisdiction to do it   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters separately  schumer welcomed any involvement by the senate committee but said the panel lacked the prosecutorial powers needed to hold potential wrongdoers fully accountable   he also said that u s  attorney general jeff sessions should recuse himself from any probe of flynn s resignation because of his political ties to trump  schumer said career justice department investigators or an independent counsel could look into whether other trump team members had contact with russia and why the white house did not seek flynn s resignation sooner   any attempt to lie or mislead must be countered by the full force of the law   schumer added   his resignation raises more questions than it answers  and the american people deserve to know the truth
