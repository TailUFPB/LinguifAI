new york  thomson reuters foundation    as a supreme court decision on abortion rights is highly anticipated in the united states  few are as uniquely positioned to assess its impact as reproductive rights attorney kathryn kolbert  who argued the last major abortion case before the high court  in that  challenge  the landmark roe v  wade ruling legalizing abortion survived  but the supreme court allowed for such state regulations as waiting periods  the decision was written by justices sandra day o connor and david souter  who have retired  and justice anthony kennedy  kennedy is seen as pivotal in the current case which picks up  in a sense  where the earlier case  planned parenthood v  casey  left off  this time  the court is deciding if texas has created an undue burden for women by imposing stiff regulations on abortion clinics and doctors  critics say the rules are a backdoor means to restrict access to abortion  known as trap laws  more than half of texas  clinics have closed  leaving fewer than   advocates say  to serve the state of  million people  hardest hit have been rural  poor women for whom distance and cost have put abortions out of reach  they say  supporters of the laws say they protect women s health  however  the regulations require clinics to upgrade to hospital standards and doctors performing abortions to have formal agreements to admit patients to local hospitals   kolbert  who heads the athena center for leadership studies at new york s barnard college  talked with the thomson reuters foundation about the supreme court and abortion rights  she co founded the center for reproductive law and policy  which is representing whole women s health  the chain of clinics challenging the texas regulations  thomson reuters foundation  it seems the issues being addressed in the texas case come out of the casey case  that the regulations are an undue burden  kolbert  the main issue in the case is how the undue burden standard will be interpreted going forward  the whole question comes down to justice kennedy and how he sees that standard  and he frankly is much more in the middle  does he come back to what he articulated in casey  or is he pushed a little bit to the right with the influence of the other justices  for me  the biggest concern is justice o connor  who he clearly listened to  is no longer on the court  trf  what do you think in essence underlies the abortion issue  kolbert  it s an issue that ties together the coalitions on the right  the fundamentalists  the catholics  the people who basically are business conservatives  it s about power  it s about equality  there s a lot of pushback in america still about giving women the ability to go beyond what they are  their life as a wife and mother  which is the culturally dominant view   trf  trap laws are often hard to explain because they seem so benign  kolbert  that s a strategy  those who are writing these restrictions are looking for things that sound reasonable but in practice are incredibly problematic for women  particularly those who have less political power  so young women and poor women are the first that are going to be affected negatively  if you look at every restriction that s been introduced since   they are all under the guise of reasonableness  trf  texas is the case being tested  is it safe to say there are similar situations in other states  kolbert  all over the country  yes  frankly  if this is upheld the same statute will be enacted in  states within three years  that s what makes it so dangerous  trf  what are the possibilities of what the supreme court could do  kolbert  remember the court has got only eight justices right now  so the option is really one of three  we win five to three  which means that we have  justice elena  kagan   justice stephen  breyer   justice sonia  sotomayor   justice ruth  ginsberg and kennedy     kennedy wrote casey  so that s a reasonable assumption  the second possibility is that the court would not make a decision right now and would send the case back for taking of additional evidence     which is what i think of as looking for an out  they could remand the case for a determination of whether or not there are a sufficient number of clinics within the state to handle the excess capacity of women needing abortions that would happen when you close so many clinics  so we could win  there could be an  out  or we could lose  if the court divided four four     then the lower court decision would be upheld  that would be interpreted as a major win for the anti abortion groups  and we would see laws like this in every state in the country  trf  if you had to put your money on any of those three options  which one do you see more likely  kolbert  i certainly hope that we can keep justice kennedy  if not  then i think they ll send it back for more evidence  trf  what s it like to argue a case before the supreme court   kolbert  it s pretty awesome  it s scary  for me though it was all about the women we were representing  it s the doctors and the clinics  the providers who do the hard work  who meet with women facing unintended pregnancies every single day  it was being able to be a spokesperson for them and to explain their plight and explain what they re going through that was the most gratifying part of the job
