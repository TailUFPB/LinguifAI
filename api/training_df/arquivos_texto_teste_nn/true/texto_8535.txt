washington portland  me   reuters    supporters of republican donald trump urged him to get back on message on thursday after a week of dropping opinion poll numbers and a war of words with ranking republicans over his u s  presidential campaign  in response to the criticism  trump pledged to focus more on democratic candidate hillary clinton  who emerged from last week s democratic national convention with a lead in the polls and who has been consistently attacking him as temperamentally unfit for the presidency  at a rally in portland  maine  on thursday  trump kept his attention on trying to undermine clinton s candidacy  he said the fact that she has moved past a scandal over her use of a private email server as president barack obama s secretary of state was  probably the greatest accomplishment that she has ever had in politics   since formally accepting the republican nomination two weeks ago  trump has exasperated many supporters by getting bogged down in a public spat with the parents of an american soldier killed in iraq and some fellow republicans  billionaire investor wilbur ross said he still backed trump  but urged him to stop engaging in exchanges that benefit the democrats and make the real estate mogul s behavior the issue in the campaign   this election is donald s to lose and so far the democrats have been clever about baiting him and he generally has bitten   ross said in an email to reuters late on wednesday  u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  who has endorsed trump but has not received a reciprocal endorsement from the new york businessman in his re election bid  told wtaq radio host jerry bader in green bay  wisconsin  that trump has  had a pretty strange run since the convention    you would think we ought to be focusing on hillary clinton  on all of her deficiencies  she is such a weak candidate that one would think we d be on offense against hillary clinton  and it is distressing that that s not what we re talking about these days   he said  michael caputo  a former trump adviser who still supports him  said trump still has time to right the ship   staying on message is absolutely key   caputo told reuters   after  years of speaking his mind  mr  trump has to understand that the general election for president of the united states is all about staying on message   actor and director clint eastwood  a prominent celebrity supporter of the republican party who appeared at its  u s  presidential nominating convention  offered an alternative view  saying trump says some  dumb things  but that americans should get over it   he s onto something because secretly everybody s getting tired of political correctness  kissing up   the acclaimed actor and director told esquire magazine   that s the kiss ass generation we re in right now   at the same time  trump s lukewarm support for the nato alliance drew criticism from  national security experts from both democratic and republican administrations   we find trump s comments to be reckless  dangerous  and extremely unwise   they wrote in a statement  obama  at a pentagon news conference  dismissed trump s statements that the election could be  rigged  against him   of course  the elections will not be rigged   he said  trump s rough patch has contributed to a dip in support in some battleground states  a wbur massinc poll in new hampshire showed clinton leading trump   percent to  percent  other polls showed trump down  percentage points to clinton in pennsylvania and  percentage points in florida  two states that are important to his chances of winning the election  trump s troubles are emboldening democrats to think big  speaking with reporters after a clinton campaign event in las vegas  u s  senator harry reid  the senate democratic leader  said he believed traditionally republican leaning states such as arizona and georgia are going to be competitive this election  and he expects clinton to campaign there  in portland  some people at trump s rally said the candidate should stop getting distracted   i don t like how he gets off track   said bill devine    of bath  maine   he needs to stay focused on his campaign   trump campaign manager paul manafort told cbs s  this morning  that the campaign is comfortable where it stands now and said the news media have built a false narrative in which democrats are controlling the race to the nov   election  manafort said that trump s dropping poll numbers  were expected  and that he expected the numbers to even out soon   the framework of this election favors donald trump  if we run the campaign that we plan on running  we think we re going to win   he said   concern about trump has spilled into at least one congressional race  u s  representative mike coffman  a colorado republican  has released a campaign ad in his own re election bid promising to  stand up  to trump if trump is elected   people ask me   what do you think about trump   honestly  i don t care for him much  and i certainly don t trust hillary   coffman said in the ad  u s  representative charlie dent  a pennsylvania republican  told msnbc he could not endorse trump because of  all these unforced errors  that trump was making   it just seems that he s  at times  hell bent on losing a very winnable election to a very seriously flawed candidate  hillary clinton   dent said
