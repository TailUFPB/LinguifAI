toledo  ohio  winston salem  n c   reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump criticized democrat hillary clinton on thursday over her trade policies  saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should  just cancel the election  and name him the victor   speaking to supporters in toledo  ohio  trump said the north american free trade agreement signed by clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  had led to the outsourcing of thousands of ohio jobs to mexico  a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on nov     we should just cancel the election and just give it to trump  right   he said   what are we even having it for  her policies are so bad   trump said he believed clinton would seek passage of the  nation trans pacific partnership  president barack obama s signature asian trade deal  which she now opposes  trump s remarks came as the new york businessman tries to steady rocky poll numbers amid a series of controversies and self inflicted wounds   he has struggled to handle the fallout from the release of a   access hollywood  video that showed the then reality tv star talking on an open microphone about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman  the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife  melania  trump said on thursday it was  certainly illegal  for nbc to release the tape and he left open the option of seeking legal action against the network after the election  since the video s release  a series of women have accused trump of groping them or kissing them without their consent  trump has called the allegations  absolutely false   the latest realclearpolitics poll average showed clinton with a nearly  point national lead over trump  fueled by declining support among women for his candidacy  trump  without evidence  has blamed his sagging poll numbers on a rigged election  and said the media had fixed the opinion polls in order to inflate clinton s numbers  numerous studies have shown that voter fraud in u s  elections is very rare  and a number of prominent republicans have denounced trump s claim that the system is unsound  while trump campaigned in  ohio  a plane carrying his running mate  indiana governor mike pence  skidded off the runway after landing at new york city s laguardia airport on thursday night  there were no injuries  the pence campaign said  clinton on thursday made her first joint campaign appearance with one of her most powerful supporters  first lady michelle obama  at a north carolina rally to urge young people and women to vote  clinton  a former first lady who lost the  democratic nomination to then u s  senator barack obama before becoming his secretary of state  praised michelle obama for standing up for the rights of girls and women worldwide  drawing a sharp contrast with her republican rival   i wish i didn t have to say this      but indeed  dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election   clinton told a crowd of about     and i want to thank our first lady for her eloquent  powerful defense of that basic value   michelle obama s stinging denunciation of trump after a leaked  video showed him making lewd remarks and bragging about groping women was seen by many as one of the campaign s most striking condemnations of the new york businessman  without naming trump  obama took him to task again in north carolina  asking the crowd which candidate they wanted to represent their daughters from the white house   we want a president who takes this job seriously  and has the temperament and maturity to do it well  someone who is steady  someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes   obama said    i would not be here lying to you  i believe with all of my heart that hillary clinton will be that president   she said  although michelle obama was critical of clinton during the hard fought  democratic nominating race  any trace of bitterness appeared long behind them  the two women showed an easy rapport  they embraced and smiled  obama called clinton  my girl  and made a point of telling the crowd they were tight   if people wonder  yes  hillary clinton is my friend   she said  clinton promised to take good care of obama s white house vegetable garden if she won and wistfully praised the athletic first lady s dancing skills   one could only hope   clinton said  she also lauded obama s work for children and military families and in what was perhaps a nod to african americans she hopes will vote for her in the state  said obama had faced challenges she had not as a presidential spouse   let s be real  as our first african american first lady  she s faced pressures i never did  and she s handled them with pure grace   clinton said to applause  although a sometimes reluctant campaigner  the first lady has thrown herself into the race  and the clinton campaign has deployed her strategically to increase support among young people and blacks  with whom she is especially popular
