 washington  reuters    when president barack obama entered the white house in   the federal appeals court based in virginia was known as one of the most conservative benches in the country   two obama terms later  democratic appointees hold a   majority on the  u s  circuit court of appeals  a panel of which issued a groundbreaking ruling this april backing transgender rights   factbox  cases where obama judges left a mark the shift to the left on the court  which hears cases from virginia  maryland  west virginia  south carolina and north carolina  highlights a widely overlooked aspect of obama s legacy   his appointments of dozens of judges to the country s influential federal appeals courts have tilted the judiciary in a liberal direction that will influence rulings for years to come and be further entrenched if democrat hillary clinton wins this november s presidential election   more from reuters election  live  who is the better president for minority voters   bolivia says deputy interior minister killed after kidnap by miners judge orders search of clinton emails from  benghazi attack by september  a reuters review of rulings by the courts over the last two years shows obama s appointees to the appeals courts have influenced major legal battles likely to ultimately reach the supreme court   obama appointed judges have voted in favor of broad civil rights protections  major obama administration regulations and gun regulations and against republican backed voting rules   when seeking to appoint judges  the white house has said it is looking for highly credentialed lawyers reflecting the diversity of u s  society  conservative critics say he has picked judges who are willing to circumvent the law in order to reach preferred outcomes    there s no question president obama s nominees have absolutely been part of his effort to transform the country and move it dramatically to the left   said carrie severino  a conservative legal activist   white house spokesman eric schultz said in a statement that obama s appointees  all share impeccable qualifications  unquestioned integrity  and a steadfast commitment to equal justice under the law    the appeals courts are the first stop for any case appealed from the lower u s  district courts and often have the last word  the next and final destination is the supreme court  but it hears fewer than  cases a year  the appeals courts handle   a year according to the administrative office of the u s  courts   of the  appeals courts  nine now have a majority of democratic appointees  compared with one when obama took office  according to research carried out by russell wheeler  a scholar at the brookings institution  a washington think tank   in addition to appointing two supreme court justices and dozens of district court judges  obama appointments now make up  of the current  appeals court judges  according to the judiciary  obama s current total of  district and appeals court appointments  most of them district court judges  is similar to the tallies achieved by other recent two term presidents   the regional appeals courts are currently more powerful than ever because of the vacancy on the supreme court caused by the death of justice antonin scalia  which has left the court divided equally between liberals and conservatives  if the ideologically divided court splits    the appeals court ruling is left intact  such an outcome occurred four times in the supreme court term that recently ended   scalia s seat is unlikely to be filled until next year due to political opposition from republicans in the senate  which has the job of confirming nominees   one of the most dramatic transformations has been on the  circuit   in july    months before obama became president  republican appointees held a   majority  through a mix of seven obama appointments and retirements  democratic appointees now hold sway   in april  a three judge panel featuring two obama appointees ruled in favor of a transgender student seeking to use a boys  restroom  the two obama appointees were in the majority  with a republican appointee dissenting   three months later  a three judge panel featuring two obama appointees and one judge appointed by democratic president bill clinton struck down north carolina s strict voter identification law on a   vote  saying the state legislature had enacted it with discriminatory intent   it is one of several recent court rulings pushing back on republican led efforts to impose new voting regulations  which democrats say is intended to deter minorities from voting   caroline fredrickson  president of liberal legal group the american constitution society  said republican appointed judges are generally less likely to rule in favor of broad interpretations of civil rights  the transgender case would  very likely  have come out differently with a more conservative panel of judges  she said   the federal appeals court in washington  d c  is another where the balance of power has been flipped  often known in legal circles as the second highest court in the land because it hears important cases concerning the federal government  the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit was dominated by conservatives   when obama took office   obama was able to force through four appointments after a major showdown in the senate  the court now has a   split in favor of democratic appointees   in june  an obama appointee  judge sri srinivasan  cast the deciding vote as a three judge panel upheld the federal communication commission s so called  net neutrality  regulation  srinivasan joined a clinton appointee in the majority  a judge appointed by republican president ronald reagan dissented  the regulation is widely opposed by the telecommunications industry and backed by digital rights advocates   obama s appointees do sometimes vote in favor of conservative outcomes  paul watford  a judge on the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals  has on several occasions reached a different conclusion to his more liberal colleagues  in one recent decision from aug    he dissented along with conservative judges when the court ruled that a death row inmate should be able to file a new appeal   when announcing three of his nominees to the appeals court in washington at a white house press conference in june   obama rejected any notion that they were political pawns  emphasizing their strong credentials    these are no slouches  these are no hacks   he said
