 reuters    u s  republican donald trump overhauled his presidential campaign team on wednesday for the second time in less than two months  hiring the head of a conservative news website to bolster his combative image and try to reverse poor opinion poll numbers  trump named steve bannon  head of the breitbart news website  as campaign chief executive officer  a new position  he also promoted senior adviser kellyanne conway to the post of campaign manager   the latest shake up combines bannon  a conservative flamethrower  with conway  a measured  data driven analyst who might be able to broaden trump s appeal to women and independent voters      it offers trump s team a chance to return to the  let trump be trump  style practiced by former campaign manager corey lewandowski that helped trump  who has never held elective office  win the republican presidential nomination for the nov   election      lewandowski  ousted in the last campaign reorganization in june  said on cnn that bannon was  a street fighter  like himself  a trump campaign statement announcing the changes touted a bloomberg politics article that branded bannon  the most dangerous political operative in america    whether that style will work in the fight against democratic nominee hillary clinton is unclear  trump  a new york real estate developer and former reality tv host  has largely been unable to extend his reach beyond white middle class voters who pack his rallies  trump trails clinton in national opinion polls and in many battleground states  potentially facing a big defeat that could also cost republicans congressional races          trump  who relishes revving up crowds with off the cuff remarks  drew criticism for comments insulting women  muslims and mexican immigrants during the primary campaign for the republican nomination   he has since faced a barrage of criticism from republicans over his campaign style and his refusal to stick to a policy message  in particular  he has been rebuked for his prolonged feud with the family of a muslim u s  army captain who was killed in the iraq war   on wednesday afternoon  trump received his first intelligence briefing from the office of the director of national intelligence  retired u s  lieutenant general michael flynn  a trump adviser who attended the briefing at the new york field office of the federal bureau of investigation  said the officials who conducted the two hour session were  absolutely professional  and that it was  a great conversation   intelligence officials brief the major party u s  presidential candidates on foreign policy and national security issues but do not disclose ultra sensitive information about ongoing u s  undercover operations  methods or the identities of intelligence sources  wednesday s campaign appointments amounted to a demotion for paul manafort  who was brought on as campaign manager in june to bring a more professional touch to trump s campaign but has struggled to get the businessman to rein in his freewheeling ways      clinton  a former secretary of state who has called trump temperamentally unsuited for the white house  said staff shake ups did nothing to change the candidate and his rhetoric   donald trump has shown us who he is  he can hire and fire anybody he wants from his campaign  they can make him read new words from a teleprompter  but he is still the same man who insults gold star families  demeans women  mocks people with disabilities and thinks he knows more about isis than our generals   she told a rally in ohio  conway and bannon may prove to be opposing forces in trump s campaign  conway is analytical and numbers driven and often offers a more pragmatic approach to winning campaigns  she is expected to travel with trump  bannon likes to push the limits of polite conversation and revels in taking the fight up a notch  strategists say   for steve and i  we also recognize that we are different when we say we have different styles  but we have one vision   conway told reporters   bannon was a key figure in producing and promoting a movie called  clinton cash  that accused bill and hillary clinton of doing favors for high dollar donors to the clinton foundation charity  a theme that trump has been touching on in his campaign speeches   my guess is bannon will be a bull in a china shop and conway will be focused on messaging and paid media   said republican strategist matt mackowiak  the appointment of bannon suggested trump was aiming not to tone down his aggressive style but to be more disciplined in emphasizing themes that resonate strongly with the voters he is trying to court  such as his tough stance against illegal immigration and withering personal criticism of clinton   i am who i am  i don t want to change   trump told wisconsin television station wktb on tuesday   if you start pivoting  you re not being honest with people   the shift to new leadership may not be a good sign at this stage of a campaign  but some republican strategists said it was not too late for trump   i ve thought for a while that they ve needed more smart  senior people and it looks like they just got them   said republican strategist charlie black   it s only the middle of august  this race is going to be close in the end  but he does need to tighten up his performance   conway told fox news she was advising trump to take  his case directly to the people    with donald trump  he is still his own best messenger because people see him as very authentic    she has worked to improve the republican party s standing with women voters and to push back on democratic accusations that republicans are waging a  war on women    manafort drew unwelcome attention this week when the new york times reported his name was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than   million from a ukrainian political party with close ties to russia  manafort denied any impropriety on monday  the current realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton six percentage points ahead of trump  at   percent to his   percent
