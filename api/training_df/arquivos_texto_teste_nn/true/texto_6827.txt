warsaw  indiana washington  reuters    when donald trump takes over as president on jan    one of the first business tax breaks he delivers is likely to go to the u s  medical device industry and companies like mark throdahl s  the chief executive of orthopediatrics corp  based in northern indiana  said his company has been able to hire more workers since the temporary suspension effective last january of a federal tax on medical devices  the tax was imposed as part of outgoing president barack obama s signature  healthcare law  throdahl said he hopes the incoming republican led congress and president will permanently repeal the tax  trump and u s  lawmakers are likely to do that  according to lawmakers  lobbyists and industry executives  in a step that also would help larger medical device makers such as medtronic inc  boston scientific  st  jude medical inc and johnson   johnson  tax cuts are republican gospel  and trump s new republican administration is widely expected to make them happen  the medical device tax may be one of the first on the chopping block  it was first imposed in january  as a funding mechanism for the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans  but republicans hate obamacare and this particular tax has powerful enemies in both parties  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said repealing the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  will be the first order of business in the senate when it convenes in january  whether cutting taxes  including the one on medical devices  will deliver more jobs remains to be seen  the congressional research service  a nonpartisan arm of congress  said in january   when the medical device tax was fully in effect  that it was having only  fairly minor  impact on production of devices and employment in the industry  that may not matter much  as republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly try to link tax cuts to job creation  perhaps sensing this connection will resonate with trump  who made big promises in his campaign about restoring u s  industrial employment  the medical device industry  in its long running assault on the device tax  is seeking to frame the fight as a jobs issue  immediately after trump s nov   election victory  industry lobbying group advamed wrote to him and vice president elect mike pence  indiana s governor  asking for permanent repeal of the tax  in the letter  advamed president scott whitaker wrote   the medical device tax has been a significant drag on medical innovation  and resulted in the loss or deferred creation of jobs  reduced research spending  and slowed capital expansion   industry complaints like these led congress last year to temporarily suspend the   percent excise tax on the sale of non retail medical devices  such as pacemakers  heart valves and artificial hips  it had been in effect for only three years  orthopediatrics  founded in   develops and markets implantable orthopedic devices  such as metal plates that can be attached to bones  to treat deformities and traumatic injuries in children  it has  employees in its warsaw  indiana headquarters  and  sales representatives around the united states  when the tax was in full effect  throdahl said  orthopediatrics  had almost a headcount freeze during   because of the revenue that was siphoned away by the tax  since the tax s temporary suspension  he said   we ve resumed an aggressive pace of hiring and investment   there are about   u s  based medical device manufacturers  the industry accounts for about   u s  jobs and has   billion in direct sales  advamed spokesman mark brager said  indiana is home to several device companies  so are minnesota  california and massachusetts  lawmakers from these states helped push through the temporary suspension of the device tax  repealing the tax would further improve the already favorable tax profile of medtronic  one of the largest u s  medical device companies  two years ago  medtronic did an  inversion  deal  which is when a u s  company shifts its home base to another country  at least on paper  to cut its tax bills  medtronic is now technically based in ireland  though it is still managed in minnesota  asked whether medtronic expects the tax to be repealed  company spokesman fernando vivanco said   it s much too early to speculate on future tax policy   republicans said the industry has little reason to fear that the tax will ever return  senator john barrasso  a member of the senate republican leadership  said obamacare repeal legislation will move next year in a way that will circumvent expected democratic resistance   the plan is to move the entire piece that we moved last year   barrasso said  referring to republican backed repeal legislation that ultimately was vetoed by obama   and it did include the medical device repeal  so i would expect that to be part of the list as well  it s to repeal the taxes related to obamacare   barrasso added  j c  scott  head of government affairs at advamed  said companies  feel a great sense of urgency in trying to get complete repeal done early next year  rather than later in the year  because companies need certainty   repealing the tax would worsen the federal budget deficit   any time you repeal a tax  that is a loss of revenue to the federal government   said jack hoadley  a research professor at georgetown university s health policy institute  but this tax was never a big one  relatively speaking  when imposed  it raised barely    billion a year  less than expected  by comparison  federal tax subsidies to help people obtain health insurance under obamacare in  were estimated to be   billion  the congressional budget office said  ever since the tax was put on hold  it has been viewed as endangered   at the time it was suspended  we were told by people in washington that in all probability it will not be reinstituted  but still  we ll all sleep better at night knowing that it s gone   orthopediatrics ceo throdahl said
