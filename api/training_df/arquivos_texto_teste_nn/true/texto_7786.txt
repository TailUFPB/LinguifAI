new york  reuters    a senior state department official sought to shield hillary clinton last year by pressuring the fbi to drop its insistence that an email on the private server she used while secretary of state contained classified information  according to records of interviews with fbi officials released on monday  the accusation against patrick kennedy  the state department s most senior manager  appears in the latest release of interview summaries from the federal bureau of investigation s year long investigation into clinton s sending and receiving classified government secrets via her unauthorized server   although the fbi decided against declassifying the email s contents  the claim of interference added fuel to republicans  belief that officials in president barack obama s administration have sought to protect clinton  a democrat  from criminal liability as she seeks to succeed obama in the nov   election  the fbi recommended against bringing any charges in july and has defended the integrity of its investigation  clinton has said her decision to use a private server in her home for her work as the u s  secretary of state from  to  was a mistake and has apologized  one fbi official  whose name is redacted  told investigators that kennedy repeatedly  pressured  the various officials at the fbi to declassify information in one of clinton s emails  the email was about the deadly  attack on a u s  compound in benghazi  libya  and included information that originated from the fbi  which meant that the fbi had final say on whether it would remain classified  a state department spokesman  mark toner  said kennedy was not pressuring the fbi but was just trying to understand better how the fbi s classification process worked  the dispute began in the summer of  as officials were busy reviewing the roughly   emails clinton returned to the state department ahead of their court ordered public release in batches in  and   the official said the state department s office of legal counsel called him to question the fbi s ruling that the information was classified  but the fbi stood by its decision  soon after that call  one of the official s fbi colleagues received a call from kennedy in which kennedy  asked his assistance in altering the email s classification in exchange for a  quid pro quo     the fbi official said he also joined at least two discussions in which kennedy  continued to pressure  the fbi about the email  the official said kennedy appeared to be trying to protect clinton by minimizing the appearance of classified information in emails from the server that clinton used while she was the country s most senior diplomat  in a separate interview summary among the  pages released on monday  another unnamed fbi official confirmed a discussion of a  quid pro quo   he said kennedy told him in a phone call that the fbi s classification of the email  caused problems  for kennedy  the official said he told kennedy he would look into the email  which he had not yet seen  if the state department would consider allowing more fbi agents to be posted in iraq in exchange   the state department and the fbi both confirmed that a conversation about the email s classification and an increase in fbi slots in iraq took place  but both agencies said there was no  quid pro quo   after a year long fbi investigation into the server  fbi director james comey said in july he found that while laws governing classified information may have been broken no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges  he said  however  that clinton and her staff had been  extremely careless  in handling information that had been classified to protect national security  toner  the state department spokesman  said there was  no quid pro quo   and told reporters that it was the fbi official who raised the possibility with kennedy of allowing more agents in iraq during the conversation about the email   after the conversation took place about the upgrading classification  at the end of that  there was a kind of   oh  by the way  hey  we re looking at how we want more slots  in iraq  toner said  calling it a  clear pivot  in the topic of conversation   no increase in fbi iraq slots resulted from this conversation   he said  the fbi also confirmed both topics were raised in the same conversation  and that the fbi official who discussed the email and iraq with kennedy had since retired   although there was never a quid pro quo  these allegations were nonetheless referred to the appropriate officials for review   the fbi said in its statement  which did not say what the outcome of the review was  other officials have made similar complaints to investigators of unusual pressure not to mark information as classified in clinton s emails last year  according to earlier documents the fbi released last month  at least one official at the state department told investigators that there was pressure by senior department officials to mislead the public about the presence of classified information in clinton s emails ahead of their public release  a summary released on monday showed at least two other state department officials making similar allegations   one official who worked in the state department s office that deals with freedom of information act requests told investigators they felt  intimidated  by senior department officials if they suggested that any of clinton s emails on benghazi contained classified information  and named kennedy as one of the officials who pressured  employees to not label anything as classified   the state department has said these allegations are also false  ultimately  the fbi told kennedy that declassification was not possible  according to the interview summaries  and the state department posted it online last year marked as classified  with heavy redactions  clinton s republican rival for the white house  donald trump  posted a video online on monday in which he said the fbi documents showed  corruption at the highest levels    this is collusion between the fbi  department of justice and the state department to try and make hillary clinton look like an innocent person when she s guilty of very high crimes   trump said   later on monday  trump proposed a series of ethics rules he said would crack down on government corruption  including a five year ban on former administration officials lobbying after leaving government and a lifetime ban on senior officials lobbying for foreign governments   he said former president bill clinton had a five year lobbying ban but lifted it at the end of his administration   obama put his own  revolving door  rules in place at the beginning of his time in office  several republican lawmakers called on obama to investigate kennedy and remove him from the department  toner of the state department said kennedy  has the full confidence  of john kerry  clinton s successor as secretary of state  reince priebus  the republican national committee s chairman  said in a statement that obama  who is campaigning for clinton to become his successor as president  was trying to  shield  clinton and that she  cannot be trusted  with classified information  paul ryan  the top elected republican in the u s  congress  referred to the fbi summaries on twitter   this bears all the signs of a cover up   he wrote  in   clinton repeatedly said she never sent or received classified information via her server  but since the release of the fbi report in july she has said she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the department  robby mook  her campaign manager  downplayed the account from the fbi interview summary  telling reporters it was  not uncommon for officials within a department to fight over classification
