farnborough  england  reuters    the u s  air force has developed a new framework for assessing the resilience of its satellites that should allow it to start the acquisition process for more military communication and missile detection satellites this autumn  a senior official said at the farnborough airshow this week  lockheed martin  boeing co  northrop grumman corp and raytheon co are keeping a close eye on these satellite programs  which could be worth billions of dollars and represent the first big new business opportunities in the military space market for some time  u s  officials have grown increasingly concerned about the need to protect their military satellites   which are critical to being able to identify targets  navigate  communicate and operate drones   given the growing use of electronic jammers and other threats  winston beauchamp  the u s  air force deputy undersecretary for space  told reuters that officials had developed a new set of criteria over the past year to help military leaders determine their options for more satellites  the air force had previously looked at the options for follow on satellites in both programs but until now had not included specific criteria for their resilience  or their ability to operate in the face of  hostile action or adverse conditions   such as electromagnetic interference  beauchamp said senior pentagon leaders last week endorsed the work done so far on the framework and further work planned before it is presented to defense secretary ash carter for approval in the fall  once that decision is made  the air force hopes to begin the long awaited acquisition process to buy follow on satellites for the advanced extremely high frequency  aehf  system built by lockheed martin for protected satellite communications  and new missile warning satellites  also currently built by lockheed under the space based infrared system  sbirs  program  work was already underway on the acquisition strategy for each of the two programs so they could begin shortly after the resilience decision this autumn  beauchamp said  the u s  air force was also focused on increasing coordination and planning among allies for its space operations  as well as more multilateral wargaming and work on developing rules of engagement and joint concepts of operations   we are thinking more broadly about how to conduct operations in a joint manner   beauchamp said   in the past it was tacked on at the end  but we d like to find a way to shift the planning to the left in a number of areas
