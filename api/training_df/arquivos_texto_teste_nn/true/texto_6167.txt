 reuters    donald trump  a big supporter of the u s  oil  gas and coal industries  has promised to get to work quickly after being sworn in as president of the united states  raising expectations that he will sign a slew of executive orders  here are some of the executive actions and other maneuvers that could come quickly  related to energy  the environment and climate change  trump  a republican  has promised to kill democratic predecessor barack obama s clean power plan  which requires states to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants  he has a few options to do so  some simpler than others  the plan is being challenged by  of the  states in court  so one option is to order the justice department to stop defending it   effectively giving the plaintiffs a win  trump could also seek a  voluntary remand  asking the court to send the rule back to the environmental protection agency for review  the problem is that attorneys general from states like new york and california  as well as environmental groups  would likely step into the gap and defend the rule  another possibility would be to order the epa not to enforce the rule  that  too  could open the door to lawsuits   a third option would be for trump s administration to try to issue a new regulation  withdrawing  the clean power plan  even if it is upheld in the courts  according to the american energy alliance  an industry group that helped advise trump s energy transition team  that move may not be a fast one  the clean power plan  finalized in   was the centerpiece of obama s broader climate change strategy  the waters of the u s  rule  which seeks to clarify which waterways fall under federal environmental protection  has been mentioned repeatedly by trump as a regulation he hopes to overturn  the rule is also being challenged in court  legal experts say trump s options here are similar  and one of the most elegant ways to overturn the rule would be through a voluntary remand  a legal vehicle that would ask the court to return the rule to the epa for review  that would then give trump s administration the ability to kill or revise the rule  but could also draw some lawsuits from democratic attorneys general and environmental groups that want the rule preserved   trump has promised to ask transcanada corp  trp to  to resubmit its application to build the keystone xl pipeline  a project to pipe more canadian oil sands crude into the united states that was rejected by the obama administration after years of environmental lobbying against it  while the invitation to resubmit could come quickly  it is unclear whether transcanada would seek to revive the project given that oil prices are far lower now than they were when the company initially pursued it   trump may also seek to issue an order to undo a guidance issued last august by the white house council on environmental quality that requires federal agencies to quantify greenhouse gas emissions and factor in impacts on climate change while evaluating projects like pipelines  the council had updated the decades old national environmental policy act to include the greenhouse gas update  trump could sign an executive order approving the dakota access pipeline in north dakota  or order the acting secretary of the army to approve the project  according to brigham mccown  former head of the u s  pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration under president george w  bush  however  such a move would be highly unpopular among pipeline opponents who have camped out at the construction site for months  leaders from the standing rock sioux tribe  which led the protests over worries the pipeline would threaten water quality  have vowed to challenge any executive action  the pipeline is owned by energy transfer partners lp  etp n    one little known tool used by the obama administration to support its regulations curbing carbon emissions is the  social cost of carbon   a calculation made by a panel of technical experts to place a dollar value on the public harm caused by carbon dioxide emissions  the calculation is used in the rule making cost benefit analysis   the current cost of carbon is put at   per tonne  which will rise to   by   the american energy alliance believes that trump could immediately order government agencies to end the use of the social cost of carbon  which could help it unravel a number of obama s other anti carbon regulations  trump could immediately lift the department of interior s moratorium on coal leasing on federal land  which the department enacted last year as it sought to review the program and evaluate whether the government adequately priced the value of coal extracted from public land on behalf of the taxpayer  lifting the moratorium would improve industry access to vast coal deposits remaining in the powder river basin  reversing some of obama s more recent moves to put federal acreage off limits to drilling could be more complicated  obama designated around   million acres of federal lands in utah and nevada as monuments  using a tough to overturn law called the antiquities act  he also permanently protected areas of the offshore arctic and atlantic using another law that legal experts say would be a challenge to overturn  the obama administration finalized a couple of environmental regulations in its last weeks in office that are likely to be quickly overturned  including the bureau of land management methane rule and the streams protection act  congressional leaders said they would target those rules under the congressional review act  which allows lawmakers to use a simple majority vote to rescind a regulation within  legislative days of publication   the methane rule limits methane emissions from energy installations on federal land  while the streams protection act protects waterways from coal mining runoff  some other rules  affecting the agriculture industry  could also fit in this category  they include the u s  department of agriculture s final rule regarding production requirements for organic livestock and poultry  establishing minimum indoor and outdoor space requirements for chickens  during his campaign for the white house  trump said he would pull the united states out of the paris climate agreement within  days of taking office  the accord  signed by nearly  countries last year  is intended to curb global warming by slashing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  since his november election  trump has softened his stance slightly  telling the new york times he would keep an open mind about the deal  nonetheless  the former new york businessman has been advised by his team about swift options he could take to end u s  participation in the accord  including issuing a presidential order simply deleting the u s  signature from the accord
