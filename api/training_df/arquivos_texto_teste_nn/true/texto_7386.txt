washington  reuters    president elect donald trump will have an early capitol hill honeymoon with republican majorities in both chambers of congress when he takes office in january  but a long term romance may be more challenging  a president whose party controls both the senate and house of representatives can generally count on getting things done fairly quickly  and trump likely will not be an exception  despite starting with unusual handicaps  many republicans in congress only backed trump after he became the candidate  some never fell in line  he offended and attacked others while running as a washington outsider  including house of representatives speaker paul ryan  who did not campaign with him  on top of that  the new york real estate businessman and former reality television celebrity  who will head the world s most powerful government and largest economy  has no governing experience  on wednesday  party leaders were quick to back the victor   and they are expected to find more common ground than differences once he takes office   donald trump will lead a unified republican government   ryan told a news conference in his home state  wisconsin  promising to  work hand in hand   ryan said his relationship with trump  is fine   the transition is under way  and he has already spoken to the president elect twice  and to his running mate  indiana governor mike pence  a former house member   most of the things he s likely to advocate  we re going to be enthusiastically for   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told a news conference on capitol hill  trump and republican leaders in congress agree on one major policy  they want to repeal democratic president barack obama s landmark obamacare healthcare law  enacted in   ryan and mcconnell both pledged to deal quickly with the law  they will also move quickly to confirm a trump nominee for the supreme court  after mcconnell refused to consider any obama nominee to replace conservative justice antonin scalia  who died in february  infuriating the white house and senate democrats  other issues might be more contentious within the party  while campaigning  trump spoke extensively about scrapping trade deals and building a wall along the u s   mexico border  but some republicans are skeptical about both those pledges  the party has long been in favor of free trade  and trump s wall scheme would bear a   billion price tag and anger mexico  an important ally and trading partner  mcconnell said on wednesday he wanted to achieve border security in whatever way was most effective  and he said the new president was free to negotiate trade pacts  trump will also have to work with democrats  who made narrow gains on tuesday that reduced the size of the republican majorities in the house and senate  with some votes still being counted  they won a handful of new seats in the house  in the senate  they seemed to secure at least  seats  up from   on wednesday when the new hampshire secretary of state called a close race for new hampshire governor maggie hassan  a democrat  over incumbent republican senator kelly ayotte  although ayotte had not conceded  controlling only  seats  republicans will need democrats to reach the  votes needed to advance most legislation in the  member senate   trump will have to work with a fair number of senate democrats to get things done   said william galston  an expert in governance studies at the brookings institution think tank  one of those things could be infrastructure spending  which trump promised in his victory speech  spending on infrastructure to fuel job growth is popular with lawmakers from both parties  possibly funded by ending a law that lets corporations hold profits offshore without paying u s  taxes on them  house minority leader nancy pelosi called trump wednesday to say she wanted to work with him on a  robust infrastructure jobs bill   and she told her fellow democrats that this should be done very fast   we re not starting a campaign against the republicans right now   pelosi told democratic lawmakers in a conference call  according to a democratic aide  trump s republican critics in congress said they hoped trump would work toward party unity  but they would be watching him   starting today  i will do everything in my power to hold the president to his promises   including fighting to enact term limits and repealing obamacare  senator ben sasse  who opposed trump from the start  said in a statement  repealing obamacare would shake the u s  healthcare and insurance industries  which have broadly called for measured reforms  although not for its full scale elimination  america s health insurance plans  or ahip  a trade association that represents insurers such as anthem inc and cigna corp in washington  said late on tuesday that it would work with any new administration on the issue  trump has called obamacare a  disaster  and vowed to repeal and replace it  house republicans have already voted more than  times to repeal all or part of the law  senate democrats were certain to fight an obamacare rollback  but could be outmaneuvered by republicans at the procedural level with trump s cooperation   it would be a tragedy  and i certainly won t in any way cooperate or work with an effort to take health insurance away   senator angus king  a maine independent who caucuses with democrats  told cnn   trump and congressional republicans will find common ground on taxes  trump generally sees eye to eye with republicans in congress in calling for major tax cuts  including those for the wealthy  although details of their plans are not an exact match  trump has called for cutting the u s  corporate income tax rate to  percent from the current level of  percent  ryan s tax plan proposes going to  percent  trump has also said he wants to do some things as president  such as ban muslims from the country and allow torture in the fight against terrorism  that some legal experts say are legally questionable
