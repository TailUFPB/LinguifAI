washington  reuters    britain s looming exit from the european union is another huge setback for negotiations on a massive u s  eu free trade deal that were already stalled by deeply entrenched differences and growing anti trade sentiment on both sides of the atlantic   the historic divorce launched by thursday s vote will almost certainly further delay substantial progress in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership  ttip  talks as the remaining  eu states sort out their own new relationship with britain  trade experts said on friday   with french and german officials increasingly voicing skepticism about ttip s chances for success  the united kingdom s departure from the deal could sink hopes of a deal before president barack obama leaves office in january   this is yet another reason why ttip will likely be postponed   said heather conley  european program director at the center for strategic and international studies  a think tank in washington   but to be honest  ttip isn t going anywhere  i believe  before  at the earliest   she said  u s  trade representative michael froman said in a statement on friday that he was evaluating the uk decision s impact on ttip  but would continue to engage with both european and uk counterparts       the importance of trade and investment is indisputable in our relationships with both the european union and the united kingdom   froman said   the economic and strategic rationale for t tip remains strong   ttip negotiators are still expected to meet in brussels in mid july as scheduled  but those talks were aimed at focusing on less controversial issues while leaving the thorniest disagreements for u s  and eu political leaders to resolve  and it is unclear when britain will launch formal separation proceedings  which will take at least two years  but analysts said both sides have been reluctant to put their best offers on the table with a new u s  president due to take office in january and french and german leadership elections nearing in   the brexit also will preoccupy eu officials in coming months as they launch their own negotiations with london over the future terms of uk eu trade  and sort out their post brexit priorities  said hosuk lee makiyama  director of the european centre for international political economy  a brussels based think tank      britain s departure could leave u s  negotiators facing a european side that is more dug in on some issues  said chad bown  a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics  a think tank in washington   as the uk is part of the coalition of liberal trading economies in the eu  the u s  is losing one of the more like minded countries from the group in brussels sitting on the other side of the negotiating table   said bown  a former world bank economist  however  lee makiyama  who also sees little chance of a deal before   said britain s departure could eliminate one source of disagreement because the uk has insisted on a financial services chapter in the trade deal   the only real proponent of banking regulation in ttip is the uk  germany and france are probably willing to let it go   he said   it still leaves about  outstanding issues at nearly the same level of difficulty   the ttip negotiations  which started three years ago  have unable to settle major differences over agriculture  where the eu side has shown little willingness to alter food safety rules that prohibit american beef raised with hormones or genetically modified foods  or open its closely guarded geographical food naming rules  such as for asiago and feta cheeses  european negotiators have complained that the united states has offered too little to open up its vast federal  state and local government procurement markets to european vendors with  buy american  preferences in place  europe also wants access to key u s  sectors such as maritime transport and aviation  while american negotiators have been frustrated over lack of access to some  european sectors ranging from healthcare to education  the two sides also are far apart on how to resolve disputes  the u s  side favors a traditional binding arbitration approach  while the europeans want a court like system that allows for appeals  more progress has been made on harmonizing regulations for things like car seat belt anchors  clothes labeling and pharmaceutical inspections
