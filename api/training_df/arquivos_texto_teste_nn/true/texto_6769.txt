moscow  reuters    soon after the united states imposed sanctions on moscow in   russian oil tsar igor sechin told a reuters reporter he would miss three things  exploring u s  culture  the chance to show his children american landscapes  and riding motor bikes with exxon mobil chief executive rex tillerson  tillerson is now front runner to be secretary of state in the cabinet of u s  president elect donald trump  and russian officials are relishing the prospect of having someone with long standing ties to russia as the chief u s  diplomat  those same ties   tillerson has met russian president vladimir putin several times and even received a medal from him   are causing disquiet among some policymakers in washington  who see the relationships as a potential liability  few people in moscow expect that the bitter rifts with washington  over syria  ukraine  and nato s presence in eastern europe  will be healed overnight with tillerson at the state department  but his emergence as front runner for the job was seen in moscow as confirmation the trump administration would put aside old enmity and do deals with the kremlin  trump is expected to name tillerson  a  year old texan  as secretary of state  a source familiar with the situation said on saturday  tillerson would join other figures with russia ties already in the trump cabinet      the choice of tillerson is a sensation   said alexei pushkov  a pro kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the russian parliament   this is a businessmen  by definition a pragmatist  who also has lots of experience working with russia    judging by the appointments to the key posts in the administration  trump wants to see a decisive and strong america  but does not see reasons for conflicts with russia   pushkov wrote on twitter  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov was cautious on tillerson s cabinet prospects  saying the appointment had not been confirmed  but he praised his personal qualities   as part of his duties as head of one of the biggest oil companies  he had contacts with our representatives   peskov  said on a conference call with reporters   he carries out his duties in a highly professional way   asked about how close tillerson is to putin  peskov said   they had working meetings  indeed  the president received mr  tillerson several times   though he and putin know each other  the most important relationship tillerson forged in russia is with sechin  one of putin s closest lieutenants  tillerson started coming into regular contact with russian officials when  in january   he was made vice president of an exxon unit involved in exploration projects in russia and the former soviet union  the flagship project was the sakhalin  offshore project in the pacific ocean  exxon was the operator and rosneft  the russian state oil giant headed by sechin  was a major shareholder   he knows this whole sphere excellently   said an oil executive close to rosneft and exxon  who spoke on condition of anonymity   he was involved in the negotiations and the implementation of sakhalin    from the start  and he knows the peculiarities of the russian mind set very well     in   rosneft and exxon deepened their cooperation  signing an agreement on joint development of oil fields in western siberia  putin  tillerson and sechin came together for the signing ceremony  later the same year zeljko runje  who until then had been vice president of exxon s russian operations  moved to rosneft to take up the post of vice president and member of the management board  their next big joint project was launched in june   when they set up a joint venture to explore for oil in the kara sea  in the arctic  and in the black sea  sechin and tillerson both attended the signing ceremony  in the same month  putin awarded tillerson the order of friendship  a russian state honor  the citation said it was for his  significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector    then the ukraine conflict intervened in   testing tillerson s relations with his russian partners  after russia annexed ukraine s crimea region and backed separatist rebels in eastern ukraine  the united states started several rounds of sanctions   tillerson  like other u s  energy ceos under pressure from the white house  stayed away from an annual investors  meeting with putin in st petersburg in june  he sent a senior exxon executive in his place  by august   exxon was poised to start drilling on the kara sea s universitetskaya exploratory well but an imminent fresh round of sanctions could have halted work  according to two offshore drilling sources familiar with the kara sea project  tillerson and his team went into crisis mode  they managed to sign the contract to supply a drilling rig just before one round of sanctions was imposed  giving them some legal breathing space  the exxon managers then pushed through the drilling program in two months before a further round of sanctions eventually knocked it off course  the sources said  they found large reserves of crude  an exxon representative was not immediately available for comment  soon after  obstacles arising from the sanctions forced exxon to suspend its cooperation with rosneft in the kara sea  the project has since been idling  but exxon s russian partners remember its effort to get the well drilled   i think his appointment is favorable for russia   one of the two sources said about tillerson being lined up for secretary of state
