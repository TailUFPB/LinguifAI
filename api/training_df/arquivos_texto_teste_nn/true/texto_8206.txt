new york  reuters    democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on saturday said she regretted saying  half  of republican rival donald trump s supporters belonged in a  basket of deplorables   but made no apologies for calling out  prejudice and paranoia  among trump s campaign and supporters   last night i was  grossly generalistic   and that s never a good idea  i regret saying  half    that was wrong   clinton said in a statement  the day after comments at a fundraiser in new york  but  trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia   she said  adding   i won t stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign   republicans and trump supporters responded fiercely on social media to clinton s remarks at the lgbt fundraiser and the episode threatened to distract from her efforts to paint trump as unqualified for the presidency   but trump on saturday sought to use clinton s comments to make the same charge about her   how can she be president of our country when she has such contempt and disdain for so many great americans   a trump  statement asked   hillary clinton should be ashamed of herself  and this proves beyond a doubt that she is unfit and incapable to serve as president of the united states   he added   at friday night s fundraiser  clinton said trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate for the white house in the nov   election    to just be grossly generalistic  you can put half of trump s supporters into what i call the  basket of deplorables    clinton said   unfortunately there are people like that  and he has lifted them up    some of those were irredeemable  she said  but they did not represent america  the other basket of trump s supporters constituted individuals desperate for change who felt let down by the government and the economy  clinton added   they don t buy everything he says  but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different   clinton said    those are people we have to understand and empathize with  as well   trump s campaign hammered on clinton throughout the day   hillary clinton s low opinion of the people that support this campaign should be denounced in the strongest possible terms   mike pence  the governor of indiana and trump s running mate  said at the values voter summit in washington   so let me just say from the bottom of my heart  hillary  they are not a basket of anything  they are americans  and they deserve your respect   trump  a new york businessman who has never run for political office before  regularly says things that some consider insulting  racist or off color  on friday night  he told supporters in pensacola  florida  that clinton could shoot someone and not be prosecuted   because she s being so protected  she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with   people watching right smack in the middle of the heart and she wouldn t be prosecuted  okay   he said     but clinton s remarks got top billing on twitter where the  hashtag  basketofdeplorables was trending  with shows of  condemnation and support for clinton  twitter user basketeer vendetta  under the account   tweeted a photo of trump supporters wearing campaign t shirts and hats  adding   proud to be part of the  basketofdeplorables with my fellow americans   and trump himself tweeted   wow  hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters  millions of amazing  hard working people  i think it will cost her at the polls   but some twitter users agreed with clinton  referencing  remarks by trump that have been called racist  such as when he described some mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists  clinton s comment could nevertheless end up being a boon to trump   as long as trump stays out of the way and doesn t overshadow hillary s comment  her  basket of deplorables  comment should dominate the media in the coming days and runs the risk of negatively defining her campaign   said republican strategist doug heye  republican strategist ana navarro  who has been highly critical of trump  said clinton might have crossed an important line   when you are running for president  you are running to represent all americans  even the ones you think are deplorable   said navarro  but jamal simmons  a democratic consultant  said the remarks probably would not wrest voters from clinton   we re moving to the part of the election process where there s a lot less persuasion of new voters and more persuasion of the people who like you to turn out and work to elect you   he added  many of clinton s fundraisers have been closed to the media  but not the one on friday night    some critics likened clinton s observation to  republican candidate mitt romney s   percent  comment in which he said  percent of voters are dependent upon the government and would vote for president barack obama no matter what  his campaign struggled to recover after the remark leaked   but democratic strategist jim manley  who supports clinton  pointed out that romney was talking about all voters  and clinton was specifically describing trump supporters
