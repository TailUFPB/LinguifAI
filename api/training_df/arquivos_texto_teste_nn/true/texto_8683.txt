cleveland  reuters    u s  senator ted cruz refused to endorse republican presidential nominee donald trump at the party s convention on wednesday  drawing angry jeers from trump supporters and shattering the facade of party unity that has been carefully built up in cleveland this week  anti trump republican delegate ken cuccinelli told reuters he escorted cruz s wife  heidi  off the floor of the republican national convention out of concern for her safety following her husband s speech  for the third day in a row  what was supposed to be a carefully scripted show of unity was thrown into turmoil by unexpected events that have raised questions about whether the party can unite around trump to defeat the presumptive democratic nominee  hillary clinton  in the nov   election   cruz  who came in a distant second to trump in the race for the republican nomination  stopped short of endorsing trump after a bitter and personal campaign and mentioned him only once  drawing boos and repeated chants of  we want trump   cuccinelli  a former virginia attorney general  said   when the speech ended  there was an ugly crowd behind us   a witness said one person shouted   goldman sachs  at heidi cruz in reference to her employment at the investment bank  cruz began his speech saying   i want to congratulate donald trump on winning the nomination last night    later in the speech  he urged   please  don t stay home in november  stand  and speak  and vote your conscience  vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution   some critics saw the appeal for people to vote their conscience as a vote of no confidence in trump  republican strategist eric fehrnstrom  who is not affiliated with any campaign  tweeted    vote your conscience  was the rallying cry of the never trump movement  for cruz to bring that message into  rnc hall was a colossal error    it s taken me about  minutes to calm down and stop shaking with anger   said erik layton  an alternate delegate from california who had shouted   go home  at cruz after his speech   i just don t know why cruz did this  it baffles my mind   trump    a businessman and former reality tv star who has never been elected to public office  made his entrance to the convention hall near the end of cruz s speech  applauding cruz s remarks but  by his appearance  drawing attention away from his former rival  in a tweet after the convention adjourned for the night  trump wrote that cruz broke a promise they both had made to endorse the party s white house choice   wow  ted cruz got booed off the stage  didn t honor the pledge  i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway  no big deal   trump wrote  during the campaign for the party s nomination  trump insulted cruz s wife s looks and suggested the texan s father was with john f  kennedy s assassin just before the president was shot in dallas in    cruz    who as a tea party conservative in the u s  senate angered many mainstream republicans in congress and spearheaded tactics that led to a government shutdown over the federal budget  called trump a  serial philanderer  and a  narcissist  during the campaign  a cruz adviser who asked to remain anonymous said cruz anticipated a backlash from the crowd if he did not endorse trump   we knew people were going to be mad if he didn t say the words  but he congratulated him and called for unity behind common values  he expected people to not be thrilled about this   the adviser said   trump won the party s nomination on tuesday with   delegates  followed by cruz with  delegates  several delegates were outraged by the reaction to cruz s speech  saying it could undermine trump s support among republicans who had supported the senator from texas   i thought it was shameful   said manette merrill  a cruz delegate from washington state  adding she was now confident she would not vote for trump in november   they talk about unity     and then they act like that  that is not going to get us to unify   she said  the drama did not prevent trump s vice presidential running mate  indiana governor mike pence  from receiving a raucous welcome inside the convention hall to end the day s events  accepting the convention s nomination  pence spoke of trump as a friend of the working class who has persevered in the business world   he s a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers   pence said  trump briefly joined pence on the stage  shook his hand  patted him on the back  gave a thumbs up and  in a signal to the crowd  pointed at pence  but the cruz speech  the latest in a series of disruptions  overshadowed any show of solidarity  cruz swiftly became one of the top trending topics on twitter and facebook immediately following his speech  with about  tweets mentioning his official twitter handle  tedcruz posted every minute  the overall immediate sentiment was slightly more positive than negative  according to social media analytics firm zoomph  the most mentioned moment on twitter on wednesday was the crowd s reaction to trump s arrival at the conclusion of cruz s speech  cruz was also the most mentioned speaker of the night  followed by pence  cruz was the most searched speaker on google  in a speech minutes after cruz finished  former u s  house of representatives speaker newt gingrich veered from his prepared text to defend cruz   i think you misunderstood one paragraph that ted cruz  who is a superb orator  said  and i just want to point it out to you  ted cruz said you can vote your conscience for anyone who will uphold the constitution  in this election  there is only one candidate who will uphold the constitution   gingrich said   to paraphrase ted cruz  if you want to protect the constitution of the united states  the only possible candidate this fall is the trump pence republican ticket   gingrich said  the convention  due to end on thursday with trump s speech accepting the party s nomination  has been marked by turmoil from day one  on monday  chaos erupted when trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted to vent frustration over a failed attempt to force a vote in opposition to trump  on tuesday  similarities between some phrases in a speech by trump s wife  melania  and a  speech by first lady michelle obama triggered accusations of plagiarism  putting the trump campaign on the defensive  a staff writer for the trump organization on wednesday took responsibility for the  chaos  over the speech  eminent republicans such as the party s previous two presidential nominees  mitt romney and senator john mccain  and members of the bush family that gave the party its last two presidents have stayed away from cleveland in a show of displeasure at trump and his rhetoric against illegal immigration and free trade  opponents brand trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of muslims and to build a border wall with mexico to keep out illegal immigrants  underscoring the problems trump has faced with u s  allies abroad  german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier told reuters on wednesday that trump threatened u s  and world security with his  politics of fear and isolation
