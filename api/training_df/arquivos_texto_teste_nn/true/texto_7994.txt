former u s  senator and secretary of state  stepped up her criticism of trump for refusing to release his tax returns  as presidential candidates have done for decades  and for saying during the debate that not paying federal income tax  makes me smart    he actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes  in fact  i think there s a strong probability he hasn t paid federal taxes a lot of years   she said at a campaign rally in raleigh  north carolina  a pivotal state in the election   he probably hasn t paid a penny to support our troops or our vets
