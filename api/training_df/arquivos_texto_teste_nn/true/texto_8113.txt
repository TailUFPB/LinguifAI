washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump on friday abandoned his false claim that barack obama was not born in the united states after spending five years peddling conspiracy theories that the country s first african american president started life as a foreigner  but  never one to let a controversy go without fanning its flames  trump accused hillary clinton  his democratic rival in the nov   election  of starting the so called birther movement in her failed  presidential campaign against obama  a claim that does not stand up to scrutiny  trump  who has won back some ground in opinion polls and made the white house race more competitive after he went through a summer slump  made his announcement in an attempt to clear the air as he prepares for the first of three televised presidential debates with clinton on sept     president barack obama was born in the united states  period   said trump  a real estate developer   now we all want to get back to making america strong and great again   he said at an event in washington at a new trump international hotel down the street from the white house  devoting only about  seconds to the subject  trump did not apologize and did not expand upon his abrupt decision to shift from a stance he held for five years  the new york businessman brought up the birther controversy as far back as   appealing to a right wing fringe of voters who formed the early base of his support when he launched his presidential bid last year  the birther conspiracy movement is aimed at challenging the legality of obama s presidency   the u s constitution requires that a president be a natural born citizen  during his presidential campaign  trump has readily trafficked in other theories that are the stuff of american supermarket tabloids  there was his declaration that the father of u s  senator ted cruz  one of trump s many rivals for the republican nomination  might have been linked to the assassin of president john f  kennedy  and there was his false claim that thousands of muslims in jersey city  new jersey  cheered when the world trade center twin towers collapsed in the sept      attacks  in making his announcement on friday  trump advanced a widely debunked claim that clinton and her  campaign had been the original birthers   hillary clinton and her campaign of  started the birther controversy  i finished it  you know what i mean   he said  his campaign directed reporters to a  memo from then clinton adviser mark penn  who had encouraged the clinton campaign to go negative against obama by saying that his hawaiian birth and boyhood in indonesia gave him limited roots in american values and culture  penn eventually left the clinton campaign  and his advice was never acted upon      the democratic national committee on friday condemned trump s bid to link clinton to the birther idea   he had the audacity to spout a new lie about the birther movement that he helped to build   it said  clinton  who leads trump by  percentage points in the latest reuters ipsos poll  on friday demanded trump apologize to the president for having helped spread the birther idea and said trump had tried to  delegitimize our first black president    his campaign was founded on this outrageous lie  there is no erasing it in history   clinton said in an address to the black women s association in washington  clinton seized on the issue after struggling to overcome the fallout from her remark a week ago that half of trump s supporters are in a  basket of deplorables  and her initial secrecy about her pneumonia diagnosis  obama  who produced the longer version of his hawaiian birth certificate in  to prove doubters wrong  had famously mocked trump over the issue at a white house correspondents association dinner as the wealthy businessman sat in the audience fuming  still  trump clung to the contention that obama was foreign born  tweeting in august    an  extremely credible source  has called my office and told me that  barackobama s birth certificate is a fraud   on friday  obama was asked for his reaction to the latest trump declaration   i m shocked that a question like that has come up at a time when we have so many other things to do  well  i m not that shocked actually  it s fairly typical  we ve got other things to attend to   he said   i was pretty confident about where i was born   trump s embrace of the birther movement has incensed black americans  whose votes trump has been trying to court  members of the congressional black caucus held a news conference on friday to urge african american voters to resist any temptation to support trump   i m wondering when this country is going to awaken from this reality show   said representative brenda lawrence  a democrat  first lady michelle obama told a crowd in fairfax  virginia  that her husband has set a strong example for those who have doubted  whether my husband was even born in this country    well  during his time in office  i think barack has answered those questions with the example he s set  by going high when they go low  and he s answered these questions with the progress that we ve achieved together   she said  at a rally in miami later on friday  trump pushed back on the idea that he and his supporters were racist  saying that when democrats are in trouble politically   they always pull out the racist word   he walked out at the rally to a song from the musical  les miserables  in front of a backdrop that read  les deplorables   a reference to clinton s comment last week about his supporters  the issue of obama s birthplace has not been a factor in the campaign leading up to the november presidential election  but it resurfaced in recent days  taking the focus of trump s white house bid away from topics such as immigration  trade and the economy  which he has been using to hit clinton  trump revived the birther controversy on thursday in an interview with the washington post when he declined to say whether he believed obama was born in hawaii      trump had promised  a big announcement  about the birther issue on friday  giving the impression it was the purpose of the event at his hotel   instead  he held off saying anything about it through more than  minutes of endorsements from military veterans  only then did trump make a brief statement about obama s birth  trump devoted more time at the beginning of the event to talking about his hotel where the event took place  he ignored reporters  shouted questions
