new york washington  reuters    donald trump fired corey lewandowski  the campaign manager who helped him win republican presidential nominating contests but clashed with other advisers on how to appeal to the broader general electorate  several people with knowledge of the decision said on monday  the firing on monday morning was another shakeup for a campaign already at odds with many senior republican figures over the presumptive nominee s policies  with the party s nominating convention in cleveland less than a month away   but it may also prove a step toward calming concerns among party leaders about trump  a wealthy businessman and political outsider  and the conflicting advice he was getting from senior aides  as he battles presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton ahead of the nov   election  trump said lewandowski did  a great job  but  it s time now for a different kind of a campaign    we ran a small  beautiful  well unified campaign  it worked very well in the primaries  i think i m probably going to do some of that   trump said in an interview with fox news  in which he did not say if lewandowski had been fired  three people close to the campaign said some of trump s staff viewed lewandowski as opposing strategic changes and staff hires urged for the general election campaign by paul manafort  a strategist hired in april partly for his experience on presidential campaigns that lewandowski lacked  the three  a campaign staffer and two people in regular contact with trump advisers  spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized by trump to discuss the firing  manafort will take over as campaign manager  said carl paladino  co chairman of the campaign s operations in new york state   paul s in charge   sean spicer  the republican national committee s communications director  said in an interview  trump s decision to fire his manager came in part at the urging of his daughter ivanka trump and her husband  jared kushner  who have powerful advisory roles in the campaign  the two people in contact with trump aides said   hope hicks  who single handedly fields trump s media inquiries  disputed reports she had complained about lewandowski to ivanka trump   that is entirely untrue   she said  lewandowski    had been a near constant presence at trump s side since the new york developer launched his campaign on june    in a brief statement read on cnn  lewandowski said   i stand by the fact that mr  trump is a great candidate and is better than hillary clinton ever will be    lewandowski denied there were any tensions between him and trump s family in an interview with cnn  later on monday  a campaign adviser resigned after reveling in lewandowski s exit on his twitter account  cnn reported   ding dong the witch is dead   michael caputo  the adviser  wrote shortly after reports of the firing emerged  he later released a statement to cnn saying he had resigned   in hindsight  that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move   his statement said  the rnc spokesman did not think there would be a change in trump s tone   it s going to be more of a streamlined effort and more of an understanding of the difference that a general election has   spicer said  clinton s campaign has hundreds more staff than that of trump  in contrast to her unsuccessful  presidential bid  there has been no public sign this time of any significant infighting among her advisers  the former u s  secretary of state has also spent millions of dollars on television commercials in recent weeks  trump has not aired any paid advertisements since becoming the presumptive nominee  preferring to spread his message through his twitter account and in media interviews  trump has faced setbacks in the past two weeks  his renewed calls to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states have drawn heavy criticism from republican politicians in washington and prompted corporate sponsors like apple and jpmorgan chase to withhold funding from the party s july   convention  recent opinion polls show at least half of all voters approve of the muslim ban  lewandowski  a former new hampshire field director for a conservative advocacy group  argued that trump s unconventional campaigning style did not need to be changed after it proved successful in the last few months of primary contests  lewandowski repeatedly defended that strategy with a line that became his mantra   let trump be trump    known for his brusque manner  lewandowski was accused of manhandling a female reporter in florida during the primary campaign  but the battery charge against him was later dropped  he is still scheduled to attend the cleveland convention as chairman of new hampshire s delegation  the democratic national committee said lewandowski s exit was unlikely to change trump   it wasn t corey lewandowski who called for a ban on muslims entering the united states   mark paustenbach  a party spokesman  said in a statement   it was donald trump
