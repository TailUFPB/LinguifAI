washington  reuters    donald trump s surprise victory in the u s  presidential election has set off a round of resume polishing across washington  as the nation s federal civil servants prepare for a leader who has promised to freeze hiring and reverse many of the policies they have spent the past eight years putting in place   while anti washington rhetoric is a staple of u s  politics  more than two dozen federal workers interviewed by reuters said trump s divisive presidential campaign pointed to bigger potential problems than those that would normally come with a routine switch from a democratic to a republican administration      the new york businessman s lack of political experience and contentious rhetoric have prompted some to assess whether they should leave government before he takes office on jan        as the republican presidential candidate  trump encouraged his supporters to harass journalists and attack protesters  he vowed to sue news outlets and women who accused him of sexual assault and said he would jail his opponent  democrat hillary clinton  trump s conduct has caused some undercover agents to worry that their identities could be made public if they step out of line  said susan hennessey  a former attorney at the national security agency who has been urging people in government to keep working in trump s administration to help resist potential abuses of power   i can t and don t blame anyone who feels they can t stay   she said  other federal workers worry their integrity could be compromised if they work on cases that affect trump s vast business interests  trump s taxes are being audited by the internal revenue service and the national labor relations board is involved in a labor dispute at his las vegas hotel  changes to tax laws or pollution rules could potentially impact some of his property holdings   do i get out or is it all the more important that i stay in to push back on the problematic things   said one federal worker  who  like others interviewed for this story  asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation at work  a transfer of power always convulses washington to some degree  particularly when it comes to the departure and arrival of political appointees in more than   posts  those top officials oversee   million civilian workers  from park rangers to tax lawyers  who are expected to enact the president s agenda and enforce laws passed by congress regardless of their personal political views  but several workers told reuters they d rather leave government service than carry out orders they don t agree with  pointing specifically at trump s vow to undo president barack obama s policies on trade  immigration  health care and environmental protection   national security officials have printed out their resignation letters  ready to hand them in if trump tries to revive policies such as waterboarding or mass surveillance of americans they oppose on legal or moral grounds  according to  more than  military  intelligence and foreign service officers  who all spoke on condition of anonymity  regulators at the environmental protection agency privately say they are looking for new jobs ahead of expected cutbacks at their agency  whose climate change rules were criticized by trump on the campaign trail   one manager is urging employees to stay on the job   sometimes democracy surprises you   and while the election results will no doubt bring many changes over the coming months  our job remains the same   sarah dunham  director of the environmental protection agency s office of atmospheric programs  wrote to colleagues two days after the election  misgivings apparently extend into the nation s   million military service members as well  a survey released by the military times on friday found that one in five service members said they will not re enlist with trump as commander in chief  during his campaign  trump promised to rescind two regulations for every new one his administration issues and freeze hiring at agencies that don t cover public safety  public health or national defense  republicans in congress have pushed to erode job protections and scale back benefits  that would be a further blow for federal workers who have weathered furloughs  salary freezes and a three week government shutdown in recent years  the civilian work force has shrunk by  percent since obama s first year in office  according to white house figures  and it could shrink further  more than one third of federal workers will be eligible for retirement next year  according to a  government accountability office report   this isn t the worst thing that s happened to us   said a scientist who manages a fisheries laboratory in the pacific northwest of the expected changes   it s kind of continual   there may be a silver lining for those who are trying to get a job working for uncle sam  trump has promised to increase the number of border security agents and immigration enforcement officers as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration  and several managers said they were rushing to fill vacancies on their teams before trump s promised hiring
