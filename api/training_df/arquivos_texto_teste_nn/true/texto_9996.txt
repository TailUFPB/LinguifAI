london  reuters    planned changes that president barack obama says are aimed at ensuring american companies do not avoid tax by shifting their headquarters overseas could also force foreign companies to adopt more conservative u s  tax planning strategies  one of the measures restricts the ability of u s  subsidiaries of foreign companies to deduct the interest they pay on loans from their parent firms from their taxable income  it aims to stop a redomiciled american firm from reducing its u s  tax bill by piling inter group debt on its u s  operations  and effectively shifting profits overseas   but it could also affect european companies that use similar strategies to reduce their tax bills in the united states after buying u s  firms  the new rules announced by the treasury department this week aim to curb so called  inversions    where a u s  group acquires a smaller overseas company and shifts its domicile to a lower tax jurisdiction   drugmaker pfizer s plan to buy rival allergan and move to ireland was one of the planned inversions that prompted the obama administration to act  the   billion deal fell apart last week as a result of other aspects of the treasury reforms  under the new rule regarding debt  if a u s  subsidiary transfers money to its overseas parent within three years before or after borrowing money from it  by paying a dividend or buying shares in the parent  then u s  tax authorities could potentially treat the loan as if it was equity  this means the interest on the debt would not be deductible for u s  income tax purposes   experts said that european companies would still be able to shift profits via inter group debt  but may have to do so gradually over a longer period of time   it  without doubt  significantly changes the rules of the game   said stephen shay  professor of law at harvard university    in the old days you bought and then you levered up as much as you can and that is not going to happen in the same way  but how much of a constraint that becomes is unclear   he added  nancy mclernon  president of the organization for international investment  a trade group for the u s  subsidiaries of foreign companies  denied non u s  groups were routinely shifting profit overseas through debt    where s the problem they  u s  authorities  are trying to fix  it feels more like a tax grab   she said   she said the complexity of the issue and uncertainty over how the internal revenue service  irs   the u s  tax authority  would seek to use their new powers would make investing in new u s  projects less attractive    it will have a chilling effect on foreign direct investment in the united states   mclernon added  the treasury says it is targeting situations where large debts are incurred to fund dividends shortly after an inversion or foreign acquisition  rather than the most common way u s  subsidiaries accumulate inter group debt  that is by having the subsidiary gradually pay all its profit to its parent as dividends and then borrow money from its parent for new investment    the proposed regulations generally do not apply to related party debt that is incurred to fund actual business investment  such as building or equipping a factory   a treasury factsheet released last week said  providing the money a foreign company takes out of its u s  subsidiary is in line with the u s  company s profits  the transactions should escape irs scrutiny  shay said  companies don t usually publish details of their inter group financing so it s impossible to put a figure on how much profit foreign companies shelter from u s  tax through inter group loans  richard murphy  professor of practice in international political economy at city university london  estimates the irs could lose tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year in this way  companies that have reduced their u s  tax bills via inter group lending include drugmaker glaxosmithkline  education group pearson  utility scottish power and telecoms group vodafone   all said their lending to u s  subsidiaries had been unwound and that they complied with all tax rules  details of their lending arrangements came to public attention following data leaks or legal action with tax authorities  a  reuters examination of tax planning by europe s largest software group  sap ag  showed how the german company shifted profits from the united states  which has a corporate tax rate of at least  percent  to ireland whose headline rate is   percent  here high interest loans according to reuters calculations based on  corporate filings  sap america inc reduces its u s  tax bill by around   million a year by borrowing    billion from sap ireland us financial services ltd at an interest rate of at least  percent  the debt  which helped fund the acquisition of u s  software groups  cuts its taxable income by around   million a year  a spokesman for sap group declined to comment on the reuters calculations but said the company followed all tax rules and that its funding structure was driven by business rather than tax reasons  some measures previously proposed by obama and the organization for economic co operation and development  oecd   which advises developed nations on tax policy  would have limited interest deductions to the extent that they reflected an operating unit s share of total group interest costs  since sap group s total net interest expense was just  million euros last year  most of its u s  subsidiary s deduction may have been disallowed under such proposals   but the treasury plan is far more limited than these proposals  sap filings suggest that it has not taken large amounts of cash from its acquired u s  subsidiaries and recapitalized them with debt   debts accumulated as sap has done   by acquiring and expanding u s  companies   should not be captured by the new measures  even if that debt is out of proportion to the parent s overall debt burden   but it s hard to be certain  inter group debts usually run for a period of a few years  and each time they extend them  there is an opportunity for the irs to re examine the arrangement    there is certainly is a risk when they roll over that instrument  that it is going to be recharacterised as equity   said victor fleischer  professor of law at the university of san diego  said of the sap loans
