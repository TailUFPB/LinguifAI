 reuters    the u s  supreme court s key rulings on abortion  dating to the landmark  decision that legalized the procedure nationwide  have long provoked social  religious and political tensions  as the court majority became more conservative over the decades  it set standards that enhance states  ability to regulate abortion  yet even in the most recent rulings  extending to   there have never been five votes on the nine member court to reverse the fundamental right to abortion  here is a look at the court s major abortion rulings  roe v  wade      vote the court rules that a woman s constitutional right to privacy protects her decision to end a pregnancy  and only a compelling state interest can justify regulating abortion  the decision institutes a three part legal test  connected to a nine month pregnancy and a fetus  viability  that gives states more latitude for regulation with each trimester  planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v  casey      vote the court affirms the right to abortion  rather than the trimester framework  the test is whether a government regulation imposes an  undue burden  on a woman seeking an abortion by creating a  substantial obstacle  to the procedure before the fetus develops to the point at which it becomes viable  stenberg v  carhart      vote the court decides that a nebraska ban on a late term procedure critics call  partial birth abortion  violates a woman s right to abortion  the procedure  known medically as  intact dilation and extraction   involves a physician removing most of the fetus intact rather than dismembering it  the justices fault the nebraska ban  similar to laws in a majority of the states at the time  for its ambiguity about precisely what type of medical procedure is prohibited and for lacking an exception for the health of the mother  gonzales v  carhart      vote the court decides that a federal partial birth abortion act  involving the same type of procedure as in the nebraska dispute and without an exception for the woman s health  is constitutional  the majority distinguishes the ruling from the  case by noting that congress developed findings that the procedure would never be necessary for the health of the mother  another factor in the reversed course was that in   justice sandra day o connor had voted to strike down the partial birth ban  she was succeeded by samuel alito in   and in  he cast the fifth vote in favor of the ban  whole woman s health v  hellerstedt      vote the court strikes down a texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities  finding that the  statute put an undue burden on women exercising their right under the u s  constitution to end a pregnancy  the court declares that both provisions of the law   requiring physicians who perform abortions to have difficult to obtain  admitting privileges  at a local hospital and requiring clinics to install costly hospital grade facilities   violate abortion rights  the ruling marked the firmest endorsement of u s  abortion rights since the  planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania v  casey ruling
