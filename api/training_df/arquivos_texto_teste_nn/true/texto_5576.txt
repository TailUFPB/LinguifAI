washington  reuters    the senate s top democrat on tuesday accused president donald trump s supreme court pick of avoiding answering questions  like the plague  and dodging efforts to gauge his judicial independence during a meeting that deepened his concerns about the nominee  neil gorsuch  the federal appeals court judge from colorado who the republican president nominated last week to a lifetime job on the high court  met privately with senator chuck schumer of new york as he continues to try to build support for his confirmation by the senate   i thought there was a deliberate strategy to duck the hard questions  and he has an obligation to answer them  not simply to the senate but to the american people   schumer told reporters afterward  referring to gorsuch  schumer said gorsuch declined to answer questions such as whether a ban on muslim immigration would be constitutional or comment on what is known as the emoluments clause in the u s  constitution that bars officeholders from accepting money from foreign powers  supreme court nominees routinely avoid weighing in on pending legal disputes they could end up casting a vote on if confirmed to the job  but schumer said he was seeking gorsuch s views on broader principles  rather than specific cases  that he believed a nominee should be able to answer   the judge today avoided answers like the plague   schumer told reporters  schumer said trump is testing the fundamental underpinnings of u s  democracy and its institutions   these times deserve answers  and judge gorsuch did not provide them  i have serious concerns about this nominee   said schumer  who added that he had not yet made up his mind on whether or not to support gorsuch  the shorthanded supreme court currently has four liberals and four conservatives  meaning gorsuch s confirmation would reinstate a conservative majority   trump s fellow republicans control the senate   but schumer insisted that gorsuch would need to win  votes  rather than a simple majority  to move toward confirmation  democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if gorsuch s supporters cannot muster  votes  although republicans could change the senate rules  schumer s questions to gorsuch followed trump s directive to temporarily ban people from seven muslim majority countries and any refugees from entering the united states  the ban  which trump said was needed to protect the united states from islamist militants  was suspended by a federal judge  pending an appeal by the trump administration  his questions about the emoluments clause come in light of a lawsuit filed by ethics lawyers accusing trump of allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments  which is prohibited under that constitutional provision  democrats argued that it is more important than ever for a supreme court nominee to demonstrate judicial independence  citing trump s harsh criticism of federal judges who have issued rulings against him  but republicans belittled democratic efforts to discredit gorsuch   if they keep working to paint judge gorsuch as a mouth breathing bald eagle hunter  they ll embarrass themselves   said republican senator ben sasse of nebraska  who also met with gorsuch on tuesday   republican senator mike lee of utah told reuters the democratic questioning of the nominee s potential independence  flies in the face of everything i know about judge gorsuch   lee described gorsuch is  fair  decent  impartial
