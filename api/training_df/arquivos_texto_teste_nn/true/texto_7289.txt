new york  reuters    continental resources chief executive harold hamm is at the top of president elect donald trump s list to serve as energy secretary  according to u s  representative kevin cramer of north dakota  a trump energy adviser who confirmed he is also under consideration for the job   in my view  harold hamm has the right of first refusal   cramer told reuters in a telephone interview   in my view  he s likely to be asked  and  because he s a patriot and an american  he s likely to say yes   hamm    became one of america s wealthiest men during the u s  oil and gas drilling boom over the past decade  tapping into controversial hydraulic fracturing drilling technology to access vast deposits in north dakota s shale fields  continental spokeswoman kristin thomas said   there has never been a conversation  between trump and hamm about the position  she declined to speculate on how hamm would respond if asked to take the job  people close to hamm were mixed on the possibility   i think harold would be great in the  energy secretary  job  if the president calls  i think he would do it   said mike cantrell  a former vice president of government affairs at continental who remains close to hamm  another prominent u s  oil and gas executive who knows hamm and asked not to be named  however  said he doubted hamm would be willing to leave continental and may be more interested in having a strong say in who gets the job  aside from hamm and cramer  trump s short list for energy secretary also includes venture capitalist robert grady  who served as associate director for natural resources  energy and science in president george h  w  bush s office of management and budget  according to cramer and two other sources with knowledge of the situation  grady did not respond to requests for comment   if hamm is nominated  the oklahoman would be the first u s  energy secretary drawn directly from the industry since the cabinet position was created in   a move that would jolt environmental advocates but bolster trump s pro drilling energy platform  trump  a republican who will take office on jan   and succeed democratic president barack obama  is also working to fill other top administration jobs in the coming weeks  hamm addressed the republican convention in july  calling for expanded drilling and saying too much environmental regulation threatened to limit u s  oil production and increase the country s dependence on middle east oil producers   past heads of the u s  department of energy  which is charged with advancing u s  energy security and technology  including nuclear weapons production and labs  have typically boasted a political or academic background  dan eberhart  a texas oil investor and republican party financier who has worked with hamm and has had conversations with the trump campaign  said   i know hamm is being seriously considered  and i know that he wants it   a former capitol hill staffer who knows both hamm and cramer said he thought trump would be wise to favor the north dakota congressman  a self described climate change skeptic who has a history of supporting the oil  gas and coal sectors   both hamm and cramer would be fantastic choices  but i think cramer brings more balance and stability   he said  asking not to be named   this is not the first time hamm has been in contention for the job  the republican party s presidential nominee in   mitt romney  vetted hamm to be energy secretary but ultimately decided against him because the two men have differing positions on renewable energy sources like wind  hamm made headlines in  after settling a protracted divorce case and agreeing to pay his ex wife   million   reported to be one of the biggest divorce settlement in history
