simi valley  california  reuters    often fiercely divided over policy  republican and democratic national security elite gathering this weekend in california appeared to largely agree on one thing  president elect donald trump s pick for defense secretary  james mattis  a retired marine general  is an unorthodox choice  because he retired only in   mattis is technically ineligible for the job since he has not been a civilian for at least seven years  that means congress would need to grant a waiver   something it hasn t done since   democrat leon panetta  a former u s  defense secretary critical of trump  says it is worth it  he sees in mattis a chance that a trump administration would adhere to core alliances and principles  even ones challenged by trump during his election campaign  that would include u s  support for nato and recognition of longstanding threats  including from russia    mattis  shares beliefs that have been at the heart and soul of protecting our national security for a long time   panetta  who was also cia director under president barack obama  told reuters in an interview at the reagan national defense forum  mattis  a  year old commander who is revered by marines  is known for his tough talk  wariness of iran and combat experience in afghanistan and iraq  although trump has played up mattis   mad dog  nickname and tough guy image  marines and others who served with him portrayed mattis as a scholar and strategist who would seek to avoid open conflict   i ve never met anybody who tried harder to win without fighting   said marine corps commandant robert neller    he s someone  that understands information  relationships  how to negotiate  how to engage below the level of conflict  at the same time     if you have to fight  ok  there s no way that we re not going to win    it is unclear how much influence mattis will have over trump  who has also already named michael flynn  a retired army lieutenant general  as his national security adviser  flynn was also a close advisor during the  campaign  adopting much of trump s rhetoric  for mattis to be confirmed  the senate and the house of representatives both must pass a waiver exempting him from a law written to ensure that the military is under civilian command  legislators have granted such a waiver only once  in   when congress passed an act that allowed general george marshall  who had retired in   to serve as pentagon chief  but marine general joseph dunford  the current chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who serves as the president s top uniformed military advisor  flatly dismissed any concerns about having a recently retired general in the post  when asked at the forum    do i have any concerns  no   said dunford  who once counted mattis as his commander   republican dick cheney  a former defense secretary and vice president  called mattis a great choice  deputy defense secretary robert work told a small group of reporters who traveled with him to california that the support expressed at the forum for mattis appeared to be bipartisan   everyone has great confidence that he s going to be able to master the job  both sides of the aisle   should he get confirmed  work said after the event  representative mac thornberry  the republican who chairs the house armed services committee  said he expected to start informal meetings on the waiver in the coming days  he hoped to settle the waiver issue before trump s inauguration jan     we need a secretary of defense on the ground  running  as quickly as possible  at the same time  i don t think it s right to try to jam it through   thornberry told reuters   it needs a debate or discussion at least  but we need to do it early    some democrats have raised concerns about civilian control of the military   as well as having too many generals in the top tiers of the government   senator kirsten gillibrand  a democrat on the armed services committee  has said she would not back a waiver for mattis  congresswoman susan davis  a democrat on the house armed services committee  said at the forum she wanted to learn more about mattis  but panetta warned fellow democrats against blocking him   considering the other picks that  trump  has made  this would be the wrong target   he said
