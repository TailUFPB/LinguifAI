washington  reuters    the obama administration on thursday repealed a measure granting automatic residency to virtually every cuban who arrived in the united states  whether or not they had visas  ending a longstanding exception to u s  immigration policy  the end of the  wet foot  dry foot  policy  which allowed any cuban who reached u s  soil to stay but returned any picked up at sea  is effective immediately  cuban officials had sought the change for years  the shift had been in the works for months  it was announced abruptly because advance warning might have inspired thousands more people to take to the seas between the communist ruled island and florida in order to beat a deadline  the united states and cuba spent several months negotiating the change  including an agreement from cuba to allow those turned away from the united states to return   with this change we will continue to welcome cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations  consistent with our laws   obama said in a statement  the department of homeland security also ended a parole program that allowed entry for cuban medical professionals  that program was unpopular with havana because it prompted doctors to leave  sapping the country s pool of trained health workers  the u s  coast guard intercepts thousands of cubans attempting the  mile   km  crossing to florida every year  but tens of thousands who reach u s  soil  including via mexico  have been allowed to stay in the country  while immigrants from other nations have been rounded up and sent home  cuba welcomed the policy changes  saying they would benefit the whole region by discouraging people trafficking and dangerous journeys that led to bottlenecks of cubans in central america last year   today  a detonator of immigration crises is eliminated  the united states achieves legal  secure and ordered migration from cuba   said josefina vidal  the cuban foreign ministry s chief for u s  affairs   el salvador s foreign ministry also welcomed the move  saying  there cannot be migrants of different categories   honduras  from where thousands flee each year without the attraction of favorable u s  immigration policies  said it would wait to see if the flow of cubans actually reduced   anticipating the end of the policy  cuban immigration has surged since the  normalization  said ben rhodes  obama s deputy national security adviser   people were motivated to migrate   rhodes told reporters on a call  noting some   cubans arrived in  and about   in   the administration had rejected cuban entreaties to overturn the policy before president barack obama s historic visit to the island last year  although even some white house aides argued that it was outmoded given efforts to regularize relations between the former cold war foes    wet foot  dry foot  began in  under president bill clinton after an exodus of tens of thousands of cubans who were picked up at sea by the coast guard as they tried to reach florida  obama has been working to normalize relations with cuba since he and president raul castro announced a breakthrough in diplomatic relations in december   his administration has eased restrictions on travel and trade  allowing more u s  business with cuba and improved communications with the island  the move to end the policy comes just eight days before the democratic president turns the white house over to republican donald trump  who has said the united states should get more concessions from havana in exchange for improved relations  u s  immigration policy has given cubans benefits granted to nationals from no other country  until now  virtually every cuban who made it to u s  soil was granted the right to stay in the country  the right to apply for work permits and  later  green cards  which convey lawful permanent residency  jeh johnson  secretary of homeland security  said on a call that cuba will take back citizens as long as less than four years have passed between the time the migrant left cuba and the start of the u s  deportation proceedings   under the agreement cuba will take back some   people who left the island among   others during the mariel boat lift of   fulfilling an agreement made in  to take back   people who the united states did not grant citizenship to  mainly people with criminal convictions   cuba has previously taken back only a handful of that group   the new policy sparked mixed emotions in miami s little havana neighborhood   mario garcia  a cuban mechanic in little havana  said the change angered him   it s not like communism has ended in cuba  so why stop this that has saved people s lives   he said  but eulalia jimenez  who is venezuelan  said the policy was not fair to migrants from other countries who also flee bad conditions   why should only the cuban people be able to come and make a life for themselves   jimenez said    some u s  lawmakers had been demanding a fresh look at the immigration rules  saying cubans coming to the united states simply for economic reasons should not be automatically granted benefits intended for refugees   this is a welcome step in reforming an illogical and discriminatory policy that contrasted starkly with the treatment of deserving refugees from other countries   senator patrick leahy  a democrat  said in a statement  republican senator jeff flake also said eliminating the policy was  a win for taxpayers  border security and our allies in the western hemisphere    flake and leahy both support obama s moves toward freer trade and travel with cuba  but u s  senator marco rubio said the incoming trump adminstration should reverse the part of the executive order that ended the medical parole system  and said cubans fleeing political persecution should receive asylum   the department of homeland security is also eliminating an exemption that prevented the use of expedited removal programs for cuban nationals picked up at ports of entry or near the border  but an existing cuban family reunification parole program is not affected by thursday s announcement and remains in effect
