washington  reuters    oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  u s  president elect donald trump s choice to lead the environmental protection agency  said on wednesday he will review the obama administration s recent decision to lock in fuel efficiency rules  on friday  outgoing epa administrator gina mccarthy finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by president barack obama should be locked in through   a bid to maintain a key part of his administration s climate legacy   it merits review and i would review that   pruitt said during a contentious senate confirmation hearing  questioning the decision of mccarthy to finalize the determination just two weeks after the public comment period closed on dec     pruitt said separately he would not commit to allowing california to continue its own clean vehicle rules under a  decision by the obama administration  major u s  and foreign automakers have appealed to trump  who has been critical of obama s climate policies  to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet wide fuel efficiency by   saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences  as part of a  regulation  epa had to decide by april  whether to modify the   model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet wide efficiency of more than  miles per gallon  in   obama announced an agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to   miles per gallon  this  the administration said  would save motorists    trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles  but cost the auto industry about   billion over  years      the epa said in july that because americans were buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks  it estimated the fleet will average   mpg to   mpg in   in november  the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the  standards  mccarthy said her determination  a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules  rested on an extensive technical record  she said the rules are  feasible  practical and appropriate  and in  the best interests of the auto industry   senator james inhofe  an oklahoma republican  on wednesday said mccarthy s determination was an  extreme action  that  broke the deal  with automakers  legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the trump administration and congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the obama administration during its final months in office  the  determination is not a new regulation  so the epa under trump would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing it and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if that step was taken  separately  california s new democrat senator kamala harris asked pruitt whether he would commit to upholding the california waiver  pruitt did not say outright that he would uphold the waiver  which allows california to pursue its own emission standards that are more stringent than the federal rules
