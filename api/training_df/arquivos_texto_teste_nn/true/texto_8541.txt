family members  who have played an influential role in his campaign  were aware that an intervention was needed to get trump back on track  one idea being floated was to have a senior adviser travel

as an outsider  trump  who had never previously run for public office  beat  rivals to become the republican presidential nominee for the nov   election  ahead of last month s republican party convention  the rnc chairman sought to rally the fractured party behind trump  priebus feels burned by trump s string of self inflicted wounds and his refusal to observe basic decorum by giving ryan
