new york  reuters    supreme court nominee judge neil gorsuch is known for questioning how far courts should go in deferring to federal agencies on interpreting the law  a view that could be important for u s  companies and  perhaps  for president donald trump  nominated by trump on tuesday to fill a vacancy on the nation s highest court  the  year old gorsuch is widely viewed as a sharp eyed jurist and a crisp writer who has the potential to be a persuasive voice on the court  in a recent case  gorsuch took a dim view of a landmark  high court ruling  chevron v  natural resources defense council  widely cited  the ruling directed judges nationwide to defer to agencies  interpretation of laws that may be ambiguous  it is known as  chevron deference    last august  in a case over immigration rules  gorsuch called the doctrine the  elephant in the room  that concentrates federal power  in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution   showing his willingness to tackle the issue head on  he added   maybe the time has come to face the behemoth   if gorsuch can persuade other supreme court justices to question chevron deference  companies arguing before the high court against federal regulations might have a better chance on issues ranging from the environment to immigration  at the same time  broader skepticism of deference to agencies could have long term consequences for trump  the new president is moving swiftly to reshape the federal bureaucracy  appointing agency heads who could upend the legacy of president barack obama on emissions  health care and internet policy  the court s views on agencies  agendas will be critical   the idea that president trump of all people would be the one to choose a justice who might push the court to reduce the executive power is pretty ironic   said john nagle  a professor at the university of notre dame law school  if the supreme court were to overturn or limit the chevron precedent  lower courts could become more active in deciding the ultimate meaning of a statute  making it less likely that an agency s view would stand  nagle said    it could make it more difficult for the trump administration to defend some of its regulatory actions in federal court   said case western reserve university school of law professor jonathan adler   republicans in congress  particularly when obama was in office  frequently complained about chevron deference  they have even debated legislation that would override it  the house of representatives passed such a bill on jan    although it is unlikely to win approval in the senate  gorsuch is not the first judge to take aim at the issue  in   the supreme court ruled against the environmental protection agency over its regulations for limiting pollution from mercury and other toxic materials  at that time  conservative justice clarence thomas wrote a separate opinion saying the government s position  raises serious questions about the constitutionality of our broader practice of deferring to agency interpretations of federal statutes   while thomas has argued the doctrine threatens the constitutionally mandated separation of the different branches of government  chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy have said it may threaten individual liberties  said andrew grossman  a conservative lawyer who has represented companies challenging government regulations   gorsuch may be the one to bring the court together on fundamental questions of administrative power that have sparked so much controversy and divisiveness in recent years   grossman said  some court watchers say that in practice the justices are inclined to support executive actions that are in keeping with their own views  but an analysis of their votes carried out by jack beermann  a professor at boston university school of law  showed that such an outcome is not uniform
