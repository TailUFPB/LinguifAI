bismarck  n d   reuters    republican donald trump and democrat bernie sanders on thursday explored staging an unconventional u s  presidential debate  that would sideline democratic front runner hillary clinton and create a television spectacle that could attract huge ratings  the two men   a billionaire and a democratic socialist   expressed interest in a one on one encounter in california even though republican and democratic presidential candidates traditionally do not debate each other until the parties have selected their nominees   i d love to debate bernie   trump told reporters in north dakota  after he secured enough delegates to clinch the republican presidential nomination   i think it would get very high ratings  it would be in a big arena   basking in his newly sealed nomination at a later campaign rally in billings  montana  trump said he expected to put  states in play in the general election  compared with three or four for a traditional republican  he named california  washington and michigan among others   trump spokeswoman hope hicks said in an email there were no formal plans yet for a debate  but sanders campaign manager jeff weaver told cnn there had been  a few discussions  between the campaigns about the details           we hope that he will not chicken out   weaver said   we hope donald trump has the courage to get on stage now that he said he would       sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  is running far behind clinton in the race for the democratic nomination for the nov   presidential election   but a nationally televised debate with the presumptive republican nominee would be a big boost to his chances in the california primary on june   when clinton is likely to clinch the nomination          trump said a debate with sanders could raise up to   million for charity   i d love to debate bernie  but they ll have to pay a lot of money for it   he said  the idea was hatched during an appearance by trump on abc s  jimmy kimmel live  late on wednesday  kimmel said he asked trump about the debate at the suggestion of sanders   game on   sanders tweeted   i look forward to debating donald trump in california before the june  primary   sanders himself appeared on thursday night on the talk show  where he said kimmel made it possible for a  very interesting debate  between  two guys who look at the world very  very differently   sanders added that the goal would be to have the debate in a stadium in california  he then had a warning for trump   if i become the democratic presidential nomination  he said   we re going to beat him and beat him bad   clinton  who backed out of an agreement to debate sanders before the california vote  said she did not think a trump sanders showdown would happen   this doesn t sound like a serious discussion  i m looking forward to debating donald trump in the general election  i really can t wait to get on the stage with him   she told cnn in a phone interview  a fox news spokeswoman confirmed the network was trying to host a forum with trump and sanders  representatives from other networks did not immediately respond to requests for comment   if it does come to pass  it would generate enormous ratings   said alan schroeder  a northeastern university professor who has written extensively about presidential debates   they are from two different planets  you have a real personality contrast  it would dominate media coverage   sanders  who has promised to continue his campaign through the democratic nominating convention in july  has said he will do everything he can to ensure that trump does not win the white house           smart and bold move by sanders   democratic strategist brad bannon said   the clinton people are furious but bernie wins points for being so aggressive   clinton has tried to woo sanders supporters as she turns her attention to the general election  but some democrats worry his supporters   who are largely young  working class and disillusioned with the democratic party establishment   will turn instead to political neophyte trump  who has championed a populist agenda      the debate would give trump a national forum to criticize clinton and try to win over sanders supporters ahead of an expected trump clinton general election contest  democratic strategist chris kofinis said   i think sanders should think long and hard about giving trump a forum   kofinis said   it crosses a line  but apparently in this election there is no line             dale ranney    a trump volunteer who has been to  of his rallies  said she would be delighted to see trump and sanders debate   i think it s a great idea  any time you can get more information to the people  absolutely   ranney said   having trump debate a socialist  absolutely  go for it
