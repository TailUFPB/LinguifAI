 washington  reuters    there was a moment in sunday s u s  presidential debate when democrat hillary clinton was trying to fend off an attack from republican rival donald trump about her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state    it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country   clinton said of her rival for the nov   election    because you d be in jail   trump shot back  drawing a mix of gasps and applause from the crowd that was defying instructions to remain silent   it was one of the most explosive moments of the debate in st  louis  and unprecedented for one presidential candidate to suggest on a debate stage that his opponent should be in jail   the debate was crammed with moments that could at best be described as petty and at worse vicious   as the candidates traded personal attacks and sarcastic one liners   trump frequently interrupted clinton and sparred with the two debate moderators  who in turn chastised the crowd for occasional outbursts   when moderator anderson cooper asked clinton if trump had the discipline to be a good leader  clinton responded with one word   no     i m shocked to hear that   trump responded sarcastically   he called clinton names  including referring to her as  the devil  when discussing the support for her by u s  senator bernie sanders  clinton s rival for the democratic presidential nomination    we have a divided nation  because people like her   and believe me  she has tremendous hate in her heart   trump said a few minutes later   clinton in turn jabbed at trump for his lewd remarks about women captured on a  videotape released on friday that has thrown his candidacy into crisis    ok  donald  i know you re into big diversion tonight  anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it s exploding and the way republicans are leaving you   clinton said   after  minutes of such harsh exchanges  the mood changed suddenly when the final question came from an audience member who asked each candidate to describe one admirable quality about the other    i respect his children  his children are incredibly able and devoted  and i think that says a lot about donald   clinton said   trump said of clinton   she doesn t quit  she doesn t give up  i respect that    at the close of the debate  they shook hands  something they had notably avoided doing when the night started
