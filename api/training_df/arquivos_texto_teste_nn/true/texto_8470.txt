washington  reuters    if you haven t heard a lot about what hillary clinton thinks of a string of controversial comments by donald trump that have generated round the clock coverage on cable news broadcasts  there is a reason   it s by design  since becoming the democratic nominee last month  clinton has been touring toy manufacturers  visiting tie makers and dropping in on public health clinics  where if she mentions trump at all  it is usually to contrast their policies  her swift condemnation at a wednesday campaign rally of trump s remark that gun rights activists could stop her from nominating liberal u s  supreme court justices was a rare instance where she has directly engaged her republican rival in the  race for the white house  aides say clinton s strategy is simple  let trump be trump  trump has suffered a series of missteps over the past two weeks that go beyond his remarks on gun rights activists  which he later accused the media of deliberately misinterpreting  he has tangled with party leaders  clashed with the parents of a fallen muslim american army captain and this week accused clinton  a former secretary of state  and president barack obama of  founding  the islamic state militant group  on friday  he said he was just being sarcastic when he made that remark    there is an adage in politics   don t get in the way of a train wreck   said democratic strategist bob shrum  a top campaign aide to presidential candidates al gore in  and john kerry in   clinton s advisers say they see little benefit in her going toe to toe with trump over every personal accusation  generating sound bites that would dominate cable news broadcasts  rather  they are happy for him to be embroiled in controversy while clinton focuses on policy  trump s campaign declined to comment for this story  but the new york real estate developer has accused the national media of bias toward clinton  he re posted a supporter s tweet on friday that said the  corrupt media  was deliberately exaggerating his remarks to favor his democratic opponent   trump has slipped in opinion polls  and worried republican party leaders have urged him to stop making off the cuff inflammatory statements that generate blanket  often negative  media coverage and distract from efforts to highlight what they see as clinton s many shortcomings   he s sucking all the oxygen out of the room to his own detriment   said republican strategist and trump supporter ford o connell  it s not enough to dominate media coverage  he needs to  win  it  o connell said  trump has boasted that the news coverage he generates means he does not have to spend as much on campaign ads  but political veterans say he is squandering the attention and missing opportunities to win over undecided voters  for example  trump gave an economic speech on monday that was meant to help his campaign regain momentum  but it was quickly eclipsed by the fallout over his remarks on gun rights activists  clinton  meanwhile  has been busy courting local media in must win states  her national press pool  which seldom gets to question the candidate  often waits as she conducts interviews with local news outlets  she has granted few recent interviews to national outlets and rarely holds press conferences  a strategy her critics say is calculated to avoid questions about her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state  and the relationship between her family s global charity  the clinton foundation  and the state department  clinton  who has said she is one of the most transparent presidential candidates in history  has acknowledged her use of the private email server was a mistake but said she properly handled all classified information  she has denied any improper links between the foundation and the state department  in interviews with local outlets  clinton is more likely to face questions about job creation  public health and raising wages   all parts of her platform that she is keen to discuss  in florida  a crucial battleground state  republican lobbyist gus corbella says the contrast between the local coverage of clinton s campaign stops there and trump s events has been stark   clinton s campaign seems to have the more disciplined approach   corbella said   the rollout that day is on a specific event she s attending  a message she s trying to deliver  whereas on the trump side  it s what crazy thing did he say today and the response to that   after clinton s visit last week to a tie maker in colorado  the lead story on the front page of the denver post was  clinton pledges millions of jobs   trump also featured on the front page  but in a smaller story about  damage control  in his troubled campaign
