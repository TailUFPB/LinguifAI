washington  reuters    the top u s  senate republican on tax policy raised questions on wednesday about a border adjustment tax backed by republicans in the house of representatives  and suggested it could have difficulty passing the senate as a part of a u s  tax reform  border adjustment  which is a mainstay of the house republican tax reform blueprint  would bring sweeping change to the u s  corporate tax system  but it faces opposition from retailers  oil refiners and automakers who say it could raise prices for american consumers    in a speech to the u s  chamber of commerce  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch did not reject the border adjustment tax proposed by house speaker paul ryan  but he said there are  questions about whether it would unduly burden u s  consumers and businesses or pass muster under international trade rules   we don t have definitive answers to any of those questions at this particular point  and without them  i don t think i can give definitive positions   hatch said  the utah republican did not say whether he thinks border adjustment could clear the senate  but he said a handful of senators have  serious reservations  and noted that republicans can ill afford to lose votes from their  seat senate majority  even if they use a procedure known as reconciliation to avoid a democratic filibuster   a major concern on tax reform is producing a bill that can get through the senate   hatch said   we ll basically need universal republican support to pass anything through reconciliation  that s difficult to accomplish under any circumstances  let alone on something as complicated as tax reform   billed as a way to boost u s  manufacturing and pay for corporate tax cuts  border adjustment would essentially tax imports but not exports  it is expected to be part of house tax reform legislation that could emerge in march or april       i m optimistic we can find a common path   house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady  hatch s congressional counterpart  said in a statement after the senator s speech   it is unclear whether the border adjustment proposal has president donald trump s support  the president has called the proposal  too complicated   but the white house says it is an option for paying for a wall along the u s  border with mexico  hatch said the senate would not  simply take up and pass a house tax reform bill  but that his committee would produce its own proposal in the near future
