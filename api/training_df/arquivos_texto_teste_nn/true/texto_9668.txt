washington  reuters    for some democrats  donald trump may seem to be a gift   set to steer republicans into a trainwreck election in november   but senior democrat harry reid said on thursday he worried people might be too confident    am i concerned about it  of course i am   the u s  senate democratic leader said in a conference call with reporters    i think this race could be a debacle for the republicans   reid added   but i m not taking anything for granted  i m not being over confident   trump effectively clinched the republican presidential nomination for the nov   election this week after a primary battle that angered many   including in his own party s establishment   for his bombastic style and proposals such as building a wall along the southern u s  border to keep out mexicans   some democrats believe that divisive style makes him an easier opponent than some of the other  republicans who started out in the race  trump s democratic opponent will likely be former secretary of state hillary clinton  reid  who is retiring from the senate after this year  used his position as the senate s democratic leader in  to aggressively attack then republican presidential candidate mitt romney  during a teleconference to discuss trump and republican opposition to supreme court nominee merrick garland  reid made clear that he will perform in a similar role against trump   by nominating trump  i guess it s the natural evolution of a party that s spent eight years defining itself entirely on what it s against  anti immigrant  anti woman    anti obama  anti working people   said the senator from nevada  reid  who has called trump a  monster   said there should be a closer look at trump s business dealings and called on the real estate developer to open up his tax records  reid recalled some of his own campaigns in his political career that were lost or won by razor thin margins  adding   i can speak from personal experience  you cannot be over confident
