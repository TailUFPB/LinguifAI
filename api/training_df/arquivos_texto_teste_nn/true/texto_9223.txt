washington  reuters    legislation helping puerto rico dig out of its   billion debt crisis is set for a vote in the u s  house of representatives on thursday after a house panel fended off attempts to open the bill to a series of controversial amendments  by voice vote on wednesday  the rules committee  the gatekeeper for bills moving through the house  sent the puerto rico oversight  management and economic stability act  promesa  to the full house for debate and a likely vote on thursday  the legislation  the result of months of negotiations between congress and the obama administration  would create a federal oversight board to work with investors to determine how much they would recover of the island territory s   billion in loans  republicans have stressed that no taxpayer money would be used to bail out puerto rico from a crisis that has left nearly half of the population in poverty amid closings of schools and hospitals and a contracting economy  during a rules panel debate that stretched into the night  the committee rejected pleas to allow amendments that would have changed the basic structure of the legislation and the operation of the oversight board  if the bill passes the house  action would move to the senate  where some leading democrats have said they would seek significant changes  earlier on wednesday  house natural resources committee chairman rob bishop  who ushered the bill through his committee on may   told reporters he expected the full house to pass it on thursday  bishop  a utah republican  said a strong vote for passage in the house would help propel it through the senate   the bottom line is the better the vote here  in the house   the less likely it s going to come back in a significantly altered form  from the senate  bishop said  supporters hope to get it enacted into law before july   when puerto rico faces a deadline for making a    billion debt payment that it might not be able to fulfill  the house rules committee voted to allow debate on a limited number of amendments  including one giving priority to protecting federal taxpayer investments in puerto rico  such as mass transportation assets  another amendment expected to be debated would expand a federal program aimed at encouraging economic development in puerto rico s  under utilized  business zones  representative raul grijalva  a senior democrat who worked on the bill  said puerto rico s debt crisis  if unaddressed  could grow into a humanitarian crisis  stabilization measures contained in the bill  he said   would be the first step toward getting the situation under control   but his fellow democrat  puerto rican born representative luis gutierrez  warned   i don t think many of my colleagues in this body appreciate just how deeply offensive the bill before us is regarded in puerto rico   he was particularly concerned with the way control board members would be chosen  with most not having to have any ties to the island  but gutierrez failed to convince the committee to allow amendments to be offered making changes to the board and its operations
