washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump won a legal battle on sunday when a u s  appeals court in ohio removed new restrictions on partisan poll watchers that democrats had sought to prevent election day voter intimidation  the rules overturned by the sixth circuit court of appeals would have imposed greater penalties on people who harass voters during tuesday s election  voter intimidation already is prohibited under u s  law but democrats have pushed for greater restrictions in ohio and five other battleground states  citing concerns that trump s heated rhetoric might inspire election day chaos  on the campaign trail  trump has warned the election may be rigged and has called on supporters to keep an eye on voting activity for possible signs of fraud in large cities  numerous studies have found that u s  voter fraud is exceedingly rare   on friday u s  district court judge james gwin imposed new restrictions on those who monitor voting activity  saying they may not interrogate voters within  feet of a polling place  block them from entering  or photograph them as they come and go  those found to violate the rules could be held in contempt of court  the trump campaign had argued that those restrictions were not justified  given that there had been no reported instances of voter harassment in the state so far    in the end  plaintiff s case rested on rhetoric  not evidence   trump attorney chad readler wrote in a court filing on saturday  the appeals court sided with trump  lifting the new rules two days before election day  the ruling came before democrats had a chance to respond to readler s motion and the party said it may appeal   we are stunned that a court would rule without even allowing one of the parties to file a memo explaining their case  but that is exactly what the sixth circuit has done in this decision  we are exploring our options to reverse this unfortunate ruling   ohio democratic party spokeswoman kirstin alvanitakis said  the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment
