washington  reuters    white supremacists and neo nazis have rarely  if ever  in recent history been so enthusiastic about a presidential appointment as donald trump s choice of steve bannon to be his chief white house strategist  before he took over as chief executive of trump s campaign in august and led it to victory last week  bannon headed breitbart news  a website and voice for the alt right movement  a loose right wing confederation that includes hardcore nationalists  neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites  five days after trump defeated democrat hillary clinton  trump rewarded bannon    a former goldman sachs banker and a navy veteran  by appointing him senior counselor and chief strategist   jobs not subject to u s  senate confirmation   democrats  rights activists and minority groups were outraged and said trump  himself accused of racism and misogyny during the campaign  had just flung open the white house doors to hatemongers  many urged him to reconsider   bringing steve bannon into the white house is an alarming signal that president elect trump remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement on monday   there must be no sugar coating the reality that a white nationalist has been named chief strategist for the trump administration   pelosi said  the southern poverty law center  the anti defamation league and the council on american islamic relations  cair  also denounced bannon  bannon  who grew up in a democratic family  has a reputation of trying to tear down a republican party establishment that he deemed too soft and too entrenched  as a senior adviser to the republican trump  bannon will be expected by far right groups to champion their views and make sure that trump  who takes office on jan    keeps such campaign promises as building a wall on the southern u s  border  cracking down on muslims entering the country and restricting the influx of syrian war refugees   perhaps  the donald  is for real   rocky suhayda  chairman of the american nazi party  told cnn  david duke  a longtime leader of ku klux klan movements  and richard spencer  a white nationalist who runs the national policy institute  were among the leading alt right figures to praise bannon s appointment  in remarks published in the new york times on tuesday  bannon ascribed his interest in populism and american nationalism to a desire to curb what he views as the corrosive effects of globalization  he rejected what he called the  ethno nationalist  tendencies of some in the movement   it s not that some people on the margins  as in any movement  aren t bad guys   racists  anti semites  but that s irrelevant   he told the times  political commentator armstrong willliams  a close associate of former republican presidential candidate ben carson  said bannon was  one of the finest and most honorable people i ve ever met  and not bigoted in any way   the trump campaign had been struggling to manage trump s unconventional candidacy when bannon took over  he stayed behind the scenes and devised the strategy for the final days of the campaign that kept trump on message and enabled him to upset clinton in crucial states such as michigan  it was bannon and jared kushner  trump s son in law  who invited three women who accused bill clinton of sexual assault to attend a presidential debate in hopes of unnerving hillary clinton  bannon  looking typically unkempt with mussed hair and stubbly chin  grinned from the back of the room as trump and the women held their pre debate news conference   bannon is a legitimately sinister figure   ben shapiro  who had been editor in chief of breitbart under bannon  wrote in august on the dailywire com conservative news website which he founded    he is a vindictive  nasty figure     he will attempt to ruin anyone who impedes his unending ambition and he will use anyone bigger than he is   for example  donald trump   to get where he wants to go   shapiro wrote  anti semitism accusations while bannon was at breitbart  it had stories with headlines such as  birth control makes women unattractive and crazy    political correctness protects muslim rape culture  and  hoist it high and proud  the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage   the site s pro trump agenda featured speculative stories questioning hillary clinton s health and accusing her close aide huma abedin of being a saudi spy  bannon was charged with domestic violence and battery in  after his then wife  mary louise piccard  said he grabbed her by the throat and arm during an argument  the case was dropped when she did not appear in court  in  piccard said in court documents bannon did not like the school the girls attended because it had too many  whiny brat  jewish students  bannon had a varied and profitable career before joining breitbart  he earned degrees from virginia tech  georgetown university and harvard business school and served four years in the navy  it was his navy experience  he said  that led him to shed his family s democratic allegiance and become an admirer of republican ronald reagan  he was at goldman sachs before starting his own investment firm  which specialized in media  through negotiating a studio sale  he obtained a stake in the royalties for the popular television show  seinfeld   a money making powerhouse in syndication  he was an executive producer of the feature movies  titus  and  the indian runner  before producing  directing or writing conservative oriented documentaries such as  clinton cash  about the clinton foundation   generation zero  about the global economic crisis of   and  the undefeated  on former vice presidential
