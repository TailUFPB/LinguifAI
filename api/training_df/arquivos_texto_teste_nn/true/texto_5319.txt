washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump delivered his first public condemnation of anti semitic incidents in the united states on tuesday after a new spate of bomb threats to jewish community centers around the country and vandalism in a jewish cemetery  several of the centers were evacuated for a time on monday after receiving the threats  the jcc association of north america said  and another center was evacuated on tuesday morning in san diego  california  according to police  also  vandals toppled about  headstones at the chesed shel emeth society cemetery in st  louis  missouri  over the weekend   the anti semitic threats targeting our jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil   trump told reporters   he was speaking at the end of a tour of the national museum of african american history and culture in washington  which trump said showed  why we have to fight bigotry  intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms   the comments marked a change for trump  who had not explicitly and publicly condemned the threats against jews when asked last week  instead  he spoke more generally about his hopes of making the nation less  divided   the president reacted with anger at a news conference last week when a journalist from a jewish magazine asked how his government planned to  take care  of a rise in threats  trump berated the reporter for asking a  very insulting  question  appearing to believe the reporter was accusing him of being anti semitic   number one  i am the least anti semitic person that you ve ever seen in your entire life   the president said  adding that he was also the least racist person  trump has often noted that one of his daughters is a convert to judaism  he has jewish grandchildren and he employs many jews in his business   trump s daughter ivanka  a close adviser to her father who practices orthodox judaism  responded to the latest threats in a message on her twitter account on monday evening   america is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance   she said   we must protect our houses of worship   religious centers     on tuesday  trump again declined to answer a question about what action he would take to address the threats to jewish organizations  sean spicer  a white house spokesman  said later that trump would respond through  deed and action  over the coming months and years   band aid   trump s derogatory campaign rhetoric against muslims and mexican immigrants won enthusiastic backing from prominent white supremacists who embrace anti jewish  anti black and anti muslim ideologies  it also drew greater media attention to fringe extremist groups   trump has disavowed their support  his chief strategist  steve bannon  is the former publisher of breitbart  a news website popular among right wing extremist groups  the anne frank center for mutual respect in new york  which has criticized the trump administration repeatedly over anti semitism  said his comments were too little too late   the president s sudden acknowledgement is a band aid on the cancer of anti semitism that has infected his own administration   steven goldstein  the group s executive director  said in a statement  spicer rejected the characterization   i wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area   he told reporters when asked about goldstein s comment   hopefully as time goes by they ll recognize his commitment to civil rights   jewish groups criticized the white house for omitting any mention of jews in its statement marking holocaust memorial day last month  the white house said the omission was deliberate since the nazis also killed people who were not jews  if in smaller numbers  the stated goal of the nazis was the extermination of jews  one day after speaking at a security summit in munich  u s  vice president mike pence spent sunday morning walking through the grounds of the dachau concentration camp in germany with a camp survivor   over the course of the u s  presidents day holiday on monday  bomb threats were sent to  jewish community centers  including ones in the houston  chicago and milwaukee areas  according to the jcc association  they were found to be hoaxes  as was another threat that forced the evacuation of a center in san diego on tuesday morning  according to police  no arrests were made  the fbi has said it is investigating recent threats as  possible civil rights violations   the council on american islamic relations  a prominent muslim human rights group  has offered a    reward for information leading to the conviction of anyone behind the threats  saying muslims felt a duty to support any targeted minority group  the incidents on monday followed three waves of bomb threats so far this year  in all  at least  incidents at  jewish community centers in  states and one canadian province have been reported  according to the jcc association
