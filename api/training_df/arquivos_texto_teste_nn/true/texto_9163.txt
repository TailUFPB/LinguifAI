washington  reuters    as she waits for the u s  supreme court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive texas abortion law  amy hagstrom miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state  but is planning for it just in case      hagstrom miller founded whole woman s health  which runs four facilities in texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law  she said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive  and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in fort worth  san antonio and mcallen       i would be irresponsible if i didn t plan   hagstrom miller said in an interview  the supreme court is due to rule by the end of june on whether the texas law  which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities  violates a woman s constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark  roe v  wade ruling  the court has not issued a major abortion related ruling since       the law requires abortion doctors to have  admitting privileges   a type of formal affiliation  at a hospital within  miles   km  of the clinic  that provision has been implemented  a second provision  not yet in effect  requires clinics to have costly hospital grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width  room size  floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors  supporters of the law  passed by a republican led legislature and signed by a republican governor in   say it was enacted to protect women s health      abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in texas  the second most populous u s  state with about  million people  getting a clear cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices  split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals  following the february death of conservative antonin scalia  one possibility is a   split that would affirm a lower court s decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes  because it is unlikely one of the court s liberals would join the four conservatives  there is almost no chance of a  broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures  numerous republican governed states have considered measures that would restrict abortion availability  for abortion opponents  who no longer have scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor  a   split leaving the texas law in place may be the best result possible  john eastman  a professor at chapman university school of law in california  an abortion opponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the texas law  said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling   it s not a catastrophe    i d rather have women s health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country   eastman said  legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states  including mississippi  louisiana and wisconsin      if the court leaves in place the lower court ruling upholding the texas law  the number of abortion clinics in the state would drop from the current  to nine  abortion providers said  texas had  abortion clinics when the law was passed       a   decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman s ability to get an abortion will depend on where she lives   said jennifer dalven  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  which opposes restrictive abortion laws       another possibility is that the justices strike down the law  or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other  it may be more likely that the admitting privileges provision  already in effect  would survive  while the hospital grade facilities requirements  which the justices themselves temporarily blocked  would not  justice anthony kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios  which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals  kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed roe v  wade  but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions   it comes down to justice kennedy  and during the argument he didn t show his hand too much   said john seago  the anti abortion group texas right to life s legislative director  adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents  ideas about what laws we could pass   another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings  as kennedy suggested during march  oral arguments   it s overwhelming for me when i think what could happen if it s not a favorable decision   said dr  bhavik kumar  who performs abortions at two texas whole woman s health clinics   i try not to think about it every minute of every day
