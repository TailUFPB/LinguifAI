 reuters    when former president bill clinton called parts of obamacare  crazy   he put his wife hillary clinton on the defensive and gave much needed ammunition to her republican rival for the presidency  donald trump  who wants to scrap it  bill clinton said this month that while millions more americans now have insurance coverage under president barack obama s signature  healthcare law  small businesses and some families are still  getting killed  by surging healthcare costs  he later clarified that he was not criticizing the entire  initiative  he was just making an argument for fixing it   still  clinton s comments may not have been so crazy  he put a spotlight on an uncomfortable truth  after six years  billions of dollars and a sweeping reform that stands as obama s single biggest domestic policy achievement  health care is still unaffordable for many americans  americans are growing increasingly anxious about rising healthcare costs  and critics of the law have said it is not living up to its promises  two of the nation s largest health insurers  aetna and united healthcare  are also pulling out of the state based health insurance exchanges that are the best known creations of obamacare  clinton says she wants to save the best of obamacare  also known as the affordable care act  while reducing costs  trump says it is an expensive  disaster  that is on track to implode in   he wants to replace it with something cheaper  whoever wins the presidency on nov   will likely face pressure to move quickly to reshape a healthcare initiative that affects millions of americans  republicans opposed obamacare from the start  labeling it a government intrusion into the healthcare market  some of them say the individual exchanges where americans shop online for coverage are already in a  death spiral   they warn that with fewer consumers using the exchanges  more health insurers will exit them  sending premiums even higher  and further deterring people from signing up  as the u s  population ages  u s  spending on healthcare      trillion in    is projected to rise to more than one fifth of the nation s gross domestic product  spending rates under obamacare did slow for a time  but they are on the rise again  trump has proposed getting rid of the exchanges and setting up tax free health savings accounts for people with high deductible insurance plans  he has also said he would set up state based high risk pools for people with medical conditions that make it hard to get coverage on their own  he also wants to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines to boost competition and drive down prices  his advisers say he would draw on a plan proposed by republicans in the u s  house of representatives  which includes a refundable tax credit to help americans buy individual plans  republicans  like trump  also want to change how they fund medicaid  which serves poor families  obamacare increased federal funding to states that expanded the program to more people with low incomes  now trump wants to limit funding by switching to pre set  block grants  health policy experts are skeptical selling insurance across state lines would do much to rein in health insurance costs  and health wonks on both sides of the aisle said republicans would likely balk at any proposals that threatened to yank health insurance away from  million people   even republican members of the house and the senate are going to end up resisting rolling back the medicaid expansion if that means that lots of people in their states would go uninsured   said jim capretta  a health policy expert at the right leaning american enterprise institute   liberals like former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders haven t called obamacare crazy  but sanders does believe it doesn t go nearly far enough  during his campaign  he proposed replacing it with a single payer insurance system he called  medicare for all   based on the government plan for elderly and disabled americans  hillary clinton s plan doesn t go that far  but she would build on obamacare by expanding tax credits for people shopping on the individual marketplaces  letting americans buy into medicare at a younger age  and adding a  public option   or a government run insurance plan to compete with private insurers on the exchanges   she has also proposed reducing americans  out of pocket expenses outside their private insurance by offering a new refundable tax credit  and she would give states more federal funding to expand medicaid for low income people  two thirds of states expanded medicaid under the  law  and that s where most of the newly insured people got coverage  policy experts said that after obama leaves office  more republican led states that objected to a plan so closely identified with obama might be willing to expand medicaid too   clinton s ability to expand tax incentives likely depends on which party controls the u s  congress  and while some states could act independently to launch public plans on their exchanges  many republicans view the idea as wildly expensive and would strongly resist any effort by clinton to require them nationwide  obamacare did little to deal with soaring drug prices for lifesaving treatments like mylan nv s epipen  democrats and republicans say that s a problem for the next president  even though it s getting little attention on the campaign trail  trump and clinton both want americans to be allowed to buy cheaper drugs from overseas  americans pay the highest prices in the world for drugs   former democratic u s  representative henry waxman made a similar proposal in   but he was defeated by pressure from drug companies  which would likely oppose it again   clinton says medicare should negotiate drug prices with companies  using its  million users to get a better deal  trump made a similar call during the republican primaries but it does not appear on his campaign website now  some health policy experts believe drug companies would respond to lower prices for medicare patients by raising prices for everyone else  and to negotiate better prices  medicare would have to be willing to stop covering certain drugs  which would be unpopular  they say  clinton has also suggested creating a commission that would watch for sudden spikes in prices of older life saving drugs  a proposal that health policy experts said is achievable through rule making rather than legislation  she has also proposed a cap on drug co payments  clinton has already put wall street on watch  her tweets have brought down shares of mylan and valeant pharmaceuticals international  which helped push many institutional investors out of healthcare stocks  drug companies are already responding to political pressure  botox maker allergan inc  for example  recently committed to keeping price increases below  percent
