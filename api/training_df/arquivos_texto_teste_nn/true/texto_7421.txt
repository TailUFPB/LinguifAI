islamabad  reuters    donald trump s surprise election as u s  president has pakistanis wary that he may accelerate what they see as a shift in american policy to favor arch foe india in the long rivalry between nuclear armed neighbors  analysts said on wednesday  historical allies in the region  islamabad and washington have seen relations sour over u s  accusations that pakistan shelters islamist militants  a charge pakistan denies  they hit new lows in may when a u s  drone killed the leader of the afghan taliban movement on pakistani territory  at the same time  pakistan s ties with traditional rival india have also deteriorated this year  with india saying pakistan based militants killed  of its soldiers in a september attack on an army base in the disputed kashmir region  to many pakistanis  trump s anti muslim rhetoric   he once proposed banning muslims entering the united states   and business ties to india are signs that his administration could shift further toward new delhi   america will not abandon pakistan  but definitely  trump will be a tougher president than hillary clinton for pakistan   said hasan askari rizvi  lahore based foreign policy analyst   i think india will have a better and smoother interaction compared to pakistan   trump has yet to lay out a detailed policy for south asia  although he recently offered to mediate between india and pakistan in their dispute over the divided territory of kashmir  he also told fox news in may he would favor keeping nearly   u s  troops in afghanistan  because it s adjacent and right next to pakistan which has nuclear weapons   on wednesday  a u s  diplomat in pakistan sought to assure the country that trump s election did not signal a drastic policy change   our foreign policy is based on national interest and they don t change when the government changes   grace shelton  u s  consul general in karachi  told geo news television  pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif congratulated trump   your election is indeed the triumph of the american people and their enduring faith in the ideals of democracy  freedom  human rights and free enterprise   sharif said in a statement  still  the uncertainty of a trump presidency has many pakistanis on edge  even if the country has leaned towards china in recent years for investment and diplomatic support   trump is a bit of a wild card   said sherry rehman  a pakistani senator and former ambassador to the united states       pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever america elects  but his anti muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty   indian prime minister narendra modi also congratulated trump on wednesday    we look forward to working with you closely to take india us bilateral ties to a new height   modi said in a tweet  trump has partnered with indian businessmen on a handful of real estate ventures  but apart from courting the indian american vote he has not articulated how he would develop the bilateral relationship  india u s  ties have flourished under president barack obama and modi  who came to power in   with the two countries striking key defense agreements this year  modi s government has also waged a campaign to isolate pakistan diplomatically  shaurya doval  director of the india foundation  a think tank close to modi s government  called trump s election  a very positive development   but added that india and the united states would have continued to grow closer under a hillary clinton presidency as well   my sense is that india u s  relations are not dependent on individuals   there are strong institutions and processes there   he said  one fringe hindu nationalist group in india held a victory gathering at new delhi s speakers  corner on wednesday   he s an american nationalist  we are indian nationalists  only he can understand us   rashmi gupta of the hindu sena  or hindu army  told reuters   we expect him to support us when it comes to terrorist attacks on india from pakistan   trump will also have to decide whether to maintain the number of u s  troops in afghanistan or change the scope of the mission   years after a u s  led campaign toppled the hardline islamist taliban government      the united states has spent some   billion in aid for afghanistan since   but the country is still caught in conflict  with a third of the country out of government control and thousands of afghan civilians  soldiers and police dying every year  afghan officials have voiced concern that the conflict is being forgotten in washington  and warned privately that the west will pay a huge price if that continues       the people of afghanistan are tired of war  we want  trump  to invest heavily in bringing peace to war torn afghanistan and stabilize our region   said umer daudzai  former afghan minister of interior  obama s original aim of pulling out of afghanistan entirely has been put on hold in the face of mounting gains by taliban militants  with u s  air power and special forces still regularly involved in combat      as recently as last week  two u s  green berets were killed near the northern city of kunduz  although afghan security forces have been fighting largely alone since the end of the main nato led combat mission in   their performance has been patchy and they continue to rely heavily on u s  air power  the taliban on wednesday urged trump to withdraw all u s  troops   they should not cause damage to their economy and their military in this failed war   taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid said of the american government in a statement
