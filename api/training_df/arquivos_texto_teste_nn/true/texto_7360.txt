new york  reuters    republican president elect donald trump vowed on the campaign trail to repeal obamacare  but making good on that promise may be easier said than done  president barack obama s  national healthcare reform law extended medical insurance to  million more people by expanding the medicaid plan for the poor and creating subsidized coverage for individuals  republican lawmakers  who have voted more than  times to repeal all or part of the law  have begun pressing trump to deliver  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday repealing obamacare is a  pretty high item on our agenda  for the new congress  but a complete repeal of obama s affordable care act may not be immediately in the cards  as republican lawmakers now hold  seats in the senate at latest count  well short of the  seats required to overturn it  instead  health policy experts said  trump could try to dismantle key elements through a process called budget reconciliation  that would allow him to eliminate funding for the income based subsidies that make the new insurance plans affordable  or cut the money providing expanded medicaid benefits in  states   some of the policy experts on the republican side would say tearing it up and starting over would be very disruptive   said paul howard  director of health policy at the conservative manhattan institute  parts of the law have been weakened through legal challenges  several of the largest u s  health insurers have pulled out of the exchanges for individual coverage after losing money on a sicker than expected group of patients  consumers not eligible for government subsidies have seen premiums rise sharply  including a projected average increase of  percent for   scrapping the law altogether without a clear plan for providing replacement coverage for so many people would be politically risky  experts said   trump also would face a tight deadline were he to try to dismantle the insurance exchanges by   many state based health insurance regulators require insurers to submit plans for the upcoming year by april or may   only a few months into a new administration  trump also could seek changes to other provisions of the law  such as a tax on medical device makers  or the so called  cadillac tax  that is due to hit rich employer based healthcare plans in   however  some elements could not be eliminated by depriving the law of funds  for instance  the law prevents insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health or pricing insurance based on gender  mandatory coverage of preventive benefits also would be unaffected   short of a complete repeal  it also is not clear if trump would try to reverse the individual mandate  which requires people to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty  the goal of the requirement was to broaden the pool of policyholders to include more healthy americans  aetna chief executive officer mark bertolini said on thursday at a new york times dealbook conference that some elements of the law are so popular that they are likely to continue  even if there is something trump calls  repeal   they include allowing young adults to stay on their parents  plans and people with health problems to buy insurance without paying more  medicaid could continue to expand  he said  though with a different type of federal financing  trump s surprise victory over democratic candidate hillary clinton rattled healthcare investors on wednesday  depressing shares in hospital operators and some insurers  medicaid focused health insurer molina healthcare inc  fell nearly  percent  and hospital chain tenet healthcare corp dropped  percent  large insurers  who have been losing money on the exchanges  gained  with anthem inc  up   percent  enrollment opened on nov   for  coverage and once those plans are purchased  it would be legally difficult for trump to cancel them before the one year contracts run out  said molina healthcare chief executive officer dr  mario molina   any changes they make will have to be on a prospective basis to begin in    molina said  it s not clear what trump s plan to replace obamacare would look like  options he raised on the campaign trail include replacing the obamacare individual coverage with high deductible healthcare plans  and lumping the sickest people together into high risk pools that are insured separately   i think there is going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of anxious people   molina said  among the worries for some people covered under obamacare is how long it will last  before the law took effect  marc dobin  a  year old mediator and lawyer in jupiter  florida  said his insurer put a surcharge on his premium because he has heart stents  under obamacare  insurers are barred from charging more for pre existing conditions   imagine the disaster if  part way through the year  they cancel it   dobin said  for others  the cost of premiums bolstered their support for trump  crista simmons    a piano teacher in kalamazoo  michigan  spends about a third of her gross income on premiums and medical care   there are people who pay more in premiums than their mortgage   she said
