 reuters    having spent billions of dollars on post crisis u s  financial industry reforms they once scorned  bankers are concerned the trump administration  joined by a like minded congress  will scrap or significantly change the rules  to comply with a rule known as dodd frank  which was enacted in  following the financial crisis  big u s banks hired tens of thousands of staffers  built new technology systems  hived off businesses  simplified corporate structures and doubled the amount of capital they hold  jpmorgan chase   co has said that in its mortgage business alone  employees spent   hours in compliance training in a single year  the industry went into these changes kicking and screaming  banks lobbied hard against dodd frank as it was being drafted  then cajoled regulators to go easy in defining and implementing precise rules  but now that the heavy lifting has been done and dodd frank is largely in effect  the industry see a total  elimination as more of a threat than a blessing  dodd frank has largely made banks safer and the once opaque derivatives market more transparent  banking executives said   president elect donald trump  who takes office on jan    and some important lawmakers in the incoming republican congress have pledged to dismantle the law and put a new one in place  it is not yet clear what the replacement would look like  but texas republican jeb hensarling  who chairs the house financial services committee  has drafted a blueprint called the choice act  the proposal has a mix of things the industry largely supports  such as abolishing the u s  consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   but it also has some ideas wall street vehemently opposes  like ramping up capital requirements to a level that would likely force big banks to split apart  proposed changes are also likely to run into stiff opposition from some congressional democrats  particularly senator elizabeth warren  architect of the cfpb  big u s  banks including jpmorgan  bank of america corp  citigroup inc  wells fargo   co  goldman sachs group inc and morgan stanley have seen big gains in their share prices since the nov   election  partly on expectations that regulators will soon have a much lighter touch   there is scope for lower taxes  less regulation  and more growth   morgan stanley analysts said in a report on tuesday recommending big bank stocks  however  bankers  lawyers and consultants who spoke to reuters said any big rollback in rulemaking could take several years to implement and may introduce more costs   one of the dangers of dismantling regulation is that it will be costly and disruptive   said mike alix  a consultant at pwc who works with banks on regulatory matters   by and large they ve gotten themselves into shape and they re not looking to get out of shape   industry sources said they are hoping it s possible to roll back some elements of dodd frank that they view as too onerous or misguided  without scrapping the entire law  for instance  many would like to see the volcker rule  which places restrictions on proprietary trading  go away  the rule was intended to prevent federally insured banks from placing speculative bets in the markets  and would be repealed as part of hensarling s plan  some banks are taking a second look at compliance initiatives until they gain further clarity on what will happen in washington  at a conference this month  bank of america corp chief operating officer tom montag said he is being  a little more cautious  about compliance spending  it is difficult to know whether it is worth spending another   million on volcker rule compliance  he said  because doing so may be a waste of money but not doing so could leave the bank at risk if the rule is implemented as planned   even if volcker doesn t go away  there are still questions about how tough the enforcement would be   said mark nuccio  who leads the bank regulatory practice at law firm ropes   gray llp   banks are deciding they may take the foot off the gas pedal now and just see what happens
