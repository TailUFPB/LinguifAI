washington  reuters    contractors likely breached security and handed over documents describing the central intelligence agency s use of hacking tools to anti secrecy group wikileaks  u s  intelligence and law enforcement officials told reuters on wednesday  two officials speaking on condition of anonymity said intelligence agencies have been aware since the end of last year of the breach  which led to wikileaks releasing thousands of pages of information on its website on tuesday  according to the documents  cia hackers could get into apple inc  aapl o  iphones  devices running google s android software and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software  the white house said on wednesday that president donald trump was  extremely concerned  about the cia security breach that led to the wikileaks release   anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law   spokesman sean spicer said  the two officials told reuters they believed the published documents about cia hacking techniques used between  and  were authentic  one of the officials with knowledge of the investigation said companies that are contractors for the cia have been checking to see which of their employees had access to the material that wikileaks published  and then going over their computer logs  emails and other communications for any evidence of who might be responsible  on tuesday in a press release  wikileaks itself said the cia had  lost control  of an archive of hacking methods and it  appeared to have been circulated  among former u s  government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner  one of whom has provided wikileaks with portions of the archive   the cia  which is the united states  civilian foreign intelligence service  declined to comment on the authenticity of purported intelligence documents   the agency said in a statement that its mission was to collect foreign intelligence abroad  to protect america from terrorists  hostile nation states and other adversaries  and to be  innovative  cutting edge  and the first line of defense in protecting this country from enemies abroad   the cia is legally prohibited from surveillance inside the united states and  does not do so   the statement added  a u s  government source familiar with the matter said it would be normal for the federal bureau of investigation and the cia both to open investigations into such leaks  u s  officials previously have confirmed that prosecutors in alexandria  virginia for years have been conducting a federal grand jury investigation of wikileaks and its personnel   a spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment on the possibility of that probe being expanded  it is not clear if the investigation of the latest cia leaks is part of the probe  contractors have been revealed as the source of sensitive government information leaks in recent years  most notably edward snowden and harold thomas martin  both employed by consulting firm booz allen hamilton  bah n  while working for the national security agency   u s  senator dianne feinstein of california and a democrat on the intelligence committee  said the government needed to stop the breaches     i think we really need to take a look at the contractor portion of the employee workforce  because you have to be loyal to america to work for an intelligence agency  otherwise don t do it   feinstein said  both u s  senate and u s  house of representatives intelligence committees have either opened or are expected to open inquiries into the cia breach  congressional officials said  some cyber security experts and technology companies have criticized the government for opting to exploit rather than disclose software vulnerabilities  though an interagency review process set up under former president barack obama was intended to err on the side of disclosure  those concerns would grow if u s  authorities did not notify companies that cia documents describing various hacking techniques had been compromised  apple  alphabet inc s  googl o  google  cisco systems inc  csco o  and oracle corp  orcl n  did not immediately respond when asked if they were notified of a cia breach before wikileaks made its files public  at apple  none of the vulnerabilities described in the documents provoked a panic  though analysis was continuing  according to a person who spoke with engineers there  google s director of information security and privacy   heather adkins  said in a statement   as we ve reviewed the documents  we re confident that security updates and protections in both chrome and android  operating systems  already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities  our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections   one reason the investigation is focused on a potential leak by contractors rather than for example a hack by russian intelligence  another official said  is that so far there is no evidence that russian intelligence agencies tried to exploit any of the leaked material before it was published  one european official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the wikileaks material could in fact lead to closer cooperation between european intelligence agencies and u s  counterparts  which share concerns about russian intelligence operations  u s  intelligence agencies have accused russia of seeking to tilt last year s u s  presidential election in trump s favor   including by hacking into democratic party emails  moscow has denied the allegation  one major security problem was that the number of contractors with access to information with the highest secrecy classification has  exploded  because of federal budget constraints  the first u s  official said  u s  intelligence agencies have been unable to hire additional permanent staff needed to keep pace with technological advances such as the  internet of things  that connects cars  home security and heating systems and other devices to computer networks  or to pay salaries competitive with the private sector  the official said  reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents   a person familiar with wikileaks  activities said the group has had the cia hacking material for months  and that the release of the material was in the works  for a long time   in germany on wednesday  the chief federal prosecutor s office said that it would review the wikileaks documents because some suggested that the cia ran a hacking hub from the u s  consulate in frankfurt   we will initiate an investigation if we see evidence of concrete criminal acts or specific perpetrators   a spokesman for the federal prosecutor s office told reuters  chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to visit washington on march  for her first meeting with trump  who has sharply criticized berlin for everything from its trade policy to what he considers inadequate levels of military spending
