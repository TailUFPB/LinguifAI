philadelphia  reuters    twelve years ago  barack obama s electrifying speech at the democratic national convention brought tears to andrew gillum s eyes  now mayor of tallahassee  florida  and viewed as a rising star in that state  gillum did not hesitate when asked to name his political role model    elizabeth warren   he replied  referring to the firebrand u s  senator from massachusetts   that the  year old african american mayor of a southern u s  city identifies warren as his political lodestar speaks volumes about the democratic party s progressive shift  even as hillary clinton officially became its presidential nominee after a quarter century in the public eye  with the party in transition  clinton s  era brand of democratic centrism is slowly being eclipsed by a wave of progressivism personified by warren and by u s  senator bernie sanders  a rival of clinton s until he endorsed her this month  although sanders  insurgent presidential bid fell short  leaving his supporters bitterly disappointed  a new crop of democratic candidates seems determined to carry on his work  with warren    as their putative leader   like obama in   gillum and many others at the philadelphia convention sought to boost their profiles  raise cash and network with fellow democrats  buoyed by the adoption of the most progressive platform in party history  with planks for debt free college  expanded social security benefits and a tax on carbon emissions  clinton  too  has moved to the left  embracing many of these causes  separating herself from a more moderate brand of democratic politics personified by her husband  former president bill clinton  who was pro free trade  friendlier to wall street and emphasized budget discipline   she appealed to sanders supporters during her speech accepting the party s presidential nomination on thursday  pledging to work with him on progressive issues   let s go out there and make it happen together   clinton said   sarah lloyd    a congressional candidate in wisconsin who supported sanders  said   there is an energy that s coming from the folks that were brought to the process by the sanders campaign     that can only be a positive thing for the party   more than sanders  warren has taken the lead in shaping the democrats  next generation  formerly a professor of law  warren conceived and set up the consumer financial protection bureau formed in  under president obama  she launched a political action committee to back democratic candidates and inspired other advocacy groups  such as the progressive change campaign committee  to solicit donations to a bloc it terms the party s  warren wing   a speaker at the convention  florida s gillum was frustrated by sanders because he seemed disinterested in helping other democratic candidates  in contrast with warren    senator sanders was content to be a movement by himself   gillum said   it s a revolution when you bring people along with you    warren s committee has donated to the campaigns of u s  senate hopefuls such as kamala harris    of california  jason kander    of missouri  and catherine cortez masto    of nevada  they and wisconsin s lloyd oppose the trans pacific partnership  the global trade deal that has split the progressive and moderate elements of the party  the pccc s slate of  warren wing  candidates supports a   an hour minimum wage  campaign finance reform and tighter rules for wall street   one of those on the slate is zephyr teachout  a candidate for the u s  house of representatives in new york  who has campaigned in a t shirt that reads   i m from the elizabeth warren wing of the party  and who has been endorsed by sanders    there is a rising and very important populism  talking about money in politics  talking about trade  talking about economic issues   teachout    told reuters   within the party  and across the board  there has been a serious rethinking of trade  rethinking of big banks  rethinking of monopolies that have too much power   tulsi gabbard  a u s  representative from hawaii  is often mentioned by sanders supporters as one who could assume his mantle  a cable news regular  gabbard    was one of a few sanders supporters offered a convention speaking slot  onstage she formally nominated sanders for president  saying he had become a  voice for millions  connecting seamlessly with laborers in the rust belt and environmentalists in the west   other rising democratic progressives frequently cited by strategists include julian castro    the u s  housing secretary  and his twin brother  representative joaquin castro of texas  former ohio state senator nina turner    u s  senate candidate pramila jayapal    of washington  and former south carolina lawmaker bakari sellers    harris might be the one to shine the brightest  as california s attorney general  harris has been mentioned as a potential u s  presidential candidate or u s  supreme court justice should she win her senate race in november  she enjoys the support of warren  obama  vice president joe biden and former new york city mayor  michael bloomberg  a republican turned independent  suggesting she can appeal to both the party s liberal and moderate flanks   she joined forces with bloomberg in his crusade for tighter gun laws  bonded with warren over helping homeowners struggling through the foreclosure crisis of the late  and joined obama s efforts to overhaul a criminal justice system that tends to treat black citizens more harshly than white ones  in one campaign ad  warren is viewed saying   kamala harris was fearless   harris  in turn  has backed clinton  in an interview  she rejected the idea that the party is leaving clinton behind even as it nominates her for president    i strongly believe that these two generations have much more in common than what separates them in terms of fundamental values   harris said
