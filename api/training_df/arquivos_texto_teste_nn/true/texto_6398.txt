washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump said on wednesday he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons while president  an arrangement that watchdogs said would not prevent conflicts of interest in the white house  trump told a news conference he would resign from all positions overseeing his hotels  golf courses and hundreds of other businesses and move his assets into a trust to help ensure that he will not consciously take actions as president that would benefit him personally  trump  a republican  is under pressure to distance himself from his businesses before he moves into the white house on jan    unlike other u s  government officials  the president is not required by law to steer clear of conflicts of interest   i could actually run my business and run government at the same time  i don t like the way that looks  but i would be able to do that if i wanted to   trump said  ethics experts said the arrangement did not go far enough   mr  trump s ill advised course will precipitate scandal and corruption   said norman eisen  a former white house ethics adviser under democratic president barack obama  walter shaub  director of the u s  office of government ethics  said on wednesday in a speech at a washington think tank that his office recommends trump  divest his conflicting assets  to avoid conflicts  trump appears to be still involved with his business while preparing to take office  saying he had turned down a   billion development deal in dubai he had been offered over the weekend  the company that made the proposal  damac  confirmed the discussions had taken place  the trump organization will not enter into any new overseas deals while trump is president and will only undertake domestic projects after a company ethics adviser has approved them  said trump adviser sheri dillon  details of how the ethics adviser would operate  as well as several other aspects of the arrangements  were not immediately clear  trump will only know of those deals if he hears about them through the news media  said dillon  a lawyer at morgan lewis who focuses on tax and ethics  trump s daughter  ivanka  will have no further involvement in managing the organization or her own clothing brand  ivanka trump said on her facebook page that she would take time off to settle her family into their new home in washington  the president elect has named her husband  jared kushner  to a senior advisory role in the white house  since trump sold all his stocks last year  the trump trust will hold only business assets and liquid assets such as cash  dillon said   a financial disclosure document he filed in may also showed loans from lenders such as deutsche bank  dbkgn de  and ladder capital  ladr k   trump will not have to file a new disclosure form until   many other ethics experts  including the u s  office of government ethics  have urged trump to completely divest or set up a blind trust for his assets  in a blind trust  the owner does now know what the holdings are or how the assets are managed  trump s oldest sons  eric and donald jr   will be running his business  so the arrangement does not meet that standard  dillon said that was not a realistic possibility for a family owned company and any sudden divestment would hurt trump financially  unlike liquid assets like stocks and investment funds  much of trump s wealth comes from office towers and other real estate that cannot be sold easily  as well as licensing deals that could be difficult to unwind  stripped of the trump name  many of these assets would lose much of their value  dillon said   president elect trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built   she said  dillon dismissed concerns that trump could violate an anti bribery provision in the u s  constitution  known as the emoluments clause  that applies to gifts  but not business transactions like renting a hotel room  she said  nevertheless  profits generated at trump s hotels by foreign governments will be donated to the u s  treasury  she said
