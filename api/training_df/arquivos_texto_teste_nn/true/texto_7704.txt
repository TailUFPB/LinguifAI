washington  reuters    the republican leaders of the u s  house of representatives plan a vote as soon as mid november on a  year reauthorization of the iran sanctions act  congressional aides told reuters on tuesday  setting up a potential showdown with the white house and senate  the iran sanctions act  or isa  which expires on dec    allows trade  energy  defense and banking industry sanctions over iran s nuclear program and ballistic missile tests   its fate is one of the major pieces of unfinished business facing lawmakers when they return to washington on nov   for the first time after the nov   elections  u s  representative ed royce  the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  is expected to introduce the  year renewal as soon as congress gets back  aides said  congressional aides said a  clean  renewal  meaning unchanged from the current legislation  was likely to pass the house  its fate in the senate was much less certain  and a white house spokesman would not say whether president barack obama would sign it into law  republicans control majorities in both the house and senate  and every republican in congress opposed the international nuclear deal announced in july   in which iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions  republicans have since tried repeatedly to pass legislation to clamp down on iran  accusing obama of being so eager to burnish his foreign policy legacy that he conceded too much to tehran in the nuclear talks  some senate republicans want more than a clean renewal of the isa  they are trying to build support for legislation that would renew it but also do more to punish individual iranians and businesses over the country s ballistic missile tests and what they see as its support for terrorism  some senators have also pushed for a law that would eliminate the president s right to waive sanctions for security reasons  obama s administration had asked congress to hold off on renewing the isa  saying it has enough power to reimpose economic sanctions if iran violates the nuclear agreement even if it expires  white house spokesman josh earnest declined to say how obama would respond to the bill if it passed both houses of congress and reached his desk   i won t prejudge at this point whether or not the president would sign that bill   earnest told reporters traveling with the president in los angeles   the president and the treasury department retain significant sanctions authority that already has been used to impose costs on iran for their flagrant violation of their international obligations   he said   white house opposition to the bill could generate resistance from democrats in the senate  making it more difficult for any legislation to garner the  votes needed to move ahead  because republicans hold only  seats in the  member chamber  they would need democratic support to move any bill  renewing the sanctions bill could also increase frustrations in iran  iranian officials have been complaining for months that remaining u s  sanctions have frightened away trade partners and robbed it of too many benefits it was promised under the nuclear deal  a house foreign affairs committee aide said addressing the isa before it expires is a  top priority  for royce   the iran sanctions act was enacted to curb tehran s support for terrorism and its very dangerous weapons proliferation  it should remain in place until the regime stops exporting terror and threatening us and our allies with deadly weapons   royce said in a statement sent to reuters   that s why i ll be introducing a bipartisan  long term extension of these important sanctions   he said
