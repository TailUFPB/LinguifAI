traditionally democratic states   in the u s  rust belt after promising to create jobs and to review or cancel trade deals that he said were bad for workers   national labor leaders had urged their rank and file members to back clinton  saying trump s appointments and policies would not align with his promises to workers  labor leaders have been girding for trump to appoint pro business

at united technologies corp s carrier plant in indianapolis  criticized trump for inflating the number of jobs that would be saved by his intervention in the company s decision to move some production

union jobs and  management positions  trump said last week that a deal by indiana to give the company   million in tax breaks would keep   jobs in the region    our people  at that point in time  got their hopes back up that they might have a job   jones told cnbc on thursday   all he had to do is come back and say i was misled by  united technologies    jones said about trump   instead of doing that he goes on the attack on me
