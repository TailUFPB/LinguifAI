 reuters    for the scores of photographers on the  u s  presidential campaign trail  capturing the characters  the color and the vibe of the election often means turning away from the speaker on the podium   the audience  the voters and the candidate are equally important   said brian snyder  who has been a photographer for reuters for more than  years    the voters need the candidates and the candidates need the voters  any way you can show that visually is a good campaign picture as far as i m concerned    take  for example  the window full of young bernie sanders supporters that snyder photographed at bronx community college in new york  waving to the u s  senator from vermont  sanders won enthusiastic support from young people in his hard fought race against the eventual presumptive democratic nominee  hillary clinton  or look at the tree with umbrellas hanging to dry on it outside a rainy sanders rally in buffalo  new york  after the secret service prevented supporters from carrying them inside   i m sure one person did it  and then the other person thought it was a good idea  and then the next thing you know  there are  umbrellas   snyder said   it was just one of those funny things   veteran reuters photographer mike segar described covering this year s u s  presidential campaign as  strangely fun    in a  year reuters career  segar has covered five presidential elections  but said that this one was different  especially with new york businessman donald trump  who became the presumptive republican nominee  playing a starring role   the tone of the trump campaign makes everything different for everybody   segar said  he added that heightened security around trump had also impacted how photographers illustrate the campaign         segar took a photograph of one of his own meals when he was covering a clinton rally  hamburger meat on a bed of undressed spinach in a tinfoil to go container    i was trying to give viewers a little bit of a different taste of what we see on a day to day basis   segar said with a laugh    your photos don t necessarily have to capture the most earth shattering moments of the campaign  but they have to capture people s interest   reuters photographer lucas jackson said he always looked for a different angle at rallies  in one of his photos  young reporters can be seen staring into the screens of their macbook laptops at a sanders rally in pennsylvania   usually cameras are pointed at the candidate   jackson said   i m always looking to add context
