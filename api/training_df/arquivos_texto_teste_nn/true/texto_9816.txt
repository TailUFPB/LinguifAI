washington  reuters    former virginia governor robert mcdonnell contends that if the supreme court agrees with prosecutors  broad view of bribery law and allows his corruption convictions to stand  it would make a politician s ordinary interactions with donors a crime and upend the u s  political process  the eight justices will hear arguments on wednesday in the appeal by mcdonnell  a former rising star in the republican party  of his  conviction arising from gifts from a businessman who sought to promote a dietary supplement  it is the final case they will hear in their term that ends in june  the legal question concerns whether mcdonnell s conduct constituted  official action  in exchange for a thing of value  as required for conviction under federal bribery law  his lawyers contend he merely arranged meetings  asked questions and attended events  the same type of activities that politicians routinely perform in exchange for campaign contributions    this case marks the first time in our history that a public official has been convicted of corruption despite never agreeing to put a thumb on the scales of any government decision   his lead lawyer noel francisco told the justices in legal papers   officials routinely arrange meetings for donors  take their calls  politely listen to their ideas  and refer them to aides  in criminalizing those everyday acts  the government has put every federal  state and local official nationwide in its prosecutorial crosshairs   francisco added  in court papers  u s  solicitor general donald verrilli said the justices in the past have carefully distinguished  general ingratiation  between a politician and a donor from  quid pro quo exchanges   for example  a governor s demanding a    contribution as the price of an official meeting    but no such issue arose here  because the bribes in this case were personal loans and luxury goods  not campaign contributions   verrilli said  mcdonnell  a former rising star in the republican party  and his wife  maureen  were convicted in  of taking    in gifts and loans from virginia businessman jonnie williams  mcdonnell was sentenced to two years in prison  which he has not yet served  at trial  prosecutors detailed the lavish lifestyle the mcdonnells enjoyed thanks to gifts and sweetheart loans from williams including vacations  designer clothing and shoes  the richmond based  u s  circuit court of appeals upheld mcdonnell s conviction last year   the concern is that under the lower court s definition of  official act   anything that s a means to an end     is now fair game for prosecution   said former prosecutor david debold  a white collar crime defense lawyer with the gibson  dunn   crutcher law firm  tara malloy  a lawyer with the campaign legal center campaign finance law watchdog group  said to convict a politician  prosecutors must prove  an explicit corrupt agreement  in which the defendant agrees to do something in return for the money  malloy said  that is not a factor in routine campaign contributions  malloy added
