washington  reuters    new u s  president donald trump s  america first  rhetoric and confrontational negotiating style have sparked frantic calls to the white house and congress from diplomats and lobbyists concerned the united states no longer has their back  when word swirled through washington on thursday that trump might be preparing to ease u s  sanctions on russia  worried european diplomats began calling the national security council and asking if the rumors were true  said a former u s  official familiar with the situation  the white house officials could not answer their questions because they  too  have been kept in the dark  said the former official  who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter trump s new united nations ambassador  nikki haley  sent another shiver through america s allies on friday  warning them that if they do not have washington s back  she is  taking names  and will respond   trump s foreign policy is totally unpredictable   said a senior official of the  nation european union  which trump has said is bound for a break up  defense secretary james mattis and secretary of state nominee rex tillerson  have said all the right things   the eu official said   but this could be like the iraq war policy all over again  when we saw how a segment of government decides policy  not the secretary of state   another western diplomat said foreign ambassadors were explaining their countries  positions to congress in the hope that they would find their way to the white house  other countries are expanding their lobbying efforts  at the end of last year  ukraine signed a    a month lobbying contract with haley barbour  a former republican chairman and mississippi governor  in january  the government run china council for the promotion of international trade hired husch blackwell llp  to lobby about the importation of stainless steel  according to records filed with the department of justice   some uncertainty is normal when a new u s  president finds his footing and voice on foreign affairs and installs his people in policy making slots  but in the week since his inauguration  trump has sent a blizzard of conflicting signals  and key slots at the state and defense departments and the nsc remain vacant   we re trying to figure out who is who   one european diplomat said  referring to efforts to determine whether long standing tenets of u s  foreign policy still apply  one of president trump s first major meetings  with mexican president enrique pena nieto  was canceled due to trump s demand mexico pay for a border wall he plans to build  the two spoke by telephone on friday after the cancellation  trump said wednesday he would back safe zones for refugees in syria  but gave no indication how he would coordinate this with turkey  russia and allies in europe and the middle east  presidential spokesman sean spicer s suggestion the united states would stop china from taking over territory in the south china sea and trump s jan   tweet that a threatened north korean test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  won t happen  could raise the chances of a military confrontation  asian officials said  some commentators say it s too soon for allies to panic   it is not appropriate to be too worried  but it is not appropriate not to worry at all   said fumiaki kubo  a professor of american government history at the university of tokyo  a senior official from a member of the five eyes nations that make up the world s leading intelligence sharing network said it was still important to keep intelligence channels open with washington  the grouping comprises the united states  australia  canada  britain and new zealand   we will continue to share intelligence with the americans  who supply the majority of information that circulates among the five eyes  if we hold data back from them  they could decide to do the same to us  and then we would suffer much worse consequences   but others suggested that the greater the uncertainty and the longer it lasts  the greater the chances of miscalculations by other nations that could harm u s  interests  the high geopolitical anxiety is most evident in east asia  where china s ambitions are colliding with longstanding u s  dominance in the pacific  during his presidential campaign  trump suggested japan and south korea  which rely on a u s  security umbrella  should defend themselves or pay washington more to do so  defense secretary mattis will make his first overseas trip next week to the two countries  a choice intended to send a  reassurance message   a trump administration official said   this is for all of the people who were concerned during the campaign that then candidate  now president trump was skeptical of our alliances and was somehow going to retreat from our traditional leadership role in the region   said the official  speaking on condition of anonymity  yet mattis has voiced sharply different opinions from trump on key questions  including the value of the nato alliance and the threat from russia  and that has led officials in tokyo and seoul to wonder who speaks for u s  policy  trump took a call from president tsai ing wen of taiwan  which beijing considers a rogue province  and has questioned washington s decades old adherence to the  one china  principle   china s attitude at the moment is very cautious  but that does not mean weak   said shi yinhong  who heads the centre for american studies at beijing s renmin university and has advised the government  allies  though  worry that instead of being based partly on shared values such as democracy  free trade  and the rule of law  their dealings with the united states might become transactional and start to resemble trump s real estate deals  we are business people  we are not going to govern this country with diplomatic niceties  we are going to govern this country as a business   said a western diplomat  quoting a trump advisor
