the world s most powerful country against the odds in tuesday s election  china  a target of trump s ire during his campaign  appealed for cooperation  mexico also struck a conciliatory tone  despite

defense burden  putin was among the first to send trump congratulations  ties between washington and moscow have become strained over the conflicts in ukraine and syria  and allegations of russian cyber attacks featured in the election campaign   it is not an easy path  but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return russian and american relations to a stable path of development

deals he says have been bad for u s  workers  and renegotiate the nuclear accord between tehran and world powers which has led to an easing of sanctions on iran  iran urged trump to stay committed to

voters showed dissatisfaction with the political establishment by voting to leave the european union  prime minister theresa may said the  enduring and special relationship  between the two countries would remain intact  but scotland s first minister  nicola sturgeon  who has often expressed distaste for trump  said many people in the united states and across the world would feel  a real sense of anxiety   nigel farage  a leader of the brexit campaign who spoke at a trump rally during the election campaign  tweeted   i hand over the mantle to  realdonaldtrump  many congratulations  you have

own in    a year in which germany  france and the netherlands hold elections  and italy and britain could also do so   hailed trump s victory   france s far right national front leader  marine le pen  said she hoped the same kind of upset would happen in france   the americans gave themselves a president of their choosing and not the one that the establishment wanted them to rubber stamp   she said

official said  quoting top national security officials  a japanese government official  speaking before trump clinched the election  urged him to send a message as soon as possible to reassure the

trump  obama and netanyahu sparred over the issue of israeli  settlements  while trump has said they should expand  palestinian president mahmoud abbas also congratulated trump  but analysts said his rule may be profoundly negative for palestinian aspirations  and despite trump s negative rhetoric about muslims during his campaign  including threats to ban them from the united states  egyptian
