washington  reuters    four u s  senators   two democrats and two republicans   introduced a bill on tuesday aimed at preventing big pharmaceutical companies from using safety rules to prevent generic drugs from coming to market  senators charles grassley  chair of the judiciary committee  and patrick leahy  the top democrat  are sponsors of the bill along with senators mike lee and amy klobuchar  the chair of the antitrust subcommittee and top democrat  respectively  the food and drug administration  which ensures the safety of the country s food and drug supply  has a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program  called rems  which is designed to ensure that the riskiest drugs are dispensed safely  but there have been complaints that the program has been misused by brand name drug companies to prevent generic manufacturers from getting the drug samples needed to market cheaper versions  generic companies also complain their drugs are not allowed to share a safety protocol  making it difficult to come to market  the bill would allow a generic manufacturer who faces either of these situations to file a lawsuit to force access to a sample or force negotiations for a safety protocol   balancing the cost of developing lifesaving medications with the need to make available affordable prescription drugs to consumers has always been a difficult task  it s a consistent topic at my town meetings   grassley said in a statement   unfortunately  we re seeing some brand name drug companies engage in anti competitive tactics that delay entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market  this bill takes important steps to ensure that our laws are not frustrated   there is a similar bill in the house of representatives which addresses the same issue but uses a different strategy  for example  it requires the generic company seeking a rems drug to get fda authorization to obtain the sample  in one of the rems disputes which is public  mylan pharmaceuticals filed a lawsuit in  against celgene corp  accusing it of using rems to prevent generic copies of thalomid and revlimid to market  the senate judiciary committee s antitrust panel will hold a hearing on its bill on june   the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america  or phrma  which counts major drugmakers among its members  said it had no immediate comment  the generic pharmaceutical association was pleased to see the bill introduced   it is worth noting and recognizing recent efforts by representatives in the branded industry to highlight the valuable role generic medicines play in driving healthcare system savings   said chip davis  gpha s president   continued use of these anticompetitive practices by certain manufacturers drives the exact opposite outcome
