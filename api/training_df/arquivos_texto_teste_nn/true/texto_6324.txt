washington  reuters    an unprecedented pre presidential inauguration feud between donald trump and intelligence agencies that soon will be under his command could harm u s  security if not quickly defused  current and former government officials said  they said morale at the cia and other agencies was already sagging because of disputes with trump over whether russian president vladimir putin ordered interference in the u s  election and over leaks about an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a private security firm suggesting moscow had compromising information on trump  unless addressed  the disputes could prompt the departure of personnel and lead those who remain to take fewer risks to counter security threats  the officials said  in the last few months  trump has expressed his willingness to deal with putin and denigrated the work of the intelligence agencies  this week  the president elect accused agencies of leaking the dossier s information to the media  but director of national intelligence james clapper said he did not believe intelligence officials were responsible for the leak   people shooting at  the cia  is pretty common  but usually it s not the president   one former senior u s  official said  trump s transition team did not reply to email messages seeking comment   i think it s a recipe for disaster   said daniel benjamin  who served in senior white house and state department counter terrorism posts under democratic presidents  benjamin  now at dartmouth college  said there was a  strong chance  people would leave and they have  tremendous value  to the private sector  complicating the situation just a week before republican trump is sworn in  two of his nominees for top security posts set a different tone at their senate confirmation hearings  heaping praise on the men and women who work in the secret world of intelligence gathering  republican congressman mike pompeo  nominee for central intelligence agency director  said on thursday that he has seen  cia personnel  walk through fire   separately  trump s nominee for u s  defense secretary  james mattis  told senators that he had a  very  very high degree of confidence  in u s  intelligence agencies   mattis also put russia at the top of a list of threats to u s  interests  a top official at one intelligence agency said a growing number of intelligence officers over the age of  and with at least  years of service  including at least five years overseas  have drafted and in many cases signed but not dated their resignation letters   there is great anxiety here about the president elect s apparent disdain for the work we do and the dangers we face     a second senior intelligence official  at another agency  said  he and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters and morale at their agencies  the latest round of rancor began with a cnn report that trump had been briefed jan   by intelligence and law enforcement chiefs on a two page memo summarizing the unverified claims in the dossier  in blaming intelligence agencies for the leak  trump wrote on twitter   one last shot at me  are we living in nazi germany   spy chief clapper called trump before dinnertime on wednesday to calm the waters  trump and clapper differed on what was said in the phone conversation  on friday  trump appeared to again blame u s  spies for the leak   probably released by  intelligence  even knowing there is no proof and never will be   he said on twitter  u s  intelligence agency personnel  are kind of shell shocked at being accused of being nazis and intentionally leaking this stuff   the former senior official said  the  u s  intelligence agencies have combined budgets of more than   billion and tens of thousands of employees  they are responsible for everything from warning of terrorist attacks to supporting american troops on the battlefield and analyzing the impacts of global trends such as climate change  several former u s  officials said the tensions with trump were the worst they could recall since president george w  bush and the cia traded blame in  and  over the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq   but douglas wise  a former senior cia official  said it will be harder for trump to  beat up  on his own intelligence chiefs once they are in place instead of officials appointed by democratic president barack obama   i think things are going to change   wise said  still  tensions seem likely to persist after inauguration day on jan    retired lt  gen  michael flynn  who will be trump s national security adviser  led the pentagon s defense intelligence agency until he was fired by clapper  he has a long time suspicion of the cia  according to wise and others who have worked with him   what pompeo said was somewhat reassuring  but it s not at all clear whether that matters  or whether trump s apparent attitude and flynn s bitterness toward us is what counts   the second senior intelligence official said
