washington delaware  ohio  reuters    u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump said on thursday he would accept the result of the nov   election    if i win    fueling republican concerns his stance would make it harder for his party to maintain control of congress  his refusal to commit to accepting the election outcome was the standout remark of the third and final  presidential debate between trump and democratic rival hillary clinton on wednesday night  it ratcheted up trump s allegations the election was being rigged against him  and became the latest flashpoint in an unusually acrimonious race three weeks before voters go to the polls  clinton called the comment  horrifying   president barack obama blasted trump on thursday at a rally in miami gardens  florida  for clinton and u s  representative patrick murphy  who is trying to unseat republican senator marco rubio  a trump supporter    that is dangerous  because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people s minds about the legitimacy of the elections  that undermines our democracy  then you re doing the work of our adversaries for them   obama said  trump modified his comment at a rally in ohio on thursday  but did not back off    i would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the united states  that i will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election   if i win   he said  he added he would accept  a clear election result   but reserved the right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result  with trump trailing in opinion polls  the focus ahead of the nov   vote is shifting to whether republicans can keep their narrow majority in the senate or even their larger advantage in the house of representatives  senator john mccain of arizona  who lost the  presidential election to obama  said accepting the election result was  the american way    i didn t like the outcome of the  election  but i had a duty to concede  and i did so without reluctance   mccain  who has opened a poll lead in his senate re election race  said in a statement   a concession isn t just an exercise in graciousness  it is an act of respect for the will of the american people  a respect that is every american leader s first responsibility   mccain has withdrawn his support for trump  asked on wednesday night if he would commit to a peaceful transition of power  trump  a businessman turned politician  replied   what i m saying is that i will tell you at the time  i ll keep you in suspense  ok   trump s statement  the most provocative in a debate that repeatedly descended into rancor  made headlines across the country and raised questions about his commitment to a peaceful transition of power  a cornerstone of american democracy  clinton accused trump of being russian president vladimir putin s puppet  trump called clinton a  nasty woman  and a criminal who should be barred from running  they did not exchange the customary handshake when the debate ended  on thursday night the two candidates appeared together at a formal charity dinner in new york and shook hands there after giving speeches intended to roast each other   just before taking the dais  hillary accidentally bumped into me  and she very civilly said   pardon me    trump joked   and i very politely replied  let me talk to you about that after i get into office   trump has said clinton should be imprisoned for her email practices as secretary of state  clinton spoke after trump at the dinner  which she joked was remarkable in itself   i didn t think he d be ok with a peaceful transition of power   she said  that show of humor was not the norm  however  democrats jumped to ask republican candidates whether they agreed with trump  who is making his first run for public office against clinton  a former senator and first lady   do you agree with donald trump to question the results of the election   the nevada democratic party asked in a release targeting republican joe heck  heck is in a tight race with democrat catherine cortez masto for retiring democratic leader harry reid s senate seat  trump s comments did not worry his supporters  marion fields    a registered democrat who backs trump  said he did not think concession would be an issue because trump would win  were he to lose   after it s announced  you d have to be a professional and concede   a cnn orc snap poll said  percent of americans thought clinton won the debate  to  percent for trump  trump donor and energy investor dan eberhart said trump won  he disagreed with his rhetoric  but still backs the candidate   i think hillary s policies and track record are not what the country needs leading us forward for the next four years  and that backs me into supporting trump   eberhart said  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway sought on thursday to defend trump  saying in television interviews he was  putting people on notice  about voting irregularities  trump has not offered specific evidence to back up his vote rigging claims  and numerous studies have shown that the u s  election system  which is run by the states  is sound  trump has stepped up allegations that the election is being rigged against a backdrop of accusations that he had made improper sexual advances to women since a video emerged two weeks ago in which trump boasted of such behavior  a  woman came forward on thursday at a news conference in manhattan with attorney gloria allred  a clinton supporter who specializes in representing women in cases of alleged assault  trump campaign spokeswoman jessica ditto called the news conference a  coordinated  publicity seeking attack  by allred  first lady michelle obama  a powerful campaigner for clinton  renewed her criticism of trump without naming him during a campaign event in arizona   decent men do not demean women  and we shouldn t tolerate this behavior from any man  let alone a man who wants to be the president   she said
