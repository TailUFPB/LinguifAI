beijing  reuters    in   then secretary of state hillary clinton provoked outrage in beijing when she pushed the south china sea to the top of the regional and u s  security agendas  now as an international court prepares to hand down a ruling that threatens china s sweeping claims in the vital waterway  beijing is watching clinton s presidential run with trepidation   combined with her tough line on human rights and role in leading president barack obama s asia  rebalancing   clinton is well known in china   but not well liked   while presidential rival donald trump has irritated beijing with comments such as comparing the u s  trade deficit with china to rape  he is largely an unknown quantity  a person who even privately officials shrug their shoulders over   clinton will be a difficult partner   one senior chinese diplomatic source told reuters  having just admitted to not knowing much about trump or what he stands for    chinese diplomats take some comfort that clinton s views are known to them from years of high level contacts  from her days as first lady to her senate tenure to her time as secretary of state  but they are also mindful that even while seeking diplomatic accommodations  she has been a staunch critic of beijing on a range of issues  including the south china sea  trade and human rights  china remembers clearly a  southeast asian security summit in hanoi  when clinton waded into the south china sea dispute  saying open access and legal solutions were a u s   national interest  and  pivotal to regional security   in a strongly worded response  china stressed the south china sea as one of its  core interests   putting the issue up there with taiwan  tibet and xinjiang in terms of its importance to beijing  china warned its rival claimants and neighbors not to be emboldened by u s  support   a line it has repeated ever since  an arbitration court hearing the dispute between china and the philippines over the south china sea is set to hand down its ruling on in the dutch city of the hague on tuesday  legal experts expect at least some substantive findings to go against china  which has vowed to ignore the ruling  china s military  which is ramping up its presence in the south china sea as part of a major modernization program  is also watching the election closely            hillary is very fierce when it comes to china   a chinese official close to the military establishment told reuters  while the chinese government has been largely quiet about the u s  election  state media has not been so restrained  with one paper even equating trump to hitler   in may  china s official xinhua news agency noted trump s more isolationist campaign compared to clinton s  who it described as an  old foreign policy hand  and important backer of the asia pacific  pivot  that china considers a threat   as far as she s concerned  being tough on foreign policy is perhaps the best way to show america s so called  leadership    it said in a commentary  laura rosenberger  a clinton campaign foreign policy adviser who worked with her in the state department  told reuters clinton would remain tough on the south china sea issue   she believes that we need to be very strong in terms of standing up to many of the actions the chinese have taken   rosenberger said   she believes in the principles of freedom of navigation in international waters  that commerce on the high seas in incredibly important to the united states  and that these are really very direct interests that we need to continue to stand up for   trump adviser peter navarro  an economist at university of california irvine and the author of the book   crouching tiger  what china s militarism means for the world   said a trump presidency would lead to respect   the central difference between a trump administration and the current administration or a clinton administration is respect  the leaders of russia  the leaders of china will respect mr  trump  will respect america because we will be strong economically  militarily and politically   trump may actually find some sympathy in china  even if he is seen as an unknown quantity    who is trump  we don t really know  we do know he hates muslims though   and that will be well received in some circles here   said the chinese official with ties to the military  pointing to what china views as its war on terror in its muslim populated far western region of xinjiang  china also views trump as a businessmen with whom they can probably negotiate   it would be very transactional for the chinese   said a senior western diplomat in beijing   he s a businessman they think they ll be able to strike a deal with   trump may also be less tough on china over human rights than clinton  who has frequently clashed with beijing on the issue   in   clinton said china was on a  fool s errand  to try to halt the march of freedom  while in  she was deeply involved in efforts to get blind dissident chen guangcheng out of china after he fled to the u s  embassy in beijing   trump advisor navarro said clinton s record on human rights abuse was  sketchy at best and abysmal at worst   highlighting her first trip to asia as secretary of state in   where other issues were given priority   so it s difficult to see how she would have someone would view her as credible on that issue    rosenberger  the clinton adviser  rejected that view  highlighting comments from trump in a  interview referring to the  strength  of the chinese government in its bloody crackdown of student led protests in tiananmen square a year earlier   it s ironic for trump s adviser to criticize hillary s statement there when trump himself has actually praised the chinese for the tiananmen massacre   rosenberger said   still  china is hoping that whoever wins they will understand that both countries need each other and will have to work closely  a source with ties to the chinese leadership told reuters  requesting anonymity   it is the most important bilateral relationship in the world  china needs the united states and vice versa   the source said   we don t know who will be the lesser of two evils
