mexico city  reuters    under pressure from president donald trump  mexico is preparing to discuss changes to trade rules about a product s country of origin to try to avoid a disruptive fight with the united states over commerce  as the two countries begin a difficult new relationship  mexico sees possible common ground with trump on the  rules of origin  of the north american free trade agreement  nafta  that binds the two countries and canada  several sources said  rules of origin are regulations setting out where trade products are sourced from  although formal negotiations about nafta have not begun  the rules could eventually be altered to favor u s  industry over competitors from outside north america  particularly in asia  changes to those rules could help align mexico with trump s industrial strategy of boosting u s  manufacturing jobs and dovetail with the mexican government s calls to strengthen north american competitiveness  it could also help pave the way for a broader deal with trump over border security and immigration  mexican officials believe  talks about nafta rules of origin will be a  very important  point of discussion between the two countries now that trump is in office  a mexican official said  a white house official said   as a general rule  it is in the best interests of the u s  to insist on strong rules of origin provisions in pursuing bilateral negotiations  lax rules of origin in proposed treaties like the now defunct trans pacific partnership shrink and weaken our supply chain and contribute to the offshoring of american jobs   mexican foreign minister luis videgaray and economy minister ildefonso guajardo will hold talks with top trump officials in washington on wednesday and thursday  where security  migration and trade will be discussed             fears of economic disaster have haunted mexico since trump won the presidency in november threatening to tear up nafta  impose protectionist tariffs and build a wall on the united states  southern border to halt illegal immigration                while mexico is reluctant to alter the  trade accord  officials concede that some changes may be necessary to help keep trade open with the united states  which absorbs  percent of its exports   what we want is to maintain free access for mexican products  without restrictions  without tariffs and quotas   videgaray  the spearhead of the government s outreach to trump  said on monday  speaking on condition of anonymity  two mexican government officials and four other people familiar with ongoing discussions said mexico saw rules of origin as an important avenue to brokering a deal with trump  provided a fair compromise can be reached  in trade agreements  content rules or rules of origin are often used to determine import duties  under nafta    percent of the material in a car or light truck made in mexico must be from north america to be able to enter the united states tariff free  if the countries agree in negotiations  that percentage could be increased  potentially giving an advantage to u s  industry at the expense of asian competitors                for mexico  changing the rules of origin could be a lesser evil than trump s threat to impose a  percent tax on certain goods made by foreign companies in mexico for sale in the united states  trump s pressure on u s  automakers such as ford to build more cars at home worries mexico  where the industry has been one of the main drivers of growth and accounted for   percent of manufacturing gdp in   trump on tuesday told the chief executives of the big three u s  automakers   general motors  ford and fiat chrysler   that he wants to see more auto plants in the united states  mexico warned it could pull out of nafta if a renegotiation of the pact does not benefit it  trump s team is behind the push for changes in the origin rules  seeing it as a means of reducing imports from china  two of the mexican sources familiar with the matter said  trump s nominee for commerce secretary  wilbur ross  spoke of the importance of content rules in protecting the automotive industry during senate hearings last week  and canadian media reported that ross had told canada rules of origin would be central to nafta talks  nafta rules of origin apply to goods made in any of the three countries  two mexican sources said the trump administration could push for national content requirements that would ensure that the united states benefits from changes in rules of origin  and not just the nafta region as a whole    however  that would be more complex to manage  they added  so as not to hurt companies  any changes would need to be phased in gradually  and the more items that were targeted  the trickier negotiations would be  one of the sources said  any deal would need to ensure rules changes applied to all countries  not just to mexico  one mexican official said  of the foreign carmakers in mexico  toyota might be able to handle a higher nafta content ratio better than others  its camry car  for example  has very high north american and u s  content  other japanese automakers such as mazda have a larger proportional reliance on asia based suppliers     kristin dziczek  a labor analyst at the center of automotive research  said deepening rules of origin could have some impact on u s  jobs and would hit some foreign automakers harder   especially those that produce more parts and vehicles outside north america  the nafta rules are in place to prevent china or other lower wage countries from being able to produce the majority of content in a vehicle and export it to another country to assemble it without paying tariffs   u s  automakers have not backed tougher rules of origin previously because they wanted flexibility on sourcing parts
