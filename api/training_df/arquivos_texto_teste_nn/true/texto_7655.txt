washington new york  reuters    the fbi is investigating more emails as part of a probe into hillary clinton s use of a private email system  it said on friday  in a new twist that could damage the democratic candidate in the  presidential race  federal bureau of investigation director james comey said in a letter to senior lawmakers that the agency would determine whether the additional emails contained classified information  adding that he did not know  how long it will take us to complete this additional work   the announcement came as clinton and republican opponent donald trump enter the final stretch of campaigning ahead of the nov   election   in a news conference late on friday in des moines  iowa  clinton urged comey to release more details about what the fbi was looking for in the newly discovered emails  she leads trump in opinion polls after a bruising campaign in which she has struggled to convince voters that she is trustworthy and honest  fresh revelations about her use of email are unlikely to assuage those concerns  and questions around the fbi investigation will now likely dog her in the coming days as she campaigns across battleground states  u s  stocks immediately fell sharply on the news  but went on to partially recover  the fbi spent about a year investigating clinton s use of the unauthorized server at her home in chappaqua  new york  while she was u s  secretary of state after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails   comey said in july that while  there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information  our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case   although comey recommended no criminal charges be brought against clinton  trump has repeatedly said her email practices are criminal and should disqualify her for office  he seized on friday s development at rallies in maine and new hampshire   this is the biggest political scandal since watergate  and i m sure it will be properly handled from this point forward   trump told a crowd in lisbon  maine   we hope that all  all justice will be fully served   he said  supporters cheered his words and chanted   lock her up   clinton said she had learned of the newly discovered emails from news reports    i m confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in july   she said   that s why it s incumbent upon the fbi to tell us what s going on   two sources close to the investigation said the latest emails were discovered not during an investigation into clinton  but rather as part of a separate probe into anthony weiner  the estranged husband of top clinton aide huma abedin  the fbi has been investigating illicit text messages allegedly sent from weiner to a  year old girl in north carolina  and found the clinton emails on a device related to that investigation  the sources said  abedin told federal investigators in april that she used several email accounts for her work  including a yahoo email  according to a summary of the interview released by the fbi in september  she said it was difficult to print from the state department s email system so she routinely forwarded documents to her private accounts when she needed to print them out  according to the summary   abedin announced her separation from weiner in august after a sex scandal similar to an earlier incident that led him to resign from the u s  congress  lawyers representing abedin did not respond to questions sent by email on friday  weiner did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment  and he did not respond to phone calls  hank sheinkopf  a democratic strategist who had previously advised former president bill clinton but has no role with hillary clinton s campaign  said the linking of clinton s email woes with weiner s sex scandals made it harder for her campaign to distinguish itself from trump s sex scandals   the whole campaign is now smeared with sex  corruption and scandal   he said   nobody remembers the beginning of something  they only remember the end  what are they going to remember  they re all the same  sex  scandal  corruption  emails  people are going to have trouble sorting out all this information   clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  said it was  extraordinary  for the fbi to release the letter so close to the end of a hotly contested election   the director owes it to the american people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining   podesta said in a statement   we are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the fbi reached in july    clinton has repeatedly apologized for using the private email server in her home instead of a government email account for her work as secretary of state from  to   she has said she did not knowingly send or receive classified information  while the fbi probe of new emails will likely prove a distraction to clinton in the coming days  it was unclear what impact it would have when americans go to the polls  election experts say about  percent of ballots have already been cast  as more americans vote by mail or go to the polls early   a lot of concern about the emails has already been baked into this electoral cake i think   said linda fowler  a professor of government at dartmouth college   they know she did it  they know it was inappropriate and  failing some sensational revelation on nov    it s hard to see that it s going to make that big a difference   still  republican lawmakers  who are facing a difficult fight to keep their majorities in both the u s  senate and the house of representatives  leaped to condemn clinton  house speaker paul ryan reiterated his call that the democratic nominee be barred from briefings involving classified information until the investigation is over  reince priebus  the head of the republican national committee  said the fbi s decision to look into the emails shows  how serious this discovery must be      clinton did not respond to reporters  shouted questions about the news when she left her plane for a campaign stop in cedar rapids  iowa  u s  stocks declined in a volatile session on friday but partially recovered from the sharp drop spurred by the fbi announcement  the dow jones industrial average closed the day down about  points  or   percent  while the benchmark  year treasury note was unchanged on the day  the dollar also fell against major currencies
