new york  reuters    gun safety advocates are pouring tens of millions of dollars into maine and nevada to support ballot initiatives that would mandate background checks for gun sales in an effort to clinch state level victories after years of failed drives in congress  the avalanche of money spent on supporting such initiatives ahead of the nov   vote could hand gun control organizations their biggest win since they failed to secure the passage of federal legislation after the massacre of  children and educators at a newtown  connecticut  elementary school in december   voters in california and washington state will also cast ballots on gun control initiatives  and opinion polls show the measures are likely to pass in all four states       everytown for gun safety  the gun control group founded by billionaire former new york city mayor michael bloomberg  has been leading the charge  throwing its financial weight behind three of the four measures  the organization plans to spend   million nationwide on the issue  almost as much as the powerful national rifle association has spent on television advertising for republican presidential candidate donald trump  the right to own firearms is protected by the second amendment of the u s  constitution  and any efforts to restrict that guarantee are fought vehemently by gun rights advocates  who are highly influential within the republican party  victories by gun control groups in maine and nevada would mean that half of the u s  population would live in states with expanded background checks  including private sales not involving a licensed dealer  gun control supporters say that would be a symbolic and strategically important threshold  opponents of the measures say the laws are poorly written  would do little to combat crime and would punish law abiding gun owners  a university of new hampshire poll in late october found  percent of maine residents support the measure and  percent oppose it  in nevada  two polls in late october found a  percentage point margin and a  point margin in favor of the initiative  respectively  the measures come in a year that voters around the united states will weigh in on  citizen submitted ballot initiatives on topics ranging from marijuana legalization to raising the minimum wage  the largest number in a decade  according to ballotpedia org  a website that tracks voting data  everytown described its strategy as part of an effort to copy the state by state tactic that helped legalize gay marriage across the united states  with congress unwilling to pass universal background check legislation   one of the great advantages of going directly to the electorate is that you can go around the legislative bodies and make law   said zach silk  a consultant who has worked with everytown in nevada and previously helped oversee washington state s  successful background check ballot initiative  nevada in particular has become an expensive battleground  bloomberg has personally donated nearly   million to the effort there  and nevadans for background checks had collected    million as of oct    that is nearly triple the    million that the leading opposition group  nra nevadans for freedom  had received  all from the nra  in maine  supporters of background checks have outspent opponents by more than  to   with the everytown backed mainers for responsible gun ownership fund reporting    million in contributions as of last week  the nra did not respond to a request for comment on its campaign spending decisions  critics have accused bloomberg of trying to buy victory    this law is convoluted and way overregulatory   said david trahan  the executive director of the sportsman s alliance of maine and a former state legislator   it reflects the person funding this initiative  michael bloomberg  his solutions are overkill  and they border on social engineering   but everytown s executive director  john feinblatt  said it was the gun lobby that has tried to take power away from the citizenry   while the nra can control legislators and the government  they can t control the people   he said
