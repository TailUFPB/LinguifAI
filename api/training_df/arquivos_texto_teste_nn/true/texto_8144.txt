washington  reuters    another u s  republican senator has moved closer to re election while keeping some distance from donald trump  and experts say this suggests the party s presidential candidate may be having little down ballot impact  at least at the primary stage   senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire still faces a tough general election challenge on nov   but she crushed a pro trump  republican challenger in a primary contest on tuesday  winning close to  percent of the vote  ayotte has refused to endorse trump although  like a number of republicans  she has said she will vote for him  some republicans  such as ohio senator rob portman  have endorsed trump but excluded him from their campaigns  senator lisa murkowski of alaska won her primary in august although she had said she did not know whether she would vote for trump  trump  a new york businessman who has never held elected office  at first criticized ayotte  then he changed course early last month and endorsed her  along with fellow republicans house speaker paul ryan and senator john mccain  with ayotte s victory  all incumbent republican senators running for re election have won their primaries this year  this is not uncommon but it is unusual for so many senators to hold their party s presidential nominee at arm s length   u s  senators serve six year terms  one third of the  member senate faces voters every two years  the outcome so far shows some voters are distinguishing this year between trump and the rest of the ballot  said nathan gonzales  editor of the rothenberg   gonzales political report  a non partisan newsletter    his impact has been less dramatic than what was initially expected  but there is still time for things to get worse for the republican party   gonzales said in a telephone interview   at a time when republicans in presidential primaries basically rejected everybody from the status quo  they are not doing that in senate or house primaries   norman ornstein  a political scientist at the american enterprise institute  a conservative think tank  said by telephone  republicans are still worried that voters who do not like trump will not turn out to vote for other republicans in the general election on nov    gonzales said    is there a trump drag  on down ballot candidates   there doesn t appear to be much of one   said jennifer duffy  senior editor at the non partisan cook political report  ohio s portman  who has not appeared with trump on the campaign trail  easily beat his primary opponent and has opened up a lead over his democratic challenger in the general election  mccain and ryan have had very public differences of opinion with trump but they also prevailed in their primary races  ayotte beat a field of four challengers in new hampshire  receiving nearly  percent of the vote  according to election results posted online by the state   she must still take on democratic new hampshire governor maggie hassan in the general election  ayotte was leading hassan by  percent to  percent in a sept    nbc wall street journal marist poll  according to the website realclear politics   i think you probably have a lot of people in the primary who were not going to pay as close attention to what she was saying about trump   ornstein said of ayotte   in the fall it may be a different matter  as certainly maggie hassan is going to try to tie her to trump
