ottawa  reuters    canada s answer to donald trump is a pediatric surgeon and former cabinet minister who  like the u s  president elect  is railing against immigration and political elites  kellie leitch    has vaulted to the front of the race to lead the opposition conservative party by pushing a hard right  canadian values  platform that taps into discontent over the sluggish economy and canada s acceptance of   syrian refugees   leitch is ahead of about a dozen candidates in the most recent opinion polls on the conservative leadership election  scheduled to be held on may     the candidate chosen by party members will be their flag bearer for the october  general election  against prime minister justin trudeau s liberals   elites pretend this isn t an issue  but canadians want to talk about it  immigration    leitch said in an interview last week from her farmhouse in rural ontario  she has professed admiration for trump s embrace of the ordinary voter  and acknowledged similarities in their agendas   i am talking about screening immigrants  i am talking about building pipelines  i am talking about making sure canadians have jobs  so yeah  some of the ideas and language are the same   said leitch  an energetic and plain spoken former labor and women s affairs minister  just as trump did not initially have the backing of mainstream republicans  leitch has alienated many in her party establishment who fear that she will struggle to win canada s urban  mainly immigrant  voter base in the general election      one of the reasons why the conservatives had managed to hold power for almost a decade was their successful push into immigrant communities under former prime minister stephen harper  who had convinced the party that rising immigration made newcomers a must win constituency  canada takes in about   immigrants every year   she may believe that swimming away from the broad center of the conservative electoral coalition  the one that wins elections  may make sense  history and demographics argue otherwise   said hugh segal  who has known leitch for more than  years  segal is a former senator and chief of staff to former conservative prime minister brian mulroney   still  a november poll by mainstreet postmedia showed leitch led a  candidate conservative race with  percent support  and separate data showed she led fundraising as well  the pool of candidates running has since swelled to   and more may join  including businessman and reality tv star kevin o leary  who has also drawn comparisons to trump       there is absolutely room for a populist surprise in canada   said pollster frank graves of ekos research   the type of forces driving brexit and trump are very much at work in canada  albeit somewhat more muted   in a year marked by ultra conservative movements in europe and the united states  leitch s vault from relative obscurity to conservative front runner is in part boosted by media fascination with the parallels between her  canadian values  and trump s  make america great again       like trump  leitch has been accused of being racist and targeting muslims with her proposal to make every immigrant go through a face to face interview before letting them in  she denies those charges  and says her screening plan is aimed at ensuring each immigrant is a good fit for canada        even if my colleagues are concerned about the backlash of the media or other elites  that s okay with me because i m quite comfortable     i don t view it as racist in any way   said leitch  a practicing catholic from the traditionally conservative  oil rich province of alberta  trudeau was elected in october  and promised to accept more syrian refugees more quickly than the conservatives  who had been in power for nearly  years  but his timeline proved too ambitious  and sparked public criticism that the government was too rushed to adequately screen refugees for security concerns  amid dissatisfaction with the economy and other issues  trudeau s approval rating has fallen  percentage points to  percent in the last three months  according to a december angus reid poll  though he remained more popular than any recent prime minister  while much can change in the next three years before the general election  graves  the pollster  said a conservative victory is possible in part because canada s economic malaise has sparked the same kind of working class resentment that helped propel trump to victory  canada s economy has been hurt by a two year slump in oil prices  weak business investment and disappointing non energy exports  the economy contracted in october and the manufacturing sector logged its biggest decline in nearly three years       the reason trump got his momentum is he was the only candidate who was prepared to talk about immigration   said martin collacott  a senior fellow at the fraser institute  a conservative think tank  and a former ambassador   if kellie leitch plays it right  and refines her message  she could probably get quite a bit of support
