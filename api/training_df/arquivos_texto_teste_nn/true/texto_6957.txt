washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump said on thursday night he would nominate retired marine corps general james mattis  known as  mad dog  and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in iraq and afghanistan  to lead the pentagon   we are going to appoint  mad dog  mattis as our secretary of defense   trump told a rally in cincinnati  he said the formal announcement would be made on monday  the choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that trump  a republican  intends to steer u s  foreign policy away from democratic president barack obama s increased reliance on u s  allies to fight islamist militants and to help deter russian and chinese aggression in europe and asia  mattis is a revered figure in the marine corps and known for his distrust of iran  the washington post and cnn reported earlier that trump had chosen mattis  but trump spokesman jason miller said earlier on twitter that  no decision has been made yet with regard to secretary of defense   while the nomination of the  year old mattis would likely be popular among u s  forces  it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle    because he retired only in   mattis would need the u s  congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the pentagon  his impressive combat record  however  may deter some senate democrats from trying to block his nomination  trump has described mattis as  a true general s general    the new york real estate magnate famously asserted last year   i know more about isis than the generals do   mattis  whose past assignments include leading central command  which oversees u s  military operations in the middle east and south asia  is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the u s  armed forces  fighting wars  in one famous line in  attributed to mattis  the general told marines in iraq   be polite  be professional  but have a plan to kill everybody you meet   in a  question and answer session  mattis appeared to be moved by a marine s question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand  known as a  kill casualty radius    once you get to be a high ranking officer  the kill casualty radius is whatever your marines make it  and by the time i got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles   he said in a video for the marine corps  still  such tough talk has gotten him in hot water  he was once rebuked for saying in  that  it s fun to shoot some people    his talk  however  belies a more thoughtful side  mattis once said the most important  inches in a combat zone was  between your ears   now a fellow at stanford university s hoover institution  mattis is also a scholar who was praised by then u s  defense secretary robert gates in  as one of the country s great strategic thinkers   mattis reads avidly  frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television   after meeting mattis on nov    trump described him as a strong  dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding  an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone s face to simulate drowning   trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding  which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under president barack obama  but bring back  a hell of a lot worse  if elected     mattis  said   i ve always found  give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with torture   and i was very impressed by that answer   trump told the new york times  the senate armed services committee will consider mattis  nomination  in a statement on thursday night  its chairman  republican john mccain  called him  one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader    mattis would be the first former u s  general to become defense secretary since george c  marshall took the job in   the decision adds to trump s national security team another pentagon veteran who served during the obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it  officials who knew him before he retired in  said mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed central command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from iran and to win more resources for afghanistan  trump has given the job of national security adviser to michael flynn  a retired three star army general who was pushed out of the top job at the defense intelligence agency in  by obama s administration   flynn was fiercely critical of obama during the  campaign  adopting much of trump s rhetoric  along with flynn and trump s choice for cia director  u s  representative mike pompeo  mattis has been critical of the deal to curb iran s suspected nuclear weapons program  saying the threat from tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about islamic state or al qaeda   the iranian regime  in my mind  is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the middle east   mattis said  speaking about the iranian nuclear deal  mattis said   hoping that iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible  modern nation is a bridge too far   if mattis wins senate confirmation  he will work side by side with another marine   general joseph dunford  who is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff   having two marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite u s  fighting force  it would also raise questions about how mattis and dunford might divide up tasks   both dunford and mattis share battlefield experience  including in iraq  in   mattis led the  marine division during the u s  led invasion of iraq  he has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of falluja in   something he feared would hurt morale  but did not   we just don t take refuge in self pity or any of that kind of stuff  and so as a result  the marine corps remains a very feared organization in this world  as it should be   he said
