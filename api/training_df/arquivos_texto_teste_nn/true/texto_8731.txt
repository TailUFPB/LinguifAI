 reuters    in   during a close and bitter congressional race  mike pence came under attack for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses  including his mortgage and credit card bills  the expenditures were not illegal at the time  but proved difficult to explain for a candidate who had railed about the outsized role of money in politics  pence in turn blasted his opponent with attack ads  including one featuring a man in traditional arab clothing who thanked pence s opponent in thickly accented english for policies that benefited middle eastern oil producers  the commercial was attacked by arab american groups  and the indianapolis star called it one of the two worst campaign commercials that year  pence  who is now indiana s governor and was selected this week to be donald trump s presidential running mate  lost his  race  but what he regretted more than losing  he later said  was his decision to sling mud  in the  years since that loss  pence s political allies and enemies alike say he has steered clear of personal attacks  this could prove challenging when campaigning with trump  who enthusiastically tears into his rivals   pence s style is likely to cast him in a very different role from that of traditional vice presidential candidates  who often throw and take punches to allow presidential contenders to remain above the fray  in the case of trump and pence  said indianapolis university professor laura merrifield albright  the roles are likely to be reversed   it s a different dynamic  it s tough to imagine anyone out trumping trump   she said  noting that he is  willing to do his own dirty work   michael totten  a retired architect who worked on pence s  campaign  thinks the two candidates will complement one another  he dubbed pence  the perfect no     a running mate who can  temper some of trump s enthusiasm  and  be the calming voice    neither pence nor the trump campaign immediately responded to a request for comment  after losing his  race  pence apologized to his opponent for the oil advertisement   he later told his colleague at a conservative think tank  william styring  that he regretted the tone of the campaign   i really screwed up on this  it s not me   styring recalled pence as saying   in   pence wrote an apologetic article for the think tank s policy journal  titled  confessions of a negative campaigner   after the defeat  pence did not seek public office again for a decade  he worked at the indiana policy review and hosted his own statewide conservative radio talk show  describing himself as  rush limbaugh on decaf   he also hosted a morning tv show in indianapolis from  to   in   pence again ran for a u s  house of representatives seat  this time successfully  and he demonstrated that his  mea culpa was more than just political theater  observers of indiana politics say  his opponents in campaigns after he re entered politics describe him as extremely disciplined and cordial  melina fox  pence s democratic challenger in   said that his statements in the race were  calculated and thought out   democrat barry welsh  who ran against him in    and   said pence was invariably  polite  professional and gentlemanly    but some question how he will cope with being constantly challenged in a hard fought presidential race   he seems uncomfortable with difficult questions and does not take counterpunches very well   said rebecca pearcey  who ran the losing campaign of pence s opponent in the  race for indiana governor  democrat john gregg   he doesn t engage  he operates as though the opponent is not there     before being picked as trump s running mate  pence was poised for a tight rematch race against gregg  in recent months  pence s approval rating had fallen below  percent  in part because of controversy surrounding the state s religious freedom restoration act  which held that  a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person s exercise of religion   pence first alienated liberals and moderates by signing the bill into law  he then outraged the measure s evangelical supporters by endorsing changes to the law aimed at preventing discrimination against lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  the  gubernatorial campaign had started to become more negative  with yard signs calling for pence to be fired  the republican governors association ran an independently produced ad that attacked his opponent s record  but pence himself had not gone negative  at a saturday morning event to formally introduce his running mate  trump called pence  a man of honor   contrasting him with hillary clinton  whom he described as  the embodiment of corruption   it remains to be seen how aggressive pence will be in campaigning for trump in coming months   and whether he will stick to the principles outlined in his  article on negative campaigning   it is wrong  quite simply   he wrote at the time   to squander a candidate s priceless moment in history     on partisan bickering    in an interview with cbs correspondent lesley stahl that will air on   minutes  on sunday evening  trump suggested he may not expect his running mate to go on the attack    while discussing his democratic opponent hillary clinton  trump told stahl   i call her  crooked hillary      but i don t think he should do it  because it s different for him
