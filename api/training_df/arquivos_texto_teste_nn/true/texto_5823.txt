  in this jan   story  corrects spelling of sergey brin in paragraph   by roberta rampton and julia edwards ainsley washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump fired top federal government lawyer sally yates on monday after she took the extraordinarily rare step of defying the white house and refused to defend new travel restrictions targeting seven muslim majority nations  it was another dramatic twist in the unusually raucous roll out of trump s directive that put a  day hold on allowing refugees into the country  an indefinite ban on refugees from syria and a  day bar on citizens from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  the friday night ban prompted protests and chaos at airports on the weekend as customs officials struggled to put the order into practise  and the fallout spread to u s  markets on monday   where stocks suffered their biggest drop of  and companies affected by the change spoke out against it  yates said late on monday that the justice department would not defend the order against court challenges  saying that she did not believe it would be  consistent with this institution s solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right   hours later  she was fired  the white house said yates  has betrayed the department of justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the united states  and portrayed her actions as political  trump has argued tougher vetting of immigrants is needed to protect america from terror attacks but critics complain that his order unfairly singles out muslims and defiles america s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants  yates  an appointee of former democratic president barack obama  was days away from being replaced by trump s pick for the top spot at the justice department  republican senator jeff sessions  who is awaiting senate confirmation   ms  yates is an obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration   the white house said in a statement  the white house said that dana boente  u s  attorney for the eastern district of virginia  was sworn in at  p m  et and would be acting u s  attorney general until sessions is approved  boente said in an interview with the washington post that he would enforce the immigration order  there have been only a handful of instances in u s  history of top justice department officials publicly breaking with the white house  the most famous example was in   when then attorney general elliot richardson and his deputy resigned rather than obey president richard nixon s order to fire a special prosecutor investigating the watergate scandal  the incident  which became known as the  saturday night massacre   was a public relations disaster and is seen as a turning point in nixon s administration  the drama at the justice department is another sign of how hastily trump s immigration order was developed and how little it was reviewed by the agencies now grappling to implement it  the white house said key government officials were briefed before trump signed the order on friday  but there was little coordination or consultation  resulting in confusion  most state department officials found out about it from media reports  officials from the state department circulated a draft memo of dissent on monday  saying trump s move would hurt america s image abroad and inflame anti american sentiment   white house spokesman sean spicer dismissed the memo   these career bureaucrats have a problem with it  i think that they should either get with the program or they can go   he told reporters at his daily briefing  an internal department of homeland security document seen by reuters showed  visa holders were kept from boarding u s  bound flights this week  and more than  people came to the united states but were denied entry  more than  people were pulled aside for questioning by u s  customs and border protection officers at airports  including  green card holders  who are legal permanent residents of the united states  the document said   trump s administration is granting waivers from the refugee ban to allow  people into the country this week   refugees that had already been cleared for resettlement in the united states and were in transit when the order came out  tens of thousands of people protested trump s order in major american cities and at airports on the weekend  obama took the rare step of weighing in  saying through a spokesman that he was heartened by the political activism on the issue  employees of alphabet inc s google in san francisco  mountain view  seattle and other cities held protests  backed by a sign that said  we are a nation of immigrants   sergey brin  president of alphabet  said he was outraged by the order   the u s  had the courage to take me and my family in as refugees   he said in a youtube video of his remarks  federal judges blocked deportation of those detained under the order through the weekend  and more lawsuits were filed on monday  the council on american islamic relations  the country s biggest muslim advocacy group  filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of more than  people  washington state filed a lawsuit  arguing that trump s order violates the equal protection clause and the first amendment of the u s  constitution  several other democratic state attorneys general have said they are considering legal action    it is an insult and a danger to all of the people of the state of washington  of all faiths   washington state governor jay inslee  a democrat  told reporters  amazon com inc and expedia inc  both of which are based in washington state s seattle area  are supporting the state s suit  amazon scrapped a business trip for a senior company lawyer who was born in libya but has uk citizenship  according to a declaration filed in support of the lawsuit  forty nine of its employees were born in one of the banned countries  and seven new hires may need to be placed in offices outside the united states  it said  a declaration from expedia said the order could impact the travel itineraries of at least   customers  costing it refunds as well as expenses to monitor how the order is applied and who exactly is affected      the u s  technology industry  a major employer of foreign workers  has been the most vocal corporate opponent to trump s order  a group of top companies plans to meet on tuesday to discuss how best to support legal challenges
