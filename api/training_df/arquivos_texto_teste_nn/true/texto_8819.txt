new york  reuters    hillary clinton disputed a scathing assessment by the federal bureau of investigation that she was  extremely careless  with classified government secrets  saying on friday she relied on the judgment of her subordinates at the u s  state department  after maintaining for more than a year that she did not send or receive classified information through her unauthorized private email system  she acknowledged in a string of interviews on friday she may have at least unwittingly done so  three days after the fbi concluded this happened at least  times  clinton  the presumptive democratic presidential nominee  said she  certainly did not believe  that she was handling classified information on her email system at the time  but emphasized that she followed the lead of her subordinates on whether information was classified   i did not have a basis for second guessing their conclusion   clinton said in an interview with cnn  saying she had the  highest regard  for her former colleagues   these are experienced diplomats  they have expertise in handling classified material   she said in a separate interview with pbs newshour   they were not careless and the material that they sent  they did not believe that was classified   clinton  who was the department s most senior classifying authority during her four year tenure at its helm  did not address the fbi s conclusion that she herself sent information on topics classified as  top secret   the highest level  through a private server she kept in her basement    i have said  and i repeated  that it was a mistake to use personal email and i regret that   she said in another interview with abc  it is a crime to mishandle classified information  and while fbi director james comey said on tuesday there was evidence clinton or her aides may have broken these laws  there was not enough evidence of criminal intent for a prosecution  in an unusual  minute announcement explaining the fbi s findings  comey ended up dismaying both republicans and democrats  while clinton s republican opponents have fumed at the decision not to file criminal charges  clinton and her staff have disputed some of comey s criticisms that undermine her argument that she has better judgment than donald trump  the presumptive republican presidential candidate  comey called her and her staff  extremely careless  and said that any  reasonable  government employee should have recognized that such information should not be aired in emails  her server was so poorly secured the fbi could not eliminate the possibility it had not been hacked by the country s enemies  comey said  asked if she agreed that she was  extremely careless   clinton told cnn she was not  adding that comey had  clarified  his remarks  it was unclear what clarification clinton meant  in lengthier comments before lawmakers on thursday  comey again spoke of clinton s and her staff s carelessness and  real sloppiness   adding that it seemed she was not  particularly sophisticated with respect to classified information
