washington  reuters    u s  senators pushed for a compromise gun control bill on tuesday  a day after the senate failed to advance four gun measures following last week s mass shooting in orlando  the deadliest in modern u s  history    senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would schedule a vote on a bill by fellow republican senator susan collins that would prevent about   people on  no fly  and other surveillance lists from purchasing guns  collins said she expected a vote on the bill this week or next  on monday  the senate defeated a democratic prohibition on gun sales to people on a broader range of government watch lists  while also blocking a narrower republican measure   some senior republicans would not commit to supporting the collins bill  citing worries about people being denied the ability to buy weapons without adequate safeguards  but the no   senate democrat  chuck schumer  told reporters   there may be a glimmer of hope now   adding that collins  proposal seemed to be  a step in the right direction   the measure is being debated in the senate before the nov   election when democrats hope to win control of the senate and gain seats in the house of representatives  democrats believe republican congressional opposition to wider control bills gives them a powerful campaign issue  it was too soon to tell if president barack obama would support the collins bill  spokesman josh earnest said senior officials including lawyers at the department of justice were taking a look at it   if the assessment is that this would enhance the ability of our law enforcement professionals to keep us safe and prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing a gun  then that s likely something that we ll be able to support   earnest told reporters in a daily briefing    in the senate on monday  four measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and curb gun sales to those on terrorism watch lists   two put forth by democrats and two by republicans   fell short of the  votes needed for passage in the  member chamber  the votes were a bitter setback to advocates who have failed to get even modest gun curbs through congress despite repeated mass shootings  the bills lost in largely party line votes that showed the political power in congress of gun rights defenders and the national rifle association  the white house accused u s  senators of a  shameful display of cowardice  and said they failed the american people by not advancing any gun control measures after the florida shooting  the gunman  omar mateen  pledged allegiance to islamic state during the june  rampage in which he killed  people and wounded  at an orlando gay nightclub before being fatally shot by police  senator john cornyn of texas  the no   senate republican  said he had concerns about the collins measure   it s a slippery slope when an american citizen is denied a constitutional right  without forcing the government to come forward with some evidence on the front end  that a person should be prohibited from buying guns  he said    after monday s votes  the senate also debated a different tactic for battling domestic attacks that could be inspired by islamic state and other foreign militant groups  senators were aiming to vote by wednesday on legislation by republican john mccain of arizona expanding the federal bureau of investigation s ability to conduct secret surveillance in counter terrorism investigations   this week we ll have the opportunity to strengthen our ability to combat lone wolf terrorists and connect the dots so we are better able to prevent terrorist attacks in the united states  such as the orlando massacre  mcconnell said  collins  who held a news conference with eight other senators including democrat bill nelson of florida  said her bill would stop about   americans and   foreign national on surveillance lists from buying guns   we believe that if you are too dangerous to fly on an airplane you are too dangerous to buy a gun   the maine lawmaker said  she said americans and immigrants with work permits could appeal a denial and recover lawyers  fees if they prevailed   nelson said he owed it to the families of the victims in the orlando shooting as well as police and other first responders to the carnage   it was not clear whether collins  plan would draw significant bipartisan support  the nra said her proposal was  unconstitutional  and would not have prevented the orlando attack   gun control groups promised to intensify their push for legislative action  and not just in washington  shannon watts  founder of moms demand action for gun sense in america  said her group  besides supporting pro gun control candidates for congress  would work to strengthen gun sale background check laws  state by state until congress acts    if the nra and their lapdogs in the senate thought moms would feel dispirited and back down  they are sorely mistaken   watts told reporters in a teleconference
