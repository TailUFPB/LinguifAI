washington  reuters    president barack obama on tuesday nominated career diplomat jeffrey delaurentis to be the first u s  ambassador to cuba in more than five decades  setting up a fierce confirmation battle with republicans in congress opposed to obama s opening with the communist ruled island  the appointment of delaurentis  the top american official at the u s  embassy in havana since relations were restored last year  marked obama s latest move to go as far as he can in normalizing ties between the former cold war foes before he leaves office in january  the nomination must be approved by the republican controlled senate  which is seen as a long shot  especially in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from cuban american senators including marco rubio of florida and ted cruz of texas  rubio  in a blistering statement  derided the nomination as a  last ditch legacy project  by obama and said it  should go nowhere   an individual senator has the power   one that is often invoked   to put a  hold  on an ambassadorial nomination to delay a full senate vote  in a veiled appeal to lawmakers  obama praised delaurentis for his leadership during the normalization process   we only hurt ourselves by not being represented by an ambassador  in havana  he said in a statement   having an ambassador will make it easier to advocate for our interests and will deepen our understanding even when we know that we will continue to have differences with the cuban government   obama said  delaurentis had been widely tipped for the post  but the president held off naming him until now even as cuba appointed its own ambassador to washington shortly after embassies were reopened in both countries  capitals in july of last year  he would be the first u s  envoy since philip bonsal  an appointee of president dwight eisenhower  left the post vacant in late   obama traveled to havana in march  the first visit by a u s  president in  years  the trip was made possible by his breakthrough agreement with cuban president raul castro in december  to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after cuba s  revolution  since the opening  obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions  while pushing cuba to accelerate cautious market style reforms and allow greater political and economic freedom  even so  the u s  embargo against cuba remains in place  a major irritant in relations  only congress can lift the embargo  and the republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon  delaurentis has been u s  chief of mission in cuba since august   his third posting in havana  he has also held diplomatic posts at the state department in washington  at the u s  mission to the united nations and in bogota
