washington  reuters    the centerpiece of president barack obama s climate change strategy faced a key test on tuesday as conservative appeals court judges questioned whether his administration overstepped its legal authority under an air pollution law to make sweeping changes to the u s  electric sector  twenty seven states led by coal producer west virginia and industry groups are challenging the environmental protection agency s clean power plan rules before  judges of the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  they argue that the epa overstepped its regulatory authority under the federal clean air act when the agency issued rules to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal fired power plants  the u s  supreme court has put the regulations on hold while the case is litigated  tuesday s highly anticipated arguments drew a crowd of hundreds at sunrise to watch the opponents face off against the epa   states and some supportive power companies  the epa told the judges that the agency had the power under the clean air act to craft the rule  and that it was cost effective and achievable  the challengers could face an uphill battle to win over a majority of the  judges  six of whom are democratic appointees   judge brett kavanaugh  appointed by former president george w  bush  said while he understands the political and moral obligation to address global warming and the importance of the united states to international climate action  the clean power plan s impact on the u s  economy and on certain coal reliant communities should require congress to have a say   this is a huge case  it has huge economic consequences   said kavanaugh  he added that climate change does not give the epa a  blank check  to use the clean air act flexibly   judge thomas griffith  another bush appointee  questioned   why is this  debate  not going on on the congress floor but in front of a room full of unelected judges     the epa argued before that the supreme court has already given the epa authority in previous cases to use the section of the clean air act at issue to regulate greenhouse gas emissions  justice department lawyer eric hostetler  representing the epa  said the agency designed the rule to be cost effective and  deepen  the shift already taking place toward cleaner energy   the epa looked at what was going on in the real world   he said  noting that most states are already shifting the make up of their electric generation      in comments indicating support for the government s position  judge judith rogers  appointed to the court by former president bill clinton  said the epa should not close its eyes to trends in the electric sector which have seen utilities diversify their energy mix   you can t survive in this market unless you do that   she said  some of the other democratic appointees voiced similar sentiments indicating they did not think the regulations constituted a major shift as the challengers argue  the clean power plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from u s  power plants by  to  percent below  levels  power plants are the largest source of u s  carbon emissions    the clean power plan is the main tool for the united states to meet the emissions reduction target it pledged to reach at u n  climate talks in paris last december   the fate of the clean power plan was thrown into question on feb   when the supreme court made a surprise   decision to grant a request by the challengers to put the rule on hold while the appeals court considered the matter  the eventual appeals court ruling could decide the case  even if it goes to the supreme court  the feb   death of conservative justice antonin scalia left the court ideologically split with four conservatives and four liberals  a   ruling by the high court would leave in place the appeals court ruling  the case is being heard by  judges rather than  because the court s chief judge  merrick garland  has recused himself from the case  garland is obama s nominee to replace scalia   a   ruling would leave the regulations in place   a ruling is unlikely before the end of the year and possibly not until after obama leaves office on jan     the outcome of the nov   presidential election could be pivotal for the regulations  if republican donald trump wins  the government could reverse the rules or decline to appeal to the supreme court should the appeals court strike them down  if democrat hillary clinton is elected  the losing side in the appeals court ruling could be expected to take the case to the supreme court  if the case does reach the high court  it may not make it in time for the justices to hear it during the court term that begins next monday and ends in june
