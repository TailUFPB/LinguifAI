washington  reuters    two women accused donald trump of inappropriate touching in a story published on wednesday by the new york times  claims his spokesman called  fiction  but which may further damage the republican presidential nominee s chances of winning the white house just four weeks before the nov   election  the report was followed by a stream of similar allegations from other women  putting more pressure on the trump campaign as it lags in national opinion polls and struggles to contain a crisis caused by the candidate s comments about groping women without their consent which surfaced on friday  one of the women  jessica leeds  appeared on camera on the new york times  website to recount how trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt on a flight to new york in or around    nyti ms   the second woman  rachel crooks  described how trump  kissed me directly on the mouth  in  outside the elevator in trump tower in manhattan  where she was a receptionist at a real estate firm  trump s campaign denied there was any truth to the new york times accounts  it made public a letter to the newspaper from marc kasowitz  a lawyer representing trump  demanding it retract the story  calling it  libelous   and threatening legal action if it did not comply   this entire article is fiction  and for the new york times to launch a completely false  coordinated character assassination against mr  trump on a topic like this is dangerous   the trump campaign s senior communications adviser jason miller said in a statement  reuters could not independently verify the incidents  leeds and crooks did not immediately respond to requests for comment from reuters   we stand by the story  which falls clearly into the realm of public service journalism   a new york times spokeswoman said  the report comes just two days after a reuters ipsos opinion poll showed one in five republicans thought trump s comments about groping women disqualified him from the presidency  and put him  points behind democratic candidate hillary clinton among likely voters  within hours  several other media outlets published similar reports  people magazine published a detailed first person account from one of its reporters  natasha stoynoff   bit ly   stoynoff said trump pinned her against a wall at his florida estate in  and kissed her as she struggled to get away    i turned around  and within seconds  he was pushing me against the wall  and forcing his tongue down my throat   stoynoff said   the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the people story late on wednesday  the article included a denial from a trump spokeswoman who called the story a  politically motivated fictional pile on   around the same time  the palm beach post reported a claim by mindy mcgillivray    a woman in south florida  that trump had grabbed her bottom  years ago while she was working at his mar a lago estate as a photographer s assistant   there is no truth to this whatsoever   trump s spokeswoman hope hicks told the post  mcgillivray could not be reached for comment  the reports come on the heels of a  video that surfaced on friday that showed trump bragging about groping women  kissing them without permission  and trying to seduce a married woman    i just start kissing them  it s like a magnet  just kiss  i don t even wait   trump is heard saying on the tape  trump said during the second presidential debate on sunday that he had not actually done the things he had boasted about  and apologized for his remarks  which he called private  locker room talk   the bombshell video has jeopardized trump s chances of winning on election day  and put republican control of the u s  congress in danger  he was chastised by republican leaders  and some called on him to drop out of the presidential race   on wednesday  trump escalated his attacks on u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan after ryan said he was no longer going to campaign for or defend trump  trump complained to thousands of supporters jammed into a livestock arena in ocala  florida  that ryan and others had not congratulated him on his debate performance on sunday  and the crowd booed in sympathy   there is a whole deal going on and we re going to figure it out  i always figure things out  but there s a whole sinister deal going on   trump said  former republican house speaker john boehner said in an interview on fox news channel that he would vote for trump in spite of being  disgusted  by his comments  because he wanted to see conservative justices named to the supreme court  the interview was taped before the new york times story was published  but boehner said he thought it was likely that more negative stories would emerge in the last month of the campaign   what more could be said in this election cycle than has already been said   boehner asked   it couldn t be any worse  could it   a spokeswoman for clinton said wednesday s report was  disturbing    these reports suggest that he lied on the debate stage and that the disgusting behavior he bragged about in the tape is more than just words   said jennifer palmieri  a spokeswoman for the clinton campaign
