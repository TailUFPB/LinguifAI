davos  switzerland   the global economy is in better shape than it s been in years  stock markets are booming  oil prices are on the rise again and the risks of a rapid economic slowdown in china  a major source of concern a year ago  have eased  and yet  as political leaders  ceos and top bankers make their annual trek up the swiss alps to the world economic forum in davos  the mood is anything but celebratory  beneath the veneer of optimism over the economic outlook lurks acute anxiety about an increasingly toxic political climate and a deep sense of uncertainty surrounding the u s  presidency of donald trump  who will be inaugurated on the final day of the forum  last year  the consensus here was that trump had no chance of being elected  his victory  less than half a year after britain voted to leave the european union  was a slap at the principles that elites in davos have long held dear  from globalization and free trade to multilateralism  trump is the poster child for a new strain of populism that is spreading across the developed world and threatening the post war liberal democratic order  with elections looming in the netherlands  france  germany  and possibly italy  this year  the nervousness among davos attendees is palpable   regardless of how you view trump and his positions  his election has led to a deep  deep sense of uncertainty and that will cast a long shadow over davos   said jean marie guehenno  ceo of international crisis group  a conflict resolution think tank  moises naim of the carnegie endowment for international peace was even more blunt   there is a consensus that something huge is going on  global and in many respects unprecedented  but we don t know what the causes are  nor how to deal with it   the titles of the discussion panels at the wef  which runs from jan     evoke the unsettling new landscape  among them are  squeezed and angry  how to fix the middle class crisis    politics of fear or rebellion of the forgotten     tolerance at the tipping point   and  the post eu era   the list of leaders attending this year is also telling  the star attraction will be xi jinping  the first chinese president ever to attend davos  his presence is being seen as a sign of beijing s growing weight in the world at a time when trump is promising a more insular   america first  approach and europe is pre occupied with its own troubles  from brexit to terrorism  british prime minister theresa may  who has the thorny task of taking her country out of the eu  will also be there  but germany s angela merkel  a davos regular whose reputation for steady  principled leadership would have fit well with the wef s main theme of  responsive and responsible leadership   will not  perhaps the central question in davos  a four day affair of panel discussions  lunches and cocktail parties that delve into subjects as diverse as terrorism  artificial intelligence and wellness  is whether leaders can agree on the root causes of public anger and begin to articulate a response  a wef report on global risks released before davos highlighted  diminishing public trust in institutions  and noted that rebuilding faith in the political process and leaders would be a  difficult task   guy standing  the author of several books on the new  precariat   a class of people who lack job security and reliable earnings  believes more people are coming around to the idea that free market capitalism needs to be overhauled  including those that have benefited most from it   the mainstream corporate types don t want trump and far right authoritarians   said standing  who has been invited to davos for the first time   they want a sustainable global economy in which they can do business  more and more of them are sensible enough to realize that they have overreached   but ian bremmer  president of u s  based political risk consultancy eurasia group  is not so sure  he recounted a recent trip to goldman sachs headquarters in new york where he saw bankers  rejoicing in the elevators  at the surge in stock markets and the prospect of tax cuts and deregulation under trump  both goldman ceo lloyd blankfein and his jp morgan counterpart jamie dimon will be in davos   if you want to find people who are going to rally together and say capitalism is fundamentally broken  davos is not the place to go   bremmer said  suma chakrabarti  president of the european bank for reconstruction and development  ebrd   believes a  modern version of globalization  is possible but acknowledges it will take time to emerge   it is going to be a long haul in persuading a lot of people that there is a different approach  but you don t have to throw the baby out with the bath water   he told reuters  still  some attendees worry that the pace of technological change and the integrated  complex nature of the global economy have made it more difficult for leaders to shape and control events  let alone reconfigure the global system  the global financial crisis of   and the migrant crisis of   exposed the impotence of politicians  deepening public disillusion and pushing people towards populists who offered simple explanations and solutions  the problem  says ian goldin  an expert on globalization and development at the university of oxford  is that on many of the most important issues  from climate change to financial regulation  only multilateral cooperation can deliver results  and this is precisely what the populists reject   the state of global politics is worse than it s been in a long time   said goldin   at a time when we need more coordination to tackle issues like climate change and other systemic risks  we are getting more and more insular
