washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives passed legislation on wednesday giving congress the power to kill dozens of recently enacted rules in one fell swoop  as republicans charged ahead on their campaign to strip down federal regulations  it was the second time the republican dominated chamber took up legislation blocking  midnight rules   those rolled out at the close of a president s term  but the previous bill  introduced in november  had faced a certain veto from president barack obama  a democrat   on its second day back in session  the house passed the bill on a vote of  to   the senate is expected to soon consider companion legislation  which could face a harder time because it would need eight votes from democrats   under a law known as the congressional review act  congress has the right to review regulations for a certain period of time after they are issued  that means any federal regulation approved since may could be voided by the republican led congress once president elect donald trump moves into the white house and can sign off on their disapproval   it takes only a simple majority of both chambers to reverse a rule  giving senate democrats little power to block a vote with a filibuster  as disapproving each regulation separately could span days  republicans would like to simply vote once to end a variety of new rules on energy  the environment  transportation  banking  finance  education and media ownership  many wall street regulations inspired by the   financial crisis have only recently taken final form or are on the cusp of completion  putting them in the disapproval line of fire  that includes two pending rules on payday lending and mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts   both of which have raised republican ire   because outgoing administrations are no longer accountable to the voters  they are much more prone to issue midnight regulations that fly in the face of the electoral mandate the voters just gave the new  incoming administration   said house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte before the vote   waves of midnight rules can also be very hard for congress or a new administration to check adequately   cutting down regulation was a near constant theme in republican political campaigns last year  and is part of house speaker paul ryan s  better way  agenda  the house is also expected to consider soon legislation that would require a congressional vote of approval for any new regulation
