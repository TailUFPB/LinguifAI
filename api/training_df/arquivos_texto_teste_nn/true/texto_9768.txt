 reuters    u s  republican presidential front runner donald trump delivered a major foreign policy speech on wednesday  vowing always to put america first   the following are highlights from his address   no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first  both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we  while being fair to them  must start doing the same  we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism  the nation state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony  i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down    the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability  but look at what s happened to us  our nuclear weapons arsenal  our ultimate deterrent  has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal    our active duty armed forces have shrunk from  million in  to about   million today  the navy has shrunk from over  ships to  ships during this same period of time  the air force is about one third smaller than   pilots flying b   in combat missions today   these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room    president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach  our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth  refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea  we have the leverage  we have the power over china  economic power  and people don t understand it  and with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea  which is totally out of control        russia  for instance  has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism  i believe an easing of tensions  and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible  absolutely possible  common sense says this cycle  this horrible cycle of hostility  must end and ideally will end soon    we have a massive trade deficit with china  a deficit that we have to find a way quickly  and i mean quickly  to balance  a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china  better than we have right now  look at what china is doing in the south china sea  they re not supposed to be doing it  no respect for this country or this president  we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways  if need be  that s what s going to have to happen    and then there s isis  i have a simple message for them  their days are numbered  i won t tell them where and i won t tell them how    isis will be gone if i m elected president  and they ll be gone quickly    he  obama  negotiated a disastrous deal with iran  and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry  iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon    he  obama  supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel  and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place   israel  our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity   president obama has not been a friend to israel   he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power    after i m elected president  i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies  in these summits  we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments  but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges       for instance  we will discuss how we can upgrade nato s outdated mission and structure  grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges  including migration and islamic terrorism
