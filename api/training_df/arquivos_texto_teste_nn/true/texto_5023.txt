washington  reuters    the new head of the environmental protection agency said on thursday he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants congress to weigh in on whether  is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated  in an interview with cnbc  epa administrator scott pruitt said the trump administration will make an announcement on fuel efficiency standards for cars  very soon   stressing that he and president donald trump believe current standards were rushed through  pruitt    is a climate change denier who sued the agency he now leads more than a dozen times as oklahoma s attorney general  he said he was not convinced that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels like oil  gas and coal is the main cause of climate change  a conclusion widely embraced by scientists   i think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact   he told cnbc    so no  i would not agree that it s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see   pruitt said   but we don t know that yet  we need to continue to debate  continue the review and analysis   trump campaigned on a promise to roll back environmental regulations ushered in by former president barack obama  including those aimed at combating climate change  he framed his stand as aimed at boosting u s  businesses  including the oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries   we can be pro growth  pro jobs and pro environment   pruitt said wednesday afternoon in a houston speech at ceraweek  the world s largest gathering of energy executives  scientists immediately criticized pruitt s statement  saying it ignores a large body of evidence collected over decades that shows fossil fuel burning as the main factor in climate change   we can t afford to reject this clear and compelling scientific evidence when we make public policy  embracing ignorance is not an option   ben santer  climate researcher at lawrence livermore national laboratory  said in a statement   the supreme court unleashed a fury of regulation and litigation when it ruled in  that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant that can be regulated under the clean air act  two years later  the epa declared carbon dioxide and five other heat trapping gases to be pollutants  pruitt said the supreme court s decision should not have been viewed as permission for the epa to regulate carbon dioxide emissions   decisions were made at the executive branch level that didn t respect the rule of law   pruitt said in his houston speech   pruitt has previously said the epa should not regulate  without a law passed by congress authorizing it to do so  the republican controlled congress could potentially issue a strong signal to the epa that carbon dioxide should not be regulated by the agency  a move that would undermine many obama era rules aimed at curbing emissions   administrator pruitt is correct  the congress has never explicitly given the epa the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the committee has no plans to do so   said mike danylak  spokesman for the senate environment and public works committee  the panel that oversees the epa   when asked at his confirmation hearing in january whether he would uphold the epa endangerment finding  pruitt said it was the  law of the land  and he was obliged to uphold it for now  pruitt declined to respond to a question from a reporter after his houston speech on whether he would now seek to overturn the endangerment finding   as oklahoma s attorney general  pruitt and another dozen attorney generals unsuccessfully challenged the endangerment finding in a federal appeals court   the mask is off  after obscuring his true views during his senate confirmation hearings  scott pruitt has outed himself as a pure climate denier   said david doniger  director of the climate program at the natural resources defense council  the new epa chief said he was committed to ensuring thorough processes for environmental rules and regulations to reduce  regulatory uncertainty   pruitt added that he shared trump s view that the global climate accord agreed by nearly  countries in paris in  was a  bad deal   trump promised during his campaign for the white house to pull the united states out of the accord  but has since been mostly quiet on the issue
