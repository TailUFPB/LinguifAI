dubai  reuters    the saudi riyal fell against the u s  dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on thursday after the u s  congress voted to allow relatives of victims of the sept   attacks to sue saudi arabia   any legal action could take years to wind through the u s  court system  and analysts said there might be little if any impact on the saudi economy or state finances  but the decision by congress was an unwelcome reminder of political and financial pressures on riyadh as low oil prices strain its budget  saudi arabia has been preparing to make its first international issue of sovereign bonds next month to raise   billion or more  but some gulf bankers said the issue might now be delayed to give investors time to digest the news  similarly  the legal threat could make riyadh less likely to choose new york for a listing of shares in national oil giant saudi aramco  an offer of aramco shares is expected as soon as   possibly raising tens of billions of dollars  and saudi officials have said they are considering several foreign bourses  the senate and house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on wednesday to override president barack obama s veto of legislation granting an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u s  soil  this clears the way for attempts to seek damages from the saudi government  riyadh has denied longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the united states in   fifteen of the  hijackers were saudi nationals  one year dollar riyal forwards  which are trades scheduled to take place  months from now  were at  points early on thursday  up from wednesday s close of  points  they rose as far as an eight week high of  points  the saudi riyal is pegged at   to the dollar in the spot market  so banks often use the forwards market to hedge against risks   in the short term you might have volatility but the legislation will take a decade to have a result  so markets will calm down   predicted a banker involved in gulf currency trade  adding the main impact might be to saddle the saudi government with tens of millions of dollars in annual legal fees  five year saudi credit default swaps  used to insure against the risk of a sovereign debt default  rose slightly to  points from   and the saudi stock market fell slightly  but the price of state run saudi electricity co s april  dollar islamic bond  one of the few outstanding international bonds from saudi arabia  did not move significantly  some analysts speculated that trade and investment ties between saudi arabia and the united states could be hurt  the kingdom owns    billion of u s  treasury bonds  according to the latest official u s  data  and is believed to hold at least that sum in other u s  assets and bank accounts   from a saudi foreign ministry perspective  there will be a review of investment policy and that could move the kingdom down a different path  which could include diversification away from u s  treasuries   the gulf banker said  in may  saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir said the proposed u s  law  would cause an erosion of investor confidence  in the united states  though he added that riyadh was not threatening to pull its money out of the country  riyadh has been selling several billion dollars in u s  bonds each month to cover its budget deficit  and bankers think it is unlikely to step this up as a result of the congress vote  that is because few other markets or currencies provide the combination of liquidity and security of the   trillion u s  treasury market  saudi arabia has also been eagerly courting investment by top u s  companies such as general electric co to help diversify its economy beyond oil  and a trade or investment war with the united states could damage its economic reform drive   the u s  is a market where the saudis will continue to invest  i don t think they ll adopt a knee jerk reaction to their investments   said john sfakianakis  economist with the jeddah based gulf research centre   if it makes sense  they will continue to keep their assets in the united states
