washington  reuters    with his selection of deal making attorney walter  jay  clayton to head the u s  securities and exchange commission  president elect donald trump is signaling that the agency will try to reduce regulations that critics see as burdensome or hindering corporate growth  trump announced on wednesday that he intends to nominate clayton  a partner in the new york office of law firm sullivan   cromwell  to lead the agency that polices and regulates wall street  clayton specializes in public and private mergers and acquisitions and capital raising efforts  and notably worked on the initial public offering of alibaba group holding company  baba n   he also helps companies navigate regulatory and enforcement actions  including a number of cases that involved mortgage securities  at least two clients that clayton has represented   alibaba and ally financial   have both disclosed in recent years that they are being investigated by the sec  it is not clear whether either review has been concluded   jay clayton is a highly talented expert on many aspects of financial and regulatory law  and he will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time   trump said in a statement   clayton did not immediately respond to a request for comment  but in a statement released by the trump transition team  he pledged to ensure investors and companies have confidence to invest in america   many republicans in recent years have criticized the sec for focusing too much on enforcement  especially under outgoing chair mary jo white  a former federal prosecutor  and not enough on its other missions  including writing rules that promote capital formation  legal experts said clayton s background is more in line with some past sec chiefs  and points to less regulation and perhaps a shift away from white s policy in which the agency fined firms for smaller violations in an effort to deter bigger ones   as a day to day corporate transactional lawyer  he ll know what these regulations are like   said walter van dorn  a partner at bakerhostetler and former sec official  as is often the case with sec chair nominees  clayton has some close personal and professional ties to wall street  during the height of the  financial crisis  clayton worked on major deals involving big banks  including barclays capital s  barc l  acquisition of lehman brothers  assets  the sale of bear stearns to jp morgan chase  jpm n   and the u s  treasury department s capital investment in goldman sachs  gs n   according to his law firm s website  he has helped draft comment letters to the sec that advocated for less onerous restrictions for foreign public companies  and also participated in a  article which advocated for less zealous enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act  clayton s background representing goldman and other wall street firms is likely to come up during his senate confirmation hearing  his wife  gretchen butler clayton  is employed by goldman sachs as a private wealth advisor  democrats including massachusetts senator elizabeth warren have previously been critical of any potential sec nominee  including those from within their own political party  who have strong ties to wall street   it s hard to see how an attorney who s spent his career helping wall street beat the rap will keep president elect trump s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from  getting away with murder     said u s  senate banking committee ranking member sherrod brown  like white  also a former wall street lawyer  clayton will likely need to recuse himself on some matters and divest certain stock holdings  under federal ethics rules  he will be recused for one year from voting on any particular matter if a firm or individual is being represented by sullivan   cromwell   prior clients who have been represented by sullivan   cromwell in sec cases have included ubs  ubsg s  and fifth third bank  fitb o    he will also be recused for a year from working on matters that involve clients he represented in the past year  and recused indefinitely if a deal he previously worked on comes up during sec litigation  the length of time could be longer if trump opts to continue president barack obama s current policy  which extended the recusal period by an additional year  trump still needs to fill two other sec vacancies to round out the five member panel  without a full panel  possible recusals could in certain cases lead to a deadlocked vote on some enforcement matters  perhaps the trickier conflicts to navigate will involve his wife s employment at goldman sachs  said richard painter  a law professor at the university of minnesota who served as the chief ethics lawyer at the white house under president george w  bush   you cannot be chairman of the securities and exchange commission and have you or your spouse have any financial interest in goldman sachs   he said  to manage the conflict  he said  she would need to divest any stock or stock options in the company and negotiate a flat salary   it could not be immediately determined whether gretchen butler clayton does own goldman stock  she did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment  breakingviews tv  an insider at the sec     reut rs  sec subpoenas ally financial over subprime auto lending
