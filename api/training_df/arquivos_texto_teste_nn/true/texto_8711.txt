cleveland  reuters    donald trump s wife melania  in her first major political speech on monday  portrayed her husband as a talented  compassionate and unrelenting leader who would unify rather than divide the country if elected to the white house  the slovenian born jewelry designer and former model delivered the speech  part of which strongly resembled an address given by current first lady michelle obama in   to a cheering crowd at the republican national convention in cleveland after a one minute introduction from trump   the presumptive republican nominee made a dramatic entrance  silhouetted against a white background  to the accompaniment of queen s  rock anthem   we are the champions    i have been with donald for  years and i have been aware of his love for this country since we first met   the aspiring first lady told the convention   he s tough when he has to be  but he s also kind and fair and caring    donald wants prosperity for all americans   she said  reading from a teleprompter  as people applauded   her roughly  minute speech was a bid to soften the image of the new york businessman turned politician  who has been accused of bigotry and callousness for his calls to suspend muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants if elected  he has also been criticized for insults directed at women  political opponents and journalists  part of the text referring to the values held by her family was strikingly similar to a section of michelle obama s speech to the democratic convention in   a trump campaign official suggested the similarity was the result of an error by her speech writers   in writing her beautiful speech  melania s team of writers took notes on her life s inspirations  and in some instances included fragments that reflected her own thinking   jason miller  trump s senior communications advisor  said in a statement  trump s democratic rival  hillary clinton  has accused trump    of lacking the experience and temperament needed to work in the oval office  on monday  clinton    used an address to a largely black audience to cast trump as someone who would divide the country along racial  ethnic and religious lines  the convention s opening night featured a string of emotional speakers attacking clinton s record as secretary of state under president barack obama  many arguing she had made americans vulnerable to islamist militancy   i blame hillary clinton personally for the death of my son   said pat smith  the mother of an information management officer who was among the four americans killed in an attack on a u s  mission in benghazi  libya  in   former new york mayor rudy giuliani  whose administration has been credited with sharply reducing crime in the city during the  and who oversaw the city s response to the sept      attacks that destroyed the world trade center and killed almost   people  gave a highly charged speech slamming clinton and making the case for trump   what i did for new york  donald trump will do for america   he said  the convention erupted in chaos earlier when trump opponents inside his party stormed out of the room and others chanted  in a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy  the turmoil threatened efforts by the trump campaign to show the party had united behind him and distracted from the day s theme of  make america safe again   the anti trump forces wanted to change the party s nominating rules to allow delegates to support alternative republican candidates over trump  party leaders held a voice vote  then declared the opponents lacked enough support  triggering pandemonium on the floor of the cleveland basketball arena where trump is due to be formally nominated this week for the nov   election   this entire system is rigged to force the vote for donald trump   said kendal unruh  a delegate from colorado  while delivering a jolt to the highly scripted program  the rebellion by the anti trump forces was quashed  but the furor  an embarrassment to trump  put a spotlight on the deep divisions within the party that have emerged over his candidacy  a string of senior republicans  worried about trump s temperament and policies  were already avoiding the convention   the gathering opened on monday afternoon in the shadow of racially tinged killings of police officers and black men  and as protesters for and against trump faced off in a plaza a few blocks from the convention  shouting slogans at each other  separated by a wall of police  the protests were largely peaceful  with law enforcement officers outnumbering demonstrators   sunday s shooting of three policemen in baton rouge  louisiana   a targeted attack that may have been retaliation for a series of police killings of black americans   hung over the gathering  trump criticized obama early on monday over the shootings  saying the democratic president  doesn t have a clue     the baton rouge shootings happened nearly two weeks after police fatally shot a black man there  and after another such death near st  paul  minnesota  both of which sparked nationwide protests   five policemen were also killed in an ambush in dallas this month  trump has sought to position himself as the law and order candidate  in an echo of republican richard nixon s successful presidential campaign of             this story has been corrected to delete paragraph  which erroneously cited a parody twitter account in suggesting donald trump jr  threatened the leaders of the attempted revolt
