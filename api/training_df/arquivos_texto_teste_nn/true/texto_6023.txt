washington  reuters    president donald trump s plans to investigate the possibility of voter fraud in the  election could pave the way for tough voting rules including stringent id requirements that democrats and rights groups say would amount to a new assault on voting rights  trump s frequent and repeatedly refuted assertions of election fraud were a tacit endorsement of recent republican led state restrictions on access to the ballot  critics said  and could be an early sign of the administration s support for changes in laws that could create new hurdles to voting   if you look throughout history  these allegations of fraud have always been deployed as a justification for restricting access to the ballot   said dale ho  director of the voting rights project at the american civil liberties union  repeated studies have shown that voter fraud is exceptionally rare in u s  elections and almost always the result of isolated mistakes  not a systematic attempt to cheat the system  civil rights groups said trump s unfounded accusations that millions voted unlawfully in november could signal a broader justice department shift away from its approach under former democratic president barack obama of challenging statewide voting laws that discriminate against minority voters  in a possible early sign of that shift  government lawyers asked just hours after trump s inauguration on friday for a delay in a hearing on whether a voter identification law in texas was intentionally discriminatory  the lawyers said they were seeking the delay because of the change of leadership  a new push in the republican controlled congress for federal voting restrictions could include a national voter identification or proof of citizenship requirement  or a campaign to update and purge voter rolls or limit registration efforts  voting advocates said  while u s  citizenship is required to vote in american elections  most states allow those wishing to register to simply sign a statement affirming they are citizens  thirty two states require some form of identification at the polls  the national conference of state legislatures said  trump won the state by state electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency but lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton by nearly  million ballots in the nov   election  he has blamed that margin on millions of illegal voters casting ballots for clinton  announcing his  major investigation  into voter fraud on twitter on wednesday  he said it would cover  those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal  and  those registered to vote who are dead  and many for a long time     depending on results  we will strengthen up voting procedures   trump said  while outdated voter registrations caused by people moving or dying are not uncommon  many state election officials regularly update their voter lists to keep them up to date and outdated registrations do not constitute fraud  rights advocates said  trump s statements could  serve as a dog whistle for voter suppression tactics to be implemented around the country   said kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  a washington based advocacy group  new voting restrictions were instituted in  republican led states after the  election  including a photo identification requirement in wisconsin  restrictions on mail in ballot collection in arizona and cutbacks to early voting in ohio  civil rights groups said the laws  which have been struck down by courts in some states  were aimed at poor and minority voters more likely to support democrats  the national association of secretaries of state  which represents election officials in all  states including many republicans  disputed trump s views on voter fraud   we are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by president trump but we are open to learning more about the administration s concerns   the group said  eleven states that passed new voting restrictions between the  and  general elections responded to questions from reuters about the prevalence of voter fraud before and after their laws  none provided specific examples of voter fraud that necessitated the new laws  or of fraud attempts that were caught by the newly passed laws  but tennessee  alabama  ohio and texas said hundreds of reports of voter fraud had been received and investigated by state authorities in recent years  state election officials in tennessee and texas both said that  dozens  of voter fraud reports had resulted in prosecutions  john merrill  alabama s republican secretary of state  said investigating voter fraud was better left to local communities and states   we don t need the federal government to help until we realize there s a problem that we can t solve on our own or aren t making an effort to solve on our own   he said  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters the voter fraud investigation would  look at the scope of the problem  before solutions were proposed   maybe its voter id in states   he said   but i think we have to understand where the problem exists  how deep it goes  and then suggest some remedies to it   any federal effort to prosecute voter fraud would be headed by trump s attorney general nominee  republican senator jeff sessions  who has been criticized for his record on voting rights and race relations  a voter fraud case he prosecuted as a u s  attorney in his home state of alabama helped sink his confirmation as a federal judge in   trump has not always seen voter fraud in last year s election results  his campaign attorneys opposed recount efforts in several states sought by green party candidate jill stein and argued in a legal filing that  all available evidence suggests that the  general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake   spicer said the campaign was just talking about swing states where the election was fiercely contested  not the big states of california and new york where clinton rolled up her popular vote margin   we didn t look at those two states in particular   spicer told reporters
