washington  reuters    donald trump s election as president raises the prospect the united states will pull out of the nuclear pact it signed last year with iran  alienating washington from its allies and potentially freeing iran to act on its ambitions  outgoing president barack obama s administration touted the deal  a legacy foreign policy achievement  as a way to suspend tehran s suspected drive to develop atomic weapons  in return obama  a democrat  agreed to a lifting of most sanctions  the deal  harshly opposed by republicans in congress  was reached as a political commitment rather than a treaty ratified by lawmakers  making it vulnerable to a new u s  president  such as trump  who might disagree with its terms  a republican  trump ran for the white house opposing the deal but contradictory statements made it unclear how he would act  in an upset over democrat hillary clinton  trump won on tuesday and will succeed obama on jan    a businessman turned politician who has never held public office  trump called the nuclear pact a  disaster  and  the worst deal ever negotiated  during his campaign and said it could lead to a  nuclear holocaust    in a speech to the pro israel lobby group aipac in march  trump declared that his  number one priority  would be to  dismantle the disastrous deal with iran     he said he would have negotiated a better deal  with longer restrictions  but somewhat paradoxically  he criticized remaining u s  sanctions that prevent american companies from dealing with iran  by contrast  he has conceded it would be hard to destroy a deal enshrined in a united nations resolution  in august   he said he would not  rip up  the nuclear deal  but that he would  police that contract so tough they don t have a chance   iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapons  but experts said any u s  violation of the deal would allow iran also to pull back from its commitments to curb nuclear development   those commitments include reducing the number of its centrifuges by two thirds  capping its level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bomb grade material  reducing its enriched uranium stockpile from around   kg to  kg for  years  and submitting to international inspections to verify its compliance   say goodbye to the iran deal   said richard nephew  a former u s  negotiator with iran now at columbia university   there is very little likelihood that it stays  either because of a deliberate decision to tear it up by trump  or steps that the u s  takes which prompt an iranian walk back   the spokesman of the atomic energy organization of iran  behrouz kamalvandi  was quoted as saying by tasnim news agency   iran is prepared for any change   adding that iran would try to stand by the deal  the nuclear deal was divisive in iran  with hardliners opposed to better relations with the west arguing that pragmatist president hassan rouhani was giving up too much of the country s nuclear infrastructure for too little relief  rouhani said on wednesday the u s  election results would have no effect on tehran s policies  state news agency irna quoted him as saying   some of washington s closest middle east allies have been skeptical of the nuclear deal  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has been outright hostile  gulf leaders say the deal has emboldened iran s pursuit of regional hegemony in part through support for proxy groups fueling regional conflicts  iranian supreme leader ali khamenei  whose power supersedes that of rouhani  regularly criticizes the united states and says it should not be trusted  but ultimately assented to the terms of the deal  known by its acronym jcpoa   the big winner in the aftermath of a trump victory is iran s supreme leader   said suzanne maloney  a foreign policy expert at the brookings institution   he will have the most cartoonish american enemy  he will exult in the  hopefully brief  crash of the american economy  and he will be able to walk away from iran s obligations under the jcpoa while pinning the responsibility on washington   further complicating any trump effort to renegotiate the deal is that it is a multilateral agreement involving u s  allies in europe as well as fellow world powers russia and china  european and asian firms have been returning to iran and making major investments there  meaning the united states would likely be alone in pulling out of the deal  possibly isolating it from its partners  on wednesday  the head of gas  renewables and power for french oil and gas company total totf pa in iran said trump s election would have no impact on investments   khamenei has already promised to  set fire  to the nuclear deal if the west violates it  iran has repeatedly complained it has not received benefits promised  though european companies have been eager to explore business prospects in iran  few deals have been enacted in part because european banks have been reluctant to finance deals involving iran   as to whether he can negotiate a  better  deal  it takes two  or seven  sides to agree to begin that process  something i rate as highly unlikely   said zachary goldman  executive director of the center on law and security at new york university and a former u s  treasury official   and if we walk away from the deal i think we will be in the worst of all worlds   iran will feel freed from its commitments and we may be blamed for the deal falling apart
