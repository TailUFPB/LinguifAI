havana  reuters    cruise company carnival corporation believes cuba will soon modify rules that bar cuban americans from traveling on its planned cruises to the island  the company said on friday  after pressure mounted for the trip to be postponed   carnival is due to become the first u s  cruise company to sail directly to cuba in more than half a century on may   but the exclusion of cuban americans has prompted a lawsuit against the company and protests in miami  u s  secretary of state john kerry said on thursday that carnival  needs to not discriminate  and called on cuba to change the policy   a state department official later said kerry  in no way meant to convey that carnival is supporting policies that are discriminating against cuban american travelers   asked whether carnival was considering cancelling the trip  spokesman roger frizzell said the company was confident cuba would change its rules before the sailing date       we continue to believe that cuba will modify its regulation before we sail on may  based on our ongoing discussions with cuban officials   frizzell said  citing rules that allow cuban americans to visit cuba by air as an example   cuban born americans cannot visit the island by sea  due to a cuban law that dates to the cold war era  and therefore are barred from joining in carnival s sailing to the island
