 reuters    growing numbers of u s  states are seeking to ensure that women have continued access to free birth control in case the insurance benefit is dropped as part of president elect donald trump s vow to repeal and replace the affordable care act  the  law  popularly called obamacare  requires most health insurance plans to provide coverage for birth control without a patient co payment  which can be as much as   per month for birth control pills or    for long acting contraceptives such as intrauterine devices  california  maryland  vermont and illinois since  have enacted statutes codifying the affordable care act s contraception mandate in state law and expanding on the federal law s requirements  democratic lawmakers in new york  minnesota  colorado and massachusetts said they are pursuing similar measures this year  with obamacare under mortal threat in washington  new york s democratic attorney general  eric schneiderman  on wednesday introduced such a measure in his state s legislature that would expand on the obamacare contraception mandate   women across new york are very concerned that republican efforts to repeal the aca will mean the loss of the contraception on which they rely   schneiderman said   i won t hesitate to act to protect new yorkers  rights   including the right to choose  and the right to birth control   no matter what a trump administration does   schneiderman added  referring to abortion rights  trump  who succeeds democratic president barack obama on jan    and his fellow republicans in congress have made dismantling obamacare their  first order of business   as vice president elect mike pence put it on jan     republicans in congress have not presented a detailed proposal for repealing and replacing the law but many republicans and religious conservatives have opposed the obamacare contraception mandate   twenty eight of the  states currently have laws requiring private insurers to provide coverage for birth control  but not all the laws affect all insurance plans  and only a few mandate cost free birth control  out of pocket expenses the obamacare contraception mandate has applied since  to most new insurance plans including employer provided coverage  in   for example  the mandate saved u s  women more than    billion in out of pocket expenses for birth control pills  according to a report by university of pennsylvania researchers  almost   million privately insured u s  women used the pill that year  the legislative move by some states  most of them democratic governed  is designed to clear up uncertainty for some of the  million women who now have access to free contraceptives and related treatments under the affordable care act  conservatives also have chipped away at the obamacare mandate in court  the u s  supreme court ruled in  that forcing family owned businesses to pay for employee insurance coverage for birth control ran afoul of another federal law safeguarding religious freedom  the supreme court last may sent another legal challenge by nonprofit christian employers back to lower courts to reconsider the matter after tossing out their rulings favoring the obama administration    i think it is even more important now   said colorado state representative susan lontine  who last year co sponsored a contraception coverage bill in her state s legislature that did not get passed but she expects to be resurrected in    we don t know what will happen on the federal level   california in  became the first state to pass a contraception mandate that went further than the obamacare language  maryland  vermont and illinois last year passed laws that also eliminated co pays for vasectomies and allowed women to fill a birth control prescription for at least six months rather than one to three   the new york legislation would allow women to fill multiple months of a birth control prescription  prohibit private insurers from  medical management  reviews that could limit or delay contraception coverage  and provide coverage for vasectomies without a co pay  within a matter of months  the trump administration even without congressional action could drop contraception from obamacare s list of preventive services that health insurance plans must cover without out of pocket costs  said laurie sobel  senior policy analyst at the nonprofit kaiser family foundation  if repealed  some employers might choose to maintain the coverage without a co pay because it is a relatively inexpensive benefit popular with employees  the proportion of privately insured women who paid nothing out of pocket for birth control pills increased from  percent in the fall of  to  percent in the spring of  during the time when the coverage went into wide effect  according to the guttmacher institute research organization  the no cost contraceptives coverage also spurred women to switch to long acting methods such as the iud  which is offered in the united states by bayer  teva  allergan and   studies have found  more than  percent of women and  percent of men support the no cost contraceptives coverage  according to a  washington post kaiser family foundation survey
