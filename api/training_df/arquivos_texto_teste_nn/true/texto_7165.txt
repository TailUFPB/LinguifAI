washington  reuters    representative mike pompeo  president elect donald trump s surprise choice to head the cia  supports the u s  government s sweeping collection of americans  communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with iran  the retired army officer  west point and harvard law school graduate also has defended the cia s use of interrogation techniques that are widely condemned as torture  the kansas republican has criticized democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s use of a private email server as secretary of state and her handling of the  attacks on u s  posts in benghazi  libya  a member of the house of representatives intelligence committee  pompeo    was first elected in the  tea party wave from the congressional district centered on his hometown of wichita  members of both parties regard him as intelligent  collegial and capable  with a keen grasp of national security issues   mike is very bright and hard working  and will devote himself to helping the agency develop the best possible intelligence for policy makers   said adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee   while we have had our share of strong differences   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in benghazi   i know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage    pompeo  is a serious guy who studies issues carefully   said former national security agency and cia director michael hayden  some civil liberties and human rights advocates  however  expressed concern over pompeo s selection because he opposes  closing the guantanamo bay detention center  they also criticized his support for the national security agency s now defunct bulk communications metadata collection and other surveillance programs   these positions and others merit serious public scrutiny through a confirmation process   said anthony romero  the executive director of the american civil liberties union  in a january op ed in the wall street journal he co authored  pompeo called for a  fundamental upgrade to america s surveillance capabilities   including resuming bulk collection of domestic phone metadata  the numbers and time stamps of calls  but not their content   the program  which a federal appeals court and two governmental review panels found to be illegal and ineffective  should be expanded to include  publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive  searchable database   and that  legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed   he wrote  he also called for the death penalty for edward snowden  the nsa contractor who disclosed the existence of the metadata program and other top secret surveillance programs     pompeo stands a good chance of being confirmed by the republican controlled senate  announcement of his nomination was warmly greeted by senator richard burr  the chairman of the senate intelligence committee  which will conduct his confirmation hearing   pompeo has been at the forefront of attacks in congress on clinton  accusing her of  criminality  for storing emails containing classified information on her private server  he served on the republican led house committee that investigated the attacks by islamist extremists on u s  diplomatic and cia posts in benghazi that killed four americans  while the panel found no wrongdoing by the administration  pompeo and another member appended to the final report a commentary accusing clinton and other officials of failing to protect the posts and to respond appropriately to the attacks      democrats accused pompeo of using inaccurate information to exaggerate alleged failures by clinton on benghazi some of pompeo s positions also are at odds with the assessments of the intelligence officers and analysts trump wants him to command  while he has argued that the cia s use of harsh interrogation techniques  including waterboarding  which simulates drowning  produced useful intelligence  current cia director john brennan has said he would resign if he were ordered to resume the practice  other cia and military officers and fbi agents have said so called  enhanced interrogation techniques  do not produce reliable information because prisoners will  say anything  to end their suffering  as one cia official put it  pompeo also is at odds with the intelligence community s assessment of the  deal that lifted financial sanctions from iran in return for limits on its nuclear program  he has vowed to overturn the deal  and suggested in a  roundtable with journalists that the united states should bomb iran s nuclear facilities  a proposal that u s  intelligence experts said would only delay tehran s development of a warhead  not halt it  pompeo also has opposed the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change  while at the cia  a recently created mission center for global issues tracks global warming as a threat to u s  security  he has taken positions that are at odds with trump s  notably on russia s actions in ukraine and its military support for syrian president bashar al assad  who also is supported by iran  russia has established a toehold in the middle east  and  we now have the iranian russian axis there largely running free   pompeo told a security forum in   pompeo  who was born in california  graduated first in his class from the u s  military academy at west point and was an artillery officer in the army for five years  he received a degree from the harvard law school and was an editor of the prestigious harvard law review
