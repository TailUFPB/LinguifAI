appointment  sessions  a u s  senator from alabama  distanced himself from comments he had made defending trump from criticism over a  video that emerged in october showing trump boasting about grabbing women s genitals  at the time  sessions told the weekly standard magazine he would not characterize the behavior as sexual assault  he later said the comments were taken out of context  asked on tuesday whether  grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent is     sexual assault   he replied   clearly  it would be   with  days to go before trump takes office  sessions    was the first cabinet nominee to face questioning  he appeared before the senate judiciary committee  trump s pick to run the department of homeland security  retired marine corps general john kelly  later went before the homeland security committee  as attorney general  sessions would serve as the top u s  law enforcement officer and be responsible for giving unbiased legal advice to the president and executive agencies      with that in mind  lawmakers from both trump s republican party and the democratic party sought to establish how closely sessions hewed to trump positions and whether he could put aside his staunchly conservative political positions to enforce laws he may personally oppose      a senator since   sessions was widely expected to be confirmed by the republican controlled senate   protesters accusing sessions of having a poor record on human rights interrupted the capitol hill proceedings several times  sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the united states on the basis of religion and that trump s intentions were to restrict people from countries harboring terrorists  not all muslims  elected on nov    trump at one point campaigned on a proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country   sessions said he favored  higher intensity of vetting  for refugees seeking to enter the united states from countries that harbor terrorists but that he would oppose ending the u s  refugee program  he also said he would enforce a  law that outlawed waterboarding terrorism suspects even if it meant resisting trump  the senator said he had voted against the law  believing those in high positions in the military and intelligence community should be able to do so     during the campaign  trump said waterboarding  which simulates drowning and is widely regarded as torture  was an effective technique and vowed to bring it back and make it  a hell of a lot worse   more recently trump has said retired marine corps general james mattis  his nominee for secretary of defense  had persuasively argued against it      sessions said he would enforce laws upheld by the u s  supreme court  even those he disagreed with  such as decisions making abortion and same sex marriage legal  sessions said the comments he made during the  presidential campaign about democrat hillary clinton s email practices and charitable foundation would cloud the perception of impartiality if the justice department continued investigating clinton  he said he would recuse himself and favored a special prosecutor to carry out any future investigations   trump  who defeated clinton  said during the campaign that if elected  he would ask his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to see that clinton go to prison for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and her relationship with her family s charitable foundation       sessions said he agreed with trump in opposing democratic president barack obama s executive

discriminate against american workers by hiring foreigners   as head of the justice department  the attorney general oversees the immigration court system that decides whether immigrants are deported or granted asylum or some other kind of protection  sessions renewed his criticism of the obama administration for not being tougher on countries that refuse to take back criminal migrants ordered deported from the united states   a key plank of trump s election campaign was his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the u s  border with mexico  kelly told his hearing a physical barrier on its own is not enough to keep people and drugs from illegally entering the united states  in written testimony  kelly said that  rapidly processing  and deporting immigrants in  significant numbers  would deter future illegal migration  the u s  immigration court system has a backlog of over   cases awaiting a decision on deportation  asylum or some other kind of protection  many migrants arriving at the u s  mexico border are given a notice to appear in court one to three years in the future   before the judiciary committee  sessions several times defended himself
