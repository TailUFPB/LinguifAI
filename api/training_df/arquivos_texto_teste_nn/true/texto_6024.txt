washington  reuters    president donald trump may order a review that could lead to bringing back a cia program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas  black site  prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used  two u s  officials said on wednesday  the black sites were used to detain suspects captured in president george w  bush s  war on terrorism  after the sept      attacks and were formally closed by former president barack obama  any return to the bush administration s initial anti terrorism tactics   including secret prisons and interrogation methods considered torture under international law   would likely alienate key u s  allies in the fight against militant groups like al qaeda and islamic state  the officials said trump is expected to sign an executive order in the next few days  it would call for a high level review into  whether to reinitiate a program of interrogation of high value alien terrorists to be operated outside the united states  and whether the cia should run the facilities  according to a copy of the draft published by the washington post  reuters could not independently verify the document  trump administration spokesman sean spicer said the draft was not a white house document  the draft published by the washington post appeared to have sections missing  suggesting that it may not have been a full version ready for trump to sign  u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said the trump administration did not write the document   my understanding is this was written by somebody who worked on the transition before who s not in the trump administration  this is not a product of the administration   ryan said in an interview with msnbc       aides to obama said during his tenure that his prohibition against torture and efforts to close the guantanamo prison in cuba helped increase counterterrorism cooperation from u s  allies in the arab world            the now defunct program s practices dubbed enhanced interrogation techniques   which included simulated drowning  known as waterboarding   were criticized around the world and denounced by obama and other senior u s  officials as torture  the document ignited a bipartisan outcry in congress  many people in u s  intelligence agencies and within the military are opposed to reopening the harsh interrogation program  according to multiple serving officers    the president can sign whatever executive orders he likes  but the law is the law  we are not bringing back torture in the united states of america   senator john mccain  a republican who underwent torture as a prisoner of war in vietnam  said in a statement        the cia black sites were located in poland  lithuania  romania  thailand and afghanistan  in   bush ended the use of harsh interrogation techniques and closed all the black sites except for one in kabul  asked whether he wants waterboarding as president  trump answered in an interview with abc news   i will rely on  cia director mike  pompeo and  defense secretary james  mattis and my group  and if they don t want to do it  that s fine  if they do want to do it  then i will work toward that end   trump said   i want to do everything within the bounds of what we re allowed to do if it s legal  if they don t want to do it  that s fine  do i feel it works  absolutely i feel it works   mattis and pompeo had not been aware such plans were in the works  according to a congressional source   trump s draft order would authorize a review of interrogation techniques that u s  officials could use on terrorism suspects  keep open the detention center at the u s  naval base in guantanamo bay  cuba  and send new prisoners there   trump s draft also revokes directives by obama to grant the international committee of the red cross access to all detainees in u s  custody and restrict interrogation methods to those in a u s  army field manual  trump vowed during the  election campaign to resume waterboarding and a  hell of a lot worse  because even if torture does not work   they deserve it anyway   he has said he wanted to keep guantanamo open and  load it up with some bad dudes   of the  prisoners left at guantanamo   face charges in war crimes proceedings known as military commissions  including khalid sheikh mohammed  accused mastermind of the sept      attacks  and his alleged co conspirators  bush established the military commissions  which obama later changed  the draft order said   no person in the custody of the united states shall at any time be subjected to torture  or cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  as proscribed by u s  law   it does not mention international laws to which the united states is a signatory that prohibit torture  congress passed the national defense authorization act in   which reaffirmed a prohibition on torture and required u s  interrogators to adhere to techniques in the army field manual  however  the justice department under trump could issue an interpretation of u s  law that allows for the use of harsh interrogation techniques as occurred in the  torture memos  drafted under the bush administration in  and subsequently withdrawn   despite the killing of al qaeda leader osama bin laden during obama s presidency  the dramatic spread of groups like islamic state has exacerbated the threat from violent islamist organizations  in a statement accompanying the draft order  the administration criticizes obama s policies  saying   the united states has refrained from exercising certain authorities critical to its defense   but it acknowledges that the national defense authorization act  provides a significant statutory barrier to the resumption of the cia interrogation program   human rights groups decried any attempt to bring back the black sites    this is an extremely disturbing and outrageous attempt to open the door again to systematic torture and secret detention  this is the trump administration making good on its most worrisome comments during the campaign   said naureen shah  amnesty international usa s director of national security and human rights  critics say a return to harsh interrogations would enflame tensions in muslim countries and be counterproductive  in the draft document  references to the  global war on terrorism  were edited and replaced with the phrase  fight against radical islamism   reflecting language trump often  uses      a former senior u s  intelligence official  who requested anonymity  said many cia officers would oppose reinstatement of black site interrogations  in part because they were forced to obtain lawyers after the withdrawal of the justice department memos that legalized the harsh techniques   people felt they were hung out to dry   the former official said   there is a lack of trust there   moreover  he said  it would be extremely difficult to persuade other governments to allow the cia to establish secret prisons on their soil   where are you going to do this   he asked   how many countries are going to jump back into the u s  lap  trump s order  if enacted  could put new cia director pompeo in a tight spot given that his workforce  according to multiple serving officers  largely opposes reinstating the black sites program  it could also complicate the confirmation of trump s nominee for the job of director of national intelligence  former u s  senator dan coats  as a conservative republican congressman from kansas  pompeo defended the cia s use of harsh interrogation techniques  arguing that they produced useful intelligence   during his confirmation hearing for cia director  he pledged he would  absolutely not  reinstate those methods  yet in written responses to questions from senate intelligence committee members  he appeared to leave the door open to restoring them   if experts believed the current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country  i would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law   pompeo wrote
