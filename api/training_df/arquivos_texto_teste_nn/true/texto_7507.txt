jerusalem  reuters    most of the world follows u s  presidential elections closely  but israel can seem particularly obsessive  endlessly assessing which candidate will better protect its interests and breaking down their every comment for policy clues  as america votes on tuesday  a cartoon in the left leaning israeli newspaper haaretz captured a sense of that fretfulness  depicting friends sitting outside a typical falafel stand and discussing in nerdy detail how the ballot will turn out    there s no way he d lose utah and arizona  and you can t count on north carolina   one says to the other   they d need to win pennsylvania and hopefully florida   the other replies  the fact is  despite all the nervous introspection  both democrat candidate hillary clinton and republican donald trump are likely to be reliable for israel  continuing the broad policy mix u s  presidents have pursued since the    it s the palestinians who may have more to worry about  over the past four years  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has had a fractious relationship with barack obama  openly campaigning against the u s  deal on iran s nuclear program  including condemning it in a speech to congress  but ultimately that did not stand in the way of the obama administration s agreeing a new    billion   year military aid package for israel  and while the u s  president has criticized israel for building more settlements on land the palestinians seek for their own state  the censure has never gone beyond words  essentially leaving israel free to build  analysts say that standoff ish approach is likely to continue whether clinton or trump becomes president  and there are other reasons for israel to expect a warmer embrace from the next administration than it has had from obama  netanyahu has been careful not to show favoritism  meeting both candidates and saying much the same thing afterwards  clinton  a former new york senator and u s  secretary of state  has repeatedly emphasized that she will protect israel s interests  trump has said he will move the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  a popular line that would all but enshrine jerusalem as the country s capital   we enjoy and appreciate the strong bipartisan support we get   said lior weintraub  vice president of the israel project  a pro israel lobby group  and a former chief of staff at the israeli embassy in washington  dc   we believe either president will continue the tradition of the many presidents from both sides of the aisle of fostering the alliance on every front  from security to culture   while polls show most israelis favor clinton  trump has a hard core following among some national religious israelis  many of whom are originally from the united states  when it comes to policy  israeli analysts see clinton as having a better handle on the issues  and the people who are likely to handle the middle east if she is elected are more familiar faces than those in trump s circle   the question is what it may mean for the palestinians  with deep internal divisions and little prospect of a resumption of peace talks with israel  palestinian observers believe neither candidate has their best interests at heart   either of them will maintain the u s  commitment to aid israel  the two have publicly angered the palestinians in electoral speeches   said analyst hani habib   the only difference was that trump promised to move the u s  ambassador to jerusalem while clinton kept silent   any betting on either of them is a losing bet   he said   this version of the story was refiled to restore the dropped word  will  in paragraph two
