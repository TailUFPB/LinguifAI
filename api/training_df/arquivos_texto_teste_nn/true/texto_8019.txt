cannon ball  n d  washington  reuters    three days after guard dogs attacked native americans protesting an oil pipeline project in north dakota in early september  an unprecedented event took place at the white house  brian cladoosby  president of the national congress of american indians  which represents more than  tribes  spoke to nearly a dozen of president barack obama s cabinet level advisers at a september  meeting of the white house s three year old native american affairs council   it was the first time a tribal leader addressed a session of the council  and cladoosby was invited in his role as the indian congress  leader  cladoosby  a swinomish indian from washington state  spoke twice at the one hour roundtable  he told reuters he praised the obama administration in his opening statement for its track record on native american issues such as pushing to reform the indian health service  but when cladoosby gave his closing speech  he delivered an impassioned request to his audience  stand with native americans who have united with the standing rock sioux tribe and block construction of the dakota access pipeline  a   mile conduit to get oil from north dakota to illinois   that plea marked one of the previously unreported turning points in a drama that played out since february and culminated september  with an about face by the u s  government  from giving the pipeline a green light to backing a request from north dakota s standing rock sioux to halt construction of the pipeline   the tribe fears sacred sites could be destroyed during the line s construction and that a future oil spill would pollute its drinking water  this month s win for the tribe  which could be reversed by regulators  is a rare instance of protests resulting in quick federal action and the triumph of an unusual alliance between environmentalists and native americans  who both say they were emboldened by the defeat of the keystone xl pipeline last fall  it also was the most galvanizing movement in native american politics in decades  some tribal leaders said  as crow  navajo  sioux and other traditional rivals united to fight what they considered an assault on their way of life  cladoosby did not play a high profile role in the early days of the pipeline controversy  but that day he spoke to a high echelon of power  including secretary of the interior sally jewell  white house domestic policy council director cecilia munoz  and the heads of the departments of energy  agriculture  education  health and human services  and the environmental protection agency  according to a senior administration official who asked not to be named and to a photo of attendees seen by reuters   the world is watching   he said in prepared remarks shared with reuters  a few days earlier  video of pipeline security personnel in north dakota armed with guard dogs and mace trying to disperse protesters went viral on social media  one of the first videos was taken and posted on facebook by lonnie favel  a member of utah s ute tribe who traveled to north dakota to support the protests   i was getting messages of support from new zealand  from europe  from all over the world   favel said  until then  obama had not weighed in on the dakota dispute even though he personally had visited  the standing rock in june   just a day after cladoosby issued his plea to administration officials  obama attended a young leaders conference in laos where a malaysian woman asked him about the dakota access pipeline and how he could ensure a clean water supply and protect ancestral land  obama said he needed to ask his staff for more information  but touted his track record protecting native americans   ancestral lands  sacred sites  waters and hunting grounds   adding   this is something that i hope will continue as we go forward   in late   pipeline operator energy transfer partners made a fateful decision  dallas based etp chose to route its proposed dakota access pipeline away from north dakota s capital  bismarck  and southward within half a mile of the standing rock sioux tribe s reservation  part of its rationale  laid out in a report for the u s  army corps of engineers  which regulates infrastructure projects that traverse certain inland waterways  was that the route would avoid bismarck and thus pose no threat to the city s water supply  the bismarck route also is more populated and thus would require more easements from multiple landowners  ironically  that  page report concluded the standing rock route would raise  no environmental justice issues  because the pipeline would not cross tribal lands  the army corps  decision angered environmental activists and unwittingly introduced a powerful new element into the environmental movement  indian rights groups  who quickly tapped into an extensive network of green activists forged during five long years of protests against transcanada s keystone xl pipeline  which obama formally nixed last november  the protest gained steam in february when standing rock sioux leaders asked for legal help from earthjustice  an environmental law group that had previously helped u s  tribes and canadian first nations fight kinder morgan s trans mountain pipeline  according to jan hasselman  an attorney from earthjustice working on the north dakota case  and tribal leaders  two months later  about  tribe members started praying daily near the pipeline s planned route in north dakota  the participants would grow in size  creating a group called the sacred stone camp  the international environmental movement soon took notice  including   org  an environmentalist group that helped defeat the keystone xl pipeline  in july  the group sent a delegation to the sacred stone camp to see how they could help  in many ways  the dakota access pipeline drew its inspiration from the fight to stop the keystone xl pipeline  according to organizers from  and other environmental groups   we didn t have to totally reinvent the wheel   said josh nelson of credo  a progressive advocacy group  by then the sacred stone camp  located alongside the confluence of the cannon ball and missouri rivers about an hour south of bismarck  had swollen in size to thousands  forming a de facto town of  tents  teepees and trailers  a school  medic  communal kitchen  horse corrals and a legal clinic  the tribal members and environmentalists agreed to seize on the u s  army corps   fast tracking  of permits for the pipeline in late july  which they argued was illegal and a violation of tribal rights   org told reuters  in this case  the corps had the right to approve pipelines in general and consider specific local concerns  such as native issues  if appropriate  the corps said it effectively considered its due diligence requirement met when it green lit the line in july   later that same month  the tribe filed suit against the army corps in federal court  while the government s reversal in september caught most by surprise  a march  letter from the department of the interior to the army corps reviewed by reuters shows that disagreements within the administration had been percolating for months  the interior department  which is responsible for protecting native americans  welfare  said the army corps  did not adequately justify or otherwise support its conclusion that there would be no significant impacts upon the surrounding environment and community  from the pipeline  energy transfer  the department of justice  the army corps and the department of the interior did not respond to requests for comment  the letter presaged the intra government fighting ahead of the white house s decision to temporarily block the line  the federal delay of the pipeline  isn t something that just fell out of the sky   archambault  the tribe s chairman  said in an interview   we feed  federal regulators  information all the time on everything that s illegal here   archambault declined to discuss responses from federal regulators he received  on september   just three days after cladoosby made his plea at the white house  u s  district judge james boasberg rejected a request from the tribe to block the    billion project  minutes after that ruling  the interior and justice departments  along with the army corps  suspended construction on a two mile stretch of federal land below the missouri river  white house spokesman josh earnest said federal regulators  who could still ultimately approve the project  called the pause to make sure the concerns of all parties were taken into account  james gette  a senior official in the environment and natural resources division of the doj  noted in a september  hearing that construction was halted mainly because the dakota access pipeline didn t have an easement for the area where the tribe gets its drinking water  protesters have vowed not to leave their camp until the pipeline is scrapped or moved far away from their reservation  their concerns about potential spills  it turns out  have precedent  an analysis of government data by reuters shows that sunoco logistics  the future operator of the pipeline and a unit of etp  has had the highest rate of spills since  than any of its competitors  sunoco told reuters it has taken measures to reduce its spill rate  cladoosby admits he  was really surprised  by the fast moving events after his strategically timed entreaty  he will be back at the white house on monday and tuesday  leaders of  native american tribes will meet with obama in washington to tackle a range of issues facing native americans from economic development to environmental protection   including the dakota access pipeline   this version of the story corrects the first name of white house domestic policy council director to cecilia  not celia in paragraph
