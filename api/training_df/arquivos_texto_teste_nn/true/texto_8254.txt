vientiane  reuters     note  paragraphs    and  contain language that may offend some readers  new philippines president rodrigo duterte sought to defuse a row with the united states on tuesday  voicing regret for calling president barack obama a  son of a bitch   a comment that prompted washington to call off a bilateral meeting  the tiff between the two allies overshadowed the opening of a summit of east and southeast asian nations in vientiane  laos  it also soured obama s last swing as president through a region he has tried to make a focus of u s  foreign policy  a strategy widely seen as a response to china s economic and military muscle flexing  diplomats say strains with longtime ally the philippines could compound washington s difficulties in forging a united front with southeast asian partners on the geostrategic jostle with beijing over the south china sea  duterte has bristled repeatedly at criticism over his  war on drugs   which has killed about   people since he took office two months ago  and on monday said it would be  rude  for obama to raise the question of human rights when they met  such a conversation  duterte told reporters  would prompt him to curse at obama  using a filipino phrase  putang ina  which can mean  son of a bitch  or  son of a whore   he has previously used the epithet against pope francis  although he later apologized  and the u s  ambassador to the philippines  after washington called off tuesday s bilateral meeting between obama and duterte in response to his latest comment  the philippines issued two statements expressing regret and also briefed reporters   president duterte explained that the press reports that president obama would  lecture  him on extrajudicial killings led to his strong comments  which in turn elicited concern   the philippines government said in a statement   he regrets that his remarks to the press have caused much controversy   it added   he expressed his deep regard and affinity for president obama and for the enduring partnership between our nations   obama s deputy national security adviser  ben rhodes  said the focus on duterte s comments leading into the summit had not created a constructive environment for a bilateral meeting   all of the attention frankly was on those comments  and therefore not on the very substantive agenda that we have with the philippines   he told reporters  officials from both countries said there would be no formal meeting rescheduled in laos but a short conversation between the two presidents was possible   instead of the duterte meeting  obama held talks with south korean president park geun hye  a day after north korea fired three medium range missiles into the sea  he urged a full implementation of sanctions against north korea  adding that the missile test demonstrated the threat that pyongyang posed  obama is also likely to hold an unscheduled meeting in laos with japanese prime minister shinzo abe to discuss north korea  rhodes said  he said washington needed to maintain a sense of urgency within the international community on sanctions against pyongyang   obama  the first sitting u s  president to visit laos  said on tuesday he wanted to address the legacy of u s  bombing during the vietnam war  he announced that washington would provide an additional   million over three years to help clear unexploded ordnance  which has killed or wounded over   people   but the unusually open tensions between the united states and the philippines  its former colony  threaten to overshadow the association of southeast asian nations  asean  and east asia summits in laos  which run until thursday  the  member asean will also meet leaders of other regional powers  china  japan  south korea  australia  india  russia and the united states  duterte won the presidency in may after promising to suppress crime and wipe out the illegal drug trade in a country where the number of methamphetamine users is estimated to be at least   million in a population of  million   about  people linked to drugs have been killed in police operations since july  and a further   have been classified as  deaths under investigation   a term human rights activists in the philippines say is a euphemism for extrajudicial killings  duterte has poured scorn on critics of his uncompromising campaign  usually larding it with curses   he lambasted the united nations after it criticized the surge in killings and he turned down a meeting with u n  secretary general ban ki moon at the laos summit  he has accused a senator heading an inquiry into the killings of getting payoffs from drug lords  manila has been aligned with the united states in its dispute with china over the south china sea  in which washington blames beijing for militarizing a vital global trade route and jeopardizing freedom of movement at sea and in the air  china rejects those accusations and accuses the united states of ratcheting up tensions unnecessarily  china claims most of the south china sea  through which more than   trillion of trade moves annually  brunei  malaysia  the philippines  taiwan and vietnam have rival claims  an arbitration court in the hague in july invalidated china s territorial claims after a case was brought by the philippines  a ruling beijing refuses to recognize  duterte said last month he expected all asean members to support the arbitration court s ruling  but that the philippines would not raise the issue in laos
