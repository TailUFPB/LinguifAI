washington  reuters    one in four registered voters in the united states live in areas that will use electronic voting machines that do not produce a paper backup in the november presidential election despite concerns that they are vulnerable to tampering and malfunctions  according to a reuters analysis  the lack of a paper trail makes it impossible to independently verify that the aging touch screen systems are accurate  security experts say  in a year when suspected russian hackers have penetrated political groups and state voting systems and republican presidential candidate donald trump has said the election may be  rigged    election officials insist the machines are reliable  but security experts say they are riddled with bugs and security holes that can result in votes being recorded incorrectly   a reuters analysis of data from the u s  census bureau  the election assistance commission and the verified voting foundation watchdog group found that  million registered voters  accounting for  percent of the total  live in jurisdictions that rely on paperless systems  including millions in contested states such as georgia  pennsylvania and virginia   the picture has improved gradually since the  presidential election  when  percent of u s  voters lived in areas that used paperless touch screen systems  in    percent lived in jurisdictions that used paperless systems    clearly we still have a long way to go to ensure that all americans have access to a form of voting technology they can trust   said alex halderman  a university of michigan computer science professor who has helped to uncover security flaws on touch screen systems   graphic showing different types of voting systems across the u s     tmsnrt rs   most of these machines are nearing the end of their expected life span  making them more vulnerable to problems  and congress has not authorized money for upgrades since   just after the disputed  presidential recount battle in florida highlighted flaws in aging punch card and lever voting systems      in some states  a divide has emerged between poorer areas that continue to use paperless touch screen systems and wealthier areas that have bought new optical scan systems that process paper ballots  which many experts say are a better way to ensure accurate elections  in virginia  for example  counties that still use touch screen systems have a poverty rate of  percent  while those that have switched to optical scan systems have an average poverty rate of  percent   i would have liked to have had the new machines  but the county says we don t have the money   said patsy burchett  the top election official in rural lee county  which has been hit hard by the decline of the coal and tobacco industries and is the poorest county in the state   these machines are on their last legs   she said   u s  election officials have known about the shortcomings of touch screen systems since shortly after they were widely adopted in the early   when researchers showed that vote results could be manipulated with tools as simple as a magnet and a palm pilot style handheld device  the systems have produced questionable results in some elections  in florida  more than   ivotronic machines did not record a vote in a  congressional race in which the margin of victory was less than  votes  in fairfax county  virginia  electronic machines subtracted one vote for every hundred cast for one candidate in a  school board race  more than   electronic ballots in carteret county  north carolina  were lost and never recovered in the  presidential election  since   states such as maryland have traded in their touch screen machines for optical scan systems  others like california and ohio have added printers to their touch screen machines which produce a backup paper trail  while washington and colorado moved to mail in ballots  absentee balloting is also cutting into the use of paperless systems  in   for example  roughly  in  voters who lived in areas that used paperless systems cast absentee ballots   election officials say the touch screen machines that remain in use are more secure now than they were a decade ago whether they are fitted with printers or not  thanks to extensive testing and better poll worker training  they say that a hacking incident is unlikely because the machines are not connected to the internet    voters should have confidence in whatever systems are being used in their jurisdiction because election officials have taken the necessary steps to secure these systems and ensure the integrity of the process   said matthew masterson  a commissioner with the u s  election assistance commission  although there has so far been no confirmed major incident of u s  voting machines being hacked  security experts say that those aiming to manipulate votes could spread a virus through memory cards  with no internet connection needed  the best way to stop that is to switch to paper based systems  they say  with  percent of all u s  registered voters living in areas that use systems that are no longer in production  according to the reuters analysis  election officials must rely on a dwindling supply of spare parts  virginia beach  virginia  for example  pulled  of its  accuvote tsx touch screen machines in a  election after residents complained that the machines were registering votes for candidates they didn t support  the city has since purchased a new optical scan system  lacking fresh federal funds  some states have opted to upgrade on their own  louisiana aims to switch to an ipad based system by   while los angeles and austin  texas  are designing systems from scratch  others see no reason to switch  in georgia  secretary of state brian kemp said he hasn t asked the state legislature for money to replace its fleet of paperless accuvote ts touch screen machines   it s working just fine and all these so called experts that are making these accusations about our system haven t seen it   he said
