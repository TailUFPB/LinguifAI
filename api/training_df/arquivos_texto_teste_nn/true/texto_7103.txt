tokyo sydney  reuters    an ambitious asia pacific trade pact linking the united states and  countries lay in tatters on tuesday after u s  president elect donald trump said he would kill the deal on his first day in office on jan    trump s statement appeared to open the way for china to assume the united states  leadership mantle on trade and diplomacy in asia  the republican termed the trans pacific partnership  tpp   a potential disaster for our country   china  japan and south korea are already in the initial stages of discussing a trilateral trade deal  and beijing has been pushing its own limited asian regional trade pact that excludes washington for the past five years  japan and australia  washington s closest allies in asia  pledged after trump s announcement to push ahead without the united states  although removing the largest market for goods and services would shrink it dramatically   pushing them forward is the idea that  if they don t act  it will look like china s very weak trade deals are the only game in town   said derek scissors  a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute  where he focuses on asian economies and trade  trump has pledged to redraw trade deals to win back american jobs  and has threatened mexico and china with punitive tariffs in a move that some economists have warned could spark a trade war that threatens to roll back decades of liberalization  ending the tpp was a key election pledge of trump s and was also the policy of his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  the deal died in congress after trump s nov   election victory  the trans pacific partnership  a signature diplomatic initiative of democratic president barack obama  was intended to lower tariff barriers in countries that accounted for  percent of the world economy  as well as providing a bulwark against china  a major trade deal between the united states and europe is also now close to collapse after britain s plans to withdraw from the european union prompted washington to demand better terms and opposition in france and germany has also all but scuppered it  japanese prime minister shinzo abe said  the tpp would be meaningless without the united states   even as parliament continued debating ratification and his government vowed to lobby other members to approve it    it  the pact  just continues in a state of not being in effect   said shinpei sasaki of the cabinet office s tpp headquarters  australian trade minister steven ciobo told reporters in canberra that countries could push ahead with the tpp without the united states by amending the agreement and possibly adding new members    we could look at  for example  if china or indonesia or another country wanted to join  saying   yes  we open the door for them signing up to the agreement as well    but singapore prime minister lee hsien loong said reopening negotiations would not be easy   if you sign a fresh agreement  you have to go through it again  we haven t crossed that bridge yet  we ll cross it if and when we come to that   china has pushed its own regional comprehensive economic partnership  rcep   which notably excludes the united states  it is a more traditional trade agreement  involving cutting tariffs rather than opening up economies and setting labor and environmental standards as tpp would  the rcep was a focus of attention at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in peru over the weekend  tan jian  a senior member of china s delegation at the summit  said more countries are now seeking to join its  member bloc  including peru and chile  and current members want to reach a deal as soon as possible to counter rising protectionism  china s foreign ministry said on tuesday that beijing has an  open attitude  toward any arrangements that promote free trade in the region as long they don t become  fragmented and  politicized   foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the rcep was an initiative led by the  member association of southeast asian nations  asean   which china has been promoting   we are willing to keep pushing the  rcep  talks process with all sides to achieve positive progress at an early date   he said   vietnam last week shelved its own ratification of tpp  after obama abandoned efforts to push it through a lame duck congress  while malaysia has shifted its attention to the rcep  at a u s  china agricultural trade seminar in washington  senior obama administration officials and their chinese counterparts appeared to ignore the elephant in the room  the collapse of tpp and trump s tough trade talk against china  u s  agriculture secretary tom vilsack said he was focused in a u s  china trade negotiators meeting in washington this week on reducing china s regulatory and food safety barriers to american beef  poultry and genetically modified crops out of china   there hasn t been a discussion about the future  there s really a focus on the present   vilsack said when asked about what he was telling his chinese counterparts about the risks posed by an incoming trump administration  chinese vice premier wang yang did not address trump s trade rhetoric at the discussion in washington  but warned that a closing of agricultural trade would be  unacceptable to our farmers    china is one of the most important markets for agricultural exports  accounting for nearly a fifth of u s  agricultural exports      on average  every u s  farmer exports about    of agricultural products to china  every year  wang said
