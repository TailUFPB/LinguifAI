washington  reuters    at the u s  state department  the dissent began building soon after president donald trump signed an executive order late on friday to limit immigration from seven muslim majority countries  opposition mounted through the weekend as a draft memo criticizing trump s policy was written up in washington and circulated by email to u s  diplomatic posts around the world  according to multiple officials involved in the effort  by monday  two of the officials said they considered withdrawing their names from the document  fearing a backlash  on tuesday  just  days into trump s presidency  the memo with some  signatures was delivered to the state department policy planning office and from there to other top officials  said one source familiar with the document   sources said this was an unprecedented number of names on a memo sent through the department s formal  dissent channel   the memo is just one example of the alarm and  in some cases  resistance spreading within the federal bureaucracy as trump s administration makes sharp policy turns while ignoring some of the agencies charged with implementation  according to interviews with more than  current and former u s  officials who spoke on condition of anonymity and in some cases asked that their departments not be identified  still fearful of recriminations  one official said some diplomats discussed whether they could qualify for professional liability insurance  which would cover legal costs in the case of disciplinary action  through the american foreign service association union  the white house did not respond to an email requesting comment   earlier  when the existence of the memo surfaced  white house spokesman sean spicer warned that anyone at the state department who questioned trump s immigration policies  should either get with the program  or they can go   elsewhere in the federal bureaucracy  officials have hastily saved scientific research and public information on climate change and other issues  fearing the new administration would strip it from their websites   officials have also set up alternative twitter accounts to criticize the administration  reuters could not verify the owners of the roughly   rogue  accounts   other officials have begun debating whether to quit most of those whom reuters interviewed said that  while the administration s policies concerned them  they are more worried that trump might try to ignore legal and legislative restraints on presidential power  trump upset many by signing his controversial executive order on immigration without consulting key agencies and members of congress   when they try to ram through things that have foreign policy and national security implications  it demands consultation   said a career official who worked in a part of the government charged with implementing the immigration order   but there was no meaningful consultation  despite what they said   a career civil servant at the federal communications commission said he was considering quitting  citing a fear widespread at the agency  of being cut out of the decision making processes   senator bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and a republican like trump  said he learned about the immigration order only after the president had signed it  corker said he talked with white house representatives on sunday and believed they had gotten the message on the need for inter agency coordination    i would find it hard to believe that they on tuesday don t understand that what they did on friday could have been done in a much better way   he said   most new presidents  particularly republicans  who favor limited government  have tussles with the federal bureaucracy  president ronald reagan fired   air traffic controllers  all federal employees  in   early in his tenure  after they ignored his order to return to work  but philip wallach  a senior fellow at the brookings institution think tank  said trump s apparent hostility to those who must implement his policies was in a different league    there certainly is something about trump s chip on the shoulder attitude that makes it seem like he s itching for a potential long term fight with the bureaucracy  rather than something he works to develop a smooth relationship with   he said   to succeed with his economic reform agenda  trump will need federal agencies  wallach said   that s going to require a lot of affirmative government work  not just smashing things up   several government managers said they have advised their employees not to react so early in trump s presidency   some of the things trump is doing are foolish and make no sense from a management perspective   said a career state department official who supervises scores of civil servants   but i ve told my folks to be professional and stay calm   don t panic   the official said   what else can i tell them  someone needs to be an adult  otherwise  we d have chaos    in a farewell speech to about  state department officials on tuesday  thomas countryman  the acting undersecretary of state for arms control and international security  called on colleagues to stay despite their concerns   we still have a duty   you have a duty   to stay and give your best professional guidance  with loyalty  to the new administration   he said   because a foreign policy without professionals is   by definition   an amateur foreign policy  you will help to frame and make the choices
