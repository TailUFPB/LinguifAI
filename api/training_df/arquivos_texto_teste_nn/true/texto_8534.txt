washington  reuters    president barack obama confirmed on thursday that donald trump will get national security briefings ahead of the november election  but he warned the republican candidate  whom he has called  unfit  for office  that information from the meetings must be kept secret  obama  a democrat who endorsed his former secretary of state hillary clinton in the  white house race  has made clear his dismay over trump  a new york businessman who has proposed temporarily banning muslims from entering the united states and building a wall on the u s  border with mexico  on tuesday obama questioned why leading republicans have not withdrawn their support for their presidential nominee  on thursday he dismissed as ridiculous trump s claims that the election may be rigged   of course the elections will not be rigged  what does that mean   obama said with exasperation   if mr  trump is up  or  points on election day and ends up losing  then maybe he can raise some questions  that doesn t seem to be the case at the moment   trump is trailing clinton in polls  despite his disdain  obama said trump would get the top secret briefings on world crises and security threats to which he  clinton and their respective vice presidential running mates are entitled  some republicans have said clinton should be denied access to such briefings because of her handling of classified material on a private email server while she was secretary of state   obama on thursday  speaking to reporters at the pentagon  made clear that both candidates would be treated equally   we are going to go by the law  which is that  in both tradition and the law  that if somebody is the nominee     they need to get a security briefing so that if they were to win  they are not starting from scratch in terms of being prepared   obama said   what i will say is that they have been told these are classified briefings   he added  in response to a question about whether he was concerned about trump obtaining the classified information   and if they want to be president  they got to start acting like president  and that means being able to receive these briefings and not spread them around   trump has placed blame on clinton and obama for the rise of islamic state  also known as isis   the obama clinton foreign policy gave rise to isis  made iran flush with cash  and is now admitting vast numbers of refugees and migrants into the united states from some of the most volatile regions in the world   trump senior policy adviser stephen miller said in a statement   but none of this is surprising from an administration that allowed its secretary of state to threaten the country with a private email server  delete her records  and lie about it to us all   miller said  obama  who was meeting with his national security advisers about the fight against islamic state  also made a subtle jab at trump for his dispute with a muslim couple whose u s  army captain son died in iraq  obama lauded  patriotic muslim americans  who fight in the u s  armed forces
