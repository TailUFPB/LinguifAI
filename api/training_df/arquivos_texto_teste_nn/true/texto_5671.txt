new york  reuters    with a swipe of his pen  u s  president donald trump on friday started killing off a retirement advice rule that wealth managers from wall street to wisconsin have spent the last six years lobbying against  a landmark policy from the obama era  the so called fiduciary rule requires brokers and financial advisers to act in the best interest of retirement savers  this restricts their ability to earn commissions and to sell some higher fee products  wall street has argued it would harm consumers because it would raise compliance costs and therefore fees  and force them to get rid of main street clients and small businesses that offer  k  plans  trump s executive order asks the labor department to review whether the rule needs to be changed or dumped  both supporters and opponents are girding to argue their case  but the industry has the edge  with trump officials stating they were planning on rolling back regulation generally and criticizing the fiduciary rule in particular  the chamber of commerce  one of a number of trade groups which have filed lawsuits to kill the rule  cheered trump s order   we look forward to swift action from the department of labor in putting this delay into effect and reevaluating matters of policy and law   the chamber said in a statement  shares of banks with large wealth management divisions jumped on friday with bank of america  bac n  up   percent  morgan stanley  ms n    percent stronger and wells fargo  wfc n  over  percent higher  insurers  whose sales of annuity products were at risk from the rule  also rose  with shares of prudential  pru n  up   percent and metlife  met n   percent stronger   everyone will be pleased that dol s rush to get it done before the administration change is set back   said judi carsrud  director of government relations for the national association of insurance financial advisors  naifa   which has been fighting the rule for years  naifa plans to pursue a  very straightforward  fix such as a  legislative approach  that directs retirement account advisers to act in clients  best interest   a standard that carsrud believes the group s members already meet  the obama administration had said conflicted advice costs american families   billion a year but the industry has said that figure was inflated  no one disputes the high cost that firms would have to pay to comply with the new rule  an amount the labor department estimates at as much as   billion over the next decade  banks have already started changing things with bank of america saying this week it would more clearly disclose the fees it charges clients of its merrill lynch wealth management business  bank of america corp had already started cutting back on  transactional  accounts that charge clients a commission for every trade  rather than a flat fee based on assets  morgan stanley  ms n  has decided to keep such accounts but is making changes that will allow advisers to work within the rule s confines by creating new contracts  re training advisors and updating supervisory software  swiss bank ubs ubsn vx welcomed trump s order and said it supported the creation of a fiduciary rule under the securities and exchange commission  which could apply to all advisers not just retirement advisers  wells fargo said it would continue to work with regulators to ensure higher standards of care for investment clients  other banks either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment  implementing changes was particularly tough for small time financial advisers  along with two colleagues  juli mcneely  who runs mcneely financial services in spencer  wisconsin has spent between  and  hours each week since december preparing for the rule  their work has focused largely on figuring out which clients from their rural community should now pay a flat fee for financial advice  instead of commissions  and creating new templates for paperwork   now we have a little breathing room to make sure we do this right and not quickly to meet a deadline   said mcneely  who voted for trump  in part because of his pro business stance  one person who has yet to comment on the retirement rule review is the person who will be at the center of it   trump s choice to head the labor department  andy puzder  puzder  chief executive of fastfood group cke restaurants  has been a vocal opponent of what he has called  overregulation  during the obama administration  the  k  plans he offers his own employees are less generous than some rivals  suggesting a more industry friendly approach  while the labor secretary cannot unilaterally repeal a rule  his agency can rewrite and change a rule substantially or scrap it  william galvin  the top securities regulator in massachusetts  described trump s order as  reckless    my office will continue to protect small investors when those in washington cave to big business   not all proponents of the rule were as pessimistic   there s no question that in the minds of industry lobbyist  delay is just a step toward repeal   said barbara roper  investor protection director for the consumer federation of america  cfa    if the department of labor follows an honest process and considers the impact on retirement savers  we have a winning argument
