beijing washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump changed tack and agreed to honor the  one china  policy during a phone call with china s leader xi jinping  a major diplomatic boost for beijing which brooks no criticism of its claim to self ruled taiwan  trump angered beijing in december by talking to the president of taiwan and saying the united states did not have to stick to the policy  under which washington acknowledges the chinese position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of it   a white house statement said trump and chinese president xi had a lengthy phone conversation on thursday night  washington time    president trump agreed  at the request of president xi  to honor our  one china  policy   the statement said   a spokesman for taiwan president tsai ing wen said in a statement it was in taiwan s interest to maintain good relations with the united states and china  the u s  and chinese leaders had not spoken by telephone since trump took office on jan    diplomatic sources in beijing say china had been nervous about xi being left humiliated in the event a call with trump went wrong and the details were leaked to the media  last week  u s  ties with staunch ally australia became strained after the washington post published details about an acrimonious phone call between trump and prime minister malcolm turnbull      no issue is more sensitive to beijing than taiwan  china and the united states also signaled that with the  one china  issue resolved  they could have more normal relations   representatives of the united states and china will engage in discussions and negotiations on various issues of mutual interest   the statement said  in a separate statement carried by china s foreign ministry  xi said china appreciated

the statement quoted xi as saying   the development of china and the united states absolutely can complement each other and advance together  both sides absolutely can become very good cooperative partners   xi said  taiwan s top china policymaker  the mainland affairs council  said it hoped for continued support from the united states and called on beijing to adopt a  positive attitude  and  pragmatic communication  in resolving differences with taiwan   china is deeply suspicious of tsai  whose ruling democratic progressive party espouses the island s formal independence  a red line for beijing  and has cut off a formal dialogue mechanism with the island  tsai says she wants peace with china  in beijing  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said the  one china  principle was the political basis of sino u s  ties   ensuring this political basis does not waver is vital for the healthy  stable development of china u s  relations   lu said  lawyer james zimmerman  the former head of the american chamber of commerce in china  said trump should have never raised the  one china  policy in the first place   there is certainly a way of negotiating with the chinese  but threats concerning fundamental  core interests are counterproductive from the get go   he said in an email   the end result is that trump just confirmed to the world that he is a paper tiger  a  zhilaohu    someone that seems threatening but is wholly ineffectual and unable to stomach a challenge   jia qingguo  dean of the school of international studies at peking university and who has advised the government on foreign policy  said trump had created a lot of uncertainty but was now back on track   trump has reassured people that he will be a responsible president   he told reuters      this is good news for china  because stable u s  china relations are good for china  now we can do business   the united states switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   but is also taiwan s biggest ally and arms supplier and is bound by legislation to provide the means to help the island defend itself  defeated nationalist forces fled from china to taiwan in  after losing a civil war

infrastructure  as well as strengthening coordination on international matters to jointly protect global peace and stability  xi said in the statement  the white house described the call  which came hours before trump plays host to japanese prime minister shinzo abe  as  extremely cordial   with both leaders expressing best wishes to their peoples  there was little or no mention in either the chinese or u s   statement of other contentious issues   trade and the disputed south china sea   and neither matter has gone away  a u s  official told reuters on thursday that a u s  navy p  plane
