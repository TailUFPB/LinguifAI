washington  reuters    democratic presidential front runner hillary clinton pivoted to a general election match up against republican candidate donald trump on thursday  saying he is dangerously unpredictable and not qualified to be president  confident that she is finally close to defeating u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont for the democratic nomination  clinton turned heavy fire on trump  who has been running about even with her in national polls of voters looking ahead to the nov   presidential election  on the republican side  trump promoted top aide paul manafort to serve as campaign manager and chief strategist  the trump campaign said  corey lewandowski  the trump aide who has been campaign manager  retains that title and will continue to oversee day to day operations  the campaign said  in addition  trump has hired veteran republican lawyer a b  culvahouse to help vet potential vice presidential running mates  a source close to the campaign said  in a cnn interview  clinton used the example of the apparent downing of an egyptair plane from paris to cairo to say that trump would lack the skills to bring together u s  allies to respond to global threats   i know how hard this job is and i know we need steadiness  as well as strength and smarts in it  and i have concluded that he is not qualified to be president of the united states   clinton said  trump  the republicans  presumptive presidential nominee  has been intensifying his criticism of clinton by lobbing personal attacks at her and her husband  former president bill clinton   clinton  a former u s  secretary of state  said she would resolutely refuse to respond to trump s goading   he can say whatever he wants   she said  but she said the egyptair crash reinforces the need for american leadership and that trump s proposed temporary ban on muslims entering the united states has sent the wrong signal to countries that washington will need to work with in the fight against islamic militants   he says a lot of things that are provocative  that actually make the important task of building this coalition  bringing everybody to the table and defeating terrorism more difficult   she said   it sends a message of disrespect and it sends a message that makes the situation inside those countries more difficult   clinton suggested the democratic race was over because of her nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the nominating convention  despite sanders  insistence on staying in the race   i will be the nominee for my party   she said   that is already done  in effect  there is no way that i won t be   she said sanders will have to eventually help her unify the democratic party after the prolonged nomination fight   i am absolutely committed to doing my part  more than my part  but senator sanders has to do his part   she said  the sanders campaign rebuffed clinton s nudge to get out of the race  pointing to his recent victories   in the past three weeks voters in indiana  west virginia and oregon respectfully disagreed with secretary clinton  we expect voters in the remaining eight contests also will disagree   sanders spokesman michael briggs said  trump stepped up efforts to rally republican loyalists behind his campaign after winning a divisive primary fight that left the party ruptured  on capitol hill  manafort and other trump aides met with conservatives in the house of representatives who are members of the freedom caucus group and canvassed them for policy ideas   manafort was reaching out for ideas  on policy  and several freedom caucus members made suggestions  said republican representative scott desjarlais of tennessee   it went very well  it was encouraging  i think the trump team recognizes the relevance of the freedom caucus  and the influence they have  i think actually  despite some early skepticism by some members  i think the  freedom caucus  board received manafort and his representation of trump very well   desjarlais said  manafort also met with u s  senator mike lee of utah  a tea party republican who was a big backer of u s  senator ted cruz of texas for president  lee has expressed some concerns about trump s candidacy   a spokesman for lee said u s  senator jeff sessions of alabama  a key trump adviser  was also at the meeting
