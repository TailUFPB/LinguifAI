youngstown  ohio  reuters    republican donald trump said on monday he would work closely with nato allies to defeat islamic state militants if he wins the white house  reversing an earlier threat that the united states might not meet its obligations to the western military alliance  in a policy speech  trump said he would wage a multi front  military  cyber and financial  war against islamic state  although it was not clear how that would differ from the obama administration s fight with the jihadist group    we will also work closely with nato on this new mission   said trump  whose remarks about the defense organization earlier this summer drew heavy criticism from allies and even some of his fellow republicans  trump said a newly adopted approach to fighting terrorism by the organization had led him to change his mind and he no longer considered nato obsolete  he was apparently referring to reports the alliance is moving toward creating an intelligence post in a bid to improve information sharing     while trump appeared to claim credit for prodding nato to focus more on the threat of terrorism  the  nation alliance has been grappling with the issue for more than a decade  nato invoked article   its collective self defense mechanism  for the first time in its history to offer support to the united states after the sept      attacks  trump called for shutting down access to the internet and social media for those aligned with islamic state  which holds territory in syria and iraq  but he said he did not want to detail military strategy because it would tip off potential foes   we will defeat radical islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat we ve faced at every age and before   trump said  blaming his democratic rival  hillary clinton  the former secretary of state  and president barack obama for aiding the rise of islamic state  in a speech in the swing state of ohio  trump also said that in implementing his call for a temporary ban on muslims immigrating to the country  he would institute  extreme vetting  and develop a new screening test to try to catch people who intend to do harm to the united states  as president  he said  he would ask the u s  state department and department of homeland security to identify regions of the world that remain hostile to the united states and where normal screening might not be sufficient to catch those who pose a threat  the clinton campaign said trump s plan to have immigrants submit to ideological tests was  a cynical ploy to escape scrutiny of his outrageous proposal to ban an entire religion from our country and no one should fall for it   reading from a teleprompter  trump said clinton did not have the judgment and character to lead the country   importantly  she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and all of the many adversaries we face   he said   trump  a wealthy new york businessman whose volatile campaign has alienated some in the republican establishment  faced a fresh rebuke on monday as he falls behind clinton in opinion polls ahead of the nov   election  the wall street journal  a leading conservative voice  said in an editorial he should fix his campaign within weeks or step down  echoing growing alarm about trump s candidacy among many leading republicans  the newspaper said trump had failed to establish a competent campaign operation   if they can t get mr  trump to change his act by labor day  the gop will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the senate and house and other down ballot races   the newspaper said  labor day  which falls on sept   this year  marks the end of u s  summer vacations and traditionally launches the final phase of the long u s  election season    as for mr  trump  he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be president   or turn the nomination over to mike pence   it said  referring to the indiana governor  who is trump s vice presidential running mate  adding to trump s woes this week was the news  first reported by the new york times  that the name of his campaign manager  paul manafort  was on secret ledgers showing cash payments designated to him of more than   million from a ukrainian political party with close ties to russia   manafort denied any impropriety in a statement on monday     i have never received a single  off the books cash payment  as falsely  reported  by the new york times  nor have i ever done work for the governments of ukraine or russia   he said   artem sytnik  the head of ukraine s anti corruption bureau  confirmed in a briefing with reporters that manafort s name appeared on a ledger and that more than   million had been allocated as an expenditure  referencing manafort  but sytnik said the presence of manafort s name  does not mean that he definitely received this money   the clinton campaign said the news was evidence of  more troubling connections between donald trump s team and pro kremlin elements in ukraine   trump has spoken favorably in the past of russian president vladimir putin  last month  he invited russian hackers to find  missing  emails from clinton s time as secretary of state  when she used a private email server to conduct government business  although he later described that comment as sarcasm     the current realclearpolitics average of national opinion polls puts clinton   points ahead of trump  at   percent to trump s  percent  polls also show trump trailing in states such as pennsylvania that are likely to be pivotal in the election
