 reuters    as the white house race took off last summer  food giant mondelez international found itself in an unusual position  republican candidate donald trump began delivering broadsides against one of its iconic products  oreo cookies   nabisco is closing a factory in chicago  and they re moving to mexico  no more oreos  i don t like oreos anymore   trump told a crowd in new hampshire on aug    reacting to reports that mondelez was shutting down some production lines at its nabisco subsidiary in chicago while boosting output in mexico  trump s statement that mondelez was closing a chicago factory was erroneous  as the company quickly pointed out  but that didn t stop him from repeating it  it s unusual for a top presidential candidate  especially a representative of the business friendly republican party  to attack major u s  corporations by name   but over the course of his unconventional campaign  trump has aimed his fire at a range of companies  mostly for shifting jobs abroad  ford motor co  united technologies corp unit carrier corp  but also for building products in foreign markets  apple  and for what he said were violations of antitrust laws  amazon    trump has threatened the companies with boycotts  tariffs  taxes and other punishments  the trump campaign declined to comment for this story   some of the companies saw their share prices dip in the wake of trump s criticism while others experienced a small boost  but all of them were presented with a dilemma that s familiar to the presumptive nominee s many vanquished republican rivals  should they engage with a possible future president known for holding a grudge  possibly inviting more wrath  or should they lie low and risk allowing trump to define them and to push policies they deem harmful  most have sought to stay out of the fray even as trump has kept up the drumbeat of criticism   i am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the united states many companies   like ford  general motors  nabisco  carrier   are moving production to mexico   trump said this week  this was  bad for all americans   he said     it was the first time trump included gm in his roster of corporate wrongdoers  though the trump campaign later removed gm from the statement and declined to say why  gm declined comment       mondelez  previously known as kraft foods  took a different tack  after trump vowed to boycott oreos  mondelez fielded numerous media inquiries and contacted reporters when the company deemed press coverage of his remarks off base  said laurie guzzinati  who oversees governmental affairs in north america for mondelez  the company didn t engage in any trump bashing  though guzzinati said trump s comments were  grounded in inaccuracies    she said she told reporters that mondelez would continue to make oreos in three locations in the united states  countering the impression trump may have left that oreos would no longer be made in the united states  mondelez s response tracks closely what crisis management experts recommend for trump targeted companies    hilary rosen  a managing director for washington  d c   communications firm skd knickerbocker  said her firm was representing corporate clients who have been singled out by trump  though she declined to name them   rosen s advice to clients  she said  is  don t depend on educating donald trump on the truth  people have tried and failed   rosen  a democrat  recommends instead that companies make their case to the journalists who cover trump  so  donald trump does not define you   none of the companies targeted by trump acknowledged hiring outside consultants to deal with his criticism  many declined to comment for this story    you re not going to win in a one on one confrontation with donald trump  you re just going to get mired in the mud   said juda engelmayer  senior vice president for crisis management at  public relations in new york   those who have been willing to engage  including ford chairman bill ford  have avoided getting too personal  trump has railed against ford for manufacturing vehicles in mexico  threatening a tariff of up to  percent on  every car  bumper and part  entering the united states from mexico   ford  the great grandson of the automaker s founder henry ford  called trump s critique  distorted  and said the company instead should be  held up as a real success story     we didn t take the  government  bailout   during the   recession  ford told reporters at a conference in detroit on may   contrasting his company with gm and chrysler   we paid back our debts  we pulled ourselves up by our boot straps  we are investing in america    crisis management experts said companies targeted by trump need to be thinking more about the policy implications of his presidency  that means  for example  shoring up support in the u s  congress for the north american free trade agreement  nafta   which trump has said he wants to renegotiate     a trade lobbyist who asked not to be named because he has worked with one of the companies trump has called out said trump s attacks do not particularly hurt companies  reputations in washington  because policymakers understand presidential campaigns are the  political silly season   but  he said  they can impact broader efforts on trade and other policies   i think what this suggests   he said   is that there needs to be a concentrated effort by the business community to talk about the benefits of trade
