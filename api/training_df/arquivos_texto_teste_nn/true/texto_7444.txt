tokyo seoul  reuters    republican donald trump s victory in the u s  presidential election will deepen asian allies  anxiety about washington s  commitment to post war security arrangements in the face of a rising china and volatile north korea  and could bolster calls from conservatives in tokyo for a more robust defense policy  trump s  america first  rhetoric and calls for allies to pay more of the cost for u s  troops in the region or face their possible withdrawal have worried officials in some asian capitals  so has his opposition to a  nation pan pacific trade pact that was a linchpin of washington s  pivot  to the region   we should expect dramatic changes in the security environment   said south korea s ruling saenuri party floor leader chung jin suk in parliament on wednesday  but he added   in any case  there should not be any wavering in the korea u s  military alliance  which has been the foundation of prosperity of this country    a japanese government official  speaking before trump clinched the election  urged the new president to send a reassuring message   the new president elect should as soon as possible issue a statement reassuring the rest of the world that the strong commitment of the united states to its allies     remains strong and reliable   said the official  who declined to be identified   we are certainly concerned about the comments  trump  has made to date about the alliance and the u s  role in the pacific  particularly japan   the japanese official said  although he added trump s policies might not match his rhetoric  trump has made several comments that disturbed washington s asian allies  from insisting they must foot more of the two way defense bill to suggesting it might be alright for tokyo and seoul develop nuclear arms capability  in an article criticizing u s  president barack obama s  pivot  to asia as  talking loudly but carrying a small stick  two trump advisors said he would beef up the u s  navy while asserting it was  only fair  that seoul and tokyo pay more for defense    there is no question of trump s commitment to america s asian alliances as bedrocks of stability in the region   wrote  university of california professor peter navarro and alexander gray  a former advisor to u s  politician randy forbes  in the article  which appeared in the nov   edition of foreign policy  the article also criticized the obama administration for failing to halt china s aggressive maritime activities in the east and south china seas  where beijing has territorial rows with several countries in the region  trump has called for more ships for the u s  navy  the  mere initiation of the trump naval program will reassure our allies that the united states remains committed in the long term to its traditional role as guarantor of the liberal order in asia   the authors said     trump s approach to the north asia security alliances could spark calls in japan for a more independent security stance  although serious talk of acquiring nuclear weapons is unlikely to emerge in the only nation to suffer atomic bombings    i think they will have more legitimacy   said a japanese diplomat  referring to those seeking a more robust security stance   but the japanese public is reluctant to go in that direction and we don t have the capacity in terms of budget or  military  personnel   asian allies who joined the  nation tran pacific partnership  tpp  trade deal  a linchpin of obama s asia pivot  now fear the pact is dead  given trump s harsh opposition  that has implications not only for trade  but security  since washington and tokyo had seen the tpp as way of creating a new regional rule based architecture to counter china   tpp was not just a trade deal  it was the united states and japan  together     these countries with shared values would create an advanced regional order with not just economic  but diplomatic and security implications   said toshihiro nakayama  a professor at keio university in tokyo   it was a symbol of america being committed to the region   singapore based security expert tim huxley warned of a period of potentially destabilizing uncertainty ahead as the region waits for clearer strategic signs of precisely what a trump presidency would mean for asia   unless trump speaks reassuringly and soothingly about the continued u s  presence and commitment to the region  i won t be surprised to see long held doubts awoken in the minds of many asian leaders about the durability of the traditional u s  role   he said   policy makers expect it will take considerable time for trump to work out personnel appointments and get down to policy formation  divisive u s  politics could also slow things down  that could mean a worrisome vacuum  but also suggests no quick  dramatic changes are in store   it will take about half a year for mr  trump to firm up his foreign policies  he only has a transition team of about  people and his first focus will be domestic policy   said masashi adachi  head of the japanese ruling liberal democratic party s foreign policy panel   i don t think there will be a big change in his stance toward japan  he has said the japan u s  alliance is important  what he is talking about is details like increasing what japan pays for u s  troops in japan   adachi added
