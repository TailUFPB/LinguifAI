washington  reuters    when japanese first lady akie abe made her rounds in washington on friday  noticeably absent was the high level chaperone of previous visits   america s first lady  rather than melania trump  it was the wife of the japanese ambassador to the united states who accompanied akie abe on a visit to a local university  a japanese embassy official said  that was a departure from akie abe s previous visits to washington  in   she was treated to a tour with laura bush to george washington s home  mount vernon  and in   she and michelle obama stopped by a northern virginia elementary school with a japanese immersion program  the break with convention  three weeks into husband donald trump s presidency  is another sign that melania trump may have different designs on the first lady s role than her predecessors     melania trump has elected to stay in new york for now while her son finishes his school year  it is not yet clear if she will take a prominent role in white house social events  including accompanying fellow first ladies on their visits to the capital   japanese prime minister shinzo abe and his wife are scheduled to spend the weekend at the trumps  florida mar a lago retreat  where the two leaders will golf and the task of hosting mrs  abe will fall to melania  while their husbands strive to appear in lock step on u s  japan relations this weekend  melania trump may find in her japanese counterpart someone who is in many ways her opposite   a political spouse who does not shun the limelight and disagrees publicly with her powerful husband  melania trump  a former model from slovenia  rarely airs differences of opinion with her husband  akie abe  in contrast  has used news interviews to make policy recommendations for his administration  leading some to dub her the  household opposition    she told reuters in  that japan should consider cutting spending and boosting the economy before further raising the sales tax  to  percent  she said she had urged her husband not to go forward with the first stage of the rise  to  percent  to no avail   critiquing japan s male dominated professional culture  akie abe told bloomberg last year that japanese women are held back by pressure from men to be  cute  rather than  capable and hardworking   her public profile makes her a rarity in japan as well as a stark contrast with melania trump  who largely avoided the campaign trail  has not shown deep interest in public policy  and has rarely disagreed with trump in public despite some damaging revelations  when a videotape of trump emerged during the  presidential campaign in which he boasted about grabbing women by their genitals  melania said in a brief statement that his words were  unacceptable and offensive  but that she had accepted his apology      the differing styles could keep the weekend conversations on the light side   i would certainly expect no discussion of global politics  between melania and akie  said jean harris  a university of scranton professor who has studied the role of first ladies   i don t see melania as wanting to be part of those conversations   akie abe s openness in stating points of disagreement with her husband has few parallels even in american politics  where first ladies tend not to diverge from their husbands in public  though they may be crucial advisors behind the scenes  harris said  just after the election  melania trump said in a cbs interview that she chides her husband  all the time  for his twitter attacks   sometimes he listens  sometimes he doesn t   she said   i give him my opinion  and he could do whatever he likes with it
