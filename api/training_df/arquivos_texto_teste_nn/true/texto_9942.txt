washington  reuters    u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on thursday he backs continuing the    billion in annual military aid that washington sends to egypt  but that its human rights record makes it  more difficult  to support the cairo government   we give    billion a year to egypt  i don t think we should take that away   ryan said during a meeting with foreign policy reporters at his u s  capitol office after a visit to israel  egypt  saudi arabia and other countries in the region  he said he had raised the rights issue with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi  the aid package for cairo has been in focus in washington because of growing unease among both ryan s fellow republicans and democrats that sisi s government is exploiting security concerns to crack down on dissent  ryan said he told sisi   you make it more difficult for us to be supportive of you when you have so many human rights violations   adding that every u s  official who visited cairo should make that case  however  he stressed that it is essential that washington not allow egypt to become a failed state  ryan also told reporters it was  too soon  to weigh in on an emergency funding  marshall plan  that some lawmakers have proposed to boost countries in the region socially and economically rather than only focus on military aspects in the fight to counter islamic state and other militant groups   i think it s too soon to jump to that conclusion   ryan said  when asked whether he would support some sort of emergency appropriations program like the  marshall plan  suggested by  fellow republican senator lindsey graham
