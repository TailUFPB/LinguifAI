new york  reuters    as century old wall street brokerages have agonized over the fate of a major u s  regulation on retirement advice  younger silicon valley counterparts have coolly shrugged their shoulders      at issue is when and how the federal government will implement the so called  fiduciary rule  handed down by the u s  labor department last year  the rule  which aims to protect retirees by eliminating conflicts of interest for the brokers paid to advise them  was set to go into effect in april  but is being challenged by the trump administration    the rule is now on track to be delayed by  days   creating a great deal of uncertainty about its future     big wealth managers and insurers most affected by the rule have welcomed signs that the new white house may roll it back  they have fought hard against the rule in court and on capitol hill  arguing that it would raise compliance and technology costs  while restricting brokers  ability to charge commissions and sell certain high fee products   critics have said the additional costs would force brokerages to dump less well heeled clients in favor of wealthier ones  startups offering digital wealth management services have taken the opposite tack  saying the rule would benefit retirees and their own businesses  investors abandoned by big firms might move to digital providers  which offer transparent  lower cost alternatives  the thinking goes      in interviews since trump instructed the labor department to review the rule earlier this month  executives at  robo advisers   which manage investor money with algorithms  brushed off the impact of the rule on their business   although the rule might have sped up a broader shift of investor money to  robo advisers   the trend had been gathering momentum anyway  they said       an expansion of the fiduciary rule would be nice for our business  but in no way affects our ultimate success   said andy rachleff  chief executive officer of wealthfront  one of the largest robo advisers that deals directly with investors      wealthfront competitor betterment has encouraged democrats in recent weeks to fight efforts to delay or gut the rule  nonetheless  betterment s associate general counsel seth rosenbloom said any regulatory changes would have little impact on the company s growth       we are sad that it looks like     the rule might go away  be delayed or watered down   rosenbloom said   but we are optimistic that the attention around the issue will make for better informed investors in the long run   among robo advisers that provide services to brokerages  mike sha  co founder and chief executive of robo adviser sigfig  said he did not expect the rule s delay to impact its business or partnerships at all  wealth units of wells fargo   co and ubs group ag use sigfig s technology and offer its online investing tools to their clients      robo advisers represent a small piece of the wealth management industry  overseeing roughly   billion of client assets in   according to consulting firm a t  kearney  it expects the total to surge to    trillion by       interrupting the fiduciary rule could slow that growth for some companies  last week  for instance  lpl financial holdings  said if the rule was delayed  it might move more slowly in rolling out some compliance plans  which include its robo adviser and other new technology      but the shift to less expensive digital options began before the rule was formalized  driven primarily by customer demand for more digital options  that trend is unlikely to be stopped with or without the rule  analysts said       by all projections  there is unbelievable demand for digital advice and solutions   said kendra thompson  a managing director in the financial services group at the consultancy accenture  the rule is  an accelerator for digital  not an originator   she said
