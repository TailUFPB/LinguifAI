washington  reuters    president elect donald trump said on thursday he will nominate bankruptcy attorney david friedman as u s  ambassador to israel  and friedman said he looked forward to taking up his post in jerusalem  implying a move from tel aviv that would mark a break in longstanding u s  foreign policy and anger the muslim world  while campaigning for the presidency  trump pledged to switch the embassy from tel aviv  where it has been located for  years  to jerusalem  all but enshrining the city as israel s capital regardless of international objections    friedman  has been a long time friend and trusted advisor to me  his strong relationships in israel will form the foundation of his diplomatic mission and be a tremendous asset to our country as we strengthen the ties with our allies and strive for peace in the middle east   trump said in a statement issued by his team on thursday  the republican made clear during his campaign that he would support israel in a number of critical areas  said he would not put pressure on israel to engage in talks with the palestinians  the united states and other powers do not regard jerusalem as israel s capital  other nations embassies are located in tel aviv   and do not recognize israel s annexation of arab east jerusalem following its capture in the  middle east war   one of the thorniest issues in the israeli palestinian dispute is resolving the rival demands for jerusalem s future  palestinians regard the ancient city   which contains sites sacred to the jewish  muslim and christian faiths   as the future capital of a separate state  friedman  who specializes in litigation and bankruptcy law  said in the statement that he would work tirelessly to  strengthen the unbreakable bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region  and look forward to doing this from the u s  embassy in israel s eternal capital  jerusalem   israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  who has had a fractious relationship with democratic president barack obama  has welcomed trump s election  chatting with him by phone and posting a video on facebook promoting ties with the united states  in an interview with israeli left leaning newspaper haaretz  in june  friedman was asked whether trump would support the creation of an independent palestinian state   a bedrock of u s  foreign policy which supports a two state solution   the answer is   not without the approval of the israelis   said friedman   if the israelis don t want to do it  so he doesn t think they should do it      he does not think it is an american imperative for it to be an independent palestinian state   there was no immediate comment from the israel embassy in washington on the news   friedman is also considered far right on issues  including settlement building and has advocated for the annexation of the west bank  which israel captured from jordan in the  war   the obama administration has been highly critical of israeli settlement construction in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem  most countries view all israeli settlements on occupied land that the palestinians seek for their own state as illegal  the palestinians  who want to establish a state in the west bank and gaza strip  with east jerusalem as its capital  say settlements are a fundamental obstacle to peace  the last u s  backed talks on statehood collapsed in   j street  a liberal pro israel group based in washington  said it was  vehemently opposed  to friedman s nomination   this nomination is reckless  putting america s reputation in the region and credibility around the world at risk   the statement said  the zionist organization for america  a conservative jewish american pro israel group welcomed the nomination  saying he had  the potential to be the greatest u s  ambassador to israel ever   aaron david miller  a former middle east adviser to republican and democratic administrations  said friedman s nomination  was designed to send a signal that there will be significant break in tone  style and perhaps substance from the obama administration  in its handling of the israeli palestinian issue   the peace process is just dead right now   miller said  alluding to the obama administration s failed efforts  but he said it was too early to see friedman s nomination as trump s disavowal of a two state solution  miller noted that trump s aides have sent conflicting signals on whether they are serious about acting quickly on his promise to move the embassy  and that it was unclear whether that would happen  presidential candidates have in the past promised to move the u s  embassy to jerusalem and then reneged  deciding ultimately that the city s status should first be resolved by parties to the conflict  in early december  obama renewed the presidential waiver  signed by every u s  president for the past two decades  against moving america s embassy to jerusalem for another six months  it effectively means any action by trump would be delayed until at least june
