washington  reuters    the united states on tuesday sought to downplay its absence from talks on the syrian conflict among russia  iran and turkey in moscow  saying it was not a  snub  and did not reflect a decline of u s  influence in the middle east  however  president barack obama s decision to offer only limited support to moderate rebels has left washington with little leverage to influence the situation in syria  especially after moscow began launching air strikes against rebels fighting president bashar al assad      although washington has long been a player in efforts to end the syria civil war and other mideast conflicts  the united states was forced to watch from the sidelines as the syrian government and its allies  including russia  mounted an assault to pin down the rebels in east aleppo that culminated in a ceasefire deal  dennis ross  a fellow at the washington institute for near east policy who was an adviser on iran and the middle east to both democratic and republican administrations  said the united states had made itself  irrelevant  in syria   the opposition finds little reason to be responsive to us and assad  the russians and iran know that there is nothing we will do to raise the costs to them of their onslaught against aleppo and other syrian cities   ross said   russia  having changed the balance of power on the ground  without regard to civilian consequences  has moved to make itself an arbiter   a spokesman for u s  secretary of state john kerry dismissed suggestions that america s absence from the meeting indicated a change in influence   the secretary doesn t see this as a snub at all  he sees it as another multilateral effort to try to get a lasting peace in syria and he welcomes any progress towards that   state department spokesman john kirby said on tuesday   we would obviously refute any notion that     the fact that we weren t at this one meeting is somehow a harbinger or a litmus test for u s  influence and leadership there or anywhere else around the world   kirby said  adding that washington was still engaged in the region on many other issues   we are not excluded  we are not being sidelined   he added  at the meeting on tuesday  russia  iran and turkey said they were ready to help broker a syrian peace deal and they adopted a declaration that laid out the principles any agreement should follow  still  the meetings on tuesday resulted in a  moscow declaration   reflecting russia s growing links with iran and turkey  despite the murder on monday of russia s ambassador in ankara  turkey s capital  and reflects putin s desire to increase his country s influence in the middle east and more widely  it also shows that russia is fed up with what it considers long and pointless talks with the obama administration over syria  a u s  official acknowledged that the u s  absence from the evacuation talks on eastern aleppo was russia s way of showing that moscow  not washington  was running the show   the fact is that we have put ourselves in a position where russia is making efforts to try to work with anybody else so they can isolate us   the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  told reuters   we let our differences with turkey over the kurds and our views over the northern part of syria create gaps that the russians have exploited   kirby said that in the end  the united states  russia  iran  and turkey would like to see an immediate ceasefire and the  urgent delivery  of humanitarian aid  ultimately  he said  it was too soon to judge whether the talks were a success  russian president vladimir putin said last week that he and his turkish counterpart  tayyip erdogan  were working to organize new syrian peace negotiations without the united states or the united nations   russia says that if they happen  the talks would be in addition to intermittent u n  brokered negotiations in geneva  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on tuesday he thought that what he called the russia iran turkey troika was the most effective forum for trying to solve the syria crisis
