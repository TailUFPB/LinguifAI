washington  reuters    a divided republican party on wednesday fought over gun control legislation that was cobbled together following last month s mass shooting in orlando  raising questions over u s  house speaker paul ryan s ability to get the measure passed  while democrats have said the gun control proposal put forward by republican leaders was too weak  an influential group of approximately  conservative house republicans announced their opposition as well  saying the plan did not do enough to protect gun buyers  the legislation fails  to do enough to address the threat of radical islamic terrorism   according to a statement by the conservative freedom caucus  the group also complained of  the inclusion of gun control provisions that fail to adequately protect due process   with the republican leadership s legislation under attack from both liberals and conservatives  it was unclear whether ryan could muster the  votes he would need for passage in the house of representatives  last month  the senate failed to approve any of several competing republican and democratic gun control proposals offered in the wake of the june  shooting at a gay night club in orlando that killed  and injured  others  during the senate debate  democratic lawmakers staged a sit in on the house floor to pressure republican leaders to pass legislation expanding background checks on gun sales and blocking gun purchases by people on terrorism watch lists  the republican leadership bill  announced last friday  would give the government three days to convince a judge that a gun sale should be blocked  ryan said wednesday that he intended to bring it to the floor for a vote this week or next  but also noted changes were being sought by numerous lawmakers   the last thing we re going to do is rush something to the floor that we don t have right   ryan said  representative matt salmon of arizona  a freedom caucus member  said he objected to ryan pushing the bill without allowing it to be processed by relevant committees first  salmon said that ryan told house republicans in a closed meeting that he was rushing the legislation to the house floor because  there are members that need to have this vote  for political reasons in swing districts that could go either republican or democratic in the nov   elections  democrats  meanwhile  continued to pressure ryan for votes on their more sweeping gun control measures  representative john larson of connecticut  a ringleader of the democrats  sit in  said his fellow democrats plan to support republican mental health legislation that could help avert some mass shootings  larson added he hoped it would be seen as an olive branch to republicans toward progress on gun control  scores of gun control advocates demonstrated outside the house chamber in sweltering heat on wednesday morning  as  people wearing orange t shirts stood on the steps leading to the house demanding action  they represented the  people who  according to government statistics  die each day in the united states from gun violence  many of them die as a result of suicide
