 reuters    republican candidates in tight races across the country have tied themselves in knots trying to decide whether to disavow or support their party s presidential nominee  donald trump  especially since multiple sexual assault allegations against him have surfaced  but u s  senator pat toomey of pennsylvania  who is in a virtual tie with his democratic challenger in a race that could tip control of the senate  has chosen a third option  say nothing  toomey appears to be the only vulnerable republican senator to have avoided answering the question of whether he will vote for trump  even as he has denounced the billionaire real estate developer s lewd comments about women and allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior  his democratic challenger  katie mcginty  has spent days hammering toomey for his reticence  coining the term  fraidy pat  and tying his candidacy to that of trump s at every turn  but pennsylvania political analysts say toomey may have taken the safest path given his need to stitch together a coalition of working class  white voters who support trump and moderate  college educated suburbanites who find his rhetoric distasteful  polling averages show trump losing the state to hillary clinton by a margin of  to  percentage points  while mcginty held a lead of less than  point in the senate race  in polls before the senate candidates debated on monday  pennsylvania has not voted for a republican presidential candidate since george h w  bush in   toomey won his seat in  by just  percentage points   i think for him he s making the right choice  because i think he has to have it both ways   said g  terry madonna  the director of the franklin   marshall college poll in lancaster  pennsylvania   he s between a rock and a hard place  and he s chosen to stay in the middle   the question of whether to back their party s presidential nominee   a non issue in virtually any other election year   has bedeviled republicans facing competitive races across the country  with control of the senate hanging in the balance  some  like senator kelly ayotte of new hampshire  have rescinded their support  angering trump s core supporters  others  like senator richard burr of north carolina  have stuck with trump and risked losing moderate voters  a handful of republicans  including ayotte before she recently changed her mind  have tried to straddle the issue by withholding a formal endorsement while saying they still planned to vote for trump  the pennsylvania campaign  one of half a dozen close contests with the senate up for grabs  has been the most expensive senate race in the country  with more than   million from the parties and outside groups pouring into the state as of august  mcginty  who served as an environmental adviser in former president bill clinton s administration  has spent months trying to link toomey to trump  she has redoubled her efforts over the last  days  as multiple women have come forward to accuse trump of sexually assaulting them following the release of a video recording from  in which he bragged in lewd terms about such behavior   on thursday  for the second time since the tape became public  mcginty held a conference call for reporters to assail toomey for what she described as his tacit support for trump   senator pat toomey now has the distinction of being the only senate candidate in the entire united states of america to refuse to come clean about whether or not he supports donald trump   she said   so  there s only one way to interpret that  pat toomey is still standing by donald trump   toomey has criticized trump s  outrageous comments  but has declined to say whether he will vote for him  a position he reiterated on monday at the first of two debates with mcginty  he did  however  say he  probably  will announce a decision before the nov   elections  after previously suggesting he might not  in a statement  a toomey spokesman turned the criticism around  calling mcginty a  rubber stamp  for the democratic establishment in washington   pat toomey has proven he will stand up to his own party for pennsylvania families  like on gun safety  fighting corporate welfare  or ending the wall street bailouts once and for all   the spokesman  ted kwong  said in an email   katie mcginty can t name a single disagreement with her party  whether it s the reckless iran deal or thousands in new middle class tax hikes   charlie gerow  a veteran republican political consultant in pennsylvania who is not involved in the race  said toomey s middle of the road strategy was necessary given the deficit trump is facing in the state  toomey  gerow said  cannot afford to alienate trump backers in places like southwestern pennsylvania  even as he tries to appeal to voters in the philadelphia and lehigh valley suburbs   i think it is the best strategy among several unpalatable options   gerow said   i don t think there was any better way to approach that dilemma
