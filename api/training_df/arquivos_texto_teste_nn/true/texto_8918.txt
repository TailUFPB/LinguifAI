 reuters    it could take years to learn how long men infected with zika are capable of sexually transmitting the virus  which can cause crippling birth defects and other serious neurological disorders  in the meantime  health officials have warned couples to refrain from unprotected sex for six months after a male partner is infected  the extraordinary recommendation  based on a single report of zika surviving  days in semen  could affect millions  the grave risks associated with zika  along with its potential reach  are driving u s  health authorities to pursue research even though funding is mired in congressional gridlock  a study of sexual transmission risk is one example of science that health officials said can t wait for politics  borrowing money earmarked for other programs  the u s  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has started enrolling men infected with zika in brazil and colombia in the study to determine how long the virus remains transmittable in semen  the study could take years to complete  but interim results could help public health officials fine tune their recommendations on sex   we are going out on a limb  but we have to   dr  anthony fauci  director of the u s  institute  said in an interview   we can t say we re going to wait until we get all the money   public health officials are alarmed by zika s transmission versatility  which has the potential to expand its reach  it is primarily spread by aedes aegypti mosquitoes  as are the dengue and chikungunya viruses  but at least  countries  including the united states and france  have reported zika infections in people who had not traveled to an outbreak area but whose sexual partners had  this ability to spread through sex could help zika gain a further foothold outside the warm habitats of its most effective agent  the mosquito  to protect women who are pregnant or trying to conceive  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention recommended couples refrain from unprotected sex for six months   triple the  days the virus survived in the semen in one british case study  the world health organization recently issued similar guidance  but such strict advice is not ideal  dr  anne schuchat  a cdc deputy director  said in an interview   to tell people not to have sex until we get back to you is not a very satisfying recommendation   she said   we would like to have some more understanding of the sexual risk   in the u s  territory of puerto rico  where more than   cases of infection have been reported since the start of the year  health officials are passing out zika protection kits that include bug spray and condoms  along with the recommendation  but the warning against unprotected sex isn t going over very well  said dr  chris prue  a cdc behavioral scientist who has studied the response   condoms are not popular in a lot places   she said   there s religious and personal preferences and lots of personal factors in that   u s  lawmakers deadlocked over funding to fight the zika virus on tuesday  as senate democrats blocked a republican proposal they said fell short of the challenge posed by the virus and hurt other health priorities  it was unclear when congress would revisit the request by president barack obama for    billion  in the meantime  the white house has diverted more than   million earmarked for other projects for urgent zika initiatives  including those where scientific opportunities will be lost if not acted upon immediately  one such study will follow children born to women infected with zika to identify the development of any disabilities not detected at birth  other projects on the priority list include vaccine development and mosquito eradication     one study underway will assess whether the risk of transmission is greater from men who experience zika infection symptoms  such as fever and rash  than from those who don t  this information is considered vital since most people experience no symptoms  the study of infected men in brazil and colombia will test semen from thousands of men over time to determine how long zika poses a risk to sexual partners  as long the virus can be grown in a laboratory from semen cell samples  infectious disease experts believe it is potentially contagious  zika typically clears the bloodstream about a week after infection  but it has been detected in urine for at least twice as long  its persistence in semen in the british case study has caused some researchers to draw comparisons to other viruses  hiv can last in blood and semen indefinitely  and the mosquito borne west nile virus can reside in the kidneys and urine for years  researchers said  one patient who survived the deadly ebola outbreak had evidence of that virus in his semen for  months   we got very surprised by ebola that it was hanging around for so long   said dr  peter hotez  dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine   one of the big questions we have to ask is does zika also cause a similar type of latency
