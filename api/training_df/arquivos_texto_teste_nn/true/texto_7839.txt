washington moscow  reuters    russian president vladimir putin insisted on wednesday his country was not involved in an effort to influence the u s  presidential election even as wikileaks released another trove of internal documents from hillary clinton s campaign  last week  the u s  government formally accused russia of launching a hacking campaign to  interfere with the u s  election process   clinton s campaign  which has charged the kremlin is trying to help republican donald trump win the white house on nov    took its allegations a step further on tuesday when john podesta  chairman of the democratic nominee s campaign  accused the trump campaign of colluding with russia  at events in florida  trump said he had nothing to do with putin or russia   i promise you  i don t have any business deals with russia   trump said at a rally in lakeland  in moscow  putin said nothing in the hacking scandal is in russia s interests and accused all sides in the u s  presidential campaign of misusing rhetoric about russia for their own purposes    they started this hysteria  saying this  hacking  is in russia s interests  but this has nothing to do with russia s interests   putin told a business forum  putin said his government would work with whoever won the u s  election   if  of course  the new u s  leader wishes to work with our country    wikileaks  the organization started by julian assange that publishes leaked information on the internet  this week released thousands of emails from podesta s email account and has not said how it obtained them  last week  it posted excerpts from clinton s private speeches to banking and financial firms   the clinton campaign has not confirmed the authenticity of the messages   the leaks  coming as the election campaign reaches the final stretch  have the potential to embarrass the clinton camp  in recent days  however  trump s own campaign has been in deeper trouble over the emergence of a  video in which trump bragged about groping women  many republican elected officials have turned their back on him and clinton s lead in national opinion polls has increased  trump escalated his attacks on u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan on wednesday  deepening a fracture in the republican party   clinton  a former secretary of state  has repeatedly accused trump of having overly friendly ties with putin and russia   she has noted that trump s foreign policies have tended to align with russian s interests  whether it has been questioning nato s role in defending eastern europe  failing to recognize russia s intrusion into ukraine  and supporting russia s actions in syria   trump  a new york businessman who has never previously run for office  has shifted his policies on a wide range of issues  from taxes to the minimum wage to immigration during his white house campaign but his statements on russia have been consistent  his friendly stance toward moscow departs from the views of many prominent republicans   during a presidential debate on sunday  trump publicly disagreed with his own vice presidential choice  mike pence  who had called for a more hawkish approach toward russia      at that debate  trump questioned whether russia was behind the hacks  as the u s  government has asserted  and on wednesday  during a rally in ocala  florida  trump echoed those remarks   have you ever noticed  anything that goes wrong they blame russia   trump told the crowd   they always blame russia and then they says donald trump is friends       i don t know putin  folks  what the hell do i have to do with putin   trump has said that as president he would seek warmer relations with russia and that it would be in the united states  best interests to seek russia s help to defeat islamic state    trump is the most pro russian presidential candidate ever   said max boot  a senior fellow for national security studies at the council of foreign relations   putin no doubt sees a once in a lifetime opportunity to reorient u s  foreign policy in his direction by electing trump   a russian ultra nationalist ally of putin who is known for his fiery rhetoric said trump was the only person able to de escalate dangerous tensions between moscow and washington  and predicted nuclear war if clinton were elected        relations between russia and the united states can t get any worse  the only way they can get worse is if a war starts   vladimir zhirinovsky  a flamboyant veteran lawmaker  told reuters             clinton campaign chairman podesta said on tuesday the fbi was investigating a  criminal hack  of his emails  and he tied the trump campaign to the leaks by suggesting that a former trump adviser  roger stone  had advance warning of the hacks   the trump campaign has not responded to the allegation about stone  but trump has denied any coordination with the russian government to embarrass clinton   he has  however  made clear he supports wikileaks  efforts   i love wikileaks   he said at a rally in pennsylvania on tuesday   the united states has an ongoing criminal investigation into assange s publishing of classified material  clinton has been a fierce critic of assange  who remains at the ecuadorean embassy in london where he sought refuge in  to avoid possible extradition to sweden   last week  the office of the director of national intelligence and department of homeland security said the government was confident the hacks of democratic political groups and campaign officials originated from high levels of the russian government  the white house on tuesday promised a  proportional  response to russia over the hacks   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told cnn the united states has offered no proof of his government s involvement  and suggested moscow was unconcerned about possible reprisals   if they decided to do something  let them do it   lavrov said
