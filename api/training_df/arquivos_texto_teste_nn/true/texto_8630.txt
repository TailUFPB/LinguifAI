philadelphia  reuters    it should have been a triumphant night for hillary clinton when her rival bernie sanders gave a rousing speech urging his supporters to vote for her in the nov   u s  presidential election  instead it turned into a sign of potential trouble for her white house bid  his speech on monday to the democratic national convention in philadelphia urging the party to unite against republican donald trump was met with some jeers when he endorsed clinton   a sign he had lost control of his own movement   i m beyond disappointed   california delegate aleece depuey    said after sanders sought to rally support for his one time rival    hundreds of sanders supporters marched through the streets on day one of the four day convention  chanting   we want bernie   delegates wore  bernie or bust  buttons  others donned robin hood style hats  a call to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor   when he spoke  a scuffle broke out between a sanders supporter and a clinton supporter in the hall   the backlash raised questions over whether   and how   clinton could ever win over sanders supporters   with opinion polls showing the clinton trump race tightening  clinton needs sanders  voters more than ever  sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  arrived in philadelphia with   of   delegates after winning  million votes in the democratic nominating contest  to many of sanders  backers  clinton is a bridge too far  they see her as the kind of political insider  backed by reams of corporate money  that drove them to sanders and his fight to rein in wall street and remove income inequality  others simply do not trust her  opinion polls show   in a reuters ipsos poll released at the end of june  some  percent of sanders  backers said they would vote for trump  and  percent would support neither clinton nor trump  sanders won the states of colorado  indiana  michigan  and new hampshire in the run up to the convention  and nearly won iowa   all states that could be closely contested by trump in the general election  clinton likely will need some portion of sanders  support to stay competitive in those states   clinton s campaign had hoped in philadelphia to put the bare knuckle primary fight behind it  but sanders  voters were enraged by friday s embarrassing release of internal party emails by the activist group wikileaks showing party officials clearly favored clinton over their candidate   sanders supporters seemed to be everywhere  often with a bigger presence than clinton supporters  a jarring sight at an event where she is due to be formally nominated as the party s presidential candidate    at a delegate welcoming event on sunday night  shouts of  bernie   filled the air as his supporters circulated a petition to force convention organizers to hold an extended roll call vote on the floor this week that would require each delegate to declare his or her support  others pledged to contest clinton s choice of democrat tim kaine  a u s  senator from virginia  as her running mate   when at mid day sanders addressed more than a thousand of his delegates at the city s convention center  the crowd erupted in fury when he asked them to switch their allegiance to clinton   brothers and sisters   he said over their jeers   this is the real world that we live in  trump is a bully and a demagogue   people started shouting back   so is hillary   sanders did not mention clinton again  but he already had lost the attention of some of his most fervent fans   as soon as he said back clinton  everyone stopped listening   said cindy melchert  a protester who listened to the appeal over a loudspeaker at a local park  a michigan native  melchert said she would not vote for clinton in november under any circumstances  for her  the movement now was less about sanders and more about showing the democratic national committee  they had us and absolutely lost us   another protester  michael arnold of atlanta  would not have been out of place at a trump rally  sporting a t shirt that read  hillary for prison    fearing a similar scene on the convention floor would embarrass clinton  sanders  campaign emailed delegates before monday night s program  urging them to restrain themselves   our credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing  turning of backs  walking out or other similar displays   it read  some sanders supporters appeared willing to set aside their qualms about clinton  largely out of a desire to see trump defeated in the election  diana hatsis neuhoff  a delegate from florida adorned with buttons backing sanders  said she planned to vote for clinton in the general election   yes   she said   we ll hold our nose and vote   others felt their fellow sanders supporters had taken the movement too far   we are surrounded by people who are so selfish and so self absorbed   said melissa robbins  who worked for the sanders campaign in philadelphia   not voting for hillary is a sure win for donald trump   but that may not be enough to sway sue spicer from indiana  who said she had trouble imagining voting for either clinton or trump   it s hard to feel they have our best interests in mind   she said
