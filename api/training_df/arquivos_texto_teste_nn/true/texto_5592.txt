london  reuters    president donald trump s review of post crisis banking rules could sound the death knell for new global standards now being finalized and rip apart a common approach to regulating international lenders  bankers and regulators said  central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the   financial crisis  but there are fears that project could unravel after trump said he wants the u s  to row back on capital rules      trump s order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements  known as basel iii   given that the united states wants to shrink the banking rule book  there are doubts over whether the basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they don t have backing from the united states  without support from the world s biggest capital market  other countries would be less willing to commit too  the core aim of the outstanding part of basel iii that regulators are working on   dubbed basel iv by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements   is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans      jpmorgan chief executive jamie dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that european rivals had been  a lot more aggressive  than american banks in calculating capital  meaning they were holding less       european policymakers have rejected that criticism  but their region s banks have been lobbying against the remaining basel rules  saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold       if the united states fails to approve the completion of basel iii  the perceived problem that european banks get away with holding less capital than u s  lenders may not be properly tackled  a source involved in the negotiations said        it s in the interests of american banks to get this done   the source said  others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after trump s intervention   it s going to delay completing basel iii  and perhaps lead to it not being concluded   an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity   i do fear that basel iv is doomed   a banking industry official added  there are headwinds from elsewhere  too  patrick mchenry  republican vice chairman of the house financial services committee  fired a warning shot at federal reserve governor janet yellen about the basel talks in a letter dated jan    ahead of trump s executive order  the fed must  cease  all attempts to negotiate binding standards  burdening american business  until the trump administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritize  america s best interests   mchenry said      while lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms  regulators said trump s intervention in banking rules gives more clout to mchenry s warning  the basel committee declined to comment  trump s decision to review existing  post crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country  mario draghi  president of the european central bank  which regulates the euro zone s main lenders  said on monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability  draghi was chairman of the group of  economies      regulatory task force  the financial stability board  which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards  a former regulator said the united states would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on u s  banking competitiveness globally      it s early days  but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from washington is worrying   said david wright  a former top eu official who was part of crisis era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus      if you break international consensus  you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end   said wright  now at flint global  which advises companies on regulatory matters  wright was referring to what was seen in the run up to the financial crisis  when countries like britain resorted to a  light touch  approach to banks to make london a more attractive financial center  valdis dombrovskis  the eu s financial services chief  said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue  much will hinge on how much regulatory change trump can actually push through  former democratic congressman barney frank  who jointly sponsored the dodd frank act that trump wants to review  told the bbc last week he does not expect congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules  but the trump administration could pressure u s  regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements     anil kashyap  a bank of england policymaker  said last month that trump s nomination for the powerful role of fed vice chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the u s  approach to international rule making  it will have a  huge impact   a regulatory source added     the fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the basel committee and the financial stability board could be abandoned by the united states under trump  jose ignacio goirigolzarri  chairman of spain s bankia  told spanish television on tuesday he would be concerned if trump was questioning the usefulness of international banking rules   it would worry me very much because i think it s very important  very relevant that there have been advances in the homogenization of regulation amongst developed countries   he said
