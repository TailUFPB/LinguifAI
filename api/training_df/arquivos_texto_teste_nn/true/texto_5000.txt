washington  reuters    republican u s  representative todd rokita keeps a clock hanging on the wall of his capitol hill office that tracks the u s  government s rising debt in real time and reminds him of his top priority  reining in federal spending   i was sent here on a fiscal note   said the indiana lawmaker and vice chairman of the house of representatives budget committee  who rode a republican wave during his first election to congress in   when president donald trump unveils his budget for the  fiscal year on thursday  rokita will be among many conservative republicans cheering proposed cuts to domestic programs that would pay for a military buildup  more moderate republicans are less enthusiastic and worry trump s budget could force lawmakers to choose between opposing the president or backing reductions in popular programs such as aid for disabled children and hot meals for the elderly   what you would hope is that the administration is aware of the difficulty of some of these things   said representative tom cole of oklahoma  the release of trump s budget  which comes as the republican president is facing an intraparty revolt over proposed legislation to replace the obamacare healthcare law  could open another fight among republicans who control both houses of congress  to keep the government running  lawmakers will need to approve a spending plan later this year  the white house has released few details about trump s budget  other than making clear the president wants to boost military spending by   billion and is seeking equivalent cuts in non defense discretionary programs  but several agencies  including the state department and the environmental protection agency  have been asked to prepare scenarios for steep reductions  according to officials familiar with the discussions  while supporting deficit reduction efforts  cole said a major research university in his district could get hit by national institutes of health cuts  as could sewage treatment facilities funded by the epa  republican senator rob portman  whose home state of ohio sits on the southern shores of lake erie  expressed concern about media reports saying the trump budget had penciled in sharp cuts in a cleanup program for the great lakes  while rokita  who was among a group of republican lawmakers who met with trump last week  appeared comfortable with what he had learned so far about trump s budget  some republican members of the conservative house freedom caucus said they wanted to see even further budget cuts  representative mo brooks of alabama said the outcry from lawmakers over the expected cuts underscored to him that the blueprint would be a  a very large step in the right direction  of reining in the debt  brooks added   my fear is that the trump budget will not be austere enough to minimize america s risk of suffering the kind of debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that is destroying the lives of venezuelans right now   opec member venezuela is immersed in a deep economic crisis  with inflation in triple digits  shortages of basic goods  and many people going hungry  brooks and other members of the freedom caucus are among the most vocal critics of the legislation backed by the white house to repeal and replace the affordable care act  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare plan  known as obamacare  to try to woo the conservative lawmakers on trump s legislative agenda  budget director mick mulvaney  himself a former member of the house freedom caucus  has invited them to a bowling and pizza night at the white house on tuesday night  another freedom caucus member  representative david schweikert of arizona  said mulvaney was encouraging lawmakers to submit maverick fiscal ideas to the white house  schweikert said he hoped to revive a proposal from a few years ago  in the midst of a fight over raising the u s  debt limit  that would have allowed the government to take a series of alternative  albeit controversial steps  such as paying some creditors ahead of others  one senior republican aide  who referred to trump s budget as a  slash and burn  proposal  said one fear of some house lawmakers was that they would be pressured to back big spending cuts only to have them rejected by the senate  where republicans hold a slimmer majority  the risk for house members is that their votes could prompt a backlash in the  congressional elections  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said a budget that cuts state department funds by one third is unlikely to pass in his chamber  other high ranking republicans are setting off alarms  senator lindsey graham  following a white house lunch on tuesday with trump  said   what i told him is that when we get in a deadlock between the house and the senate  different factions of the party     you re the guy who needs to come down and close the deal   cole said congress would ultimately have the final say on the budget   at the end of the day  we ll have a budget  we ll pass the budget   he said   our budget is not necessarily the president s budget
