new york  reuters    democrat hillary clinton had a four percentage point advantage in support over republican donald trump ahead of their first u s  presidential debate  according to the latest reuters ipsos national tracking poll released on friday  the sept    opinion poll showed that  percent of likely voters supported clinton  while  percent supported trump  clinton has mostly led trump in the poll during the  campaign  though her advantage has narrowed since the end of the democratic and republican national conventions in july  with just six weeks before the nov   election  monday s debate at hofstra university in hempstead  new york will be the first of three between the white house rivals  it presents a major opportunity for them to appeal to voters who have yet to commit to a candidate after a mostly negative race in which clinton and trump have sought to brand each other as untrustworthy and dangerous for the country  the live  televised matchup is expected to draw a super bowl sized television audience of  million americans  according to some commentators  among those watching will be people who so far remain on the fence  this could be a sizable group  some  percent of likely voters said in the latest poll that they do not support either major party candidate  that was more than twice the proportion of uncommitted voters at the same point in the  election between democratic president barack obama and republican mitt romney  these uncommitted voters appear to be leaning more toward trump than clinton  according to the latest poll  though they have not been convinced enough to say they will vote for him in november  it was also possible that some of these voters would pick an alternative party candidate like libertarian gary johnson or the green party s jill stein  clinton led a separate four way poll that included trump  johnson and stein  among likely voters   percent supported clinton   percent favored trump   percent picked johnson and  percent supported stein  the reuters ipsos poll is conducted online in english in the continental united states  alaska and hawaii  it included   respondents who were considered to be likely voters given their voting history  registration status and stated intention to show up on election day  it has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of  percentage points  meaning results could vary by that much either way  national polls have produced varying measurements of support for clinton and trump during the  campaign  the differences are partly due to the fact that some polls  like reuters ipsos  try to include only likely voters  while others include all registered voters  the reuters ipsos tracking poll gathers responses every day and reports results twice a week  so it often detects trends in sentiment before most other polls   polling aggregators  which calculate averages of major polls  have shown that clinton s lead over trump has been shrinking this month  the most recent individual polls put her advantage at  percentage points
