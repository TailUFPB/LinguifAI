 reuters    an order by president donald trump that could scale back enforcement of some obamacare provisions is unlikely to sink health insurance stocks  but shares of hospitals and medicaid providers could be under pressure over fears more poor people would lose coverage  analysts said  president trump signed an executive order on friday urging government departments to  waive  defer  grant exemptions from  or delay the implementation  of provisions of the affordable care act  known as obamacare  that imposed fiscal burdens on states  companies or individuals  while the order lacked details  it signaled the start of an effort by trump and republicans to repeal and replace the program  which expanded health coverage to some  million people  obamacare has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers  including unitedhealth group inc and aetna inc  largely pulling out of the system  shares of unitedhealth and aetna were little changed in early trading on monday  the equity markets dislike uncertainty and trump s executive order introduces at least a modest level of new uncertainty  j p  morgan analyst gary taylor wrote in a note on monday  the new administration may no longer enforce an affordable care act rule requiring individual americans to pay a penalty for not carrying health insurance  kellyanne conway  counselor to the president  said on abc s  this week  program on sunday  the healthcare exchange system that is the cornerstone of the affordable care act depends on premiums from healthy  younger individuals  typically between ages  to   to offset higher expenses for covering older  less healthy individuals  the scrapping of enforcement was  a real risk  for  insurance exchanges enrollment  sheryl r  skolnick  a healthcare analyst for mizuho securities usa inc  said in a research note on saturday   we have to wonder why the hospital companies and investors who have pushed the stocks back up to pre election levels would be so enthusiastic   skolnick wrote  but young people did not buy health insurance at desired levels  even when penalties increased for not having the coverage  said ana gupte  a healthcare services analyst for leerink partners llc in new york   fundamentally  i don t think it s going to make a difference   if the so called  individual mandate   requiring individuals to buy coverage or pay a penalty  is scrapped  said gupte  some experts also question whether the obama administration itself was vigilant about enforcing the rule   we re not sure as to how vigorously it was being enforced anyway   said les funtleyder  healthcare portfolio manager for e squared capital management  still  trump s plans could pressure shares of insurers such as molina healthcare inc  centene corp and wellcare health plans inc  who administer state medicaid plans  over concerns that the number of insured  especially among the poorest  would shrink     molina s shares were down   percent  while centene s shares were down   percent  if medicaid funding becomes less than what states are receiving now   it will put pressure on the number of people who are covered through medicaid expansion   gupte said    hospitals may also be on the hook for more unpaid medical expenses as the number of uninsured individuals increase and seek emergency room treatment  gupte added   longer term  though  the hospital industry is lobbying to get more money for unpaid expenses and  it looks like they will get what they want   gupte said  shares of hospital operators such as hca holdings inc  tenet healthcare corp and community health systems inc were down about  percent   in reality  the executive order is just a sideshow to the main event   the repeal replace legislation that republicans are expected to introduce this year   taylor said
