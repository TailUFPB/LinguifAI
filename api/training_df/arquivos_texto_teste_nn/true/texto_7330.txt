kabul  reuters    with so much riding on american support  afghanistan is waiting anxiously to see if president elect donald trump matches his maverick image and reverses policy or keeps to a path that has cost billions and committed thousands of troops to propping up a fragile ally  much to the private annoyance of officials in kabul  america s longest war barely featured in the election campaign  but few were expecting the billionaire property developer to beat former secretary of state hillary clinton   it s been a complete surprise   said one senior afghan official closely involved in national security issues   i think everyone was expecting the opposite result   it  afghanistan  wasn t a priority in the campaign  that s obvious  no one talked about afghanistan at all  at least with mrs  clinton  though  you knew more or less what you were getting   afghanistan will nonetheless present the incoming trump administration with one of its most intractable foreign policy challenges  the united states has spent some   billion in aid for afghanistan  but  years after the hardline islamist taliban were toppled after the sept   attacks  a third of the country is out of government control and security forces are struggling  as recently as last week two u s  service members were killed fighting the taliban near the northern city of kunduz  and expectations that afghan security forces could survive without extensive foreign assistance have proved illusory  faced with a mounting taliban insurgency  obama dropped his original aim of pulling out of afghanistan entirely  in july  he decided to keep   u s  troops in afghanistan  shelving earlier plans to bring the numbers down to   and leaving it to his successor to decide how to move forward  before the election  u s  officials told partners that afghanistan  whose war ruined economy depends heavily on billions of dollars in foreign aid  will not be neglected by the new administration and that ties will remain strong and close   you can be assured that afghanistan will remain at the highest levels of our foreign policy agenda   ambassador michael mckinley told an election day party at the u s  embassy in kabul  before the final results of the ballot were in  however  trump s  america first  doctrine has left many wondering if he will be willing to continue spending billions of dollars funding afghanistan  particularly given his declaration that   we re getting out of the nation building business   among afghans who use social media  a sense that the incoming president is opposed to their old enemy pakistan made some hope his election would be good for afghanistan  but there is little to go on for those trying to parse his public remarks  so far  he has shown little interest in afghanistan  although his most recent comments suggested he favored keeping troop numbers at around    the level they were intended to reach by the end of the year before obama shelved the plan and set the number at    but in other comments  he has described america s involvement in afghanistan as  a terrible mistake  and appeared to set conditions on the u s  commitment to nato  which leads the resolute support advise and assist mission in afghanistan  security officials in kabul say the threat that islamic state militants could build their presence in afghanistan should act as an incentive to keep a u s  force in place  although they admit they remain in the dark about trump s intentions   as trump promised during his campaign that he would eliminate daesh  islamic state   we don t think he would withdraw american forces from afghanistan as daesh is a new threat for afghanistan and the region   said one official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue   but we are still in a state of uncertainty and we will wait and see what trump has for afghanistan   he added  the decision will be vital for a country that is likely to depend on american support for years to come   the united states will almost certainly continue to be the leading source of both military and civilian reconstruction aid to afghanistan for years to come   the latest report from the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction  a congressional oversight body  said only last month  in an interview with cnn television last year  trump himself appeared to accept that it was too late to pull u s  forces out   and at this point  you probably have to stay because that thing will collapse about two seconds after they leave   he said  in the interview in october
