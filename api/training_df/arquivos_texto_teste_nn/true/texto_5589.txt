beijing  reuters    u s  president donald trump s order temporarily banning visitors from seven muslim majority countries shows that his administration does not understand its counterterrorism duties  chinese state media said on wednesday  trump s jan   order  which he says is necessary for national security  sought to bar entry by travelers from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  and by all refugees for  days  except for refugees from syria  who face an indefinite ban  the move  which sparked protests and chaos at u s  and overseas airports  has been suspended by a federal judge in seattle and is now under intense scrutiny from a u s  federal appeals court questioning whether it unfairly targeted people over their religion  china s government has offered mild criticism of the ban  saying immigration policy was a sovereign right but  reasonable concerns  must be considered  but the official xinhua news agency said trump s order  shows that his administration has no correct recognition of the responsibility it needs to shoulder in a global fight against terrorism    radical elements around the world could use the ban to further justify their ruthless causes  and to gain more recruits   xinhua said in a commentary   that is a grave threat not only to the safety and security of the united states  but that of others worldwide   banned countries on the list  such as iraq  libya and syria  have been victimized by terrorism because previous u s  governments and other western powers deliberately intervened for self interests   it added  such commentaries from xinhua do not equate to government policy  but often reflect official thinking  the world s most populous nation generally accepts few refugees  china offered permanent residence to   foreigners in   the public security ministry has said  but such openings are largely reserved for experts and professionals  china  which says it faces a serious threat from terrorism  has often rebuked the united states and other western countries for what it considers their double standards on terrorism  nervous about being implicated in possible human rights abuses  western nations have been reluctant to cooperate in china s campaign in its far western region of xinjiang  where  officials say islamist militants aim to set up a separate state  rights advocates say ethnic violence in the region in recent years is a response to repressive government policies affecting the largely muslim uighur people who call xinjiang home  though china denies rights abuses there
