singapore  reuters    donald trump s  isolationist  foreign policy pronouncements are feeding insecurity in some asian nations fearful of china s growing power  and risk emboldening nationalists and authoritarians in the region  the real estate developer  who is very close to securing the republican nomination for november s presidential election  has with undiplomatic abandon challenged much of the status quo in u s  asia relations  overall  his comments have sounded like a death knell for the  pivot to asia  strategy adopted by president barack obama five years ago  trump has said u s  allies like japan and south korea should pay more toward their defense  warned he could withdraw u s  troops from bases in japan  and mulled whether japan and south korea should have their own nuclear arms  this week he told reuters he is willing to talk to north korean leader kim jong un  which would represent a major shift in u s  policy   in a television interview on friday  trump told msnbc that while he was open to talks  he  would never go to north korea    trump has also threatened to rein in china s big trade surplus with the united states  saying he will threaten to impose heavy duties on chinese goods  and trump says he will rip up and then renegotiate the trans pacific partnership  a trade pact agreed to by the u s   japan  and  other countries in february   furthermore  trump s call for a ban on muslims entering the united states risks undermining moderate leaders in muslim countries like pakistan  indonesia  malaysia and bangladesh   if he becomes president and adopts his own version of foreign policy  the u s  will cease to be a pacific power  that s the end result   said kunihiko miyake  a former japanese diplomat  who served in both beijing and baghdad    it s not that we would adopt  japan first   but if the u s  leaves  there will be a vacuum and   china will try to fill it   said miyake  research director at the canon institute for global studies   it s a survival issue for all allies of the united states   trump could  of course  lose the election to the likely democratic candidate  hillary clinton  who is well known by many asia policymakers   and if he is elected he could act much differently in office  but asian diplomats and policy advisers say that initial impressions count  trump s idea of making japan and south korea pay up rather than enjoy a cheaper ride under the u s  security umbrella sent shudders through tokyo and seoul   trump reiterated his stance on friday   they have a lot of money  both of those nations   he told msnbc  pointing to japan s auto sales and south korea s electronics industry   we have to get reimbursed    in addition  his comments about the possibility of a local nuclear deterrent fanned fears among asian diplomats that the world could become an even more dangerous place    it is here that trump is most scary   lalit mansingh  a former indian ambassador to washington  told reuters in new delhi  though he also noted it may be  just election rhetoric   japan s nationalist led government has already boosted defence spending and has reinterpreted its pacifist constitution to allow its military to come to the aid of allies under attack even if japan itself if not attacked  a major shift in japan s post war security stance   his position is causing anxiety  especially in east asia   said a senior lawmaker in japan s ruling coalition   it is really hard to comprehend because conservatives have supported a stronger military presence and more engagement   mansingh said he expects china to test the foreign policy resolve of whoever occupies the white house next  and the south china sea looms as one of the most likely flashpoints  tensions over china s land building and installations on islets in the disputed waters flared on tuesday  when two chinese warplanes carried out what the pentagon called an  unsafe  intercept of a u s  military reconnaissance aircraft   they re building a massive fortress in the south china sea  they re not supposed to be doing that   trump told reuters  without saying what he would do about it  at least  according to mansingh  china s leaders and trump shared the mentality of dealmakers  which could help settle diplomatic wrangles before they get out of hand  jia qingguo  an adviser to china s government on foreign affairs  said trump sounds like an  isolationist  who doesn t want the united states to become too active internationally   so  he doesn t sound that aggressive   said jia  the dean of the school of international relations at china s elite peking university   chinese tend to think that too much so called internationalism on the part of the u s  is not that good   a senior japanese government official said washington could lose influence in asia if there was any perception it was softening its stance on issues like the south china sea   and it would be very difficult to get it back   he warned  mansingh says those fears are overblown as the united states  self interest lay in protecting access to the pacific and indian oceans    what would american withdrawal mean  does it want to hand over the affairs of the world to china  would that serve anybody s interest  i don t think so   there are also fears that the tpp could unravel  or become worth a lot less to asian partners  should trump renegotiate the pact  as he has said he wants to do  the deal has yet to be ratified by the u s  congress  but obama has warned that delay could allow china to steal a march through its own proposed regional trade deal with  other nations        i think it s hard to imagine that tpp would survive a trump presidency   said a top trade official in a major country in the region  who declined to be more closely identified    less intervention  would be a small benefit compared to the massive damage to the world from a usa that becomes more isolationist and more crassly commercial under trump   he said   the lack of priority trump appears to give to issues that don t serve his  america first  agenda could mean he ll soft pedal on human rights and democratic values  some critics said  that would come at a time when generals are running thailand  a  strong man  has just been elected as president of the philippines  and malaysia s prime minister has silenced independent media   let s hope that someone on his team realizes that respect for human rights must be a core u s  foreign policy value and not just a reality show line   said phil robertson  deputy director for human rights watch s asia division  on the other hand  panitan wattanayagorn  an adviser to thailand s defence minister  prawit wongsuwon  expressed confidence that trump wouldn t apply pressure to countries like his   all in all  if trump arrives  the chances of stronger ties will be good because he would want allies   said panitan
