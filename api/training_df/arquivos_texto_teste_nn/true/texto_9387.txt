 reuters    officials from  u s  states sued the obama administration on wednesday to overturn a directive telling schools to let transgender students use bathrooms matching their gender identity  decrying the policy as  a massive social experiment   ramping up the simmering battles over contentious cultural issues in america  the states  led by texas and most with republican governors  accused the federal government of rewriting laws by  administrative fiat    we are willing to fight this all the way to the supreme court if we have to   republican texas attorney general ken paxton told reporters in austin   amid a national debate on transgender rights  president barack obama s administration on may  told u s  public schools that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice  upsetting republicans and paving the way for fights over federal funding and legal authority  the states  lawsuit accused the federal government of overstepping its constitutional powers by taking actions that should be left to congress or individual states  it also challenged the obama administration s interpretation of federal civil rights law with regard to sex and gender  the lawsuit said the administration  conspired to turn workplace and educational settings across the country into laboratories for a massive social experiment  flouting the democratic process  and running roughshod over commonsense policies protecting children and basic privacy rights   texas was joined by alabama  georgia  louisiana  oklahoma  tennessee  utah  west virginia and wisconsin  plus arizona s department of education and maine s governor  paxton said   it s about parents who are upset  grandparents who are upset  they want to see that the safety of their children is taken care of   transgender rights advocates argued it is transgender people who need protection  particularly transgender women who are disproportionately the victims of assaults and would be forced to use men s bathrooms if states succeed in forcing people to use bathrooms matching their sex at birth  likewise  transgender men  many of whom grow facial hair  would be required to use women s bathrooms along with girls   this action puts students at risk for the sake of politics   said alison gill of the trans united fund advocacy group supporting transgender rights  gill said the states  lawsuit did not reflect the position of most school boards and administrators  the administration s letter to the schools said that to get federal funding under existing rules  schools must agree not to treat students or activities differently on the basis of sex  that includes not treating transgender students differently from others of the same gender identity  officials said  paul castillo  a lawyer with lambda legal  which supports lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  rights  said the lawsuit represented an  unprecedented attack against transgender people across the united states    these states are demonstrating the great lengths they will go to in order to discriminate against transgender individuals   castillo said  nine of the  states that sued have republican governors  including maine s paul lepage  lepage broke with the democratic attorney general  janet mills  who did not approve of the lawsuit  a spokesman for mills said  school districts from texas and arizona also joined the suit  which names the u s  government and a host of federal  agencies and officials as defendants  north carolina sued the federal government on the transgender bathroom issue this month  seeking to protect its state law passed in march that bans people from using public restrooms not corresponding to their sex assigned at birth  ever since the  civil rights movement  the federal government has asserted its authority to force states to extend equal protection under the law for all  the administration sued north carolina on may   stating that its transgender bathroom law violated the u s   civil rights act  the  states  lawsuit accused the administration of taking that argument too far and improperly  widening the scope of interpretation of civil rights law  title ix of the education amendments of  prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities  the administration s interpretation is that the word  sex  extends protection to transgender people  but the issue has not been settled in the courts   i agree with the obama administration that  sex  includes  gender   and  gender  includes  gender identity    said john pagan of the university of richmond s school of law in virginia  peter lake of stetson university college of law in florida said the u s  supreme court has taken a narrow view of the meaning of  sex  under the law  but in recent years lower courts have been more likely to defer to the obama administration s broader definition   my sense is a certain momentum is building for broader protection of  lgbt  rights  and we might be seeing a moment of federal civil rights law in long term transition   lake said  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment
