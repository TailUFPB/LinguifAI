taipei  reuters    before getting too carried away with taiwan s elevated status under a donald trump presidency  president tsai ing wen might want to check her bank balance  trump s suggestion that the  one china  principle   that taiwan is a part of china   was up for negotiation has already prompted saber rattling from chinese state media and some in the military establishment   taipei s ability to mitigate any military action by china will be severely limited by its weak economy and a tiny domestic arms industry that will take years to build up  and even if the united states   taiwan s sole arms supplier   agrees to sell the advanced weaponry the island needs to deter a chinese attack  taipei will struggle to pay the bill  government advisers and experts say   the trend in defense spending is a  slow rise    said chieh chung  a long time defense expert and researcher with the national policy foundation in taipei  a think tank   there isn t a lot of flexibility in government finances   the ability of taiwan to defend itself  and the willingness of the united states to help it  have been brought into sharp relief since president elect trump accepted an unprecedented phone call from president tsai early this month   tsai has never conceded the  one china  principle and beijing has never renounced the use of force to take back what it deems a wayward province  particularly if taiwan makes moves toward independence  despite that threat  taiwan has spent less than  percent of its half a trillion dollar economy on its defense needs in recent years  leaving it woefully unable to match a free spending china militarily  u s  based think tank the rand corporation said in a research report last year the united states would find it far more challenging to come to taiwan s aid in the event of an attack now compared to two decades ago  due to rapid advances in chinese capabilities  in   only two u s  air wings would have been need to achieve air superiority at the outset of a conflict  but by  that rises to   the report said  selling arms might be more palatable  and there is certainly a need  two of taiwan s four submarines date to world war two  while the two other dutch built boats have been in service for nearly  years   but chieh estimates submarines would cost taiwan more than   billion each  requiring a special budget fundraising via government bonds   a more expensive prospect in a rising interest rate environment   any arms sale would also risk provoking beijing  retired major general luo yuan  a widely read chinese military figure  told hong kong s phoenix television on monday that taiwan buying u s  arms could be considered a hostile act   if you want to buy one set of anti missile systems from the united states  then we ll set up four in response on the other side of the taiwan strait  so that you will know pain  that you can t buy security  and that what you re actually buying is danger   he said  buying big ticket items like subs would also be a tough sell at home because tsai has made developing an indigenous defense industry a key policy plank to create jobs and pump up the sluggish economy  currently growing at less than  percent  taiwan has previously developed its own missiles and also manufactured over  of its own fighter jets in the  before the program withered  the navy has just begun programs to build a few small warships  and next on taiwan s list are submarines and advanced jet trainers  but critics say it will take years to build a battle ready fleet  costs would likely be higher than buying second hand equipment and there is almost no export market to sustain programs for taiwanese defense goods     taiwan s reliance on the united states is therefore key   beijing knows that we have obligations to help taiwan defend itself and resist coercion  as enshrined in the taiwan relations act  and that we make decisions about our defense relationship with taiwan based on the threat that china poses   said daniel blumenthal  director of asian studies at the american enterprise institute  and a former u s  defense official    trump s campaign rhetoric  however  indicated he may be less likely to go to war over someone else s defense while recent comments suggest taiwan may be a pawn in his trade negotiations with china   madeleine bordallo  a member of the u s  house of representatives armed services committee  says throwing china a  curve ball  will make beijing think twice about issues such as taiwan   bordallo backed a defense bill supporting senior military exchanges between the united states and taiwan that was approved by congress this month   i believe that different types of engagement with taiwan offer us a way to throw that curve ball in the coming years   she told an audience at a security conference in taipei this week   further engagement with taiwan is important to achieving the strategic goal           taiwan dollars
