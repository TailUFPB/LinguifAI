washington  reuters    donald trump pulled off one of the biggest upsets in american political history when he toppled hillary clinton in the u s  presidential election on tuesday   and he did it using far less cash than his rival      relying heavily on an unorthodox mix of social media  unfiltered rhetoric  and a knack for winning free tv time  the new york real estate businessman likely paid less than   per vote during his insurgent white house bid  about half what clinton paid  according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance records and voting data  those figures assume the candidates spent all the funds they raised      trump s cost effective win has upended prevailing concepts about the influence of money in american politics and raised the question of whether a lean  media savvy campaign can become the new model for winning office in the united states      political strategists and academics tend to agree  however  that trump s performance would be tough to repeat  a household name for his luxury brand resorts  reality tv stardom  and ability to surround himself with non stop controversy  trump held advantages that many political candidates lack       i think this is a case where trump had unique characteristics as a candidate that allowed him to pursue a different type of strategy   said tony corrado  a professor of government at colby college in maine       in total  trump raised at least   million since launching his campaign in june   a little more than a third of the money that obama s re election campaign spent in   according to the most recent filings with the federal elections commission   with vote counting wrapping up in the early hours of wednesday  trump had won some  million votes nationwide in the general election  that amounts to less than   per vote for the   million he spent      according to data analytics firm mediaquant  trump garnered about   billion worth of free media coverage during the election campaign  more than twice the amount earned by clinton  a lifelong politician who served as secretary of state  senator  and first lady at different times in her career      mediaquant adds up all the unpaid coverage the candidates earn in newspapers  magazines and social media and then compares the sum to what a comparable amount of coverage  with the same kind of reach  would have cost in advertising       trump has also frequently dominated news cycles with provocative rhetoric that breaks taboos  including unabashed insults targeting women he dislikes over twitter  or unusual policy proscriptions like his call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country to prevent domestic attacks  or to force mexico to pay for a multi billion dollar border wall to keep out immigrants      trump made his self funding a selling point early in his campaign as he fended off  republican rivals for the party nomination  arguing that by eschewing big donors he was not beholden to special interests       but once he secured the nomination  trump changed course and began fundraising in earnest  replicating the small dollar fundraising juggernaut of another insurgent candidate  democrat bernie sanders  along the way          clinton raised at least   million  according to filings           the former secretary of state stuck to the more traditional campaigning model of launching expensive television ads and funding hundreds of staffers who fanned across the country to work to increase voter turnout on election day       she spent more than   million on television ads and more than   million on hundreds of staffers      she also benefited from spending by the super pacs supporting her candidacy  which are allowed to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money but cannot coordinate directly with the campaign  more than a dozen people  including hedge fund magnate donald sussman and global financier george soros  wrote multi million checks to priorities usa  the primary pac supporting her campaign  according to filings      michael traugott  a political science professor at the university of michigan  said the traditional u s  model for picking presidents might seem odd to people in other nations  where campaigns are shorter and require less cash       the system is clearly broken   traugott said
