washington  reuters    most of the u s  coal industry doubts donald trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt cheap natural gas  a competing fuel   but a small sub section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal   a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants   is gearing up for a trump inspired boom  that s because the republican president elect has promised a spending surge for roads  bridges and tunnels after he takes office on jan    a push to upgrade america s infrastructure with the support of leading democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from american steel mills  prices for met coal  as it is called  have already risen in recent months on lower supply from china   this is the best news that appalachia as a whole has had in about  years   said jason bostic  a vice president at the west virginia coal association  referring to trump s infrastructure agenda   suddenly there s a little bit of hope here   corsa coal corp  a producer of met coal based in pennsylvania  was already encouraged by the china driven price spike before trump s victory  now it believes u s  politics are going its way too   the thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending   said george dethlefsen  corsa s chief executive   all those things are very energy  and steel intensive  and that s good for our business   the company  plans to boost its production of met coal by  percent in  to around   million short tons  in the meantime  it is putting mines on a six day a week schedule  up from four days  and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift  which it normally reserves for maintenance  arch coal inc  which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants  said it was also optimistic about trump  particularly his promise to roll back regulations  but other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem  plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom  national production figures for met coal are unavailable  since the government does not break the data out  but total u s  coal production has fallen to its lowest level since   costing the industry thousands of jobs  as low natural gas prices and president barack obama s emissions and water regulations took their toll  met coal prices  however  reflect the coal sector s only major sign of life this year  they have risen to above   a metric ton this month from lows of   a ton in february  driven in part by china reducing its output  corsa and arch are among a very small number of u s  met coal producers that are publicly traded  with most of the others small and privately owned  alpha natural resources  which emerged from bankruptcy in july  declined to comment   trump s transition team is weighing an  infrastructure bank  to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation  a trump adviser said this week  democrats  including senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi  have indicated they hope to work quickly with trump on infrastructure  but whether they will succeed is far from certain  as many republicans oppose spending bills  ramaco  a private company  announced in september it will open two met coal mines in west virginia and virginia next year  thanks to   million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward  randy atkins  the chairman and chief executive of ramaco  said adding new mines was possible if trump s u s  infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them  banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies   including arch and peabody energy corp   and the weak financial conditions of others  atkins said  jim truman  the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group wood mackenzie  said the specialized workers that would be required  such as underground electricians  could also be hard to find given coal s downturn since   phil smith  a spokesman for the united mine workers of america  said the other key to the u s  met coal industry s outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on american made steel and coal as trump has promised   if we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal  then it won t make any difference for american miners   smith said
