simi valley  calif   reuters    the u s  arms industry is ready and capable of boosting production of new ships if president elect donald trump makes good his vow to expand the u s  navy to  ships  chief of naval operations admiral john richardson told reuters  shifting the current target of  ships upwards would be  remarkably easy  as long as there is funding to pay the bill  the top uniformed navy official said in an interview at the annual reagan national defense forum in southern california   if it s resourced  it s a matter of working closely with the industrial base  and they definitely are ready to do that   he said  adding the only limiting factor would be hiring and training workers to build the new ships   if i do not have that capacity  i can create it faster than you can appropriate the money   mike petters  chief executive of huntington ingalls industries inc  hii n   the largest u s  military shipbuilder  said in a separate interview with reuters   trump promised during his u s  election campaign to expand the navy to  ships  although lawmakers and military officials caution that any such boost would require big increases in staffing  training  maintenance and infrastructure  richardson said the incoming administration could smooth the way toward the increase by submitting a supplemental budget for fiscal   which ends sept     it seems to me that if you want to get something done  you get started   all eyes are on the funding for an expansion under the shadow of sequestration  the self imposed u s  spending cap   the question is  can you get rid of sequestration  because that is going to cloud everybody s judgment on how fast do i invest  how fast do i build that capacity   petters said  navy officials were still calculating how much it would cost to expand the navy to  ships from around  now  but it would depend on the mix of ships and related costs  a supplemental budget request could include munitions  aircraft  and other equipment that can be bought on short notice  followed by later orders for submarines  destroyers  amphibious ships and potentially even carriers  richardson said   if you build those closer together  you get economic order quantities  the learning curve gets to be a much more relevant thing and the cost starts to drive down   he said  building two carriers at a time would potentially save about   billion  petters said
