washington  reuters    the top u s  intelligence official said on thursday he was  even more resolute  in his belief that russia staged cyber attacks on democrats during the  election campaign  rebuking persistent skepticism from republican president elect donald trump about whether moscow was involved  james clapper  the director of national intelligence  said he had a very high level of confidence that russia hacked democratic party and campaign staff email  and disseminated propaganda and fake news aimed at the nov   election   our assessment now is even more resolute than it was  on oct   when the government first publicly accused russia  clapper told a hearing of the senate armed services committee  he said motives for the attack would be made public next week  trump on thursday morning called himself a  big fan  of intelligence agencies  but he has cast doubt on their assessments that russia targeted the campaign of his opponent  former secretary of state hillary clinton  drawing ire from his fellow republicans as well as democrats who are wary of moscow and distrust trump s praise of russian president vladimir putin  the intelligence officials at thursday s hearing said they worried a lack of support from atop the government could prompt valued staff members to leave their agencies   there s a difference between healthy skepticism     and disparagement   clapper said  vice president elect mike pence has used the expression  healthy skepticism  to defend trump s criticism of intelligence findings  central intelligence agency director john brennan  speaking at the university of chicago institute of politics on thursday  said that because trump had never served in government  he was unfamiliar with the intelligence profession   it doesn t bother me if someone is going to be skeptical and challenge our work and maybe disagree with our views  but i expect that the president of the united states will recognize that the cia and intelligence community were established by statute for a very important reason    the congressional hearing was overseen by republican senator john mccain  a vociferous russia critic  it was the first in a promised series of briefings and hearings on allegations that russia tried to disrupt or influence the u s  campaign  one of the most bitter in recent history  moscow denies the allegations  mccain told reporters that senator lindsey graham  also a vocal critic of moscow  would chair a new armed services subcommittee dedicated to cyber issues  trump will be briefed by intelligence agency chiefs on friday on the hacks  president barack obama received a report on the matter on thursday  an unclassified version will be made public early next week   i don t think we ve ever encountered a more aggressive or direct campaign to interfere in our election process than we ve seen in this case   said clapper  who leaves when trump becomes president on jan    clapper stopped short of declaring russia s actions  an act of war   saying that determination was beyond the scope of his office  clapper and the two other officials who testified  national security agency director admiral mike rogers  and marcel lettre  undersecretary of defense for intelligence  did not say what made u s  intelligence confident russia was behind the cyber attacks  a conclusion also reached by several private firms  obama last week ordered the expulsion of  suspected russian spies and imposed sanctions on two russian intelligence agencies he said were involved in hacking u s  political groups such as the democratic national committee  the cia has identified russian officials who fed material hacked from the dnc and democratic party leaders to wikileaks at putin s direction through third parties  according to a new u s  intelligence report  senior u s  officials said   documents stolen from the dnc and clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  were posted on the internet before the election  embarrassing the campaign  in a tweet on wednesday  trump was skeptical about a russian role in the affair  writing    wikileaks founder  julian assange said  a  year old could have hacked podesta    why was dnc so careless  also said the russians did not give him the info   but on thursday  trump said in another twitter post that he was not against intelligence agencies or in agreement with assange   the media lies to make it look like i am against  intelligence  when in fact i am a big fan   trump tweeted  clapper said assange had put american lives in danger and deserved no credibility  mccain and other lawmakers also blasted assange  senator claire mccaskill  a democrat  said there would be  howls  from republicans if a democrat described intelligence officials as trump had  u s  intelligence officials have said russian cyber attacks were specifically aimed at helping trump beat clinton  several republicans have acknowledged the russian hacking but have not linked it to an effort to help trump win  trump and top advisers believe democrats are trying to delegitimize his victory by accusing russia of helping him   senator tim kaine  an armed services member who was clinton s vice presidential running mate  said   it is my hope that this congress is willing to stand in a bipartisan way for the integrity of the electoral process   graham said obama s actions against moscow fell short   i think what obama did was throw a pebble  i m ready to throw a rock   graham said   putin is up to no good and he better be stopped
