new york  reuters    u s  senator bernie sanders is set to throw his support behind fellow democrat hillary clinton s bid for the white house on tuesday  a boost for the former secretary of state as she prepares to face off with republican rival donald trump in the nov   presidential election  an endorsement from sanders would end a bitterly fought battle for the democratic nomination that split the party over education  healthcare and climate change  and comes after clinton offered sanders a handful of policy concessions on those issues in recent weeks  at a rally in new hampshire on tuesday  the pair will appear together to discuss a shared  commitment to building an america that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone  not just those at the top   according to statements released monday by both campaigns   sanders campaign manager jeff weaver would not confirm whether sanders would formally endorse clinton on tuesday but said the rally will be the first of many in which sanders will  be out there stumping for the democratic nominee   sanders had been under pressure for weeks from democratic party officials to throw his weight behind clinton after she locked up the required number of delegates last month with a string of wins in state by state primary contests  but had resisted  citing policy differences  clinton needs sanders  supporters to boost her chances against trump in her run for the white house  only about  percent of sanders  supporters say they would vote for her  according to recent reuters ipsos polling   weaver said that despite sanders backing of clinton  he would likely still press on with his efforts to reform the democratic party nominating process after a contentious primary season  pushing to open primaries to independent voters and change the roles of superdelegates  party stalwarts who can support a nominee of their choosing regardless of how people voted in their districts  in the past few weeks  both camps have been in regular contact on how to bring clinton closer to some of sanders  progressive stances on issues like wealth inequality  trade  healthcare  education  and the environment in an effort to unify the party  but some sanders  supporters are not fully satisfied by clinton s concessions on the party platform   most of which centered on education and healthcare   suggesting there may be some room for friction at the democratic national convention later this month where clinton is set to be formally nominated   this is a platform clearly influenced by bernie sanders   said james zogby  the president of the arab american institute and a sanders appointee to the party s platform drafting committee       but  he added   there were several areas where the clinton campaign lost an opportunity to not only reach out to the sanders base but to also to make a dramatic statement to the american people in general that would have gone a long way in helping her demonstrate that she will be a different kind of candidate   he said   for example  he said  the party could have used stronger language in its policy platform draft to condemn the trans pacific partnership trade agreement  which sanders has argued would hurt american workers and which clinton has also vocally opposed  sanders  challenge to clinton  one of the best known figures in u s  politics  lasted far longer than expected  running for four months and across  states and yielding record numbers of small donations to his campaign   he has previously vowed to help clinton defeat trump but has been reluctant to end his campaign  and has come short of making a formal endorsement even as other prominent democrats have rallied around her  including president barack obama  vice president joe biden and u s  senator elizabeth warren  a favorite of the party s liberal wing  on monday  the communications workers of america endorsed clinton  after having earlier endorsed sanders
