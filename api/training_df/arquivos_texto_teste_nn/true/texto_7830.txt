new york  reuters    kerry woolard  the  year old manager of trump winery in charlottesville  virginia  went online in june and made her first political contribution  a   donation to the campaign of her boss  republican presidential nominee donald trump  woolard s donation was unusual  only a dozen of an estimated   people employed at trump s companies have donated more than   to the celebrity businessman s bid for the u s  presidency  a reuters review of federal campaign finance records through august shows  those who gave less to either trump s campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review   the contributors  including an office cleaner  a golf course groundskeeper  a bartender and an attorney  have given    to trump s campaign  a fraction of the   million trump s political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers  an employee at trump enterprises gave   to the campaign of her employer s democratic rival  hillary clinton  a  trump employee  a lawyer at the trump organization  contributed to a trump super pac  giving      honestly  i wish i could do more   said woolard  who addressed the republican national convention in july and has attended private dinners with trump  his wife melania  and their son  barron   he is an amazing boss  has been a great leader and i believe would do a great job for our country   trump has made his business record central to his campaign  he often speaks about the thousands of jobs he has created and portrays himself as a dealmaker who drove hard bargains and avoided paying taxes to benefit his company  his family and his employees   those employees may vote for trump on nov    and could be supporting his candidacy with smaller dollar contributions that do not appear on the filings  but when it comes to putting more significant money toward trump s candidacy  his workers have shown little inclination to support their boss         that stands in stark contrast to the  election  when mitt romney  also an affluent businessman  was the republican nominee  employees at the private equity firm romney led and then retired from in   bain capital  and a separate company for which he worked  bain   company  donated nearly    directly to his campaign and through joint fundraising committees during a comparable period in the election cycle  fec records show  bain capital employees gave an additional    million to romney s super pac  clinton received    directly to her campaign and through her joint fundraising committee from employees at the state department  where she served as secretary of state from  until   according to fec filings through august  no state department employee has given so far to clinton s super pac  a spokeswoman for the trump campaign  hope hicks  said in an emailed statement   mr  trump has self funded the majority of his campaign so the comparison is not realistic    a trump organization spokeswoman said   while the trump organization is not political  there has been tremendous excitement and support for mr  trump from his employees  those that know firsthand he is an incredible leader   after vowing to self fund his campaign   and spending   million of his own money to defeat his primary challengers   trump changed course once he secured the republican nomination  of the   million he raised   percent came from people who gave   or less directly to his campaign   a study published in september of companies on the standard   poor s   stock market index found that employees  political donations typically mirror those of their chief executive officers   the study  conducted by business and finance professors at arizona state university  bocconi university in milan and the swiss finance institute in zurich  found workers donated almost three times more money to candidates supported by their ceos  the influence of the chief executives was particularly pronounced at firms that explicitly advocate for political campaigns  reuters cross referenced trump s federal financial disclosure records  which lists him as controlling more than  entities  including some based overseas  with fec campaign finance data   the fec requires that political campaigns disclose the identities  addresses and employers of anyone who contributes   or more to super pacs  a campaign or a joint fundraising committee  which typically coordinates fundraising between a political campaign and the party s central organizing body  the estimate of trump s total employees     comes from financial data intelligence provider privco and includes some entities abroad  federal election law stipulates that permanent residents and american citizens  including those working outside the united states  can donate to political campaigns  but foreign nationals working for trump operations either in the united states or abroad cannot  six of the  people who said they worked for trump on campaign donation forms did not respond to multiple requests for comment on their home and business phones   two had phone numbers that are not in service  according to a background search database  one confirmed his employment and donation before hanging up the phone  another confirmed her donation but said she needed clearance from the trump organization to comment     the only two who discussed their donations with reuters were woolard  the trump winery manager  and fred laderer  an  year old employee at trump national golf club in north carolina  laderer made two donations to republican political entities  of which   was earmarked for the trump campaign   laderer  who schedules start times for golfers  said since trump took over the north carolina club  it s a much better place to work  the members are much happier    still  he added that he didn t donate to trump s campaign because he works for the candidate  but because  clinton would bring a lot of bad luggage
