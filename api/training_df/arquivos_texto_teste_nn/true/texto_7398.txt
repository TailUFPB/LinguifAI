washington  reuters    republican donald trump s presidential election victory all but dooms major obama administration initiatives that are already tied up in legal challenges and gives him the chance to appoint a pivotal fifth conservative justice on the u s  supreme court  democratic president barack obama s signature  healthcare law  his plan to combat climate change  his executive action on immigration  his transgender rights policy and other issues were challenged in court by republicans and industry groups   for a graphic on legal challenges to major obama initiatives click tmsnrt rs   a trump administration could decide no longer to defend the policies in court after trump takes office on jan    in addition  trump and the incoming republican led congress could simply repeal or rescind obama s policies  as they have promised  trump s supreme court appointment  possibly the first of multiple picks  would allow him to restore the decades long conservative majority on the bench  which looked under threat when conservative justice antonin scalia died in february  the shorthanded court currently is split with four conservatives and four liberals  conservative activists may be emboldened to bring cases urging the court to support gun rights  uphold abortion restrictions and rule for religious rights   if you have a conservative court  you are going to have more conservative decisions   said kerri kupec  a lawyer with the alliance defending freedom  a conservative christian legal group involved in religious rights cases  one issue the court could take up in the near term is whether business owners who oppose same sex marriage can object on religious grounds to providing services to gay couples  one dispute concerns a baker in colorado  while another involves a florist in washington state  in the labor context  the high court could also revisit whether states can force nonunion workers to pay unions for collective bargaining activities  the court split   on the issue in march  just after scalia s death  in a loss for conservative groups challenging the practice  liberal hopes of gaining a majority on the supreme court for the first time in decades lasted almost nine months  from scalia s death on feb   to tuesday night  in a vindication of republican senate leader mitch mcconnell s decision  with little precedent in u s  history  to take no action on obama s nominee to replace scalia  appeals court judge merrick garland  trump is now poised to nominate a new justice as soon as he takes office  his nominee would be considered for confirmation by a republican controlled senate under mcconnell  trump may also be able to make further appointments to the court  with three justices  or older  including  year old liberal ruth bader ginsburg  whom trump called on to resign in july after she called him a  faker  and speculated about the possibility of moving to new zealand if he won the white house  fellow liberal stephen breyer is   while conservative anthony kennedy is   if trump is able to replace ginsburg or another liberal justice during his presidency  the court s conservative wing would be further strengthened  such a majority  could be a threat to important rights that have been protected in the past by the supreme court   said elizabeth wydra  president of the constitutional accountability center  a liberal legal group  she cited abortion rights and efforts at ensuring racial equality as examples  a conservative court  as it was with scalia on the bench   would likely be favorable toward gun rights  skeptical of abortion and supportive of the death penalty  if democrat hillary clinton had won tuesday s election  liberals may have been emboldened to challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and seek gun restrictions and limits on campaign spending  among other things   trump has already issued a list of  judges  mainly federal judges appointed by president george w  bush and state court judges  he said he would consider to fill scalia s vacancy  all have conservative credentials on such issues as abortion  birth control and gun rights  the case that could be affected soonest by trump s win  involves transgender rights  the court on oct   took up a case concerning a female born transgender high school student named gavin grimm  who identifies as male and sued in  to win the right to use the school s boys  bathroom  grimm is backed by the obama administration  no date has been set for the argument in the case  the court could potentially delay acting until it has nine justices  a ruling could resolve similar litigation around the country over an obama administration directive saying schools should allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choosing  trump has said he would rescind the obama directive  he also has said he would rescind obama s executive action to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits  which was put on hold by the courts while the administration fights to revive it  trump would be expected to overturn major regulations put in place under obama  including the clean power plan to curb greenhouse emissions mainly from coal fired power plants  that process takes time  meaning the supreme court could potentially rule on a legal challenge to the clean power plan before trump can dump it  the case is pending before an appeals court in washington  the republican congress under trump could now seek to repeal obama s signature healthcare law  the affordable care act  but even if it does not  a republican legal challenge that could cripple the law is pending before a federal appeals court in washington
