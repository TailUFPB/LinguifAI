  corrects this nov   to clarify details of bolton s recess appointment  paragraph    by warren strobel and john walcott washington  reuters    despite his professed opposition to the  u s  invasion of iraq  president elect donald trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration  according to republican officials  among those who could find places on trump s team are former top state department official john bolton and ex cia director james woolsey  both men championed the iraq invasion  which many analysts have called one of the major u s  foreign policy debacles of modern times  also involved in transition planning for trump s presidency is frederick fleitz  a top aide to bolton who earlier worked at the cia unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on iraq s weapons of mass destruction programs  although it is impossible to predict how a trump foreign policy might evolve  one u s  official who has served in iraq said advocates of the  invasion might be more inclined to commit additional u s  forces to the fight against islamic state there  despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects americans from iraqi legal action  paul pillar  the top u s  intelligence official for the near east from  to   said that because trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue  the republican president elect s senior personnel appointments would be crucial   what we re seeing going on   and we should be worried about it   is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map   said pillar  now at georgetown university   thus  the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does     bolton  who is under consideration as trump s secretary of state  the officials said  and woolsey  reported to be in the running for u s  director of national intelligence  did not respond to requests for comment  the trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment even if bolton is nominated  senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion  in   senate democrats   with the support of a single republican   blocked a vote to confirm him as u s  ambassador to the united nations  he was appointed to that post by republican president george w  bush while the senate was in recess  fleitz  in a brief phone conversation  confirmed he was involved in trump s transition effort  but declined further comment   a return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other  neoconservatives  who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of iraq  during the presidential campaign  some leading neoconservatives and republican foreign policy veterans opposed trump  saying he was unfit to lead  the group saw its clout wane in bush s second term  as u s  troops in iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war  and has watched from the sidelines during democratic president barack obama s eight years in power  trump  who takes office on jan    has said he opposed the invasion of iraq  in which more than   u s  troops and hundreds of thousands of iraqis died  and which led to the creation of al qaeda in iraq  the forerunner to the violent  ultra hardline islamic state group  iraqi dictator saddam hussein s weapons of mass destruction and ties to al qaeda  used to justify the invasion  proved to be nonexistent    as you know  for years i ve been saying   don t go into iraq   they went into iraq  they destabilized the middle east  it was a big mistake   trump said in august  on nbc s  meet the press  program  his account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by democratic rival hillary clinton  who cited a  interview trump gave to radio host howard stern in which he replied   yeah i guess so  when asked if he supported invading iraq  consideration of bolton  woolsey and others is  another demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in american foreign policy have not been   they don t seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the washington foreign policy dialogue   pillar said
