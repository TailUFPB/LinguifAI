 reuters    president donald trump opened the door on tuesday to a broad overhaul of the u s  immigration system and vowed to pursue massive tax relief for the middle class in a speech to congress as he sought to rebound from a chaotic start to his presidency      trump said he was open to a broad overhaul of the u s  immigration system  a shift from his hardline campaign rhetoric  he emphasized his desire to focus on problems at home by boosting the u s  economy with tax reform  a   trillion infrastructure effort and an overhaul of president barack obama s signature healthcare law  known as obamacare     brian reynolds  chief market strategist  new albion partners  new york  the speech showed the softer side of the president  but i think the media had let investors know this would be the case  so no surprise for markets on that front   the speech lacked specifics as it related to financial markets  again i don t think that is a surprise   with no surprises and few financial specifics  it is likely that equity investors will focus on how many of his themes can be passed by congress given how late it is getting in the legislative calendar  skepticism over the likelihood of policy enactment may create a brief pullback in stocks at some point   there was nothing in the speech  or in the president s agenda  that is likely to alter the behavior of corporate bond investors  who have been driving this equity bull market for eight years via debt fueled buybacks  they bought a strong   billion of new corporate bonds on tuesday in advance of the speech  and they will likely be back at work on wednesday  putting their cash flows to work  i believe that these flows are likely to keep any stock market pullback brief and shallow   bucky hellwig  senior vice president  bb t wealth management  birmingham  alabama   the speech was a summary of trump s policies   stocks could move higher tomorrow as nothing has changed and stock investors are still expecting infrastructure build out  tax and regulatory relief  and changes in affordable care  but the timetable has not been clarified for these  republican constituents may pressure congress to step up the pace in moving the trump agenda forward   some specifics  pressure on drug margins  completion across state lines for healthcare organizations  military expenditures increasing   but nothing new here   fed policy will get more attention this week and next   manufacturing pmi tomorrow and employment report next friday  march   will be watched   yellen will be speaking this friday   fed funds futures showing a higher probability of  an increase at the fomc march  meeting   j j  feldman  portfolio manager at miracle mile advisors in la   there was nothing really new   he said   it was a good speech in that it was more uniting than divisive but from the market perspective it was status quo    this probably wasn t the venue but if new details on tax reform are not coming soon there s going to be disappointment for sure   juan perez  senior currency strategist  tempus consulting  washington   trump said a lot of things that are positive for financial markets such as spending a huge amount for infrastructure  overall there were no real surprises as these are pronouncements that we have heard before  however  i expect that market gains from his speech would be subdued by the continued tone of protectionism in his statements  anytime  you attack trade deals as trump did  the market gets nervous   paul christopher  head global market strategist  at wells fargo investment institute in st  louis  mo    i was impressed though  or at least relieved  that it wasn t like his inauguration speech  it wasn t a challenge or a gauntlet thrown down to the opposition or to other countries  it was a speech that was more balanced and more presidential sounding    but even as a state of the union address  which it sounded a lot like  it wasn t very specific  it especially and could have and didn t prioritize all of these different things he was talking about  some of the policies are going to be very expensive   a trillion dollars for infrastructure    billion a year  extra defense spending   the budget may not have room for all of that    he didn t talk at all about how they were going to fund any of that  he also didn t talk about tax reform  which i expected he would give congress some marching orders in terms of what he wants   he hardly said anything about tax reform    he talked about the affordable care act but again he didn t talk about any of the directives of are we going to repeal and replace now or repeal and replace later  he did say he wanted continuity but moderate republicans are not convinced the conservative republicans have that as a priority  so it may be even difficult to pass the aca repeal in this budget bill    he was effective at reaching out to the other side  he was effective at times in being able to connect items  for example  connecting education as the way to break the cycle of poverty and then morphing or transitioning into violent crime and cutting down on that  those were effective points and effective transitions   but again not enough detail for investors and certainly the markets were chopping around while he was speaking  it wasn t a big market mover and we still have to wait for the details  i don t think we are going to see much change    there is no reason to sell  he didn t throw water on any of the agenda  he simply didn t clarify it any    i think the market is going to be positive  the market continues to see him as a good for business president  he s very pragmatic when it comes to business  in terms of getting these grand visions done  i don t think the market gives so much importance to that  when he spoke about cost cutting  that immediately resonates with everyone on wall street  that s easy stuff  that s low hanging fruit  it s really hard to grow revenues  but it s really easy to cut costs  there is so much fat  it s so over regulated  this is easy stuff  he said enough of that during the speech that he will resonate well   i think some people were probably looking for some meat on the bones  he definitely covered everything  it was more of a laundry list  there wasn t a lot of details   to me  the tax reform is something everybody wants  repatriation of money abroad is something that ever wants  why not take care of those and then take care of the dicey things  like obamacare and immigration   omer esiner  chief market analyst at commonwealth foreign exchange in washington dc   trump s  mention of historic treaties and nato specifically was reassuring for our allies globally  and in that sense it was probably reassuring for global financial markets as well     the speech  was still probably light on actual details on the fiscal side of things  we got mention of a trillion dollar infrastructure spending package  i think it s very early so i wouldn t necessarily hang my hat on that number  it was largely absent of any major focus on the tax side of things  in terms of overall details  on the fiscal side of the equation  it was probably pretty light  but i think despite that on some level the market might be reassured by the more or less balanced tone of the speech  it was much more presidential than some of the previous speeches and commentary we ve gotten from the president   paul nolte  portfolio manager at kingsview asset management in chicago  the devil is going to be in the details and i think that s why you didn t see the futures move too terribly much  the markets are still  show me what you are going to do  how is this all going to work and how are we paying for it  that s going to take probably a couple weeks to a couple months to get laid out    everybody is looking for more details and we re still waiting     i think expectations right now are really high all the way around and it s going to be a process  we re going to have to wait to see some of this develop   steve massocca  senior vice president at wedbush securities in san francisco   i thought it went pretty well  certainly no land mines or explosions    from an investor s perspective there was no new information  no surprises good or bad  from the perspective of where money goes tomorrow  i don t see what we have learned that s new or different      but he burnished his image  so there s a positive there  he s a pro business president so that s a good thing   randy frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for charles schwab in austin  texas  he pretty much didn t say anything he hadn t said before so markets have no reason to react overly positively or overly negatively     would the market have liked details sure  but i don t think it was expecting them     if anything the market might move moderately higher tomorrow  it pulled back moderately today  the uptick in volatility today was a preparation for the potential for a downside move     it was a little bit of hedging going on before an event that could move the market    a key focus for wednesday will be personal consumption expenditures  a key inflationary measure that the u s  federal reserve watches  frederick said  brian jacobsen  chief portfolio strategist at wells fargo funds management in menomonee falls  wisconsin    he was surprisingly detailed about what to replace obamacare with  it s likely congress will be able to take that up shortly as part of the  budget and then quickly pivot to the  budget which will deal with tax reform  that plan is much less developed  but he has time   on taxes  jacobsen said   every deduction and credit that would need to be eliminated to lower tax rates in a budget neutral way has strong defenders  that s how those deductions and credits got there  so  we ll just have to watch and wait to see which special interests president trump will take on   tim ghriskey  chief investment officer of solaris group in bedford hills  new york   it seemed to be a somewhat kinder and gentler trump  he wasn t attacking individuals like he often does    this remains a very pro growth agenda and the markets like that  but i didn t hear anything new that would make it necessarily move ahead  except that he stuck to his guns to make his agenda items happen   stocks  u s  stock futures were stronger at the start of trump s address  with major indices   percent higher  they eased those gains as he spoke  with the s p  e mini futures last up   percent   bonds   u s  treasury futures  dipped slightly ahead of his speech  and were last down   percent  forex  the dollar erased its earlier gains in asia  with the market jittery as trump s speech was short on details on his economic stimulus  the dollar yen eased to around   yen jpy  from the day s high of   yen hit earlier  on hopes the federal reserve may raise interest rates this month
