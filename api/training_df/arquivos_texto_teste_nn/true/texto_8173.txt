washington  reuters    a house of representatives panel on tuesday approved a proposal to revamp the dodd frank wall street reform law  after a hearing where lawmakers verbally tussled over rules enacted in the aftermath of the   financial crisis  the financial services committee voted to send the bill  introduced this summer by committee chairman  republican jeb hensarling  to the full house to consider  no democrat on the committee voted for the measure  which would allow banks to choose between complying with dodd frank or meeting tougher capital requirements  it would also reorganize the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   a watchdog created through dodd frank that last week penalized wells fargo for creating millions of fake accounts under customers  names  the  dodd frank law  passed in the wake of the financial crisis  has drawn the ire of most banks and republicans in congress  they have said congress went too far in trying to clamp down on wall street and the law imposes burdensome requirements and gives regulators too much power  the cpfb has been a particular target for republicans  who do not like that it is governed by a single director and say it reaches beyond its authority in enforcement  during the hearing  democrats cited the wells case  where the cfpb levied its largest ever fine of   million  criticizing the panel s republican majority  democrats said that without dodd frank the u s  government would have had no tools to fight the widespread fraud  which led to the firing of   wells employees   i am particularly disturbed that this bill would take away the consumer financial protection bureau s ability to penalize companies for practices that are abusive to consumers   said new york s carolyn maloney  a democrat  echoing many in her party   the chairman s bill  strips   from the cfpb its authority to punish abusive conduct  which means wells fargo would have gotten off even easier   meanwhile  randy neugebauer  the texas republican who has advocated creating a five member commission to govern the cfpb  said the bureau has not been politically neutral and is not transparent   i remain concerned that many bureau actions demonstrate regulatory paternalism that assumes the american consumer doesn t know how to make choices for themselves   he said at the hearing  corresponding legislation has not been introduced in the senate  and obama would be unlikely to sign the bill even both chambers of the republican led congress passed it  dodd frank is one of the democratic president s signature pieces of legislation
