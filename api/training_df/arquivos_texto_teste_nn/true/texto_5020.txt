washington  reuters    the republican plan backed by president donald trump to overhaul the u s  healthcare system cleared its first hurdles in congress on thursday  but its chances for passage looked uncertain and top republicans scrambled to bring disgruntled conservatives aboard  in the face of opposition by democrats  healthcare providers and many conservatives  two house of representatives committees approved the legislation that would undo much of the  affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  moving it closer to a vote before the full house  the energy and commerce committee voted   along party lines  with democrats unified against it  to back the plan after marathon proceedings lasting  straight hours  hours earlier  the tax writing ways and means committee similarly voted   before dawn to approve it after working  straight hours  house speaker paul ryan sought to bolster support among  conservatives in his own party  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said fellow republicans must get in a  governing mode  while trump denied the bill was in trouble   despite what you hear in the press  healthcare is coming along great  we are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture   the republican president said on twitter  the bill would replace obamacare s income based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market  while ditching the obamacare expansion of the medicaid insurance program for the poor  it would also end penalties for not having insurance  though  insurers would be given permission to impose a  percent surcharge on customers who let their coverage lapse for more than two months and then seek to renew  hospital stocks  which has fallen after the plan was unveiled on monday  ended broadly higher on thursday  with tenet healthcare up   percent  shares of health insurers were mixed  with most large insurers modestly higher and medicaid focused insurers ending negative  including molina healthcare s   percent drop   while republicans have been itching for seven years to dismantle democratic former president barack obama s signature domestic policy achievement  the party has failed to coalesce behind the plan put forth by house republican leaders  republicans control the white house and both houses of congress for the first time in a decade  but passage of the legislation was not a foregone conclusion  conservative lawmakers and lobbying groups have lambasted it as too similar to obamacare  they have sharply criticized its proposed tax credits as an unacceptable new government entitlement program and have called for a quicker end to the obamacare medicaid expansion  the measure is the first major legislative test for trump and his fellow republicans amid questions about whether they can govern effectively after years spent as an opposition party under obama  ryan  with his shirt sleeves rolled up and using a video screen with facts and figures  held what he called a  townhall style  presentation for reporters on the proposal  but his intended audience appeared to be fellow republicans  and he said his party must  actually make good on our word    the time is now   said ryan  who long has been the target of criticism of some conservatives   this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing obamacare   ryan added  mcconnell had a similar message  saying   we need to get into a governing mode and start thinking about actually achieving something rather than just kind of sparring   democrats denounced the bill as a gift to the rich that would force millions of people off of insurance rolls  republicans said it was needed to roll back the government s  nanny state  role in the more than   trillion u s  healthcare system   trumpcare is a loser for just about all of america  unless you re in the top  percent   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said  the house budget committee next wednesday is due to merge the provisions approved by the two committees into one bill to be voted on by the full house before it goes to the senate  republican leaders are eyeing april for congressional passage of the bill  in a series of tweets early on thursday  conservative republican senator tom cotton urged his house colleagues to pull back  saying their measure could not pass the senate without major changes   what matters in long run is better  more affordable health care for americans  not house leaders  arbitrary legislative calendar   cotton wrote  but white house spokesman sean spicer expressed confidence in the legislation s prospects   we re not jamming this down people s throat   spicer said   this bill will land on the president s desk  he will sign it  we will repeal obamacare   the brookings institution think tank forecast that the nonpartisan congressional budget office  expected early next week to release its closely watched assessment of the bill s cost and coverage implications  would conclude that at least  million people would lose health insurance  credit rating agency standard   poor s earlier estimated   million people could lose health insurance coverage  before the energy and commerce committee vote  conservatives at the request of the panel s chairman withdrew an amendment sponsored by republican joe barton that would move up by two years  to next jan    the end of the medicaid expansion  barton said he planned to try to offer the amendment on the house floor  committee chairman greg walden hailed the unanimity of republicans on the committee in approving the bill  obamacare enabled  million previously uninsured people to obtain coverage  about half came from the medicaid expansion  the bill s proposed changes in medicaid funding could hurt smaller  less diverse health insurers  fitch ratings said  and the unintended  unforeseen consequences of a bill this size are likely to create uncertainty for all health insurers   with doctors  hospitals  seniors  health plans  democrats  some governors and conservative republicans against the bill  it may not make it out of the house  mario molina  chief executive of managed care company molina healthcare  said in an interview   if it does  i think the senate is going to slow things down and really take a good look   molina said   we are going to have to hope that the senate is more moderate
