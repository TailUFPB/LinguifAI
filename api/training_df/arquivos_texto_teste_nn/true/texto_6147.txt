langley  va  washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump tried to ease tensions with the cia on saturday  telling officers he had their back after he had leveled unprecedented criticism against spy agencies for their investigation into russian hacking during the election  in his first official visit to a government agency as president  trump   who had said u s  intelligence tactics were reminiscent of nazi germany   sought to leave no doubt with officers that he supported their work  even so  some analysts said it would take more than a quick visit for trump to patch up relations with a community that he has denigrated  a large part of trump s off the cuff remarks on saturday were not related to the work of the cia  at times sounding more like a campaign rally than an address to intelligence professionals  trump made no mention of russia during his remarks  which included praise for his nominee to head the central intelligence agency  mike pompeo  a pledge to fight islamic state and a rant against the media  which he said invented his feud with intelligence agencies   very  very few people could do the job you people do and i want you to know i am so behind you   trump said  to cheers and loud applause from about  officers who packed the building s atrium to hear him speak  ahead of his inauguration  trump had harshly criticized intelligence officials after they concluded that russian president vladimir putin directed hackers to breach democratic emails to try to boost trump s presidential election campaign  he has since accepted those conclusions  then  after leaks about an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a private security firm suggesting moscow had compromising information about him  trump blamed intelligence agencies for using nazi like tactics   drawing a rebuke from outgoing cia director john brennan  trump has said he wants to try to work with moscow to fight islamic state militants and reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons  he said reporters made up the tension between him and the cia   i have a running war with the media  they are among the most dishonest people on earth   trump said   they made it sound like i had a feud with the intelligence people   trump also slammed media for showing images of  an empty field  from his inauguration on the national mall while he claimed that the crowd  went all the way back to the washington monument   and he called out by name a reporter who had made an error in a white house press pool report  while trump has some support in the u s  intelligence community  his criticism over the russia issue eroded much of it  within the  agency intelligence community  there are widely shared concerns about the qualifications and judgment of trump  a businessman and television star who never before held public office  some veteran analysts who have spent their careers studying foreign dictators and autocrats have said they are troubled by trump s style  saying his negativity  egotism and appeals to nationalism are hallmarks of autocratic regimes   many people are asking whether we can serve under a president and national security adviser who ve expressed such contempt for the intelligence community  and one photo opportunity drive by on a saturday is not going to change that   said a veteran officer now working at cia headquarters after multiple assignments overseas  who spoke on condition of anonymity  paul pillar  a former top u s  intelligence analyst on the middle east  said trump s digressions during the speech show that  even when he is in their own building he can t be bothered to focus on their work   representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives  intelligence committee  said trump s speech in front of a memorial wall with stars representing cia personnel killed in action was  little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice   trump had originally hoped to swear in pompeo as his new cia chief during the visit to the spy agency  but the senate has not yet confirmed the kansas republican representative for the job  that vote is expected on monday  trump and pompeo received briefings at the cia headquarters before the president made remarks  trump vowed he would return to speak with officers again  he said fighting islamic state militants would be a priority for the agency  saying  radical islamic terrorism  had to be eradicated   we have not used the real abilities that we have  we ve been restrained   trump said  it was not immediately clear what he meant by restraints  during his campaign  trump pledged to bring back the use of waterboarding  a simulated drowning technique that former president barack obama had banned as torture  but pompeo and trump s new defense secretary  james mattis  have told congress they would oppose a return to the interrogation technique
