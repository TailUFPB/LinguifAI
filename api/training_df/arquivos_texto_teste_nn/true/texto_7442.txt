beijing  reuters    donald trump s upset election victory cracks open pressing strategic and economic questions in u s  china ties  and has likely surprised and worried chinese leaders  who prize stability in relations between the two powers  trump had lambasted china throughout the campaign  drumming up headlines with his pledges to slap  percent tariffs on imported chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator his first day in office  he has also questioned u s  security commitments to allies and undercut long held bipartisan u s  foreign policy norms  such as suggesting that japan develop nuclear weapons  all stances that if he follows through on could upset the regional security balance in asia  that unpredictability is not an ideal election outcome for china s stability obsessed communist party  especially as it seeks smooth u s  relations at a time of daunting reform challenges at home  a slowing economy  and a leadership reshuffle of its own that will put a new party elite around president xi jinping in late   beijing tends to prefer incumbent party successors with consistent policy lines  trump s lack of a governance track record and his unorthodox take on long held republican priorities could prove a headache for chinese officials  jia qingguo  the dean of the school of international relations at china s elite peking university and a government advisor  called trump  a symbol of uncertainty    china hopes the united states  future policy would be more certain because in this way  we can prepare and deal with it   jia said   double edged sword  certainly  a trump white house presents china with a range of new opportunities  decades of hillary clinton s criticism of china s human rights record and her insistence on u s  interests in the south china sea have made her a well known  and not well liked figure among beijing s ruling elite  chinese experts say some in beijing believe trump will prove a pragmatic businessman  willing to deal with china   any type of protectionist policy pursued will be a double edged sword   said ruan zongze  a former chinese diplomat now with the china institute of international studies  a think tank affiliated with the foreign ministry   i think he will be very careful about this   moreover  trump s criticism of u s  allies  including japan  for free riding on u s  security guarantees  has offered china the tantalizing prospect of an american retrenchment from asia   from a long term perspective  this gives china more space to prove itself and it takes off some of the pressure on china   said wang yiwei  director of the institute of international affairs at china s renmin university  but a u s  pullback in the region would raise other questions for beijing  such as the uncomfortable prospect of a potential japanese military expansion  while trump has vowed to build up the u s  military  in particular the navy  he has said little publicly about his approach to beijing s increasingly assertive role in the south china sea    trump s  foreign policy approach does seem to be somewhat inchoate and therefore much will depend on who he appoints and who is willing to serve   said dean cheng  a china expert at the heritage foundation in washington  the u s  and chinese business community alike has been unsettled at the prospect of a trump presidency  gloria liu  partner at law firm dla piper  which specializes in chinese mergers and acquisitions  said   the us has been the no   destination for outbound chinese investments  it s hard to see chinese firms making the us their first choice  at a minimum  there will be a period of wait and see   u s  business groups have grown more pessimistic about chinese restrictions on market barriers and state subsidized efforts to replace foreign technology with home grown products   but they also worry that trump s china tariff pledges will undermine the economic interdependence that helps the two countries weather serious security differences  executives are holding their breath   everybody is going to be asking who is the real donald trump and how much of this campaign rhetoric is going to find itself into reality   said randal phillips  who heads mintz group s office in beijing  a beijing based state energy executive involved in overseas investment said the market was  very worried  by trump s victory and selling for  risk aversion    trump increases the unpredictability in u s  policies over regulatory approvals  the likelihood of tighter scrutiny on chinese investment     and also over oil and gas exports   said the executive  who asked not to be named   james zimmerman  the head of the american chamber of commerce in china and a prominent clinton backer  said  talking tough is a lot easier than thinking tough and making tough decisions  which is what presidents actually have to do    isolating or penalizing china will not serve america s interests   he said in a statement  chinese president xi jinping congratulated donald trump on winning the u s  presidency  state tv reported on wednesday  telling him the two biggest economies in the world shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity   i place great importance on the china u s  relationship  and look forward to working with you to uphold the principles of non conflict  non confrontation  mutual respect and win win cooperation   xi told trump by phone
