columbus  ohio  reuters    donald trump s presidential candidacy has triggered anguished soul searching among many college educated and affluent republicans who must decide whether to back him  sit out the election  or do the unthinkable  vote for his opponent  hillary clinton  with less than two months to go before the nov   election  rural  white voters who lack a college degree have flocked to trump  but his brash style and lack of experience in government are a much tougher sell among well off republicans who have long been a backbone of the party  according to reuters ipsos polling and interviews with republican leaning white collar professionals  trump s hopes of capturing the white house may rest on whether he can win over enough of these voters in battleground states such as ohio  virginia and colorado to offset clinton s overwhelming advantages with minority voters  young people  urban voters and women   if you had told me two years ago that i would be voting for hillary clinton  i would have said   no freaking way    said michael sheehan  chief operating officer of a columbus based apparel firm  sheehan is now leaning toward clinton  the democratic nominee  because he worries trump would damage u s  relations abroad  reuters ipsos polling shows that clinton is doing better among affluent and college educated voters than president barack obama did four years ago  even among republicans  it s a warning  signal for trump  who has been shunned by blacks  latinos and millennial voters  in   nearly nine out of every  republicans with a college degree and annual income over    supported then republican candidate mitt romney  now  about seven in  support trump  romney won college educated voters over obama by  percentage points in   but the reuters ipsos tracking poll showed clinton with a   percent advantage among those same voters last month   the same gap is playing out in key swing states  in ohio  clinton has a   percent edge among the college educated  according to a monmouth university poll in august    it s amazing how few trump supporters i ve run into   said james king  a partner in a prominent columbus law firm who backed romney in  but who likely will vote for clinton  marsha blackburn  a congresswoman from tennessee who is one of trump s biggest supporters in washington  said trump s proposal this week for a child care tax credit was an example of policies that can appeal to more affluent republicans   trump still needs to  keep pushing his economic message  keep talking about national security  keep talking about these issues that are so important to moms  these working family issues   she told reuters  ohio  with its  electoral votes  is crucial for trump and he has campaigned intensively in the state  but in populous  largely suburban central ohio  trump has a tougher task than in the rural counties that surround it  the local economy skews toward white collar workers and professionals and does not depend on the manufacturing revival trump has promised in his  make america great again  message  romney  the scion of a wealthy family and former private equity fund manager  was a more natural fit with many republicans in the area  he epitomized what sometimes has been called the  country club republicans   they favor smaller government  less intrusive regulations and put less weight on conservative social values  trump  the real estate magnate from manhattan  would seem similar  but some republican professionals in central ohio can t get past his temperament and comments like the one suggesting illegal immigrants from mexico are rapists and murderers  romney himself has been a fierce critic of trump   there s no way i could ever vote for that guy   said king  the law firm partner  adding that trump s criticism of the family of a muslim soldier  humayun khan  who was killed in action  soured him on trump for good  an nbc news wall street journal marist poll of registered voters last month showed clinton ahead among white  college educated voters in colorado  where she held a   percent edge  in north carolina  where she held a   percent advantage  and in virginia  where she held a   percent edge   bradley barbin  a white collar criminal defense lawyer in columbus  has decorated the walls of his office with republican memorabilia stretching back a century  he faults trump for stirring resentment and for encouraging violence at his rallies  trump has denied there is significant violence at his events and has blamed the media for exaggerating scuffles with protesters  barbin said he likely won t back clinton   do i know exactly what i am going to do  no  but i do know that trump s the bigger problem   he said  among affluent republicans who do support trump  several said that whatever reservations they may have about him as a candidate  it was more important to keep clinton from the presidency   i think she s a bad person   said william bay  a retired nephrologist who lives in hilliard  a suburb of columbus  who lauded trump as an agent of change  trump s campaign has long contended there exists a swath of trump voters who won t talk to the press or pollsters for fear of being demonized  but who will show up at the polls in november  but it s also possible that some republicans  once in the privacy of the voting booth  will go with clinton because of their concerns about trump  barbin  the columbus defense lawyer  said that s the takeaway from conversations with his peers   we all know   he said   that there are certain people you just cannot give that kind of unfettered power to  you just can t
