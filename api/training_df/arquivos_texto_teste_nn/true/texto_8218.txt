washington  reuters    republican presidential nominee donald trump s u s  military buildup plan would cost hundreds of billions of dollars   but with no apparent strategy  defense experts from across the political spectrum said on thursday   i haven t seen any kind of strategy   said william hartung  director of the arms and security project at the center for international policy   he  trump  says nobody is going to challenge us because we will be so strong  but that s not a strategy  it s just a kind of wish fulfillment   u s  senator jeff sessions  a top trump backer who sits on the senate armed services committee  said the proposal was based on recommendations from groups such as the national defense panel and served as a statement of trump s commitment to build the military   i believe this lays out a framework for rebuilding the military  and it represents a commitment by donald trump to make this a priority   sessions said in an interview   if you don t have presidential leadership really defending the need for a robust national defense  you re not going to maintain the defense budget   trump s proposal  unveiled in a speech on wednesday  did not spell out how he would accommodate the additional manpower and hardware as the united states shutters military bases  or where and for what purposes the larger forces would be employed  there were no cost estimates and trump proposed revenue raising steps that budget experts called insufficient   he just called for higher defense spending without giving us a number and without telling us how he is going to pay for it   said lawrence korb  a former reagan administration pentagon official and senior fellow at the center for american progress  a think tank aligned with the obama administration  trump s democratic opponent in the nov   election  hillary clinton  advocates tough defense and foreign policies  but has yet to take a stand on the size of the pentagon budget  stephen miller  a trump policy adviser  said trump s proposal came in contrast to clinton  who he said has  no military plan   trump pledged to expand the army to   active duty troops from its current    increase the marine corps from  to  battalions   or as many as   more marines   boost the navy from  to  ships and submarines  and raise air force tactical aircraft from   to    trump said those numbers were based on assessments by the conservative heritage foundation and other groups  heritage said in a report that it looked at the capacity needed to handle two major wars to determine its force size recommendations  trump said he would bolster the development of missile defenses and cyber capabilities  he made no mention of u s  nuclear forces already in the midst of a modernization effort that will cost an estimated   trillion over  years  to pay for the buildup  trump said he would ask congress to lift a pentagon budget cap and  fully offset  the increased costs by collecting unpaid taxes  cutting appropriations for federal programs operating without congressional reauthorization  cracking down on social welfare fraud and other fraud  and collecting additional taxes and fees from increased energy production   soft pedaling  the cost writing in the weekly standard  a conservative magazine  tom donnelly  a defense scholar at the american enterprise institute think tank who opposes trump s election  praised trump for embracing a buildup that many mainstream republicans advocate   however  trump undercut the power of his proposals by soft pedaling the cost of such a buildup   he wrote  independent cost estimates for trump s plan range from   billion in additional spending over  years  according to the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget  to as much as   billion over the same period  as assessed by todd harrison  a defense budget analyst at the center for strategic and international studies think tank  harrison said that increase could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit  raising taxes  or cutting other spending  such as benefits programs for seniors and the poor   none of those things are politically popular   he said  the committee for a responsible federal budget estimated that lifting the cap would cost   billion over  years  the revenue generating steps proposed by trump would leave   billion of that amount uncovered  it said  another flaw in trump s plan is the assumption that republican members of the house of representatives who belong to the deficit fighting tea party movement would agree to end the budget cap  in april  army chief of staff general mark milley told a senate committee that adding more soldiers without a sufficient budget would be disastrous for the country and the army  bases would close and programs that support troops and their families would have to be curtailed to make up the shortfall  he said  the navy already has launched a shipbuilding program to raise the number of vessels to more than  by   trump s plan fails to account for the country s limited shipbuilding capacity and the cost of manning  maintaining and basing the additional warships he proposes to build   the whole thing is unrealistic   said dov zakheim  the pentagon s top financial official under former president george w  bush  zakheim  who opposes a trump presidency  estimates that trump s plan would boost defense spending by roughly   billion over five years   it s a soundbite   he said
