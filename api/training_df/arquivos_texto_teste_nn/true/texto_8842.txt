washington  reuters    international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde warned in an interview published on thursday that anti trade policies like those championed by republican presidential candidate donald trump risked a protectionist movement that could severely damage global growth  lagarde told the financial times that with britain s vote to leave the european union already casting a shadow over global growth  the imposition of new trade barriers in another larger economy could have  disastrous  effects   i think it would be quite disastrous  actually  well i don t think i should say disastrous because that is an excessive word and i should refrain from excessive words  but it would certainly have a negative impact on global growth   she told the ft in response to a question about such policies  the newspaper said that while lagarde made clear her negative views of anti trade rhetoric and policies  she refrained from referring to trump by name or singling out any politician  lagarde also told the ft that she doubted that a prolonged period of uncertainty over britain s exit  without triggering formal separation negotiations  would be politically sustainable   we want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty  which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making   lagarde told the newspaper  in a separate interview with agence france presse  lagarde said brexit was unlikely to cause a world recession  adding that the immediate effects would hurt the uk  with some spillover to the euro area  she told afp that proposals in britain to cut corporate tax rates to  percent from  percent to counter the damage caused by the uk s eu divorce was a  race to the bottom  that would hurt other economies
