columbus  ohio washington  reuters    voting is no easy task for roland gilbert  the  year old retired ohio lawyer  who is legally blind  completes his absentee ballot with help from a machine that magnifies the print  so the registered democrat was not completely surprised to learn he had made an error in filling out his  ballot  entering that day s date in the birthdate field  what surprised him was that it cost him his vote  local election officials rejected it because it did not perfectly match his registration information on file   it didn t seem right   gilbert said   i felt foolish for making a silly mistake   laws passed by the republican led ohio state legislature in  require voters to accurately fill out their personal information on absentee or provisional ballots or they will be rejected   even if the votes are otherwise valid  the laws are being applied in a presidential election for the first time this year  a reuters analysis found that where a voter lives can determine whether their provisional or absentee ballot counts in ohio  the law requiring a perfect match on information such as name  address  birthdate  signature and id number has been enforced unequally county to county  federal data and court documents show  with local officials sometimes using wide latitude in applying the standards  the disparity could hurt democrats in ohio  a vital battleground in the nov   election between republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton  the  ohio counties with the most restrictive enforcement accounted for  percent of ohio s total vote in  and gave democratic president barack obama  percent of the votes he won in ohio  more than half of the provisional and absentee votes discarded for minor errors in  came from five large  democratic dominated urban counties  lucas  home to the city of toledo  cuyahoga  which includes cleveland  franklin  home to the state capital  columbus  summit  which includes akron  the fifth largest city in the state  and hamilton county  home of cincinnati  while the number of votes rejected for technical reasons was small in the  congressional election  when nearly   absentee and provisional ballots were thrown out  those totals are likely to swell in a presidential election  when more people will vote  the number of discarded ballots could go even higher in ohio after a court ruled that tens of thousands of voters who had been purged from the state voter rolls can cast provisional ballots  expanding the possible pool of disputed votes  a provisional ballot is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter s eligibility  election boards  split evenly between republicans and democrats in ohio  then examine the provisional ballots to determine if the vote should count   there are going to be thousands of indisputably registered and eligible voters in ohio who are going to be disenfranchised solely because they made trivial  immaterial errors and omissions on forms   said attorney subodh chandra  who has led a court challenge to the laws on behalf of a homeless coalition and the ohio democratic party  a federal district judge threw out the provisions requiring a perfect match on personal information as discriminatory earlier this year  but most were later restored by the  u s  circuit court of appeals  the appeals court did remove the requirement that voters accurately fill in their address and birthdate on the absentee form   any vote cast by mail or in person prior to election day   but kept the requirement for the other fields on both types of ballots  the u s  supreme court on monday rejected without explanation a request for an emergency stay of the appeals court ruling that would have allowed ballots with those technical mistakes to be counted  a spokesman for ohio secretary of state jon husted  a republican  said the  laws were aimed at finding a balance between making it  easy to vote and hard to cheat  and that officials were striving to be more consistent in the law s application  the office has issued a directive that mistakes in the address and birthdate fields of provisional ballots should not be the sole basis for rejection if a board can still identify the voter  chandra and other critics say the ohio laws are aimed at low income and minority voters who move more often and have less flexibility with schedules  making them more likely to cast absentee or provisional ballots  they also are more likely to back democrats   it s a clever scheme to shave off democratic votes   said chandra  arguing the laws create a modern day literacy test by requiring voters to read  write and understand voting forms without making any errors or leaving out information  republican backers of the ohio law reject the claims of racial or partisan bias   it is just nonsense   said ohio state senator bill coley  lead sponsor of one of the bills   we aren t trying to disallow their ballot  we are trying to make sure that every ballot that is cast was cast by an actual registered voter and you are cutting down on opportunities for shenanigans   u s  election assistance commission records show democratic leaning franklin  the state s second largest county  was the most strict in   throwing out  ballots for technical errors including missing or incorrect social security numbers  zip codes  birthdates  cities or street names  officials tossed five ballots because the voter wrote their name in cursive  another seven were rejected because the voter mixed up two digits of their social security number  the federal data showed  some  were rejected because the voter did not provide a birthdate   we are not allowed to do anything other than what the law says   said david payne  deputy director of the franklin county board of elections   we can t be arbitrary   in democratic leaning lucas county  the elections board rejected an absentee ballot in  because the street name was misspelled as  cuthberth  rather than  cuthbert   according to evidence presented in the lawsuit   many smaller  heavily republican rural counties did not reject any ballots for those reasons  in wyandot county  ballots examined for the lawsuit found officials approved ballots without a valid street address  city or zip code  a wrong or missing birthdate  or a misspelled name   we re not monsters  we want to count everybody s vote   said deb passet  elections director for wyandot county  a sparsely populated county south of toledo where republican presidential candidate mitt romney won  percent of the vote in   election officials in rural  republican leaning adams county are also more likely to forgive voters who make a mistake   if there is an opening and they can help the voter out  that s the way they will go   said mary fannin  director of the county s board of elections  other states have tried to introduce similar exact match information requirements  georgia and wisconsin also faced recent challenges that led to adjustments in laws requiring voters to provide letter perfect personal identification information  the battle over the ohio law is just one of several voting rights disputes complicating election forecasts in the state  in the last year  courts have also allowed the state to eliminate a period of early voting  known as golden week  when voters could register and cast a ballot on the same trip   a convenience that has been popular with minority voters   people should not have to jump through all these hoops to get their votes counted in ohio   said ohio democratic rep  kathleen clyde
