  corrects this oct   story s headline to conform with quote from professor that a trump defeat would upset the verdict of history    reuters    the forces influencing the u s  presidential election favor republican nominee donald trump to win the popular vote   but even proven prediction models face  the most difficult election by far to predict accurately   a political forecaster with a three decade winning streak said on wednesday  history professor allan lichtman of american university in washington has accurately predicted the popular result in presidential elections since republican president ronald reagan defeated democratic challenger walter mondale in   although the number of ballots cast by voters for each candidate counts  it does not ultimately determine who takes the white house  in a process known as the electoral college  the candidate who wins a majority of  electoral votes is the victor  each state and the district of columbia is allocated a certain number of those votes  and the candidates have to amass them state by state on election day  while lichtman s  keys to the white house  analysis predicts a popular victory by trump  some other models  such as fivethirtyeight s and the new york times   have given democratic rival hillary clinton a large probability of victory  lichtman joined reuters global markets forum to discuss his take on campaign   what follows are excerpts from that conversation  question  why is trump your favorite to win  answer  with respect to my prediction  my  keys  system is based on  true false questions where an answer of  true  favors re election of the white house party   the democrats  they have exactly six  false  keys against them  just enough to predict their defeat  however  i also noted that donald trump is such a dangerously precedent breaking candidate that he could upset the verdict of history and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory  the two candidates have been repeatedly fact checked by independent sources  and his lies vastly outnumber hers  q  how big is the immigration issue in deciding the election  a  i think immigration is a very important issue  america is a nation of immigrants and immigrants have been demeaned for more than two centuries  the french  the irish  the jews  the asians  the mexicans  and now the muslims  the two candidates have fundamentally different approaches to dealing with the issue  q  what is your expectation for the next two debates  a  trump has got to convince voters that he has the temperament  knowledge  and background to be a dependable and effective leader  he can try to do that without losing his base  which will never abandon him  the first debate was definitely a lost opportunity  for trump   which may be hard to regain for him  obama lost the first debate  against mitt romney  in   but voters still did not have as many doubts about him as they do about trump  in terms of temperament  he could take a lesson from pence  but trump has a great deal of difficulty preparing for a debate or keeping himself under control
