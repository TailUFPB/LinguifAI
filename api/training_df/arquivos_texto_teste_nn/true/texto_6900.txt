washington  reuters    native american reservations cover just  percent of the united states  but they may contain about a fifth of the nation s oil and gas  along with vast coal reserves  now  a group of advisors to president elect donald trump on native american issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to  million acres of tribal lands  two chairmen of the coalition told reuters in exclusive interviews   the group proposes to put those lands into private ownership   a politically explosive idea that could upend more than century of policy designed to preserve indian tribes on u s  owned reservations  which are governed by tribal leaders as sovereign nations   the tribes have rights to use the land  but they do not own it  they can drill it and reap the profits  but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property   we should take tribal land away from public treatment   said markwayne mullin  a republican u s  representative from oklahoma and a cherokee tribe member who is co chairing trump s native american affairs coalition   as long as we can do it without unintended consequences  i think we will have broad support around indian country   trump s transition team did not respond to multiple requests for comment  the plan dovetails with trump s larger aim of slashing regulation to boost energy production  it could deeply divide native american leaders  who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation  the proposed path to deregulated drilling   privatizing reservations   could prove even more divisive  many native americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self determination and culture   our spiritual leaders are opposed to the privatization of our lands  which means the commoditization of the nature  water  air we hold sacred   said tom goldtooth  a member of both the navajo and the dakota tribes who runs the indigenous environmental network   privatization has been the goal since colonization   to strip native nations of their sovereignty   reservations governed by the u s  bureau of indian affairs are intended in part to keep native american lands off the private real estate market  preventing sales to non indians  an official at the bureau of indian affairs did not respond to a request for comment  the legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between  and  to end wars between indigenous indians and european settlers  tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members  leaders of trump s coalition did not provide details of how they propose to allocate ownership of the land or mineral rights   or to ensure they remained under indian control  one idea is to limit sales to non indian buyers  said ross swimmer  a co chair on trump s advisory coalition and an ex chief of the cherokee nation who worked on indian affairs in the reagan administration   it has to be done with an eye toward protecting sovereignty   he said  the trump appointed coalition s proposal comes against a backdrop of broader environmental tensions on indian reservations  including protests against a petroleum pipeline by the standing rock sioux tribe and their supporters in north dakota  on sunday  amid rising opposition  the u s  army corps of engineers on sunday said it had denied a permit for the dakota access pipeline project  citing a need to explore alternate routes   the trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline  however  and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in january   tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations  the council of energy resource tribes  a tribal energy consortium  estimated in  that indian energy resources are worth about    trillion  in   the bureau of indian affairs testified before congress that reservations contained about  percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the u s  deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including devon energy corp  occidental petroleum  bp and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments  those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment  trump s transition team commissioned the  member native american affairs coalition to draw up a list of proposals to guide his indian policy on issues ranging from energy to health care and education   the backgrounds of the coalition s leadership are one sign of its pro drilling bent  at least three of four chair level members have links to the oil industry  mullin received about eight percent of his campaign funding over the years from energy companies  while co chair sharon clahchischilliage   a republican new mexico state representative and navajo tribe member   received about  percent from energy firms  according to campaign finance disclosures reviewed by reuters   swimmer is a partner at a native american focused investment fund that has invested heavily in oil and gas companies  including energy transfer partners   the owner of the pipeline being protested in north dakota  etp did not immediately respond to a request for comment   the fourth co chair  eddie tullis  a former chairman of the poarch band of creek indians in alabama  is involved in casino gaming  a major industry on reservations  clahchischilliage and tullis did not respond to requests for comment  several tribes  including the crow nation in montana and the southern ute in colorado  have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much needed revenue for tribe members and finance health  education and infrastructure projects on their reservations  but a raft of federal permits are required to lease  mortgage  mine  or drill   a bureaucratic thicket that critics say contributes to higher poverty on reservations   as u s  oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade  tribes struggled to capitalize  a  report from the government accountability office found that poor management by the bureau of indian affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes    the time it takes to go from lease to production is three times longer on trust lands than on private land   said mark fox  chairman of the three affiliated tribes in forth berthold  north dakota  which produces about   barrels of oil per day    if privatizing has some kind of a meaning that rights are given to private entities over tribal land  then that is worrying   fox acknowledged   but if it has to do with undoing federal burdens that can occur  there might be some justification   the contingent of native americans who fear tribal land privatization cite precedents of lost sovereignty and culture  the dawes act of  offered indians private lots in exchange for becoming u s  citizens   resulting in more than  million acres passing out of indian hands between the  and   said kevin washburn  who served as assistant secretary for indian affairs at the department of the interior from  until he resigned in december    privatization of indian lands during the  is widely viewed as one of the greatest mistakes in federal indian policy   said washburn  a citizen of oklahoma s chickasaw nation  congress later adopted the so called  termination  policy in   designed to assimilate native americans into u s  society  over the next decade  some   million acres of land were removed from tribal control  and   native americans lost their tribal affiliation   mullin and swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations  they said they also will aim to retain federal support to tribes  which amounts to nearly   billion a year  according to a department of interior report in   mullin said the finalized proposal could result in congressional legislation as early as next year  washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass  but gabe galanda  a seattle based lawyer specializing in indian law  said it could be possible with republican control of the white house and the u s  house and senate   legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a u s  supreme court with a conservative majority  he said  trump will soon have the chance to nominate a supreme court justice to replace antonin scalia  a conservative member who died earlier this year   with this alignment in the white house  congress and the supreme court   he said   we should be concerned about erosion of self determination  if not a return to termination
