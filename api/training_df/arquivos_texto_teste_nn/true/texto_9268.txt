washington long beach  california  reuters    if hillary clinton ends up losing california to bernie sanders  it will be because of voters like nallely perez  perez personifies what a clinton supporter was supposed to look like  a  year old latina who grew up idolizing the former first lady as a groundbreaking woman in politics  but when she votes in california s democratic presidential nominating contest on tuesday  perez will be supporting sanders     everything that i would stand for  he has said it   said perez  a student at california state university  long beach  who said she likes sanders  promises of tuition free college and universal healthcare   we found our voice in him    california is the final big contest in the long  bitter fight for the democratic nomination  opinion polls show the democratic race there tightening in recent weeks  where clinton  a former secretary of state  once held a big lead over sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  the two now are nearly tied   a university of southern california los angeles times poll released on friday showed sanders with a one percentage point lead over clinton in the state   to  percent  a swing from march when clinton held a nine point edge   on the republican side  donald trump has earned the nomination for the nov   election  and clinton is close to capturing the number of delegates she needs to head the democratic ticket  her campaign expects that a win in new jersey earlier on tuesday will secure the nomination   but a loss in a populous democratic stronghold like california could lend credence to trump s claim that she is a weakened candidate    clinton would like to go to the nominating convention with the wind at her back and tamp down the perception that she doesn t excite democrats   said rodell mollineau  a democratic strategist in washington  a sanders victory will not clear the way to his nomination unless it triggers a defection by scores of superdelegates   party office holders and officials   from clinton s camp  an unlikely outcome   sanders has vowed to use california as a springboard to the party convention in philadelphia in july  a win  especially a big one  would validate the self described democratic socialist s decision to stay in the race to the end and give him leverage to influence clinton s policies and cabinet picks   the game he is playing is to be able to draw as many concessions as he can out of the party and the clinton campaign   mollineau said  the area around long beach  part of the  congressional district in california  has emerged as a key battleground  sanders campaigned there a week ago  clinton was in the area on friday and may return again before tuesday s vote  the district s congressman  representative alan lowenthal  remains one of the few uncommitted democratic members of the house of representatives to either clinton or sanders  his district once leaned republican  but is becoming increasingly liberal thanks to an influx of latino and asian american voters who comprise the majority of  residents   the large minority population might be expected to translate into an advantage for clinton  who has consistently shown strength with such groups  but a reuters reporter who toured the area observed an abundance of sanders supporters   in the belmont shore neighborhood of long beach  sanders  volunteers gordon winiemko and jon fellman manned a table on the sidewalk outside a coffeehouse   they had a long discussion with shawn coleman  a  year old film student  who told them he preferred sanders to clinton because  i think i m a little bit more for what bernie has in mind for the future  i think he s right  and hillary doesn t really seem on it    lia roldan  a  year old set decorator in the film industry who lives in long beach  said she was voting for sanders because  he has a lot of experience in standing up for causes that benefit the working class   roldan said she would reluctantly support clinton in a contest against trump   i ll vote for her only because i don t want a republican to win  but i don t really feel in my heart that i would vote for her otherwise   she said   stopping trump was on the minds of those who said they would vote for clinton on tuesday   i love bernie   said sami reed    the ceo of a corporate wellness business  interviewed in a thrift shop   but i ll probably vote for hillary just because i don t want trump to win    a second term congressman  lowenthal told reuters he has come under a  tremendous amount of grief and pressure from sanders people  to support him  but he would not say for whom he would vote  at california events  clinton has been careful to focus her criticism on trump  not sanders  while talking up her national security experience  she will almost certainly need the support of passionate sanders  backers to defeat the outspoken trump in november
