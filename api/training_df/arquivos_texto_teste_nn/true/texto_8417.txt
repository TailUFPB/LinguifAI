 reuters    donald trump s u s  presidential campaign sealed a major staff reshuffle with the resignation on friday of its campaign chairman  and the republican nominee tried to end weeks of upheaval to focus on beating democratic rival hillary clinton       the departure of paul manafort came as trump tried this week to reset his unorthodox bid for the white house after falling behind clinton in opinion polls for the nov   election  trump said in a statement he had accepted manafort s     resignation and praised his  great work   but did not offer an explanation for the departure     trump aides say the staff changes usher in a greater focus on policy and a more serious tone   the former reality tv host has stuck to that mission  swapping his free wheeling rally speeches for prepared remarks that stick to a singular theme  he has concentrated on immigration  trade deals and law and order  speaking in dimondale  michigan  on friday with the use of a teleprompter  trump stayed clear of much of the hyperbole that has been a hallmark of his campaign  he attacked clinton for her position on trade agreements  telling the michigan crowd that the democrat would send auto jobs to mexico   nonetheless  he appeared to stray at times from his prepared remarks  as when he said that black voters  who overwhelmingly tell pollsters they prefer democratic candidates  should vote for him   you re living in poverty  your schools are no good  you have no jobs   percent of your youth are unemployed   trump said   what the hell do you have to lose   trump  who has never held elected office  did not refer to his staffing changes  but in an interview earlier on friday his son eric trump said unflattering headlines about manafort had taken a toll   i think my father didn t want to be  you know  distracted by  you know  whatever things that  you know  paul was dealing with   he told the fox news channel s  sunday morning futures   while also praising manafort s work for the campaign  questions have arisen about manafort s previous work for the political party of the kremlin backed former ukrainian leader  viktor yanukovich   federal investigators from the u s  department of justice are examining american ties to corruption in ukraine  cnn reported on friday  the investigation is looking at the work of manafort s firm and another lobbying firm  the podesta group  headed by tony podesta  whose brother  john podesta  is chairman of clinton s presidential campaign  clinton leads trump by  percentage points among likely voters  according to a reuters ipsos opinion poll released on friday  the aug    online poll showed that clinton was supported by  percent of americans who are expected to vote  compared with  percent for trump  some  percent would not side with either candidate   on wednesday  trump overhauled his campaign team  hiring the head of conservative website breitbart news  stephen bannon  as chief executive of the campaign in a move that bolstered his combative image  trump also promoted adviser kellyanne conway  a data driven political analyst  to campaign manager  in a previous shake up  manafort  who first joined the team in march  took over the running of the campaign from corey lewandowski  who was fired as campaign manager in june      the clinton campaign has pointed to manafort s ukraine work and favorable comments that trump has made about russian president vladimir putin to sow questions in voters  minds about whether the russian government has an unseen hand in the u s  election  russian officials have rejected that accusation   you can get rid of manafort  but that doesn t end the odd bromance trump has with putin   robby mook  clinton s campaign manager  said in a statement  john feehery  a republican strategist  said it would have been unsustainable for manafort to stay on after wednesday s hires   too many cooks in the kitchen   he said  trump s hiring of bannon was seen as a sign he would not hold back in his aggressive  unorthodox campaign manner  still  trump offered rare words of regret on thursday for any time he had caused  personal pain  with his take no prisoners style   on friday  he also began airing his first television advertisement since becoming the republican candidate  buying airtime in the crucial states of ohio  pennsylvania  north carolina and florida  where clinton has already spent of millions in television advertising   the  second ad focuses on immigration  saying clinton would allow  terrorists and dangerous criminals  into the country  a charge her campaign dismisses  karlyn bowman  a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute conservative think tank  said trump still had some time to turn around his campaign  noting the news of the shakeup came as many americans were enjoying summer vacations   the final stretch of the protracted campaign traditionally starts after labor day  which falls on sept   this year   i m not sure the public pays a lot of attention to inside campaign stories   she said   but that said  trump has clearly been having significant problems in the polls and he needed to do something differently and perhaps this is the beginning of the attempt   clinton won some relief on friday from a controversy over her use of a private email system when she was secretary of state  a u s  federal judge ruled that clinton did not need to give sworn testimony in a lawsuit about the email issue
