washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s choice to lead an important health agency said on thursday that the way pharmaceutical companies classify products as generic or branded needs to be reviewed in order to help hold down government spending  as she cited mylan nv s epipen emergency allergy treatment   seema verma  trump s nominee to lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms   did not answer questions about whether the u s  government should negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices   i think what happened with     the epipen issue is very disturbing   verma said at her confirmation hearing before the senate finance committee   the idea that perhaps medicaid programs  which are struggling to pay for those programs  that they could have potentially received rebates is disturbing to me    mylan has been criticized for listing epipen with medicaid as a generic product even though it listed it with the food and drug administration as a branded product  the classification led to mylan s paying significantly smaller rebates to the medicaid healthcare program for the poor than if epipen were classified as branded   i would like to review the processes in place there  in terms of the classifications  in terms of brand and generic  to ensure that type of thing doesn t happen again   verma said  cms said last year that it had  expressly advised  mylan that the drugmaker had improperly classified epipen  mylan said last month that u s  antitrust authorities had launched an investigation into epipen  the company said suggestions it took any inappropriate or unlawful actions to prevent generic competition was  without merit   mylan has also come under fire for raising the price of a two pack of epipens to   last summer from   in   mylan began selling a generic version of epipen for   per two pack in december  verma also said she would produce records of communication between the agency and mylan  when questioned by republican senator chuck grassley  a statement from grassley s office said mylan had overcharged states and taxpayers by  potentially hundreds of millions of dollars    democrats were not pleased with verma s sidestepping a question from senator debbie stabenow about whether she agreed with trump that the government should negotiate with drug companies over prices of drugs covered by the medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled   i don t think that s a simple yes or no answer   verma said   the goal is to make sure that we re getting affordable prices for our seniors
