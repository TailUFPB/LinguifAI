washington  reuters    the chair of the u s  senate foreign relations committee said  that abrupt rejection of the iran nuclear deal by the incoming trump administration could create  a crisis  and that he did not expect such an approach   to tear it up on the front end  in my opinion  is not going to happen  instead  we will begin to radically enforce it   senator bob corker told reporters on friday at a breakfast sponsored by the christian science monitor  he said he expected strong enforcement of the international agreement  announced in july   in which iran agreed to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions  concern about the iran deal under trump  who at times has pledged to pull washington out of it  has led to worries that tehran would be unable to attract foreign investment and that its economy could collapse   to me the prudent course of action is to make sure you enforce it  that you hold the un security council accountable   corker said   and in the event the agreement falls apart  it s someone else that is causing it to fall apart  not a president coming in on day one and ripping up the agreement   every republican in the u s  congress  including corker  objected to the nuclear pact  signed by the united states  britain  russia  france  china  germany and iran  dozens of democrats also objected  but there was too much support for it to prevent its implementation last january  at times on the campaign trail  trump threatened to scrap the agreement  although he said at other times he would seek a better deal  the obama administration and other supporters of the nuclear pact said washington s backing out would upset the u s  partners that also signed and risk destabilization by allowing iran to resume its nuclear development  corker said washington had a choice  to strictly enforce the deal or come in and tear it up   and you can create a crisis on the front end by doing so   he said  corker advocated a wait and see approach   in spite of all the flaws in the agreement  nothing bad is going to happen relative to nuclear development in iran over the next few years  it s just not   he said
