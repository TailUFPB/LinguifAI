new york london  reuters    two days ago  pollsters and statisticians gave hillary clinton odds of between  and  percent of winning the u s  presidential election  how did so many get it so wrong  in hindsight  the polling consensus went astray in two major ways  the media  including reuters  pumped out two kinds of poll stories  some were national surveys designed to estimate the entire country s popular vote  but not the outcome in individual states  where the contest is actually decided  these polls actually got the big picture right  clinton won more overall votes than president elect donald trump   but not by as much as the polling averages predicted  and not where she needed to  news organizations also produced a blizzard of stories meant to calculate the probability of victory for the two candidates  these calculations were predicated on polls of individual states  in hindsight  though  the stories seem to have overstated clinton s chances for a win by failing to see that a shift in voting patterns in some states could show up in other  similar states   in part  this is because polling analysts got the central metaphor wrong  u s  presidents are chosen not by the national popular vote  but in the individual electoral college contests in the  states and washington d c  in calculating probable outcomes  election predictors generally treated those  contests as completely separate events   as unrelated to one another as a series of  coin tosses   but that s not how elections work in the united states  voting trends that appear in one state   such as a larger than expected republican shift among rural voters   tend to show up in other states with similar demographic make ups   and that s what happened tuesday  the election models calculated the probabilities of a clinton win that turned out to be high  because they viewed each state too much in isolation   the reuters ipsos states of the nation project projected clinton to win the popular vote  percent to  percent  and gave her a  percent probability of winning the  electoral votes needed to secure the election  in the end  clinton won the popular vote by   percent to   percent  by the latest count  and trump could win the electoral college by as many as  votes to clinton s  when the tally is final  the state races were not akin to a string of coin tosses but more like  rolls of a set of weighted dice  in many states  it turned out  the side of the dice representing white voters in suburban and rural counties carried a heavier weight  and the side representing urbanites a lighter one   the problem  said cliff young  president of ipsos public affairs us  the polling partner of reuters  came down to the models the pollsters used to predict who would vote   the so called likely voters  the models almost universally miscalculated how turnout was distributed among different demographic groups  young said  and turnout was lower than expected  a result that generally favors republican candidates   in   when republican george w  bush beat democrat al gore  for example  the turnout was about  percent  according to the u s  census bureau  eight years later  turnout was  percent when democratic nominee barack obama won his first presidential election against republican arizona sen  john mccain  this year   whites with lower levels of education came out in greater relative numbers than younger  more educated and minority voters   young said   a point here or a point there can really change an election   ultimately  missing that shift in the state polls tripped up the predictions  it also highlights how the otherwise empirical process of polling rests on a subjective foundation  each pollster must make a decision about turnout  their decisions are informed by historical voting patterns  but the actual turnout in each state is unknowable before election day  among the questions pollsters grappled with this year  will the electorate look like the won that gave obama his  victory   or george w  bush in his  victory  would  black turnout fall after the historically high turnout enjoyed by obama  the nation s first black president  and by how much    key for me is turnout in explaining this year s polling miss   young said  the reuters ipsos model anticipated turnout for white men  for example  at around  percent  which appears to have been too low  and for black women at  percent  which was probably too high  demographic breakdowns aren t available yet  drew linzer  a pollster and creator of the daily kos elections forecasting model  which forecasts the electoral college result by aggregating large numbers of state polls  said prediction models like his try to estimate the possibility of an unexpected turnout shift   but ultimately  he said  the effectiveness of the models came down to the accuracy of the underlying state polls  likely voter models  linzer s model predicted a large win for clinton in the electoral college   to   and because those polls missed the mark  it created an illusion of a near certain clinton win  beyond the calculations of the candidates  odds of winning the electoral college  there was a near constant stream so called  horse race polls   or tracker polls  that focused on the distribution of the national vote between the major candidates  here  too  pollsters   and the media that co sponsored or covered the polls   stumbled  largely because the popular vote metric itself is of limited utility and cannot  of itself  predict the outcome of the electoral college  as of wednesday morning  clinton led the popular vote by slightly less than  percentage point  the mcclatchy marist poll released on nov    for example  had clinton up by one point   one of the most accurate calls of the popular vote  but even that headline number missed the point a bit  because she lost the election in the electoral college  a few polls correctly pegged trump as the winner  the international business times tipp poll had trump leading on nov    that poll put him ahead in the popular vote by two percentage points  which in the end overstated his share by about three points   in one sense  most polls were relatively accurate  the real clear politics average of polls  for example  had clinton leading by about   points  little more than two points above the actual outcome  a polling error of two or three percentage points is not uncommon in modern politics  popular vote polls  however  also exaggerate the influence of massive states  such as new york and california  in the outcome of the election and mask trends that might be occurring outside those left leaning states   the electoral college system reduces the influence of big states by distributing a disproportionate number of votes to smaller states  north dakota  for example  has about a quarter of one percent of the u s  population but double that proportion of electoral college votes  conversely  californians make up  percent of the population but only  percent of the electoral college votes  young said both pollsters and journalist described the results of the national polls and predictions with a false precision by presenting the result as near absolutes   the forecasting models  which assign probabilities or chances to candidates  are no better than the polls themselves   he said   if the polls are off  the forecasting models will be off  too   the reuters ipsos states of the nation project website did offer an interactive tool that allowed users to adjust the poll s estimate of turnout and play pollster themselves   it also included one fixed scenario that showed how trump could win   with a higher than expected republican turnout and a lower than forecast democratic turnout  that scenario  as it happened  better reflected what actually happened tuesday   we need to recognize that there can be a range of possibilities   said young   the trick of course is how to communicate that with the larger public
