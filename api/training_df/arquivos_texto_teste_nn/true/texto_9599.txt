washington  reuters    u s  house speaker paul ryan said on wednesday he was trying to be as constructive as possible as he looked forward to a thursday meeting with presumptive u s  republican presidential nominee donald trump aimed at unifying the fractured party  but ryan  the most high profile republican who has not endorsed trump  warned that bringing party factions together would take some time after a grueling primary season  this suggested there might not be instant results from his get together on thursday with trump and republican national committee chairman reince priebus  trump s takeover of the republican party has shaken the party s establishment and prompted soul searching over whether to reluctantly get behind him or cede any role in the nov   presidential election  when hillary clinton is expected to be his democratic opponent  trump faces pressure to tone down his rhetoric and clarify his policy positions as a step toward unifying the divided party  some republicans were alarmed at his recent talk of raising taxes on the wealthy  but ryan also faces some pressure to smooth things over after saying last week that he was not yet ready to support trump  an extraordinary statement that was seen as keeping some distance from the presumptive nominee and leaving open his prospects for running for president in    what we are trying to do is to be as constructive as possible  to have a real unification   ryan told reporters on wednesday after a meeting with his fellow republicans in the house of representatives   after a tough primary  that s going to take some effort  we are committed to putting that effort in   said ryan  who said he does not really know trump   i want to be a part of that unifying process so that we are at full strength this fall  so that we can win this election  we cannot afford to lose this election to hillary clinton   ryan said  ryan    a conservative congressman since  who ran unsuccessfully for vice president in   and trump  a  year old billionaire real estate developer  are very different republicans who do not see eye to eye on many things  from immigration to trade  but ryan said on wednesday these differences are not at issue  because  this is a big tent party  there is plenty of room for different policy disputes in this party   one lawmaker at wednesday s house republican gathering raised a request for trump to meet with all republicans in the house  a source who was in the room said  asking not to be named  such a meeting is expected to happen sometime before the july   republican convention in cleveland  the source said  on tuesday night  ryan spoke by phone for about  minutes with a trump emissary  former republican presidential candidate ben carson  according to carson spokesman armstrong williams  some republicans have been rankled by trump s policy proposals  including his declaration that nato is obsolete and his call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country  but some house lawmakers who back trump expressed their displeasure with ryan for withholding his support at a small group meeting with the speaker later on wednesday  an aide to one of the lawmakers said  trump has the potential to appeal to a greater number of republican voters but must make changes to make party leaders more comfortable with him  republican officials and lawmakers say    i think he has to show what kind of president that he would be   senator susan collins said   but i believe he can do that  so i am not one who has foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting him  but i need to see more from him   after ryan said last week he was not yet ready to support trump  the candidate fired back that he was not ready to support ryan s agenda  but on wednesday  trump had warm words for ryan and said he thought they were doing fine   we ll see what happens  at the meeting  trump told fox news   if we make a deal  that ll be great  if we don t  we ll trudge forward like i ve been doing
