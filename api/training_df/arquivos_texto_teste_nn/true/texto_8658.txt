 new york  reuters    donald trump has said a lot of things that  were he a sitting u s  president instead of a candidate for the job  could be expected to roil financial markets   if investors were taking the republican presidential nominee at his word  they would be selling shares of apple inc  aapl o   mondelez international inc  mdlz o  and ford motor co  f n   and cashing out of mexican equities   all targets of trump threats of boycotts  barrier walls or import taxes  investors betting on a trump presidency would be buying shares of u s  companies that dealt exclusively with domestic customers and suppliers   yet the trump trade is not much in evidence on wall street  where some market strategists and investors told reuters they find it difficult to position their portfolios for his possible presidency  in part because many of his proposals are contradictory or lack specific implementation details   more business coverage  ex goldman banker gordon dyal beefs up m a boutique amazon makes its debut in the student loan business  more pain for u s  crude should trump win the nov   election  some investors said  it is not clear how the new york businessman could push through policies that clash with mainstream republican party views on free trade and low taxes    the investment community in particular is having trouble figuring out what  trump  is about   said bruce mccain  chief investment strategist at key private bank in cleveland    they are not taking individual items as seriously as they would with other candidates   he said   traders said they will be watching trump s speech at the republican convention on thursday night for signs of how he would address business and tax issues  though they expect scant detail   the trump campaign did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment on how investment strategists viewed his policies   u s  stock indexes have rallied to new highs as trump received the nomination of his party on a platform that includes a proposal to reinstate the  glass steagall law that would require a breakup of the largest u s  banks   a trump presidency  would not be good for markets at all   because of the uncertainty among investors about his true priorities  said paul zemsky  chief investment officer of multi asset strategies and solutions at voya investment management in new york   zemsky  however  said he has not so far been selling securities because of trump   it s hard to react to things that are said because of the lack of specificity  and the probability of him being elected is still low so changing your portfolio because of him is not likely to be profitable   he said   to be sure  trump has supporters on wall street  anthony scaramucci  founder of skybridge capital  has backed trump and said he would be good for the economy because he would cut back on business limiting regulations  such as those governing bank investments and labor policies  he also thinks trump would bring in tax reform   although never elected to public office  trump defeated  republican rivals to win the nomination  he trails democratic rival hillary clinton by  percentage points  narrowing the gap from  points late last week  according to a reuters ipsos poll released on tuesday   if trump s stated proposals were carried out  that could leave the economy significantly weaker because they would result in large federal budget deficits and an anti global stance that could hurt trade  according to a june analysis by moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi   zandi forecast the loss of   million jobs during a trump administration alongside a drop in stock prices and real estate value   trump has said he would renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada  build a wall between the united states and mexico to stop illegal immigrants  and raise a  percent tariff on products made in mexico by ford and united technologies corp s  utx n  carrier corp   yet there has been no selloff of mexican stocks  which are up  percent so far in   that is the best gauge of investment reaction to trump  said jack ablin  chief investment officer at bmo private bank in chicago    for the most part   ablin said   that suggests to me the investment community has not considered a trump presidency a probable scenario at this point
