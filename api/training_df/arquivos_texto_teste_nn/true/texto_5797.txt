 moscow  reuters    in his book   art of the deal   donald trump said the best deals were ones where both sides got something they wanted  his credo  applied to a potential u s  russia deal  flags an awkward truth for vladimir putin  he wants more from trump than vice versa   as aides try to set up a first meeting between the two presidents  the mismatched nature of their respective wish lists gives trump the edge  and means that a deal  if one is done  may be more limited and longer in the making than the kremlin hopes    what the two countries can offer each another is strikingly different   said konstantin von eggert  a commentator for tv rain  a moscow tv station sometimes critical of the kremlin    the u s  has a stronger hand  in biblical terms  the u s  is the three kings bearing gold  while russia is the shepherds with little apart from their good faith    appetite for a deal in moscow  where parliament applauded trump s election win  is palpable  the kremlin blames barack obama for wrecking u s  russia ties  which slid to a post cold war low on his watch  and with the economy struggling to emerge from two years of recession  craves a new start   trump s early moves spark alarm  resistance within the governmentcommentary  war college  russia s hybrid war against the westiran confirms new missile test  says it does not violate nuclear deal trump s intentions toward moscow are harder to discern  but seem to be more about what he does not want   having russia as a time consuming geopolitical foe   than his so far vague desire to team up with the kremlin to fight islamic state   trump has hinted he may also push for a nuclear arms deal   putin s wish list  by contrast  is detailed  long and the items on it  such as getting u s  sanctions imposed over moscow s actions in ukraine eased  are potentially significant for his own political future   he is looking to be given a free hand in the post soviet space  which he regards as russia s back yard   specifically  he would like trump to formally or tacitly recognize crimea  annexed from ukraine in   as russian territory  and pressure kiev into implementing a deal over eastern ukraine which many ukrainians view as unpalatable   the icing on the cake for him would be for trump to back a moscow brokered syrian peace deal allowing president bashar al assad  a staunch moscow ally  to stay in power for now  while crushing islamic state and delivering regional autonomy   for putin  described in leaked u s  diplomatic cables as an  alpha dog   the wider prize would be respect  in his eyes  a deal would confer legitimacy and show russia was a great power   but  like a couple where one side is more interested than the other  the expectational imbalance is starting to show   trump spoke by phone to five world leaders before talking to putin on jan   as part of a bundle of calls  the white house readout of the putin call was vague and four sentences long  the kremlin s was effusive and fifteen sentences long   nor does trump seem to be in a rush to meet  dmitry peskov  putin s spokesman  said the two might only meet before a  summit due to take place in july   trump has good reason not to rush   with u s  intelligence agencies accusing moscow of having sponsored computer hacking to help trump win office  a deal would hand fresh political ammunition to trump s opponents  who say he has long been too complimentary to the russian leader   a delay would have the added advantage of postponing a chorus of disapproval from foreign allies and congress  where there is bipartisan determination to block sanctions relief   for putin though  in his  year of dominating the russian political landscape  a deal  or even an early symbolic concession such as easing minor sanctions  matters   expected to contest a presidential election next year that could extend his time in the kremlin to   he needs sanctions relief to help lift the economy out of recession   u s  and eu financial sector sanctions have cut russia s access to western capital markets and know how  scared off foreign investors  and   coupled with low global oil prices   have exacerbated an economic crisis that has cut real incomes and fueled inflation  making life harder for millions   since putin s  election  consumer prices have risen by  percent  while a fall in the value of the rouble against the dollar after the annexation of crimea means average salaries fell by  percent from   in dollar terms   official data puts inflation at   percent  but consumers say the real figure is much higher  and fear of inflation regularly ranks among russians  greatest worries in surveys   an easing of u s  sanctions could spur more foreign investment  helping create a feel good factor    it would be a huge bonus if it happened   said chris weafer  senior partner at economic and political consultancy macro advisory ltd  who said he thought putin wanted to put rebuilding the economy at the heart of his next term   the economy matters to putin because  in the absence of any more land grabs like crimea  greater prosperity is one of the few levers he has to get voters to come out and support him   with state tv affording him blanket and favorable coverage and with the liberal opposition still weak  few doubt putin would genuinely win another presidential term if  as expected  he decided to run   but for the win to be politically durable and for putin to be able to confidently contemplate serving out another full six year term  he would need to win big on a respectable turnout   that  an election showed last year  is not a given   around  million fewer russians voted for the pro putin united russia party in a september parliamentary vote compared to   the last time a similar election was held   although the economic benefits of a trump deal might take a while to trickle down to voters  its symbolism could boost turnout  helping putin prolong a system based on himself    it would be presented to the russian people as a huge victory by putin   said von eggert   it would be described as a validation of his strategy to go to war in ukraine regardless of the consequences and to turn the country into fortress russia
