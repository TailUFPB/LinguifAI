geneva  reuters    the world will be in danger if republican nominee donald trump becomes president of the united states  the top united nations human rights official said on wednesday  u n  high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein cited trump s views on vulnerable communities including minorities and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations  banned under international law  as  deeply unsettling and disturbing    if donald trump is elected on the basis of what he has said already   and unless that changes   i think it is without any doubt that he would be dangerous from an international point of view   zeid told a news briefing in geneva  trump lashed out at u s  house speaker paul ryan and other  disloyal  republicans on tuesday and vowed to campaign in whatever style he wants now that the party establishment has largely abandoned him  this occurred after a  video surfaced last week showing him bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances  trump has said he would immediately re authorize the waterboarding of suspected militants if elected on nov    contending that  torture works    u s  president barack obama  a democrat  signed an executive order after taking office in january  that banned waterboarding and other  enhanced interrogation techniques   such executive orders can be rescinded by a successor  zeid said that he would rather not interfere in political campaigns  but when a candidate s comments pointed to a potential use of torture  prohibited under the convention against torture  a pact ratified by washington  or to vulnerable groups possibly losing their basic rights  he had to speak out  in a speech in the hague last month  zeid accused trump of spreading  humiliating racial and religious prejudice  and warned of a rise of populist politics that could turn violent   i always believe that it s incumbent on leaders to lead and to lead in a way that is ethical and moral   zeid said on wednesday  when asked about trump   the use of half truths is a very clever political device  because as every propagandist knows  you allow the listener to fill in the rest   trump has portrayed himself as tough on national security and promised to build a wall to stop mexican immigrant  rapists  from crossing the border    we have to be on guard to see that in the end vulnerable populations  populations at risk do not again see their rights deprived because of a view that is in the ascendancy based on false premises   zeid said
