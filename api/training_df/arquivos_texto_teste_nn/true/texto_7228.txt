washington  reuters    japanese prime minister shinzo abe will seek reassurances from u s  president elect donald trump on u s  japan ties on thursday and a senior adviser to abe said he had been told that campaign remarks calling the alliance into question should not be taken literally  abe is due to meet trump in new york on thursday and is expected to be the first foreign leader to meet the president  elect since his election last week  trump s transition team has not responded to requests for comment on the meeting  but an adviser to trump  speaking anonymously  said this week that trump would seek to reassure abe and other asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric  trump had fanned worries in tokyo and beyond with his comments on the possibility of japan acquiring nuclear arms and demands that allies pay more for the upkeep of u s  forces on their soil or face the possibility of their withdrawal  katsuyuki kawai  an adviser to abe sent to set up the trump meeting  said he had spoken to several trump advisers since arriving in washington on monday   i have been meeting with so many top aides to the president elect and also i have been meeting with the very distinguished senators and congressmen and they unanimously told me that we don t have to take each word that mr  trump said publicly literally   he told reuters  kawai said that among the trump advisers he had met were representative devin nunes  senator tom cotton  and the presidents of the conservative heritage foundation and hudson institute think tanks  jim demint and ken weinstein  kawai said the fact that abe would be the first foreign leader trump would meet since winning the presidency on nov   was  a meaningful signal  and abe s aim was  to establish the highest level personal ties with the president elect    that meeting will be the first for building up the great personal relationship between two leaders   he said   prime minister abe will definitely talk about the importance of the japan u s  alliance and that alliance is not only for japan and the united states  but also for the entire indo pacific region as well as world politics   a trump adviser  who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media  said he expected the meeting to  set the tone  for trump s relations with japan and the region    i think the message     is going to be extremely reassuring   the adviser said   i expect he is going to reaffirm his commitments to the alliance and the american commitment to being in the pacific long term   the adviser said japan s financial support for u s  troops in japan might come up but was unlikely to be a focus  some diplomats say that until trump makes key appointments  it will be hard to assess his policies on issues ranging from overseas deployments of u s  troops  china s maritime aggressiveness in asia and north korea s nuclear threat  a day before the trump abe meeting  japanese officials said they had no idea exactly when the meeting would take place  where in new york it will happen  who will be invited or whom to call for answers  japanese and u s  officials said on wednesday the state department had not been involved in planning the meeting  which has left the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled weeks in advance still to be determined   there has been a lot of confusion   said one japanese official  abe  a political blue blood and veteran lawmaker  and trump  a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience  have sharp differences on policy issues such as free trade  but the two may find they have much in common  including pledges to restore their countries  global stature and a desire to counter a rising china while improving relations with russia   prime minister abe and mr  trump will have good chemistry   said takashi kawakami  a professor at tokyo s takushoku university   both tend to decide and act based on intuition  and both are pragmatists who put their countries  interests first   kawai said abe considered the u s  relationship japan s most important and that it was essential that it was built on trust   that is why the prime minister wants to build the highest level personal ties with mr  trump   he said  some of trump s rhetoric suggests an image of japan forged in the   when tokyo was seen by many in the united states as a threat to jobs and a free rider on defense  his election also has dashed hopes for u s  approval of a  nation trade pact  the trans pacific partnership  tpp   a linchpin of washington s  pivot  to asia and a pillar of abe s economic reforms  but abe s personal attitude about defense appears to be viewed more positively in the trump camp  even if it would like japan to do more  since taking office in  abe has boosted japan s overall defense spending while stretching the limits of its pacifist post war constitution to allow the military to take a bigger global role   frankly  the prime minister has been more assertive and forthright in trying to make those changes to japan s global posture   the trump adviser said   i think he s going to get a very receptive audience there    japan agreed last december to boost spending for u s  forces in japan by   percent for the next five years  at an average of   billion yen      billion  per year  defence minister tomomi inada has said tokyo was paying enough  however  defense spending still stands at just over  percent of gdp against over  percent in the united states
