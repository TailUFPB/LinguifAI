global health officials are racing to better understand the zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in brazil last year and has spread to almost  countries   the following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak  how do people become infected  zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes  primarily the aedes aegypti mosquito  the same type that spreads dengue  chikungunya and yellow fever  the pan american health organization  paho  said aedes aegypti mosquitoes are found in all countries in the americas except canada and continental chile  and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where aedes mosquitoes are found  the virus can also be transmitted through sex  from either a male or female partner who has been infected  and a few cases of apparent infection via blood transfusion have been reported  how do you treat zika  there is no treatment or vaccine for zika infection  companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for zika  but a preventative shot is not expected to be ready for widespread use for at least two or three years  how dangerous is it  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention concluded that infection with the zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly  a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems  and other severe brain abnormalities in babies  the cdc said that since the causal relationship had been established  several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years  the world health organization in an updated assessment said the  most likely explanation  is that zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including microcephaly  in addition  the agency said infection is a trigger of guillain barre syndrome  gbs   a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis  the update from the who came after considering months of research  its previous statement  based on a rapid assessment of evidence  said there was strong scientific consensus that zika virus caused gbs  microcephaly and other neurological disorders  brazil recently reported   confirmed cases of microcephaly believed to be linked to zika infections in pregnant women  it is investigating more than   suspected cases of microcephaly  current research indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy  but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks  recent studies have shown evidence of zika in amniotic fluid  placenta and fetal brain tissue  what are the symptoms of zika infection      people infected with zika may have a mild fever  skin rash  conjunctivitis  muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days  but as many as  percent of people infected never develop symptoms  how can zika be contained  efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets  u s  and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to latin american and caribbean countries  sections of miami  florida in the united states and singapore where they may be exposed to zika  they are also advising that men and women who have traveled to zika outbreak areas use condoms or abstain from sex for six months to prevent sexual transmission of the virus  how widespread is the outbreak  active zika outbreaks have been reported in at least  countries or territories  most of them in the americas  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   brazil has been the country most affected    usa gov   africa     cape verde  americas     anguilla  antigua and barbuda  argentina  aruba  the

tropical locales with large mosquito populations  outbreaks of zika have been recorded in africa  the americas  southern asia and the western pacific  the virus was first identified in uganda in  in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in  in uganda and tanzania  according to the who   what other complications are associated with zika  zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders  including serious brain and spinal cord infections  the long term health consequences of zika infection are unclear  other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes  such as dengue
