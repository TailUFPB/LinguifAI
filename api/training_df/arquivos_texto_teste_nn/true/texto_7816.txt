  in this oct   story  corrects description of legal standard regarding trump in paragraph   by alison frankel and dan levine  reuters    donald trump hasn t sued a newspaper for libel in three decades  despite the republican presidential nominee repeatedly threatening to do so over the course of his business career  according to databases of state and federal court records   a lawyer for the new york real estate developer demanded on wednesday the new york times retract a story in which two women accused trump of inappropriately touching them  if the newspaper did not comply  trump  who says the allegations are fabricated  would  pursue all available actions and remedies   the lawyer  marc kasowitz  said in a letter   trump said at a rally on thursday he was preparing a lawsuit   an attorney for the times  david mccraw  said the story was of national importance and the paper would  welcome the opportunity  to defend it in court  over the years  media outlets including the wall street journal  the village voice  the new york post and fortune magazine have reported receiving similar threats from trump or his representatives in advance of unflattering articles  however  trump rarely makes good on those threats  according to a reuters review of court dockets in the database of online legal research service westlaw  a unit of thomson reuters        the last time he sued a news organization for libel was apparently in   trump filed the case after the chicago tribune s architecture critic called his proposed  story manhattan skyscraper an  atrocious  ugly monstrosity   in   a federal judge in manhattan dismissed the suit  ruling the critic had a first amendment right to express his opinion  the skyscraper was never built  in the  years since trump brought that suit  he has not taken similar action against another news organization  although he or his companies have sued at least three individuals and a book publisher  he was successful in one of those cases   book author and former new york times reporter timothy o brien defeated a trump libel lawsuit in   after trump underwent a grueling deposition by o brien s lawyers   trump s suit against o brien  which also named o brien s publisher  time warner book group  alleged the author deliberately underestimated the businessman s net worth  a new jersey state judge found in  that trump had not established o brien s actual malice      former miss universe contestant sheena monnin was hit with a   million default judgment after she failed to appear for arbitration in a case in which trump claimed she falsely denigrated the pageant as  rigged   the arbitration judgment was upheld by a federal judge in manhattan in   the court record indicates the judgment was paid in       the same year  a san diego federal judge ruled tarla makaeff  who was lead plaintiff in a class action against trump university  did not act with malice when she said in letters to her bank and the better business bureau that trump university engaged in fraudulent business practices  the judge  gonzalo curiel  dismissed trump s defamation claim      trump s attorneys  as well as a spokeswoman for his campaign  did not respond to requests for comment on his libel litigation record  including requests for information on any suits the reuters docket search may have missed      u s  courts have routinely deemed trump a public figure in libel lawsuits  that means he has to show not only that the story is false  but also that the media outlet knew that it was false or published it in  reckless disregard  for the truth  if trump were a private person  he would have to show the paper was negligent in failing to learn the allegations were false  which is a lower standard of proof  the new york times attorney  david mccraw  wrote that the paper carefully vetted the allegations in the story  any trump claim will be difficult because trump s accusers were on the record  said jane kirtley  a media law expert at university of minnesota law school  that would bolster the newspaper s argument that it didn t act recklessly in publishing their accounts  trump has vowed to  open up our libel laws   if he wins the presidency on nov    to make it easier to sue news organizations  in reality  he would not be able to unilaterally change the laws because they are generally governed by individual states and court precedents  court records show that trump or his businesses have themselves been sued several times for libel or defamation  most of those suits  including a complaint by a former tenant of a trump condominium and another by a former dealer at a trump casino in indiana  were dismissed  one defamation suit against trump survived dismissal  however  stock analyst marvin roffman sued trump for   million in federal court in philadelphia in   claiming he was fired from his job after publicly predicting the failure of the taj mahal casino in atlantic city  roffman alleged trump defamed him in critical statements to numerous newspapers and magazines  after a federal judge refused to toss the case  the trump organization settled in   an attorney for roffman declined to comment
