until april  when north vietnamese tanks rolled in to bring u s  backed south vietnam under communist rule  many in the crowds lining the streets chanted  obama  obama   some held handwritten signs reading  obama  we love you   and one woman held a boy dressed in a captain america costume  complete with shield  underlining the importance of the growing economic ties between the countries  obama held an open forum with young  entrepreneurs and laid out the benefits of the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade pact between  pacific rim countries  the high point of his visit came on monday  with an announcement that washington was scrapping its embargo on the sale of lethal arms to vietnam  that clears the biggest hurdle remaining between two countries drawn together by concern over china s military build up  critics said that by removing the ban  a vestige of the vietnam war  washington had put concerns about beijing s assertiveness in the south china sea first and given up a critical lever to press hanoi for improvements in human rights  one prominent intellectual  nguyen quang a  told reuters that about  policemen had come to his house at   a m  and put him in a car that was driven out of the capital until obama was about to leave  an outspoken lawyer  ha huy son  said he was also stopped from joining obama s meeting with six other civil society leaders  human rights watch said a journalist who was also invited had been arrested on monday  quang a  a former it entrepreneur  was one of more than  vietnamese who tried to run as independents for last weekend s election to the parliament  which is tightly controlled by the communist party  almost all failed to get on the ballot  before he was taken away  quang a posted on facebook a photograph of himself dressing for the meeting with obama  with the message   before going  may be intercepted  arrested  advising so people know   vietnam s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment  obama noted that several activists had been blocked from meeting him and said this was an indication that  despite some  modest  legal reforms  there are still folks who find it very difficult to assemble and organize peacefully around issues that they care deeply about    there are still areas of significant concern in terms of freedom of speech  freedom of assembly  accountability with respect to government   he said  u s  officials said that lifting the arms embargo would make it easier for washington to engage with vietnam on such issues  in washington  members of the u s  congress  including republicans as well as some of obama s fellow democrats  criticized the policy shift alongside about a dozen vietnamese human rights activists   this is the definition of a bad deal   republican representative chris smith said at a news conference   this is not smart diplomacy  it is surrender of u s  interests and values   democratic representative adam lowenthal said   i am very disappointed that we lost yet another opportunity to elicit any kind of commitment from the vietnamese government on improving the human rights of the vietnamese people    in a speech before leaving hanoi  obama stressed the importance of freedom of navigation in the south china sea  where china has been turning remote outcrops into islands with runways and harbors   big nations should not bully small ones  disputes should be resolved peacefully   he said  without naming china  which claims sovereignty over most of the south china sea  china s global times  run by the communist party s official people s daily  said the decision to lift the embargo showed a willingness to relax standards on human rights for the sake of containing china  u s  secretary of state john kerry  in ho chi minh city with obama  told reporters that washington s efforts to normalize relations with vietnam were not aimed at china   this is not about china  nothing that we did here or  are  arguing here is focused on china  it is focused on the fastest growing marketplace in the world   kerry said   obama interviewed three entrepreneurs at ho chi minh city s  dreamplex   which hosts budget tech start ups with support of angel investors and silicon valley funds  he also touted the benefits of the trans pacific partnership  especially for unlocking entrepreneurial innovation  vietnam s manufacturing and export led economy is seen as the biggest tpp beneficiary  annual u s  vietnam trade swelled to   billion last year from   million when ties were normalized  washington is a big buyer of vietnam s televisions  smartphones  clothing and seafood  but the tpp  which would remove tariffs across a  nation bloc worth a combined   trillion of gross domestic product  is not a done deal  opposition is expected in washington amid concern about competition and a loss of u s  jobs
