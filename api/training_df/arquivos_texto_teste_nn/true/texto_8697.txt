cleveland  reuters    u s  house speaker paul ryan offered his strongest support yet for donald trump s white house bid on tuesday at the republican national convention  saying the new york businessman he has repeatedly criticized provides america  a chance at a better way    behind the scenes in cleveland  the highest ranking elected republican has been shopping a competing vision for the party  backed by some wealthy donors and republican establishment figures who see him as the savior of a party thrown into turmoil by trump s candidacy  the support reflects deep divisions within the party over trump s harder line on stemming illegal immigration and his threats to scrap trade deals that he says have hurt american workers but establishment republicans view as central to their free trade policies  the split has created an identity crisis for the party  embodied in the figures of trump and ryan    everybody knows the tough spot paul ryan is in   said annie dickerson  a new york delegate to the convention and close adviser to republican financier paul singer  referring to ryan s dilemma in backing a candidate as the party s standard bearer in the nov   presidential election who does not represent many of its traditional values   he s the antidote to all the frustration that s in cleveland this week   she said  noting that despite a public push for unity  there are those still unhappy with trump s nomination  ryan    is chairman of the convention at which trump was officially nominated on tuesday  but he has kept a low profile  avoiding the convention s opening day on monday  and instead holding meetings with state delegations and addressing private gatherings of republican supporters  according to aides and attendees  at the meetings  according to attendees  ryan has been pushing his  better gop  platform  a six part agenda that shares strong similarities to the form of conservatism president george w  bush advocated   reduced regulation  lower taxes  and welfare reform  it contrasts with the speeches typically delivered by trump  who prefers to lambaste his opponents and skip detailed policy discussions  doug heye  a former house republican leadership aide close to ryan  said ryan s platform  gives them something that they can talk to constituents about that isn t divisive  that isn t name calling    heye said the approach could help ryan position himself as the face of the party if trump loses the election   ryan has publicly clashed with trump over the latter s promise to deport millions of illegal immigrants and end trade deals  he criticized trump s call to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country and called his remarks about the heritage of a mexican american judge racist  ryan supports free trade and comprehensive immigration reform  and as chairman of the house of representatives budget committee  he authored a document that called for a drastically reduced federal government   the risk for ryan is that a swath of the party is moving away from traditional republican orthodoxy  and by not embracing trump he could find himself isolated  some of trump s supporters see him as emblematic of the washington dysfunction that has angered many republicans   mark bolin  a canton  ohio  business owner who supports trump  called ryan s tepid endorsement of trump  political suicide   he said ryan and other republicans leaders can t admit their own failures   instead of them thinking there s something wrong with their party  they think it must be us  the american people aren t smart enough   bolin said   ryan has long been seen as a rising star and some wealthy donors pushed ryan  who was the vice presidential nominee in   to run for president this year  he declined but hasn t ruled out running in the future  advisers to singer and the billionaire industrialist koch brothers say the donors are banking on ryan to carry the flag for traditional republican values   i like ryan and his day to lead the party will come   very soon  if trump loses   said energy magnate dan eberhart  another major donor    linda devore    a retired attorney from fayetteville  north carolina  who met ryan for the first time in   rushed over to give him a hug when he arrived on tuesday morning to speak to her delegation at a hotel in the cleveland    he s just one of the smartest republicans  that s what i told him   devore said   he s a quick wit  he said   pretty low bar  huh
