philadelphia  reuters    when president donald trump was elected last november  republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle obamacare in the first  days of his presidency  but as congressional republicans gathered for an annual policy retreat in philadelphia on wednesday  the  day goal morphed into  days  as the week wore on  leaders were saying it could take until the end of    or possibly longer   for passage of final legislation  trump had a different idea when he spoke to lawmakers in philadelphia  telling them  enough talk  time to deliver  the divergent views on the timetable were among many indications of tensions that simmered just below the surface at the three day republican retreat  before the cameras  trump and republicans sought to convey an image of a happy  unified family  playing down differences over tax policy  whether to reinstate torture interrogation techniques and investigating  election fraud  and clearly there is none of the open warfare that has sometimes erupted among republicans  such as when senator ted cruz infuriated many of his colleagues by leading a standoff over obamacare that partially shut down the government in   but barely visible in philadelphia  there are potential flashpoints of disagreement within the republican rank and file in congress as well as between republican lawmakers and the unorthodox new president  these include how and when to replace obamacare if republicans succeed in their quest to repeal it  how to revamp the multi layered tax code  whether to build a wall on the u s  border with mexico and the nature of the u s  relationship with russia  when it comes to tax reform  senior congressional aides said the spring of  might be a more likely time than this year for the passage of legislation  republican lawmakers lavished praise on trump in public  in dozens of interviews  many said they felt he would be an energetic champion of issues they cared about  but some also voiced fears that his big agenda would drive up deficits and said they were still searching for details on his plans  several republican lawmakers and aides said they were wary of the cost of his plan to build a wall on the border with mexico  republican leaders have said the wall proposal under discussion would cost   billion to   billion cost but some congressional aides say it could end up easily topping   billion  republican representative will hurd  whose texas district partially borders mexico  went a step further  calling the wall an ineffective tool for stopping illegal immigration  others warned a border adjustment tax on foreign goods to pay for that wall could hurt u s  companies  profits  raise costs for american consumers and spark retaliation by foreign trading partners  some lawmakers also worry that some of their constituents could be at risk of losing healthcare coverage if the push to repeal obamacare moves too quickly  republican representative tom cole said rank and file lawmakers have an incentive to fall in line behind trump   you don t want to be the reason why we weren t successful in getting these things done   he said  still  cole said republicans are taking stock of the potential cost of the biggest items on trump s agenda such as the wall  infrastructure projects  tax cuts and beefing up military spending   i think they worry about it   cole said   following trump s speech to the lawmakers on thursday  senator james risch said that no decisions had been made on the replacement of obamacare  a complex law that has expanded healthcare insurance to millions of americans   it s going to take a while to resolve it   risch said  asked by reporters whether republicans had a clear idea of what trump would like to replace obamacare with  risch responded   in detail  no
