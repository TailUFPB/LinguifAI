washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court breaks for the summer this week  having dealt high profile setbacks to president barack obama on issues important to his liberal legacy  notably on immigration and climate change  this will be the high court s last full nine month term of the democratic president s administration  obama leaves office in january   the court was one shy of its full strength nine members much of this term due to the death of conservative justice antonin scalia on feb    his absence affected the outcome of some major cases  four cases  including the immigration dispute  ended in   splits that left lower court rulings in place  there was little obama could do about it  even if the republican led u s  senate had accepted obama s march  nomination of judge merrick garland to succeed scalia  it was unlikely he would have made it to the bench in time to hear the term s final round of arguments in april  hoping their candidate wins the presidential election in november  republicans insist the choice of scalia s successor should fall to the next president  the administration did score some major wins on abortion and  other social issues  but these were when it intervened in cases where it was not directly involved  obama s biggest loss came last thursday on his bid to protect up to four million immigrants from deportation  the   deadlock will keep him from taking major action on immigration reform  a top policy aim  before he leaves office  in a second major blow to obama s legacy  the court unexpectedly put on hold sweeping federal regulations meant to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants  the centerpiece of his administration s climate change strategy   that decision by a   vote  days before scalia s death  effectively put off a ruling on the regulation until after a legal challenge is completed   sometime after the next president enters the white house   and prevented the new regulations from being implemented  on healthcare  the administration lost narrowly to christian groups that sought an exemption to a provision of his signature law known as obamacare requiring employers to provide health insurance coverage for contraception   the high court sent that dispute back to lower courts without deciding the main legal issue  throwing out a series of rulings in the government s favor  the administration lost some other big cases in which it was directly involved  including former virginia governor robert mcdonnell s successful appeal of his corruption convictions  a silver lining for the administration came in cases where it lent its support  as a friend of the court  to advocates for abortion rights and for race based university admissions to offset years of discrimination  elizabeth wydra  president of the liberal leaning constitutional accountability center  said solicitor general donald verrilli  the administration s top supreme court lawyer until he stepped down last week  deserved some credit for the ruling on monday striking down tough abortion restrictions in texas due to his performance during the oral argument  last thursday  the court upheld consideration of race as an acceptable factor in admissions at the university of texas  had scalia lived  the court might have deadlocked   in that too  one   decision went the administration s way  the government supported unions that successfully fended off a conservative legal challenge  the divided court left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the unions  with scalia on the court  the conservative majority would likely have struck down fees that many states force workers to pay unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other activities   a loss for unions would have deprived unions representing teachers  police  transit workers  firefighters and other government employees of millions of dollars annually and diminished their political clout  the administration also scored a significant victory when the court upheld an electricity markets regulation that encourages big power users like factories to cut consumption at peak times  rejecting a challenge brought by electric utilities
