washington  reuters    white house press secretary sean spicer on monday tried to tamp down the furor over president donald trump s reorganization of the national security council  saying  nothing has changed   a comparison of trump s order with documents from the bush and obama administrations  however  shows that is not entirely accurate  unlike president barack obama  but like president george w  bush  trump did not make the u s  director of national intelligence and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff regular members of the cabinet level principals committee  but trump s directive gives an unprecedented nsc role to a political advisor  steve bannon  who headed breitbart news  a website and voice for the alt right movement  a loose confederation that includes hardcore nationalists  neo nazis  white supremacists  and anti semites  critics of the move say it could allow domestic politics to influence national security and puts a political adviser on par with other cabinet level officials  in his briefing on monday  spicer argued that identifying bannon by his title was a move to show that the administration was transparent about who is attending top level meetings  he said that david axelrod  a top political adviser to obama  attended national security meetings  quite frequently   axelrod disputed that  saying he attended early meetings under obama only on afghanistan pakistan policy   i was not a member of the committee  i did not speak or participate  i sat on the sidelines as a silent observer   he wrote on cnn s website on monday   a former top obama administration official  speaking on the condition of anonymity  called the addition of bannon  an unprecedented politicization of foreign policy that exceeds even what hubris is the new normal    in many ways that is unprecedented  often time these discussions are analytical  very technical  and it is not a lot of politics in the room   said shannon green  who served on the national security council staff and is now a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies  green said that there are few areas where the u s  military and intelligence agencies do not have expertise and relationships with foreign governments that could be beneficial for non military issues       the pentagon said it did not see trump s reorganization as  downgrading the role of the joint chiefs chairman  who is the top u s  military officer  the chairman and the u s  intelligence czar are advisers to the national security council by law  trump s directive says they will attend meetings of the principals committee  where issues pertaining to their responsibilities and expertise are to be discussed   that is the same language used by bush in a february  order   defense secretary james mattis   when he engages with the national security council  whether it is with the full nsc or at a pc  principals committee   he intends to always have the chairman at his side when he is discussing anything that has anything to do with national security and our military   pentagon spokesman captain jeff davis said  in a statement the chairman of joint chiefs of staff general joseph dunford said he would continue to provide his best military advice to the president and members of national security council
