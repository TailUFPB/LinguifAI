washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump s nominee for secretary of state has set a course for a potentially serious confrontation with beijing  saying china should be denied access to islands it has built in the contested south china sea  in comments expected to enrage beijing  rex tillerson told his confirmation hearing on wednesday before the u s  senate foreign relations committee that china s building of islands and putting military assets on those islands was  akin to russia s taking crimea  from ukraine  asked whether he supported a more aggressive posture toward china  he said   we re going to have to send china a clear signal that  first  the island building stops and  second  your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed   the former exxon mobil corp  xom n  chairman and chief executive did not elaborate on what might be done to deny china access to the islands it has built up from south china sea reefs  equipped with military length airstrips and fortified with weapons   trump s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for specifics on how china might be blocked from the artificial islands  china claims most of the energy rich waters through which about   trillion in ship borne trade passes every year  neighbors brunei  malaysia  the philippines  taiwan and vietnam also have claims  when asked repeatedly about tillerson s comments on blocking access to islands  china s foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said he couldn t make any guesses as to what tillerson was referring to and would not answer hypothetical questions  china s right to carry out  normal activities  in its sovereign territory in the south china sea is  indisputable   lu said  speaking at a daily briefing on thursday  he did not elaborate  tillerson also said washington needed to reaffirm its commitment to taiwan  which beijing regards as a renegade province  but stopped short of trump s questioning of washington s long standing policy on the issue  the united states switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   acknowledging that china takes the position that there is  one china  and taiwan is part of it  but the united states is also taiwan s biggest ally and arms supplier   i don t know of any plans to alter the  one china  position   tillerson said  tillerson said he considered china s south china sea activity  extremely worrisome  and that it would be a threat to the  entire global economy  if beijing were able to dictate access to the waterway  he blamed the current situation on what he termed an inadequate u s  response   the failure of a response has allowed them just to keep pushing the envelope on this   tillerson said   the way we ve got to deal with this is we ve got to show back up in the region with our traditional allies in southeast asia   he said  democratic president barack obama s administration conducted periodic air and naval patrols to assert the right of free navigation in the south china sea  these have angered beijing  but seeking to blockade china s man made islands would be a major step further and a step that washington has never raised as an option   under his strategic  pivot  to asia  obama has increased the u s  military presence in the region  and trump has vowed a major naval buildup  tillerson s words also went beyond trump s own tough rhetoric on china  regional military sources said while the u s  navy had extensive capabilities in asia to stage blocking operations with ships  submarines and planes  any such move against china s growing naval fleets would risk dangerous escalations  obama has sought to forge a united front in southeast asia against china s pursuit of its territorial claims  but some allies and partners who are rival claimants have been reluctant to challenge beijing  tillerson called china s south china sea island building and declaration of an air defense zone in the east china sea it contests with japan  illegal actions    they re taking territory or control  or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully china s   he said  the response was muted from the philippines  a traditional u s  ally that last year won an international arbitration case that included a challenge to china s island building within its  nautical mile exclusive economic zone   these are not policies yet and let us wait if they will implement what was said in the hearing   defense secretary delfin lorenzana told reporters on thursday   let s wait until trump is in office   his comments reflect the sharp change in manila s approach to china under new president rodrigo duterte  who wants good diplomatic and business ties with beijing and says challenging it is provocative and pointless  he makes no secret of his lack of trust in the obama administration and has chided it for what he considers inaction in the south china sea  tillerson also said the united states could not continue to accept  empty promises  china had made about putting pressure on north korea over that country s nuclear and missile programs  he said his approach to dealing with north korea   which recently declared it is close to carrying out its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile   would be  a long term plan  based on sanctions and their proper implementation  asked if washington should consider imposing  secondary sanctions  on chinese entities found to be violating existing sanctions on north korea  tillerson said   if china is not going to comply with those u n  sanctions  then it s appropriate     for the united states to consider actions to compel them to comply   he accused china of failing to live up to global agreements on trade and intellectual property  echoing past remarks by trump  who has threatened to impose high  retaliatory tariffs on china  but tillerson also stressed the  deeply intertwined  nature of the world s two biggest economies   we should not let disagreements over other issues exclude areas for productive partnership   he said
