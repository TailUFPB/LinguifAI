new york  reuters    a federal judge blocked the deportation on saturday of dozens of travelers and refugees from seven muslim majority nations  stranded at u s  airports under an order from president donald trump  after a lawsuit filed on behalf of two iraqis with ties to u s  security forces  in the lawsuit filed in federal court in brooklyn  new york  the two men challenged trump s directive on constitutional grounds  the suit said their connections to u s  forces made them targets in their home country and that the pair had valid visas to enter the united states  the lawsuit highlights some of the legal obstacles facing trump s new administration as it tries to carry out the directive  which the president signed late on friday to impose a four month ban on refugees entering the united states and a  day hold on travelers from syria  iran and five other muslim majority countries  in an emergency ruling on saturday  u s  district judge ann donnelly ordered u s  authorities to refrain from deporting previously approved refugees as well as  approved holders of valid immigrant and non immigrant visas and other individuals     legally authorized to enter the united states  from the countries targeted in trump s order  the american civil liberties union  which sought the temporary stay  said it would help about  to  people who found themselves detained in transit or at u s  airports after trump signed the order   i am directing the government to stop removal if there is someone right now in danger of being removed   donnelly said in the court hearing   no one is to be removed in this class   u s  department of justice attorney susan riley during the hearing said   this has unfolded with such speed that we haven t had an opportunity to address all the legal issues    many of the people in a huge crowd that had gathered outside the brooklyn courthouse broke out into cheers after word of the judge s ruling filtered out  the u s  department of homeland security in a statement hours later said only a small fraction of airline passengers arriving in the united states on saturday were  inconvenienced while enhanced security measures were implemented    these individuals went through enhanced security screenings and are being processed for entry to the united states  consistent with our immigration laws and judicial orders   the statement said   the department said trump s executive order remained in place and that its officers would enforce it   separately  a group of state attorneys general were discussing whether to file their own court challenge against trump s order  officials in three states told reuters  the plight of one of the men who brought the lawsuit  a former u s  army interpreter who was detained at john f  kennedy international airport  is especially compelling  said david leopold  a former president of the american immigration lawyers association  who is not involved in the suit   here is a guy who was a translator who worked for the u s  military for years  who himself was targeted by terrorists   he said   it is clear that if he is sent back  he is facing a direct threat to his life   that man  hameed khalid darweesh  was released later on saturday and told a crowd of reporters at jfk airport that he did not have ill feelings about his detention   america is the greatest nation  the greatest people in the world   he said   darweesh    worked for the u s  army and for a u s  contractor in iraq from  to  as an interpreter and engineer  the lawsuit said  the second plaintiff  haider sameer abdulkhaleq alshawi    was also detained at jfk airport but has since been released  he is the husband of an iraqi woman who worked for a u s  contractor in iraq  she already lives in houston  the suit said   trump  a republican  has said his order would help protect americans from terrorist attacks  the lawsuit on behalf of the iraqis challenges trump s order on several grounds  it says the order violates the u s  constitution s guarantee of due process by taking away their ability to apply for asylum  and violates the guarantee of equal protection by discriminating against them on the basis of their country of origin without sufficient justification   it also says the order violates procedural requirements of federal rulemaking  the next hearing in the case was set for feb    supporters of the order say the president has wide authority to limit the entry of foreign nationals from specific countries when it is in the national interest   even if they do and they win  my answer is so what   said mark krikorian  the director of the conservative center for immigration studies   we are talking a few dozen people   that is just a last ditch effort to get the last few people in  it doesn t really change the policy   he said  trump s order does not mention specific religions but trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network on friday he was acting to help christians in syria who were  horribly treated    comments like that could come back to haunt the president in litigation over his order  said hiroshi motomura  an immigration expert at ucla school of law   there were comments during the campaign that focused very much on religion as the target   motomura said   if the record showed that the origins of a particular measure were based on targeting a particular group  that could be challenged in court
