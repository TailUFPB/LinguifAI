washington  reuters    the longest serving u s  diplomat warned against isolationism  protectionism and russian aggression on friday in a retirement speech implicitly criticizing some of u s  president donald trump s policies even as he urged officials to serve the white house loyally  ambassador dan fried argued that since becoming a world power over a century ago  the united states had largely pursued an open  rules based world  rejected  spheres of influence  where great powers bully their neighbors and contributed to  the longest period of general peace in the west since roman times    this track record suggests that an open  rules based world  with a united west at its core  is an asset and great achievement  and a foundation for more   the former assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs said as he wrapped up a nearly  year career at the u s  state department   yet  some argue that this is actually a liability  that values are a luxury  that in a hobbesian or darwinian world we should simply take our share  the largest possible   he added  the comment was an implicit rebuke to the  america first  approach in which trump has pledged to end what he sees as decades of other nations freeloading on u s  security and exploiting trade agreements harmful to u s  workers  in his speech  fried noted  how improbable victory in the cold war appeared  in the  and he hailed the freeing of swathes of europe  including poland  where he served as u s  ambassador  from soviet domination   this great achievement is now under assault by russia   he said   it is for the present generation to defend and  when the time comes again  extend freedom in europe   while fried is a skeptic of russian intentions  colleagues described him as a pragmatist who led efforts to work with russia as a white house aide under bill clinton after the fall of the berlin wall and later when serving george w  bush  he is the latest member of a generation of experienced hands who have left u s  diplomatic ranks in recent months  some  like fried  have retired voluntarily  while others trump chose not to retain  many current and former u s  officials are troubled by trump s openness to closer ties with russia  fearing this could lead to acquiescence in its annexation of crimea from ukraine and  more broadly  in russian domination of its other neighbors  free trade advocates are also worried by trump s decision to abandon the  nation trans pacific partnership trade deal  his desire to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement and his suggestion he could impose punitive tariffs  fried argued against a winner take all attitude in which the great powers each try to carve up the world to their advantage   spheres of influence     would mean our acquiescence when great powers   starting with russia and china   dominated their neighbors through force and fear  while creating closed economic empires   he said    america would essentially retreat from whole areas of east asia  central asia  and eastern europe   in what appeared another implicit criticism of the current  administration  whose efforts to clamp down on immigration from seven muslim majority nations and on refugee admissions have been stymied by the courts  fried said    we are not an ethno state  with identity rooted in shared blood   the retiring diplomat also urged current officials to serve trump and new secretary of state rex tillerson  with loyalty  dedication and courage    help secretary tillerson  he deserves it  and he needs it  and help the president as well  putting your backs into it   among those who spoke at the event were former deputy secretary of state tony blinken  who took a dig at how long it has taken trump to fill state department jobs  including his own   when secretary  of state john  kerry used to say to me as deputy   you are truly irreplaceable   i thought it was just flattery   blinken said   who knew   he added  to loud laughter
