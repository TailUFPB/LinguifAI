washington tampa  fla   reuters    hillary clinton named u s  senator tim kaine as her running mate on friday  opting for an experienced governing partner who will help her present the democratic ticket as a steady alternative to the unpredictable campaign of republican presidential rival donald trump  the selection of kaine  a self described  boring  virginian with a reputation for low key competence  could appeal to independents and moderates  but it quickly angered liberal groups that object to his advocacy for an asian free trade pact  the spanish speaking former virginia governor and richmond mayor fit clinton s long stated criteria that the vice presidential choice be a capable and reliable partner who is ready to take over the presidency if necessary  clinton made the announcement via twitter and a text message to supporters after the first day of a two day campaign swing in florida  she called kaine to tell him about  minutes before the announcement  and called president barack obama shortly after kaine   i m thrilled to tell you this first  i ve chosen sen  tim kaine as my running mate  welcome him to my team   she said in her text message  kaine    edged out two other finalists   cory booker  a u s  senator from new jersey  and agriculture secretary tom vilsack  according to a democratic source familiar with the discussions  clinton also bypassed candidates who would have generated more excitement among liberal and hispanic activists  including progressive favorite u s  senator elizabeth warren and two hispanic members of obama s cabinet  julian castro and thomas perez  the former secretary of state will be formally nominated as the party s presidential candidate for the nov   election at next week s democratic convention in philadelphia  she leads trump in many opinion polls  clinton s choice of a running mate could give her campaign momentum heading into the convention  as the fight for the white house begins a more than three month push to the finish              clinton    acknowledged in an interview earlier this week that even kaine admits he is boring  and said she did not mind   i love that about him   she told charlie rose of cbs news and pbs   he s never lost an election  he was a world class mayor  governor and senator and is one of the most highly respected senators i know   a campaign official said clinton was impressed with kaine s down to earth style when she campaigned with him in virginia last week  afterwards  kaine went back to her house in washington  d c   for a  minute evening meeting  two days later  kaine and his wife  anne  joined clinton in new york for lunch  along with clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  daughter chelsea and chelsea s husband  kaine was the only vice presidential candidate to have a private family lunch during the vetting process  the official said  clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  who led the search  offered her advice   it needs to be someone who whenever they walk into a room you are glad to see them and want to have them as part of any conversation   the campaign official quoted podesta telling her  kaine s first appearance with clinton will be on saturday at an event in miami  a campaign aide said   just got off the phone with hillary  i m honored to be her running mate  can t wait to hit the trail tomorrow in miami   kaine said on twitter  liberal groups  which had pressured clinton not to pick kaine because of his support for fast track authority for the white house to negotiate the trans pacific partnership  were dismayed by the choice  critics of the asia free trade deal  including trump and clinton s democratic primary rival bernie sanders  say it would be unfair to u s  workers and kill jobs  clinton praised the deal when she was secretary of state  but has since distanced herself from it   republicans will run hard against democrats on trade this year  unfortunately  since tim kaine voted to fast track the trans pacific partnership  republicans now have a new opening to attack democrats on this economic populist issue   said stephanie taylor  co founder of the progressive change campaign committee  hispanic activists also may be annoyed with the pick of kaine given that latino candidates were again passed over  though some latino advocacy groups praised the choice   she has chosen a running mate that has a track record of advocating and fighting for the issues that affect the latino community and our nation  immigration  healthcare  women s rights and the environment   said ben monterroso  executive director of mi familia vota   top republicans were quick to criticize clinton s choice  the trump campaign called kaine  an ethically challenged insider  and called clinton and kaine a  status quo  ticket   if you think crooked hillary and corrupt kaine are going to change anything in washington  it s just the opposite   campaign aide jason miller said in a statement  republican national committee chairman reince priebus condemned the pick  saying clinton spent the past week pandering to sanders and grassroots democrats  and now  has chosen someone who holds positions that she s spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of   but republican senator jeff flake of arizona  who has been critical of trump  said on twitter that he was trying to count the ways he hated tim kaine   drawing a blank  congrats to a good man and a good friend   flake said   kaine could help clinton in virginia  a heavily contested swing state  and choosing kaine will not cost democrats a seat in the senate  where republicans now hold a majority  virginia s democratic governor  terry mcauliffe  a close clinton friend and ally  will name a replacement for kaine if he and clinton win the white house  some democrats who know kaine well dismissed fears that he lacks the toughness to stand up to republican attacks  given how deftly trump chewed up  low energy  jeb bush and  little marco  rubio in the republican primaries       it s not the donald trump sledgehammer  but he s not a shrinking violet   said luke albee  a former chief of staff to democrat mark warner  the senior u s  senator from virginia      albee  who has watched kaine up close over the years  added   i wouldn t mistake a thoughtful and genial disposition for an inability to really forcefully articulate differences   kaine has good relations with senators from the opposing party  according to senior senate republican congressional aides  one aide speculated kaine would be effective in reaching out to congressional republicans if he becomes vice president  a role that vice president joe biden has played for obama  kaine  a member of the senate foreign relations and armed services committees  has been a leading voice calling for a formal authorization of war against the islamic state militant group  he played an important role in securing congressional review of the  international deal on iran s nuclear program  although he eventually backed it  he has a track record of backing liberal causes such as ending across the board automatic budget cuts and providing a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants         kaine  a catholic who became fluent in spanish speaker while serving as a missionary in honduras  has expressed personal opposition to abortion  but has a public record in support of abortion rights
