greensboro  n c   reuters    hillary clinton got back on the campaign trail on thursday after taking three days off for pneumonia  and the democratic presidential candidate faced a more challenging political landscape  with republican rival donald trump rising in opinion polls  senior clinton aides said they always expected the race to the nov   election to be close  but it was clear from a raft of new polls that trump had halted a summer swoon after taking steps to give a less freewheeling  more polished performance on the stump  clinton    appeared in good health on a visit to her campaign plane s press cabin while flying to greensboro  north carolina  for a rally where she sought to refocus her campaign on the plight of the working class   which has turned out to be a potent theme for trump  leaving the stage to the tune of james brown s  i feel good   clinton told reporters she kept her pneumonia diagnosis last friday quiet  telling only senior staff  because she thought she would be able to  power through  the illness and keep campaigning   from my perspective  i thought i was going to be fine and i thought that there was no reason to make a big fuss about it   she said  on sunday  clinton nearly collapsed while leaving a ceremony marking the sept      attacks in new york  her illness coincided with a mini surge by trump  who has drawn even or taken a slight lead in national polls  polls in battleground states where the race is likely to be decided showed trump now leading in iowa  ohio  florida and nevada  and tied in north carolina  following her appearance in north carolina  clinton was scheduled to appear at a washington dinner  clinton s campaign chairman  john podesta  said the candidate and her aides expected the contest to be close   we always expected the race to tighten up  we still feel like we re in a strong position with organizational advantage in florida and ohio   podesta told reporters on thursday   they call these states battlegrounds for a reason   in a speech at the new york economic club  trump stuck to his script  avoiding the more improvisational style that has produced a cornucopia of controversies  trump pushed a package of tax cuts he said would help power the u s  economy to an annual growth rate of   percent  the new york businessman said his goal would be  percent growth  a target originally championed by republican primary rival jeb bush  trump said the growth would generate  million new jobs  his economic package resurrected a decades old debate on whether tax cuts can generate sustainable growth  but the overarching impression left by his speech was one of trump talking about substantive issues and avoiding the frivolous  bob shrum  a democratic strategist who managed  candidate john kerry s unsuccessful campaign  said clinton remained the favorite to win the white house  with demographic changes favoring her over trump  who is heavily reliant on white voters  what has hurt clinton  shrum said  is not the time taken off from the campaign trail but rather her decision to keep her diagnosis secret until forced to disclose it   which reinforced a perception among voters that she has a penchant for secrecy   fairly or unfairly  what this was taken as was more evidence that she was not transparent and that s what hurts her   shrum said   she been far more transparent than trump but she hasn t gotten any credit for it   democrats have sought to pressure trump to release his tax returns  but the republican has said he will not release them until a federal government audit has been completed  clinton has released her tax records  with the candidates  health in the spotlight  trump    on thursday released details of a recent physical examination  a day after clinton released specifics on her medical condition  trump s campaign said the results of his physical showed the fast food fan has normal cholesterol with the help of a statin drug  weighs  pounds   kg  and has normal blood pressure  in a not so subtle slap at clinton  the trump campaign said his medical report showed he  has the stamina to endure   uninterrupted   the rigors of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign and  more importantly  the singularly demanding job of president of the united states   trump also appeared on the  dr  oz show  to discuss his health in an interview with host mehmet oz  a surgeon  top clinton aide jennifer palmieri said  one upside  of clinton s unplanned break was the chance to  sharpen the final argument clinton will present to voters in these closing weeks    our campaign readily admits that running against a candidate as controversial as donald trump means it is harder to be heard on what you aspire for the country s future  and it is incumbent on us to work harder   palmieri said in a statement  trump backers on capitol hill said they were heartened by the tightening race after a call on thursday morning with his campaign manager  kellyanne conway  who mapped out what the campaign was doing  she promised a more policy driven approach from trump in the race s final stretch   the poll numbers are just looking phenomenal as you move away from registered voters to likely voters   republican u s  representative blake farenthold of texas said
