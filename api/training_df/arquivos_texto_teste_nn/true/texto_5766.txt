washington  reuters    as a lawyer in private practice for a decade  president donald trump s u s  supreme court nominee neil gorsuch often fought on behalf of business interests  including efforts to curb securities class action lawsuits  experience that could mould his thinking if he is confirmed as a justice  gorsuch  a conservative federal appeals court judge from colorado nominated by wealthy businessman trump on tuesday  could turn out to be a friend to business  having represented the u s  chamber of commerce in fending off securities class actions  one of the most hotly contested areas of corporate law  the chamber is the largest u s  business lobbying group  if confirmed  gorsuch would be one of the only current justices with extensive experience on business issues in private practice   securities class action lawsuits are filed by investors who allege misconduct by a company whose stock price has tanked  hurting investors  portfolios  these once common lawsuits now face higher hurdles and are filed less often  congress passed laws in  and  making it harder to bring securities class actions  later court rulings  including one in which gorsuch was involved  clarified the requirements under the laws  from  to   gorsuch worked at boutique law firm kellogg  huber  hansen  todd  evans   figel in washington  becoming a partner in   he had a wide range of clients  including individuals and nonprofits  as well as various business interests  while there  he filed two briefs on behalf of the chamber of commerce seeking limits to securities class actions  one of gorsuch s briefs came in a securities fraud case called dura pharmaceuticals v  broudo  the supreme court in  ruled unanimously for the company  but did not issue the kind of broad ruling gorsuch had sought  said patrick coughlin  the lawyer who argued the case on behalf of the investors who sued  of gorsuch s role  coughlin said representing the chamber of commerce is the epitome of corporate defense work for a lawyer   the chamber had always been against us   coughlin said  referring to class action lawyers   he d always been on the other side of what we were doing  so it was not surprising he was selected by trump   prior to the ruling  gorsuch co wrote an article in the legal times trade publication for lawyers in which he described some securities class actions as a  free ride to fast riches  for plaintiffs  lawyers  he said the dura case was a chance for the court to  curb frivolous fraud claims  in which plaintiffs cannot prove a stock price drop was caused by misrepresentations by a company  gorsuch s background promises to be valuable on the supreme court  which hears a significant number of business disputes among the roughly  cases considered each annual term   businesses have been trying with mixed success to get the supreme court to put new curbs on class action litigation beyond the securities context  class actions can lead to huge jury awards against companies and is harder to defend against than lawsuits brought by individuals  if confirmed by the u s  senate in time  gorsuch could play an immediate role in a major case on whether companies can head off costly class action lawsuits by forcing employees to give up their right to pursue work related legal claims in court as a group  paul bland  executive director of consumer advocacy group public justice  said he hoped gorsuch  if confirmed  would see that  most of what he saw as meritless cases in  have been weeded out  and that the vast majority of the cases that remain raise substantial issues that protect investors   chamber of commerce official tom collamore joined trump at the white house on wednesday for a meeting with advocacy groups touting gorsuch s pick  calling it  a fantastic nomination   the chamber declined comment on gorsuch s work for the group  in a statement issued after the nomination was announced  chamber president tom donohue congratulated trump on the selection  when democratic president barack obama last march nominated appeals court judge merrick garland to fill the same vacant seat on the court  there was no press release from the chamber  senate republicans refused to act on garland s nomination  a move that paved the way for trump to nominate gorsuch to replace fellow conservative antonin scalia  who died in february   describing his career in private practice  gorsuch said in his senate questionnaire prior to his appointment by republican president george w  bush to the denver based  u s  circuit court of appeals in  that he was  involved in matters large and small for clients ranging from individuals to nonprofits to corporations   on such issues as racketeering  securities fraud and antitrust   his former washington law firm stressed in a statement that gorsuch had a  wide variety  of clients and cited a case in which he represented people who had been targeted over payday loans  david frederick  a lawyer at the firm  called gorsuch  a dogged  very determined lawyer    he s the kind of lawyer you would want to have representing you   frederick said  after leaving the firm  but before becoming a judge  he spent just over a year in bush s justice department  one of his roles was overseeing antitrust litigation involving the government
