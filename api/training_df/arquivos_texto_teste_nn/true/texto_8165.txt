moscow  reuters    the kremlin said on wednesday it viewed u s  president barack obama s recent statements on republican presidential candidate donald trump as anti russian and said they were unlikely to improve fragile relations between russia and the united states  obama on tuesday strongly criticized trump for praising russian president vladimir putin and for appearing on a tv channel  rt  funded by the russian government   unfortunately  we see continued displays of often hard core russophobia   kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov  commenting on obama s intervention  told a conference call with reporters   we can only express regret in this regard   this rhetoric  which is being formulated in electoral campaign style     is unlikely to help fledgling fragile attempts to build at least some sort of mutual trust
