washington  reuters    president donald trump s pledge to bring massive investments in u s  infrastructure projects showed new signs of life on friday after lying dormant for weeks  as leading republican lawmakers said proposals from the administration could be in the offing  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  told reporters he expects to receive  some kind of recommendation on an infrastructure bill  a subject that we frequently handle on a bipartisan basis   but gave no details or timing  he has previously voiced concern over adding to budget deficits with a new injection of federal funds for road  bridge and other construction projects like the ones president barack obama secured from congress in   especially after a major highway funding law was enacted about a year ago  some republicans and democrats in congress are increasingly criticizing trump s administration for being slow to get behind his legislative initiatives during the first month of his presidency  trump s plans to create an infrastructure council led by two new york billionaire friends  developers richard lefrak and steven roth  have yet to be launched  a spokesman for lefrak said   during his presidential campaign  trump said he would push for a   trillion infrastructure program to rebuild roads  bridges  airports and other public works projects  he said he wanted action during the first  days of his administration  which now seems unlikely  the republican president has talked about creating a tax credit to encourage private sector investment in many of these projects  but democrats say that would fail to spur enough rebuilding and put taxpayers on the hook for a tax credit to wealthy developers  who they said would build toll roads that taxpayers would then have to pay to use  democrats want a more direct federal role in sparking a construction boom  in an interview on tuesday  republican representative mario diaz balart said he had  no doubt that it  infrastructure investment  is a priority for the administration   diaz balart chairs a house subcommittee that would control the flow of washington money that might be needed to fund some of the public works projects  several lawmakers and aides speculated the initiative could be attached to tax reform legislation that republicans want to advance this year  but no decisions have been made  writing an infrastructure bill involves seven or eight committees  there are complicated tax and spending questions at stake  and lawmakers are divided  there are also questions over what would qualify as an infrastructure project  with rural areas  for example  clamoring for more broadband internet service  senator john thune  a member of the republican leadership who chairs the commerce and transportation panel which has a say on any bill  said he had little information on the content or status of legislation  asked about mcconnell s comments  thune said   maybe he knows more about it since he s married to the secretary of transportation   elaine chao
