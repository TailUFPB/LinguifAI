munich  germany  reuters    republican senator john mccain broke with the reassuring message that u s  officials visiting germany have sought to convey on their debut trip to europe  saying on friday that the administration of president donald trump was in  disarray   mccain  a known trump critic  told the munich security conference that the resignation of the new president s security adviser michael flynn over his contacts with russia reflected deep problems in washington   i think that the flynn issue obviously is something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they ve got a lot of work to do   said mccain  even as he praised trump s defense secretary   the president  i think  makes statements  and  on other occasions contradicts himself  so we ve learned to watch what the president does as opposed to what he says   he said  european governments have been unsettled by the signals sent by trump on a range of foreign policy issues ranging from nato and russia to iran  israel and european integration  the debut trip to europe of trump s defence secretary jim mattis and secretary of state rex tillerson  to a meeting of  counterparts in bonn  went some way to assuaging concerns as they both took a more traditional u s  position  but trump is wrestling with a growing controversy at home about potential ties between his aides and russia  which he dismissed on thursday as a  ruse  and  scam  perpetrated by a hostile news media  mattis made clear to allies  both at nato in brussels and in munich  that the united states would not retreat from leadership as the european continent grapples with an assertive russia  wars in eastern and southern mediterranean countries and attacks by islamist militants  u s  vice president mike pence will address the munich conference on saturday with a similar message of reassurance   pence will say that europe is an  indispensable partner  for the united states  a senior white house foreign policy adviser told reporters   mattis told a crowd that included heads of state and more than  defense ministers that trump backed nato   president trump came into office and has thrown now his full support to nato  he too espouses nato s need to adapt to today s strategic situation for it to remain credible  capable and relevant   mattis said  mattis said the united states and its european allies had a shared understanding of the challenges ahead  trump has alarmed allies by expressing admiration for russian president vladimir putin   mattis  however  has spoken out strongly against russia while in europe  after talks with nato allies in brussels on thursday  he said that he did not believe it would be possible to collaborate militarily with moscow  at least for now  the europeans may need more convincing that washington stands with it on a range of security issues   there is still a lot of uncertainty   sebastian kurz  austria s foreign minister  told reporters   the big topic in munich is looking to the usa to see which developments to expect next   european intelligence agencies have warned that russia is also seeking to destabilize governments and influence elections across europe with cyber attacks  fake news and propaganda and by funding far right political parties   we should be under no illusions about the step change in russian behavior over the last couple of years  even after crimea   british defence minister michael fallon said  referring to moscow s  annexation of the ukrainian peninsula   we have seen a step change in russian military aggression  but also in propaganda  in misinformation and a succession of persistent attacks on western democracies  interference in a whole series of elections including     the united states   nato secretary general jens stoltenberg held talks with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in munich  seeing progress on encouraging moscow to be more open about its military exercises that the alliance says are unpredictable  russia says it is the western alliance  not moscow  that is destabilizing europe by sending troops to its western borders   we have different views   stoltenberg said of the crisis in ukraine  where the west accuses the kremlin of arming separatist rebels in a conflict that has killed   people since april   russia says the conflict is a civil war  in the latest incident  lithuanian prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into a false report of rape by german soldiers stationed there on a nato mission to deter russia  mattis  without explicitly citing the case  rallied to the defense of german forces as he spoke in the german city of munich   i have great respect for germany s leadership in europe   and for the ethical performance of your troops on the battlefield   he said  u s  intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump s favor  mccain acknowledged concern in europe and beyond that america was  laying down the mantle of global leadership  and cited global trends he found disturbing  including hardening resentment toward immigrants and an unwillingness to separate truth from lies     mccain urged the forum not to give up on the united states    make no mistake  my friends  these are dangerous times  but you should not count america out  and we should not count each other out   mccain said
