fort pierce  fla   reuters    the photo from omar mateen s high school yearbook is hardly remarkable   a toothy  dimpled smile with a peach fuzz mustache below a mop of black hair   his transformation from high school football player to perpetrator of america s worst mass shooting raises questions about whether red flags were missed over the depth of his apparent sympathies with muslim extremists  as families of the victims grieved and the nation recoiled at the scale of yet another mass shooting  a picture began to emerge of the  year old killer as a quiet  devout person who in recent years displayed a hateful and violent streak  early on sunday  he stormed a packed gay nightclub in orlando  florida  with a handgun and ar  semi automatic rifle  fatally shooting  people before police killed him  fifty three others were wounded  many critically  his ex wife  sitora yusufiy  described him as  bipolar   and emotionally disturbed with a violent temper  she said she had been beaten and otherwise physically abused by mateen during outbursts in which he would  express hatred towards everything   she was  rescued  by family members just four months into a stormy marriage that began in  and ended in divorce  she said   he would often get into fights with his parents  but as i was the only one in his life most of the violence was directed towards me   she told reporters in boulder  colorado outside a home where she was staying   she said he aspired to be a police officer and had worked as a correctional officer at a detention center for juvenile delinquents in fort pierce  florida  and had once sought admission to a police academy  in fort pierce on florida s southeast coast   miles   km  from the shooting  the imam at the mosque that mateen attended for nearly  years described him as a regular worshipper who was quiet and rarely interacted with the congregation   he hardly had any friends   syed shafeeq rahman  who heads the islamic center of fort pierce  told reuters   he would come with his little son at night to pray and after he would leave   rahman said mateen never approached him regarding any concerns about homosexuals  he usually prayed at the mosque a few times a week  mostly in evenings and as recently as friday  but he didn t display signs of radicalism  according to fellow worshippers interviewed by reuters  mateen was born in new york of afghan descent but spent most of his life in florida  attending martin county high school in stuart  a small city about a  minute drive from the fort pierce condominium where had most recently lived  a classmate described him as a typical teen who played football  a school yearbook image of mateen was seen by reuters    samuel king  who was one year ahead of mateen  said the two often spoke after mateen graduated in   king waited tables at ruby tuesday s restaurant at treasure coast square  a mall where mateen worked at gnc  the nutrition store  he said  king  who is openly gay  said the mateen he knew until  did not appear to be anti homosexual   what is shocking to me is that the majority of the staff at ruby tuesday s when i worked there were gay  he clearly was not anti  gay  at least not back then  he did not show any hatred to any of us   while at gnc  mateen lifted weights and  got really buff   king said  describing mateen as gregarious and talkative in the immediate years after high school   something must have changed  since he last saw him  he added  mateen s father  mir seddique  told nbc news the massacre was not related to religion  he said his son turned angry when he saw two men kissing in miami a couple of months ago   the fbi twice interviewed mateen for having suspected ties to islamist militants  the first investigation took place in  when mateen made inflammatory comments to co workers that indicated sympathy for militants  fbi special agent in charge ron hopper told a news conference in orlando  at the time  mateen worked as a security guard at   a british owned multinational company that is among the world s largest private security firms   he joined  in september   carried a gun as part of his duties and was employed with the company at the time of the shooting as an armed security officer  the company said    provides security to federal buildings in florida  mateen was investigated and interviewed twice but the fbi was  unable to verify the substance of his comments   hopper said  daniel kime  a security guard employed along with mateen by at  in the fort pierce area  said he met mateen briefly three or four times   every time i saw him he never smiled  if you said good morning  he d just walk right by you  like he had a chip on his shoulder   kime told reuters  daniel gilroy  who said he was a co worker of mateen s at   said that mateen s anger was  constant    any time a female or a black person would come by he would use horrible words   he told fox news   in   hopper said  mateen was investigated and interviewed again  this time for suspected connections to moner mohammad abu salha  an american citizen who became a suicide bomber in syria in   hopper said mateen s contact with abu salha was minimal and it was deemed that  he did not constitute a substantive threat at that time   hopper said mateen was not under investigation or surveillance at the time of sunday s attack  he said mateen called during the massacre to pledge allegiance to islamic state  also known as isis  which in recent years declared a caliphate over large swathes of iraq and syria  but the depth of that commitment is unclear  mateen also mentioned the boston marathon bombers during the call  which he made  minutes into the shootings  authorities said  mateen s former wife said she met mateen online about eight years ago and decided to move to florida to marry him  according to the washington post   he was not a stable person   she said   he beat me  he would just come home and start beating me up because the laundry wasn t finished or something like that   mateen had a florida firearms license that expired in  and a state permit to work as a security guard  according to public records  he was registered as a democrat  city  state and federal officials were searching mateen s apartment in the woodlands condominium building in fort pierce and had told other residents to evacuate   this story has been refiled to
