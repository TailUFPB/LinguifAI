 reuters    new jersey prosecutors on friday said they would not pursue criminal misconduct charges against governor chris christie in connection with the  bridgegate  scandal  the office of the bergen county prosecutor said in a letter to a local judge it did not have sufficient evidence to prove allegations that christie knew about a plot to close lanes at the george washington bridge in  in order to punish a local mayor for failing to endorse christie s re election bid   the reason is simple  but compelling   that charge cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt   the letter said  bill brennan  a retired firefighter and activist who announced he would run for governor this year  filed the citizen complaint against christie last september  two former christie allies were convicted last year of orchestrating the lane closure plot  and u s  prosecutors introduced evidence at trial suggesting the governor was at least aware of the scheme  christie has steadfastly denied that he knew about the closures at the time  roy mcgeady  a municipal judge in fort lee  had found probable cause to allow the case against christie to proceed after a hearing at which brennan testified  christie s lawyer was not permitted to argue or cross examine  mcgeady said  because the governor was not a defendant until probable cause was established  bergen county superior court judge bonnie mizdol rejected christie s subsequent request to toss the complaint outright  but she agreed with both christie s lawyers and county prosecutors that mcgeady erroneously denied the governor s attorney an opportunity to participate  the bergen county prosecutor s office said in the letter that citizen complaints typically allege minor crimes of which the complainant has personal knowledge  the letter said criminal misconduct was far outside that scope   in short  a matter of this gravity should not have been heard by a municipal court judge   the letter said  brian murray  a spokesman for christie  applauded the decision on friday   the governor is gratified that the bergen county prosecutor s office has ended this baseless fiasco began by mr  brennan and perpetuated by judge mcgeady   murray said in a statement   it is right and appropriate that this injustice against the governor is finally over
