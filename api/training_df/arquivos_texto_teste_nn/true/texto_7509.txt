tokyo jakarta  reuters    win or lose  donald trump s campaign has changed the way countries in asia view their relationships with washington  final polling suggests the most likely outcome is a victory for hillary clinton  but even clinton  an architect of the u s  strategic pivot to asia  has some work ahead of her in rebuilding trust  analysts and former officials in asia said   with or without trump  this marks the end of u s  leadership  in particular  moral leadership   said a former japanese diplomat  who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic   i don t think it s a question of trump as an individual  but a question of the u s  society that produced this man as the republican candidate   trump upended u s  democratic traditions during his white house campaign  drawing enthusiastic crowds where people cheered his often provocative and outrageous remarks  critics labeled him ignorant  uncouth  a racist  hypocrite  demagogue and a sexual predator  all accusations he denied   he described a dark america  knocked to its knees by china  mexico and the islamic state   trump s harnessing of a populist backlash against immigration and global trade has challenged the ideal of benevolent american power that helped shape the global economy   and the forces of globalization   since the fall of the soviet union in the early   now the united states faces a rising china  long an economic force and now becoming more assertive in geopolitics    building its military capability and ignoring an international tribunal s ruling against its claims to most of the south china sea  trans pacific partnership  asia is most worried about trade protectionism   exports make up a quarter of asia s gdp and a fifth of them go to the united states  the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade deal  championed by barack obama in part to increase u s  influence in asia  was to be an essential feature of washington s strategic pivot to asia   an  economic nato     it now looks dead in the water  both clinton and trump oppose the deal  which would set up a free trade zone among  countries that excludes china  former indonesian finance minister chatib basri told reuters the tpp  is an important instrument for the u s  pivot to asia    there is some kind of a rivalry between america and china  and the way america can get into asia is with tpp   said basri   now a visiting professor at australian national university  with u s  allies such as japan  south korea  taiwan and singapore among the biggest winners of an open trade regime  a more isolationist and protectionist stance will cost washington influence in asia   ironically  it would be china  the subject of many of trump s tirades  that could emerge the big winner as uncertainty over washington s future commitment to asia pushes countries into dealing more closely with beijing   if the u s  pulls out of tpp  that will certainly increase china s influence in asia   said kanti bajpai  professor of asian studies at the lee kuan yew school of public policy in singapore   already  u s  criticism of domestic issues in thailand  the philippines  and malaysia has alienated those countries and caused them to lean towards beijing  pulling out of the tpp will help china geopolitically         philippine president rodrigo duterte has been particularly hostile towards washington over its criticism of his lethal anti drugs campaign  announcing a  separation  from the united states during last month s visit to china  malaysian prime minister najib razak came back from a visit to china last week with   billion worth of deals and an agreement to buy four chinese naval vessels         china has long been in trump s sights  with promises to declare it a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on imports  but any such moves could also hurt asian exporters who ship components there for assembly and export to the united states  at a time when global trade is already weakening  gareth leather  senior asia economist at capital economics  said the philippines  taiwan and south korea were the emerging asia economies most vulnerable to a trump presidency   perhaps the biggest risk to the region s economies  however  stems not from trump s trade policies  but from his foreign policy   leather said  trump has created doubts over his commitment to security alliances  suggesting japan and south korea need to pay more for a u s  military presence and that they should even develop their own nuclear capability to counter china and north korea  clinton  who was secretary of state when the obama administration launched its asia pivot  is expected to maintain obama s foreign policy  with some seeing her as being more hawkish  the divisive u s  presidential campaign has already done a lot of damage to the reputation of the united states in asia  regardless of the election outcome  according to some analysts   the broader question is whether the united states can assert global leadership   said jesper koll  ceo at fund manager wisdomtree japan    all my chinese friends say   we thought we would run the world in  years  now it s going to be in january   this is not a joke  it s the natural state of development   koll said
