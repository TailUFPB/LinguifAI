boston  reuters    a  new hampshire law prohibiting voters from taking selfies with their ballots on election day is an unconstitutional infringement on the right to free speech  a federal appeals court ruled on wednesday  the new england state had banned the practice  which has become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates  claiming that it would set the stage for a return of the vote buying scandals that rocked many u s  states in the  century  three new hampshire citizens  including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the  republican primary for the u s  senate  sued the state that year claiming the measure violated their rights to free expression  as protected by the first amendment of the u s  constitution  a federal court in new hampshire sided with them  but the state appealed  making its case in boston just two weeks ago  the appeals court swiftly rejected its arguments   the statute s purposes cannot justify the restrictions it imposes on speech   circuit judge sandra lynch wrote in the court s decision  new hampshire s argument that ballot selfies could lead to people selling their votes or being compelled by their employers to vote in a certain way fell short in no small part because the state had no evidence of that actually happening  lynch wrote   the legislative history of the bill does not contain any corroborated evidence of vote buying or voter coercion in new hampshire during the  and  centuries   she wrote   digital photography  the internet  and social media are not unknown quantities   they have been ubiquitous for several election cycles  without being shown to have the effect of furthering vote buying or voter intimidation   lynch also noted that several federal and state laws in effect in new hampshire already make it illegal to buy or sell a vote  which would allow prosecutors to take on allegations of election tampering even in an environment where selfies were permitted  other states  including nearby rhode island  have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies  partly reasoning that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process
