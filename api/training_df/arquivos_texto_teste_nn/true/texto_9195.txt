washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama formally endorsed hillary clinton s white house bid on thursday and called for democrats to unite behind her after a protracted battle with bernie sanders for the party nomination  u s  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts also backed clinton on thursday  telling msnbc s  the rachel maddow show  that presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump was  a genuine threat to the country   clinton  the presumptive democratic nominee  said it  means the world  to her that obama had her back in a bruising campaign for the nov   election   clinton also said she had the  highest regard  for warren  a fiery critic of wall street  and was  really pleased to have her good ideas and support   vice president joe biden also waded into the campaign on thursday   whoever the next president is  and god willing in my view it will be secretary clinton   biden said in a speech at the american constitution society in washington  the obama endorsement increases pressure on sanders  a u s  senator from vermont  to bow out of the race and lend his support to clinton so that the party can focus on defeating trump   it is absolutely a joy and an honor that president obama and i over the years have gone from fierce competitors to true friends   clinton told reuters in an interview  after an unexpectedly tough battle against sanders  challenge from the left  former first lady clinton made history when she reached the number of delegates needed to win the party nomination this week  that made her the first woman to lead a major u s  party as its white house candidate  obama  who enjoys rising approval ratings as he nears the end of eight years in office  will appear with clinton on the campaign trail next week in wisconsin  the two were opponents in the  democratic presidential primary race  which obama won  but they buried their rivalry and she served as his secretary of state for four years  clinton is the  candidate who the white house believes will best safeguard obama s legacy   i don t think there s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office   obama said of clinton in a video   i m with her  i am fired up  and i cannot wait to get out there and campaign for hillary    trump assailed the endorsement on twitter   he wants four more years of obama but nobody else does    clinton s campaign tweeted a brash response   delete your account   sanders  who galvanized young voters with his calls for more social equality and measures to rein in wall street  has been reluctant to concede the race  despite concerns among leading democrats that continuing party divisions could hamper clinton s efforts to beat trump  obama and other senior democrats are seeking a delicate balance of rallying the party behind clinton  while not alienating sanders and his supporters  in what appeared to be an attempt to gently ease sanders toward giving up his campaign  obama met the democratic socialist for about an hour in the white house  laughing warmly as they walked into the oval office  although sanders told reporters afterward that he still planned to compete in the final nominating contest in washington  d c   next tuesday  he said he would work with clinton to defeat trump   sanders was then welcomed on capitol hill by senator harry reid  the top democrat in the senate  reid said the lawmaker from vermont was in a  good place  with his democratic colleagues  he suggested that sanders was close to acknowledging defeat by clinton   i didn t hear a single word about him trying to change the fact that she is the nominee  i think he s accepted that   reid told reporters  in the endorsement video  obama recalled the party unity that followed his prolonged primary battle against clinton in    secretary clinton and senator sanders may have been rivals during this primary  but they re both patriots who love this country and they share a vision for an america that we all believe in   obama said  warren told msnbc she was endorsing clinton because  a female fighter in the lead is exactly what this country needs   warren s populist credentials will boost clinton s ability to court sanders voters as she prepares to battle trump  warren was the only female democratic u s  senator who did not endorse clinton during the primary race  clinton told reuters she and warren had similar views about issues such as economic policy and protecting the  dodd frank financial reform law and the consumer financial protection bureau  which warren pushed to start   trump said in an interview with reuters last month that he would try to dismantle the dodd frank law  in the interview with reuters  clinton said her overall economic package  including plans to rein in wall street and cut taxes for the middle class  would come during the first  days of her presidency if she defeats trump  clinton previously said a plan to generate jobs by investing in transportation and other infrastructure spending and immigration reform would be among other early priorities   one of the things that president obama said yesterday is he thought his job was to remind the american people what a really serious job this is  the tough choices  the hard decisions  the high stakes in choosing a president and commander in chief   clinton said   and i know how important it is to get off to a really good start in the white house   she said      trump  a wealthy real estate developer who became the party s presumptive nominee last month after seeing off a large group of rivals  is well behind clinton s campaign in terms of fundraising and policy infrastructure  on thursday  his top donors were holding their first official meeting in new york  trump also met with industry leaders in new york at an event organized by oil billionaire harold hamm
