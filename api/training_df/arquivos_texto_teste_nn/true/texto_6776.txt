washington  reuters    president elect donald trump rejected as  ridiculous  u s  intelligence reports that russia intervened in the presidential election on his behalf through targeted hacking  putting him at odds with top lawmakers who vowed to investigate the findings  he blamed democrats for news reports on the intelligence findings and said he did not believe they came from the central intelligence agency   i think it s ridiculous  i think it s just another excuse  i don t believe it   trump said in an interview on  fox news sunday    trump s reluctance to blame russia for interfering in the u s  election has raised concerns among u s  officials who fear he will go soft on moscow at a time when they are worried about its increasingly aggressive behavior on cyber attacks and in crimea  ukraine and syria  a u s  intelligence official  speaking on condition of anonymity  harshly criticized trump s rejection of the assessment that russian hacking was intended to boost the president elect s prospects in the nov   election   it s concerning that intelligence on russian actions related to the u s  election is being dismissed out of hand as false or politically partisan   said the u s  intelligence official    the inclination to ignore such intelligence and impugn the integrity of u s  intelligence officials is contrary to all that is sacred to national security professionals who work day and night to protect this country   the unusually harsh comment underscored the unprecedented tensions that trump has created with the intelligence community he will command even before he s been sworn into office  two leading u s  senate foreign policy voices from trump s own party expressed alarm on sunday about the possibility of moscow tipping the scales in favor of an american presidential candidate and promised to begin investigating immediately  the obama white house  which has ordered intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the  election  has formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations ahead of the presidential election  russian officials  who have previously vehemently denied accusations of interference in the u s  election  were quiet  in his search for a secretary of state  trump  a new york real estate magnate  is strongly considering exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson  who has close ties with moscow and has spoken out against u s  sanctions on russia  republican senator john mccain expressed concern about tillerson s close relationship with russian leader vladimir putin   that would color his approach to vladimir putin and the russian threat   he said on sunday on cbs   face the nation   a number of u s  senators have expressed concerns about tillerson  suggesting his nomination could run into trouble in the senate  trump s pick as national security adviser  retired army lieutenant general michael flynn  has also raised eyebrows in military circles through appearances on russia s government run broadcaster rt  particularly at a gala last year attended by putin  but trump s choices to lead the cia and the pentagon  u s   representative mike pompeo and retired marine general james mattis  are more likely to take a harsher stance on russia  u s  intelligence agencies have told congress and president barack obama s administration that russia has grown increasingly aggressive in syria and ukraine and has stepped up activities in cyberspace  including meddling  sometimes covertly  in european and u s  elections  a senior u s  intelligence official told reuters that intelligence agencies had concluded with  high confidence  that not only did their russian counterparts direct the hacking of democratic party organizations and leaders  but did so to undermine democratic candidate hillary clinton    trump questioned whether the cia was behind the reports that indicated moscow wanted him in the white house   i think the democrats are putting it out   he said in the fox news interview  he said the intelligence community did not agree on russian intervention   they re fighting among themselves  they re not sure   he said   mccain was at a loss on sunday to explain trump s repudiation of the russian meddling   i don t know what to make of it because it s clear the russians interfered   mccain said on cbs   whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate  i think that s a subject of investigation  but the facts are stubborn things   mccain and fellow republican senator lindsey graham joined democratic senators chuck schumer and jack reed on sunday in expressing concern over possible russian interference and said they would work together to investigate such cyber attacks   recent reports of russian interference in our election should alarm every american   they said in a statement   this cannot become a partisan issue  the stakes are too high for our country   mccain  chairman of the armed services committee  said he would have a subcommittee led by graham begin investigating the russian hacking immediately    republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan cannot comment on classified briefings   but he rejects any politicization of intelligence matters   spokeswoman ashlee strong said in an email  trump advisers disputed elements of the news reports  focusing particularly on a new york times story saying that intelligence officials concluded the computer systems of the republican national committee also had been hacked  the fact that material from that intrusion had not been released  the times reported  supported the conclusion that russia was trying to help trump    the rnc was absolutely not hacked   the rnc chairman and incoming white house chief of staff  reince priebus  said on nbc s  meet the press    trump adviser kellyanne conway said trump would not interfere with any congressional inquiry but that the president elect regarded the spate of hacking reports as part of an effort to relitigate the election    he absolutely respects the intelligence community   conway said on cbs   what he has said is laughable or ridiculous is that this was meant to elevate him to the presidency   in the  fox news sunday  interview  trump also discussed his decision to receive the president s daily brief  or pdb  a highly classified document that can include details of u s  and allied covert operations  once a week  far less often than most of his predecessors  trump said a number of his top advisers received the briefing and he did not need to get the report more frequently under routine circumstances   i don t need to be told the same thing every day  every morning   same words   sir  nothing has changed  let s go over it again   i don t need that   he said
