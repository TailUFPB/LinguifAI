washington  reuters    president donald trump  who has vowed to stop u s  manufacturing from disappearing overseas  will seek job creation advice on thursday from at least five companies that are laying off thousands of workers as they shift production abroad  caterpillar inc  cat n   united technologies corp  utx n   dana inc  dan n    co  mmm n  and general electric co  ge n   are offshoring work to mexico  china  india and other countries  according to a reuters review of u s  labor department records   executives from the five companies are among a group of business leaders due to meet with trump on thursday to discuss how to help the president deliver on his promise to increase factory employment  according to the white house  about   u s  workers at these five companies stand to  lose their jobs within the next two years as a result of offshoring  according to the labor department s trade adjustment assistance program  which provides retraining benefits to workers displaced by global trade  reuters obtained the information through a freedom of information act request   the companies confirmed the planned job cuts to reuters  it is not clear whether the other  executives due to meet with trump on thursday are currently offshoring work  as the taa program does not cover all workers who lose their jobs due to global trade  the lost jobs amount to a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of u s  workers employed by those involved in the meeting  general electric  for example  employs   u s  workers  financial filings show  on the campaign trail and in the white house  trump has painted globalization as a zero sum game that has enriched low wage countries while leaving the united states littered with abandoned factories and underemployed workers  and he has threatened to tax companies that offshore u s  jobs  the experience of companies on trump s task force  however  shows the reality is more complex in a world where they are serving customers across the globe  several said they were creating many new u s  factory jobs even as they move work to other countries   it s not clear whether trump will opt for the carrot or the stick  trump plans to meet business leaders to hear their reasons for  why they re going offshore   said a white house aide who spoke on condition of anonymity   blue collar workers who share trump s skepticism of global trade say they will be watching closely to see if he will try to save their jobs      i don t think he s a typical politician  so there is hope alive for middle class families that he will do something   said scott schmidt  one of  workers at a ge engine plant in waukesha  wisconsin who are due to lose their jobs later this year when the company shifts production to canada   general electric ceo jeffrey immelt is among those due to meet with trump on thursday  ge says it is closing its waukesha plant because congress has hobbled the u s  export import bank s ability to finance large export orders while most other industrialized nations still offer such financial support  the company says it laid off  workers last year at a houston factory for the same reason  shifting production to france  the united kingdom and hungary      ge says it is also closing an ohio factory and laying off  workers because consumers are buying fewer of the florescent and incandescent light bulbs they make there  what production remains will be handled by a factory in hungary  the u s  economy lost  million manufacturing jobs from  to   roughly one third of its total  in part due to offshoring  but the sector has added   jobs since then  according to the u s  bureau of labor statistics   multinational companies say labor costs now are only one factor they consider when deciding where to manufacture  an auto maker  for example  may decide to build a particular model in the country where sales are strongest  prompting parts suppliers to set up there as well so they can turn around orders quickly   the offshoring picture is also more complex than official statistics indicate as a shuttered factory in the united states does not always mean a new factory abroad  when auto parts maker dana corp closes a factory later this year in glasgow  kentucky that is operating at  percent of capacity  one of its plants in ohio will pick up the work  along with other factories in mexico  india and china  dana ceo james kamsickas is among those scheduled to meet with trump on thursday  the company plans to hire nearly  u s  workers over the next three years as it expands factories in four u s  states  spokesman jeff cole said      that is little comfort to the  people in kentucky who will lose their jobs      it seems like all these ceos and companies have turned their backs on the american worker   said dana employee tim wells  one of those who will be laid off  the group also includes united technologies ceo gregory hayes  who took heat from trump last year for planning to move jobs from indianapolis to mexico  the company struck a deal with the incoming president in november to preserve roughly  jobs in exchange for   million in tax breaks  united technologies says it still plans to lay off  workers at a separate indiana plant and move production to mexico this year  the company is also moving work from a facility in arden hills  minnesota  resulting in a loss of  jobs  most of that work is staying in the united states but some is moving to poland  spokeswoman bethany sherman said  and some of the affected workers will be offered positions elsewhere  the company is adding more than   new jobs in the united states  sherman said  other participants include caterpillar chairman doug oberhelman  who oversees a company that is laying off  workers in the american south and midwest and moving the work to china  mexico  italy  france and germany as it weathers the largest sales slump in its history  a caterpillar spokesman said it is simultaneously creating   new manufacturing jobs elsewhere in the united states   also due to participate is inge thulin  ceo of   which is eliminating  jobs in suburban cincinnati and moving production to mexico  the company says it has added more than   u s  manufacturing jobs over the last five years
