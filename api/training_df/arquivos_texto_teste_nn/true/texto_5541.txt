 washington  reuters    in his first call as president with russian leader vladimir putin  donald trump denounced a treaty that caps u s  and russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the united states  according to two u s  officials and one former u s  official with knowledge of the call   when putin raised the possibility of extending the  treaty  known as new start  trump paused to ask his aides in an aside what the treaty was  these sources said   more top stories japan s love of tiny cars a sore spot for trump trump changes tack  backs  one china  policy trump then told putin the treaty was one of several bad deals negotiated by the obama administration  saying that new start favored russia  trump also talked about his own popularity  the sources said   the white house declined to comment on the details of the call  white house spokesman sean spicer said trump knew what the new start treaty is but had turned to his aides for an opinion during the call with putin  he said the notes from the call would not have conveyed that    i would say they had a very productive call   spicer told reporters  he added   it wasn t like he didn t know what was being said  he wanted an opinion on something    it has not been previously reported that trump had conveyed his doubt about new start to putin in the hour long call   new start gives both countries until february  to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads to no more than    the lowest level in decades  it also limits deployed land  and submarine based missiles and nuclear capable bombers   during a debate in the  presidential election  trump said russia had  outsmarted  the united states with the treaty  which he called  start up   he asserted incorrectly then that it had allowed russia to continue to produce nuclear warheads while the united states could not   don t miss uaw confirms workers at tesla have approached the union trump s mexican wall just got    billion more expensive two democratic members of the senate foreign relations committee  senators jeanne shaheen and edward j  markey  criticized trump for deriding what they called a key nuclear arms control accord    it s impossible to overstate the negligence of the president of the united states not knowing basic facts about nuclear policy and arms control   shaheen said in a statement   new start has unquestionably made our country safer  an opinion widely shared by national security experts on both sides of the aisle    daryl kimball  the executive director of the arms control association  a washington based advocacy group  said   unfortunately  mr  trump appears to be clueless about the value of this key nuclear risk reduction treaty and the unique dangers of nuclear weapons    secretary of state rex tillerson said he supported the treaty during his senate confirmation hearings   during the hearings tillerson said it was important for the united states to  stay engaged with russia  hold them accountable to commitments made under the new start and also ensure our accountability as well    two of the people who described the conversation were briefed by current administration officials who read detailed notes taken during the call  one of the two was shown portions of the notes  a third source was also briefed on the call   reuters has not reviewed the notes taken of the call  which are classified   the kremlin did not immediately respond to requests for comment   the phone call with putin has added to concerns that trump is not adequately prepared for discussions with foreign leaders   typically  before a telephone call with a foreign leader  a president receives a written in depth briefing paper drafted by national security council staff after consultations with the relevant agencies  including the state department  pentagon and intelligence agencies  two former senior officials said   just before the call  the president also usually receives an oral  pre briefing  from his national security adviser and top subject matter aide  they said   trump did not receive a briefing from russia experts with the nsc and intelligence agencies before the putin call  two of the sources said  reuters was unable to determine if trump received a briefing from his national security adviser michael flynn   in the phone call  the russian leader raised the possibility of reviving talks on a range of disputes and suggested extending new start  the sources said   new start can be extended for another five years  beyond   by mutual agreement  unless they agree to do that or negotiate new cuts  the world s two biggest nuclear powers would be freed from the treaty s limits  potentially setting the stage for a new arms race   new start was ratified by the u s  senate in december  by a vote of  to   thirteen republican senators joined all of the senate s democrats in voting for the treaty  although republican opponents derided it as naive   the call with putin was one of several with foreign leaders where trump has turned to denounce deals negotiated by previous administrations on trade  acceptance of refugees and arms control   in a phone call with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull  trump questioned an agreement reached by the obama administration to accept   refugees now being held by australia in offshore detention centers
