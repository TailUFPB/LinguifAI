orlando  reuters    ask john mica why he sticks by donald trump  amid the defections of many fellow republicans  and the u s  congressman from central florida instead touts his own work on easing traffic congestion in this tourism mecca  ask again about his support for trump and the mild mannered mica shows subtle signs of becoming annoyed  mica has become adept at tiptoeing around trump questions as his support for the controversial presidential candidate complicates his effort to extend a  year reign in congress  the race between mica and his democratic challenger  newcomer stephanie murphy    could be a bellwether for republicans who seek to support the party s presidential nominee while maintaining a safe distance from some of trump s more controversial positions and alleged bad behavior   the course of the campaign could provide clues on whether republicans maintain control of the house of representatives in a year in which trump has shaken his party and the political world with his bombast   voters in his orlando district  don t care about all this garbage that s going on  in the presidential race  says mica  as he steers the conversation to improving healthcare for military veterans  creating jobs and expanding local airports  mica s re election bid is also made unusually tough because of a newly drawn congressional district that gives democrats hope of a win   murphy has sought to use mica s support for trump against him by saying that just as mica has stuck with trump too long  he follows republican leaders in congress all too often  she ticks off mica s support for gun positions pushed by the powerful national rifle association  especially after june s massacre in orlando of  people at a gay nightclub  murphy has said mica is out of step with the reconfigured district  which she said is  evenly split  and not especially partisan   as mica campaigns on his ability to deliver goods to his district in the form of job creation and infrastructure investment  democrats are making sure to remind voters that he is aligned with the man who arguably is one of the most controversial major party presidential candidates in history  democrats punctuate that with a photo of trump and mica side by side at a  ceremony celebrating the start of construction of a trump hotel in washington  early trends of mail in ballots in the  congressional district point to a competitive race  in orange county    democrats have cast early votes compared to only   republicans and   independents  orlando may be famous as the home of the fantasy land that is disney world  but mica s district is a real life mirror of america  its residents are politically divided  in this case about evenly split between republicans and democrats and with a strong dose of independent voters  furthermore  as in other parts of the country  latino voters in central florida are building political muscle  as mica    wages a ground war that has him knocking on constituents  doors in orlando s heat and humidity  he walks a fine line  he is a grandson of immigrants who boasts of being  hard nosed  against  amnesty  for the  million immigrants in the united states illegally  but he suggests there could be exceptions to trump s promise to deport them all  building a wall on the southern border with mexico  a linchpin of trump s campaign  should be done  where it makes sense   mica said during an interview with reuters amid a lunchtime crowd of mainly hispanic customers at the lechonera el barrio restaurant  still  as prominent republicans offended by the tenor of trump s campaign  including house speaker paul ryan  distance themselves from trump  mica stands firm  saying   i m pretty much a party loyalist   such loyalty can come with a price  though  and mica acknowledges   i m stuck with the republican  presidential  nominee  whom he said made  vulgar  reprehensible  remarks about sexual advances on women captured in a  videotape that recently became public  but there is an upside to supporting trump as well  mica said some supporters want to know that he is sticking with the nominee   these people are very passionate  they re going to be voting   he said  miriam ramirez  a former republican legislator in puerto rico who lives part time in florida and has been stumping for mica  worries trump could complicate mica s re election   asked whether mica s appeal to the district s booming puerto rican population could suffer because of his association with trump   ramirez said   yes  especially in lower income families   murphy  who came to the united states as a child after she and her family escaped vietnam and were adrift in the south china sea before being rescued by the u s  navy  said trump s  hateful and divisive rhetoric  has voters worried that he  will act on the prejudices he has laid out  if elected   voters choose political leaders they believe will do the best for them but also represent the best in them   murphy said  challenging mica s support of trump  one thing seems certain in the closing weeks of the campaign  mica is staying on message as he tiptoes around trump  instead talking about the  interstate  highway  massive rebuild  and the airport in seminole county that  had weeds growing up   out of the runway  and now supports thousands of jobs       changes to  grandson  from
