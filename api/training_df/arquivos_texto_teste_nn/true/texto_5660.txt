washington  reuters    the trump administration on friday imposed sanctions on iran   which it said were just  initial steps  and said washington would no longer turn a  blind eye  to iran s hostile actions  the sanctions on  individuals and entities were the opening salvo by president donald trump who has vowed a more aggressive policy against tehran and came two days after the administration had put iran  on notice  following a ballistic missile test   the trump administration will no longer tolerate iran s provocations that threaten our interests   national security advisor michael flynn said   the days of turning a blind eye to iran s hostile and belligerent actions toward the united states and the world community are over   flynn said in a white house statement  suggesting that more concrete action could follow if iran does not curb its ballistic missile program and continues support in regional proxy conflicts  a senior administration official said the latest sanctions were the initial steps in response to iran s  provocative behavior   the administration was  undertaking a larger strategic review  of how it responds to iran  iran denounced the sanctions as illegal and said it would impose legal restrictions on american individuals and entities helping  regional terrorist groups   state tv quoted a foreign ministry statement as saying  those affected under the sanctions cannot access the u s  financial system or deal with u s  companies and are subject to secondary sanctions  meaning foreign companies and individuals are prohibited from dealing with them or risk being blacklisted by the united states  the white house said that while the sanctions were a reaction to recent events  they had been under consideration before  it added that a landmark  deal to curb iran s nuclear program was not in the best interest of the united states  white house spokesman sean spicer said the missile test did not violate the nuclear agreement   it s not a direct violation     i think there is no question that it violates the spirit of that   spicer said in an interview with msnbc  he said the nuclear agreement was a  sweetheart deal  for iran  citing a foreign ministry statement  iran s semi official fars news agency said the missile program is  the undeniable and inalienable right of our nation under international law and the un charter  any foreign interference in this regard is a violation of international law   the new designations stuck to areas that remain under sanctions even with the  nuclear deal sealed between iran and world powers in place  such as the islamic revolutionary guard corps  an elite military body that is powerful in iranian politics and the economy  and iran s ballistic missile program  zarif led iran s delegation at the nuclear negotiations in   among those affected by the sanctions were what it said was a lebanon based network run by the revolutionary guards   the list is actually so targeted and comparatively mild  it leads one to surmise that it may have been a set of targets devised by the obama administration  and was ready to go when trump came into office   said adam smith  former senior advisor to the director of the u s  treasury department s office of foreign assets control   as such  the real test for which way the trump team will go on iran may well be not this list release but the next one  whenever that occurs   smith said  the sanctions  impact will be more symbolic than practical  especially as they do not affect the lifting of broader u s  and international sanctions that took place under the nuclear deal  also  few of the iranian entities being targeted are likely to have u s  assets that can be frozen  and u s  companies  with few exceptions  are barred from doing business with iran      meanwhile  the u s  moved a navy destroyer  the uss cole  close to the bab al mandab strait off the coast of yemen to protect waterways from houthi militia aligned with iran  german foreign minister sigmar gabriel on friday expressed understanding over the sanctions  but warned against conflating sunday s test with the nuclear deal  earlier on friday  trump tweeted   iran is playing with fire   u s  senator mark warner expressed support for the sanctions  adding   i urge the administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards iran  and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric   or provocative tweets   that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges   some of the entities sanctioned by the u s  treasury are based in the united arab emirates  lebanon and china  among those affected were companies  individuals and brokers the u s  treasury said support a trade network run by iranian businessman abdollah asgharzadeh  treasury said he supported shahid hemmat industrial group  which the united states has said is a subsidiary of an iranian entity that runs iran s ballistic missile program  hasan dehghan ebrahimi  a beirut based official with the revolutionary guard s qods force  which runs its operations abroad  was put under sanctions for acting on behalf of the qods force  treasury said  three lebanese companies involved in waste collection  pharmaceuticals  and construction were also listed under the sanctions for being owned or controlled by muhammad abd al amir farhat  one of ebrahimi s employees  treasury said he has facilitated millions of dollars in cash transfers to lebanese militant group hezbollah  two of his employees and a company he manages were also sanctioned  treasury said ebrahimi and his employees used a lebanon based network to transfer funds  launder money  and conduct business
