washington  reuters    a u s  senator seen by silicon valley as one of the technology industry s main foes in congress is fighting for his political life as donald trump s slumping poll numbers threaten to damage republican candidates across the board           senator richard burr from north carolina  the chairman of the senate intelligence committee  is facing a strong and unexpected challenge from democrat deborah ross       though tech policy is unlikely to decide the race  a burr defeat would remove from the scene a lawmaker who has feuded with u s  tech companies over digital privacy and encryption  ross  a former head of the state s chapter of the american civil liberties union  is fighting an uphill battle   north carolina has voted republican in every presidential election from  until   when it backed barack obama by a thin margin  the state went for republican mitt romney in   burr    was not expected to face a challenge this year  in what he has said will be his last congressional campaign  but republican presidential candidate trump s numbers have slumped nationwide and in north carolina  a battleground state in the nov   presidential election  declining support for trump  a property developer and television personality who has never held elected office  has put burr  who endorsed trump  and other republicans in jeopardy  said carter wrenn  a republican consultant in north carolina   we re not sure it s a wave here for democrats  but it s beginning to look that way   wrenn said   any republican running down here ought to be very concerned about trump s impact   a poll from nbc news wall street journal marist in early august showed ross leading burr  percent to  percent  though other polls have given burr a narrow edge  burr has been in congress for more than  years and is distantly related to aaron burr  u s  vice president in the early   if burr were to lose  democrats would be one seat closer to reclaiming a senate majority from republicans  the concerns of companies such as apple inc  google and facebook are not a key issue for north carolina voters  but the race s outcome could affect future handling of data encryption and privacy matters  for a year  burr has been crafting legislation that would force apple and other companies to weaken the security of their products in a way that would give u s  law enforcement access to encrypted devices and communications   the fbi has said that the growth of strong default encryption makes it more difficult for investigators to access communications of criminal suspects  even with a warrant  silicon valley  cyber security experts and civil liberties advocates say strong encryption is essential to ward off hackers and maintain the overall security of the internet  the encryption debate is decades old  but it boiled over earlier this year due to a dispute between apple and the fbi over unlocking an iphone linked to one of the shooters in a san bernardino  calif   rampage in   several u s  tech companies and privacy groups  asking not to be named because they do not typically take public positions on candidates  told reuters they are eager to see burr lose  his efforts to require encryption backdoors in u s  technology products are the main reason  while other lawmakers have been critical of silicon valley in the encryption debate  none has been as antagonistic as burr  the sources said  andrew mclaughlin  a former white house technology official who now is head of content at the publishing site medium  tweeted in may   trump s win endangers gop senators  america s tech community should rally to defeat richard burr  for his idiotic war on internet security   mclaughlin declined an interview request from reuters   burr spokeswoman becca glover watkins said the senator had worked closely with california senator dianne feinstein  the top democrat on the intelligence panel on the encryption issue  she said the two had worked on a  number of bipartisan national security issues including their encryption proposal  and burr planned to continue engaging with tech companies  on the challenges posed by encryption and cyber threats   ross  a lawyer and former state legislator  has not clarified whether she sides with apple in its dispute with the fbi  in a statement to reuters  she said that  protecting our law abiding citizens  privacy doesn t mean sacrificing our security   tech interests  so far  have not donated sizeable amounts of money to ross  according to a review of contributions  however  laurene powell jobs  the widow of apple co founder steve jobs  in june made an unspecified donation to ross  according to u s  federal election commission records  the political action committee that supports oregon senator ron wyden  a democrat  vocal defender of encryption and frequent opponent of burr  gave    to ross this year  burr s pac later gave    to wyden s republican challenger in oregon  at a national level  apple ceo tim cook and other tech executives have helped raise money for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  silicon valley has almost universally shunned trump  troubled largely by his rhetoric on immigration and his stated desire to shut down the internet to fight extremists
