honolulu  reuters    u s  president barack obama on friday signed into law an annual defense policy bill  but in a lengthy statement he raised objections to parts of it  including policies blocking him from closing the detention center at guantanamo bay  cuba  obama pledged in his  presidential campaign to close the military prison  but his efforts have been blocked by mostly republican opposition in congress  the democratic president has instead reduced the population there by transferring prisoners to other countries   the administration recently told congress it would move up to  more prisoners of the  remaining at guantanamo before obama leaves office next month   during my administration  we have responsibly transferred over  detainees from guantanamo   obama said in the statement on friday   our efforts to transfer additional detainees will continue until the last day i am in office   president elect donald trump  who will be sworn in on jan    said during the campaign that he would keep the guantanamo bay facility open and vowed to  load it up with some bad dudes   the    billion defense spending bill passed by the republican controlled congress this month was a compromise version that dropped controversial language requiring women to register for the draft  but it kept some republican backed initiatives obama had opposed  the legislation boosts military spending when there has been no similar increase in non defense funding  and it bars closures of military bases even though top pentagon officials say they have too much capacity      house of representatives speaker paul ryan  a republican  said on friday the legislation would give u s  troops a pay raise and praised the guantanamo language   this ensures that  right up until his last hour in office  president obama will not be able to transfer guantanamo bay detainees to the united states   ryan said in a statement  obama s predecessor george w  bush opened the facility to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas following the sept   attacks  under bush  the prison came to symbolize aggressive detention practices that opened the united states to accusations of torture  obama has maintained for years that he considers  onerous restrictions  on his ability to transfer prisoners a violation of the u s  constitution s separation of powers between congress and the executive branch  but he gave no indication he would try to override those restrictions  reflecting the growing migration of espionage and warfare into cyberspace  obama also said on friday that he favors splitting the u s  cyber command  which conducts offensive operations  from the national security agency and making it independent  similar to the military s european and pacific commands
