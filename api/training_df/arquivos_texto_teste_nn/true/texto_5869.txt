washington chicago  reuters    steve loomis  president of the cleveland police patrolmen s association  had a blunt message for donald trump during a meeting in september  court ordered reforms aimed at curbing police abuses in the midwestern city are not working  loomis and two other attendees said trump seemed receptive to loomis s concerns that federally monitored police reforms introduced during the obama administration in some cities in response to complaints of police bias and abuse are ineffective and impose an onerous burden on police forces   trump  loomis said  was  taken aback by the waste of money  when the union chief told him that federal monitors overseeing his city s police department earned   an hour   a standard salary for the position    i think he s going to have a more sensible approach to rising crime rates   loomis said of now president trump   what i got from the meeting was that donald trump is going be a very strong supporter of law and order   emboldened by trump s election  some of the country s biggest police groups want to renegotiate  consent decrees  agreed to under president barack obama  the police labor groups said in interviews  consent decrees are agreements between a police force and the justice department that can prescribe changes to use of force  recruiting  training and discipline  they are enforced by a federal court with the oversight of court appointed monitors  currently  police departments  including seattle and miami  are operating under the decrees  the police groups want to discuss the decrees with jeff sessions  trump s designee for attorney general who has voiced criticism of them  although any renegotiation would be legally complicated because all parties as well as a federal judge must approve any changes   there are certainly decrees that are inartfully applied that we d like to see revisited   said jim pasco  the head of the fraternal order of police  the nation s largest police union with   members  it endorsed trump in september and has worked with sessions  a republican senator from alabama  for years while lobbying congress for pro police policies   we ve always found him a man who s willing to listen to alternatives to a previously charted course   pasco said of sessions  civil rights groups are alarmed at the possibility that the decrees could be unraveled  saying they have been an important tool for the government to try to address issues like excessive use of force by police in baltimore and an officer shooting in ferguson  missouri that led to nationwide protests    trump officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the meeting with loomis  while trump has not publicly commented on consent decrees  he has expressed strong support for police departments and unions  and on jan   the white house said he wants to end the  dangerous anti police atmosphere in america   there have been questions by police and conservative politicians over the effectiveness of the consent decrees  which give the justice department power to obtain court orders imposing reforms on police forces that routinely violate civil rights through practices such as unlawful stops and seizures  racial discrimination  and illegal uses of force  the federal program was authorized by congress in  in the aftermath of riots in los angeles sparked by the police beating of rodney king  some police unions complain the decrees stigmatize police and impose overly restrictive limits on use of force  they also chafe at what they see as misguided federal prescriptions to local problems and have fought the reforms in court   a reform agreement that the justice department negotiated with the new orleans police department in   for instance  has been  extraordinarily expensive  to implement  said donovan livaccari  the lawyer for the louisiana fraternal order of police  the city of new orleans is footing the bill  the obama administration negotiated  reform agreements with law enforcement agencies during obama s eight years in office after finding patterns of excessive force  racial bias  poor supervision and other issues  more than double the  agreements reached under the previous bush administration   vanita gupta  the last obama appointed head of the justice department s civil rights division  which investigates and recommends reforms for police departments  defended the use of consent decrees in an interview  saying they are apolitical ways of improving public safety and making policing more effective   bill johnson  head of the national association of police organizations  which represents about   officers  said he expects local police associations to examine existing consent decrees to see whether the justice department under obama overstepped in imposing any measures      some police union officials say they have been encouraged by comments by sessions  who has said that federal inquiries  smear  police departments and  undermine respect for officers     under attorney general sessions  it ll be more   okay  there s a problem  let s craft an agreement as best we can and cure it  and then move onto the next thing    johnson said       union officials said they expect the trump administration to initiate and reach fewer binding reform agreements with police departments  and they hope sessions will work with them to try to re negotiate some of those existing agreements  sessions said in his confirmation hearing on jan   that he  wouldn t commit that there wouldn t be any changes  to existing consent decrees when he becomes attorney general if police departments show improvement before they have fully complied with the terms of the decree    a trump transition official said sessions would not comment on his testimony until after the senate votes on his appointment  that vote is not expected until february  not all union leaders agree that the decrees  costs outweigh the benefits      sean smoot  who directs the police benevolent   protective association of illinois and serves as a monitor for the cleveland police reform agreement  said the federal inquiries prompt cities to hire more cops and invest in better equipment      the decrees have had mixed results  reforms in some cities  such as los angeles  have resulted in higher public satisfaction with police and declines in reports of police use of force  in other places  such as ferguson  the city has missed multiple deadlines for implementing reforms required by its decree      civil rights advocates in chicago say that given trump s law and order platform they fear his administration will neglect the justice department s findings from a  month long investigation into the police force   issued in the last days of the obama administration  the justice department s jan   report found that chicago police routinely used excessive force and violated the constitutional rights of residents  particularly minorities  city officials signed an agreement to negotiate a consent decree  but with trump in the white house   it s not clear where the leverage is going to come from for the reforms   said jamie kalven  founder of the invisible institute  a nonprofit group which advocates for police transparency   the white house did not respond to a request for comment about kalven s concerns  jonathan smith  the obama appointed former chief of special litigation in the justice department s civil rights division  said he is confident that most agreements reached during the obama era will remain intact because they are overseen by judges who are  committed to their implementation        in cleveland  for instance  the judge who oversees the reform agreement that loomis s union is objecting to recently rejected any efforts to renegotiate it
