 reuters    seattle financial worker harrison karlewicz had been considering joining an environmental activist group for a while  the day after donald trump won the white house  he signed up   that was a big push for me  kind of a wakeup call   the  year old said  after joining  seattle  a group that stages mass protests against fossil fuel use   i thought   i don t feel involved  i want to get out there    during his campaign  trump said global warming was a hoax and called for the environmental protection agency to be gutted  he promised to  cancel  the paris climate agreement between the united states and nearly  other countries to slow climate change  and he pledged to revive the coal industry  karlewicz represents what environmental activists say is the silver lining of trump s electoral victory  environmentally minded people angered by the outcome are rallying to their cause  at  seattle  people packed a volunteer drop in meeting  after news of trump s confirmed win  said organizer emily johnston  the group blocked a rail line in washington state that transports oil to shell and tesoro refineries earlier this year        this was surprising to me  because i personally was so shaken that i felt practically paralyzed  and i know many other people did  too   johnston said   the fact that many others responded by immediately engaging is incredibly heartening   jay o hara  a vermont based climate change activist with the climate disobedience center and a mastermind behind a coal shipment blockade in  that spurred more radical fossil fuel activism  said trump s win represents an opportunity for environmentalists to focus on a clear enemy   in some ways  it can almost be seen as a relief   he said of trump s win   we are going to have a real fight here  or maybe an actual argument   johnston  of  seattle  who camped for a week at north dakota s standing rock sioux reservation to protest pipeline construction  said that protesters would continue to take advantage of the vulnerability of energy infrastructure   all these pipelines  all these tankers  all these trains have to go through thousands of miles  and could be potential protest targets  she said  some of the well established national environmental organizations that helped draft the obama administration s environmental initiatives  like the clean power plan to curb carbon dioxide emissions  will be shifting to a defensive posture under trump s leadership   we ll be in the congress  in the courts  in the boardrooms and in the streets   said gene karpinski  president of the washington based league of conservation voters  which backed trump s democratic rival hillary clinton and spent over   million to support candidates in the  elections  karpinski said he expected legal action to prevent trump from following through on his agenda   trump has appointed myron ebell  a known climate skeptic  to guide the reshaping of the epa  and trump energy adviser kevin cramer  a u s  representative from north dakota  said trump is likely to target the clean power plan and waters of the united states rules during his first  days in office  dan farber  an environmental law professor at the university of california  berkeley school of law  said the best that advocates for climate change action could hope for from  courts is to  play successful defense against an anti environmental onslaught  from the new administration       it s a fairly grim situation   he added  several groups also said they would put a greater focus on state level environmental initiatives to sidestep trump s administration   the sierra club  which is headquartered in california  said it would push ahead with its beyond coal campaign  which has led to the retirement of hundreds of coal plants since it was launched more than a decade ago  the campaign mobilizes local activists and lawyers to push utilities and state regulators to shutter older plants and replace them with renewable energy    clearly  we are going to have to fight and resist the worst impulses of the next administration   said michael brune  sierra club s executive director   but we are also mindful that despite all odds  we were able to make great progress during the bush administration and we hope to do it again
