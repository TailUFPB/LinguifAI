new york  reuters    two groups that support far reaching curbs on legal immigration to the united states and ideological screening of would be immigrants to test their beliefs say donald trump s presidential campaign has consulted them on his immigration policy  numbersusa and the center for immigration studies  which for years have denied accusations they harbor radical views on immigration  told reuters they had met or had telephone calls with either trump or senior members of his campaign over the past year  trump s campaign declined to confirm the meetings  trump  the republican nominee  has won over millions of supporters with his calls for a wall on the mexican border and a temporary ban on muslims entering the country  but the calls have also drawn an outcry from immigrant rights groups and condemnation from abroad   while trump s immigration proposals push the republican party sharply to the right  numbersusa and cis also want to slash legal immigration  going beyond the new york businessman s call to keep it  within historical norms   numbersusa says on its website that immigrants are the main driver of population growth  take jobs that should go to u s  workers  and fuel urban sprawl that threatens farmland and wildlife habitats    the aim should be to halt all immigration possible   numbersusa head roy beck wrote in a blog in march  numbersusa wants to cut legal immigration to   a year immediately  said chris chmielenski  the group s director of content and activism  about a million immigrants obtain legal permanent residence status in the united states every year  according to the u s  department of homeland security  around  million undocumented immigrants were living in the united states in   down from a peak of  million in   according to the pew research center  the head of cis  mark krikorian  has argued against legal immigration extensively  last year he wrote in the national review that mass legal immigration would end u s  conservatism  because immigrants tend to have more liberal views on issues like gun rights  beck told reuters he had met with trump in new york and had also spoken with people  at the top  of his campaign repeatedly since last autumn  when numbersusa accepted invitations to meet several republican presidential hopefuls  much of the contact was by phone and email  beck would not provide details of what was discussed or say who took part in the discussions  in early august  numbersusa shared a  point immigration plan with the trump campaign  of the  points  six were echoed by trump in a major immigration speech on aug    those points included calls for the immediate deportation of undocumented immigrants with criminal records and the mandatory use of the  e verify  system to check a job applicant s legal status   the trump campaign declined to comment on the apparent overlap  the policy was written with input from senator jeff sessions of alabama  former new york mayor rudy giuliani  as well as immigration and customs enforcement officers and border patrol agents  beck said the overlap showed the  convergence  of ideas between his group and the campaign but he acknowledged he had  no indication that they sat down and looked at our  steps and said let s take six of them       based in arlington  virginia  numbersusa describes itself as the  the nation s largest grassroots immigration reduction organization with more than  million participants   it is credited with helping block immigration bills in  and  that aimed to make it easier for undocumented immigrants to become citizens  krikorian  of cis  whose slogan is  low immigration  pro immigrant   said his group had also received requests for research and studies from the trump campaign for months   in an aug   speech  trump outlined his plan for  extreme vetting  of immigrants  calling for an ideological test to gauge their views on things like religious freedom  gender equality and gay rights to ensure the country only admits people  who share our values and respect our people    cis was an early proponent of ideological screening   widely criticized as discriminatory and a violation of freedom of thought   to protect u s  culture and national security following the sept      attacks  but it was unclear if trump consulted cis on the idea  the department of homeland security already requires people seeking legal status in the united states to show they adhere to the principles of the constitution  krikorian took part in a roundtable of national security advisers at trump s new york headquarters in august  after which he said he was asked by trump s campaign to be a  surrogate   a surrogate can act on behalf of a campaign  by speaking at rallies and other events  krikorian said he turned down the trump campaign s request   hate watchdog groups like the southern poverty law center and the anti defamation league have accused numbersusa and cis of attempting to use mainstream arguments to sell proposals aligned with white nationalism   these are the organizations that are the leading edge of the nativist movement in this country   said frank sharry  executive director of immigrants  rights group america s voice   both organizations reject the claims   we re absolutely opposed to nativism   said beck  adding that numbersusa s recommendations come from a desire to protect american workers  his group stresses that it blames bad immigration policy and not immigrants themselves  krikorian said cis wants  an ethnically neutral policy that lets in fewer people in the future and does a better job of welcoming those people we do legally admit to our country    adds dropped word   plan   in paragraph
