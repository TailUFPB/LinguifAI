washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday dropped a u s  commitment to a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict  the  longstanding bedrock of washington s middle east policy  even as he urged israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to curb settlement construction  in the first face to face meeting between the two leaders since trump s victory in the  election  the republican president backed away from a u s  embrace of the eventual creation of a palestinian state  upending a position taken by successive administrations and the international community   i m looking at two states and one state  and i like the one both parties like   trump told a joint news conference with netanyahu   i can live with either one   trump vowed to work toward a peace deal between israel and palestinians but said it would require compromise on both sides  leaving it up to the parties themselves ultimately to decide on the terms of any agreement  but he offered no new prescription for achieving an accord that has eluded so many of his predecessors  and palestinian anger over his abandonment of their goal of statehood could scrap any chance of coaxing them back to the negotiating table   dropping a bombshell on netanyahu as they faced reporters just before sitting down for talks  trump told him   i d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit   the right wing israeli leader appeared momentarily startled  it was a rare concession sought by trump as the two leaders tried to set a new positive tone after eight years of friction  under trump s democratic predecessor  president barack obama  netanyahu insisted that jewish settlements were  not the core of the conflict  and made no public commitment to reduce settlement building in the occupied west bank  he later told reporters traveling with him that he hoped to  reach an understanding  with trump on settlements  trump echoed netanyahu s calls for palestinians to recognize israel as a jewish state   something they have refused to do   and to halt incitement against israelis  but even as trump promised to pursue peace  saying  it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand   he made no effort to address the deep distrust and other obstacles that have prevented any substantive negotiations since   setting an initially chummy tone  trump greeted netanyahu on a red carpet rolled out to the white house driveway  the two leaders smiled  shook hands and chatted amiably before heading inside  accompanied by first lady melania trump and netanyahu s wife  sara  among the questions that figured prominently on the agenda was the future of the two state solution   the idea of creating a palestine living peacefully alongside israel  foreshadowing trump s policy shift  a senior white house official said on tuesday that peace did not necessarily have to entail palestinian statehood  palestinians responded by warning trump that such a move would seriously damage u s  credibility  giving a meandering response to a question on the issue  trump suggested that he could abide by whatever path the two sides decided   i m happy with the one they like the best   he said  palestinian president mahmoud abbas seized on trump s settlements comment to demand a complete halt to such building   which palestinians see as meant to deny them a viable state   and said he remained committed to  the two state solution and to international law   united nations secretary general antonio guterres warned   against abandoning the idea of a sovereign palestinian state alongside israel  saying there was  no alternative   netanyahu committed  with conditions  to the two state goal in a speech in  and has broadly reiterated the aim since  but he has also spoken of a  state minus  option  suggesting he could offer the palestinians deep seated autonomy and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty  at the news conference  he never ruled out a two state solution  but also made it sound like an almost impossible ideal  he said it would require preconditions  including the palestinians  recognition of israel as a jewish state and israel s retaining security control  in the area west of the jordan river    which would encompass all of the west bank  netanyahu and trump shared several warm handshakes during the news conference  especially after trump s opening remarks  when he said the united states was israel s greatest friend  but trump also managed to catch netanyahu off guard  at one point saying that if a solution to the israel palestinian conflict was going to be reached  both sides will have to make compromises   the president then turned to netanyahu and said   you know that  right   netanyahu replied with a chuckle   both sides   the two leaders agreed that there was an opening for enlisting israel s arab neighbors   which share its concerns about iran   into any future peace efforts  but a retreat from the principle of palestinian statehood would cast doubt on the chances for cooperation from the broader arab world  martin indyk  a former middle east negotiator under obama and now at the brookings institution think tank in washington  said of the possibility that washington might ditch its support for an independent palestinian nation   it s another nail in the coffin of the peace process  which already had a lot of nails in it   the one state idea would be deeply problematic for both sides  one concept would be two systems for two peoples  which palestinians would see as apartheid  another version would mean equal rights for all  including for palestinians in an annexed west bank  but that would compromise israel s jewish character  palestinians have expressed fear that their leadership will be frozen out by netanyahu s close bond with trump  but cia director mike pompeo met abbas in ramallah on tuesday  u s  and palestinian officials said  for netanyahu  the talks with trump are an opportunity to reset ties after a frequently combative relationship with obama  the prime minister  under investigation at home over allegations of abuse of office  wanted no visible gaps between u s  and israeli thinking during his visit  trump  who has been in office less than four weeks and whose foreign policy apparatus is in disarray following the forced resignation of his national security adviser michael flynn   brings with him an unpredictability that netanyahu s staff hoped would not impinge on the discussions  the two leaders  who seemed to strike up an emerging  bromance  in social media exchanges since the u s  election  sought to demonstrate good personal chemistry face to face as well  meetings with obama were at best cordial and businesslike  at worst tense and awkward  in one oval office encounter in   obama grimaced as netanyahu lectured him in front of the cameras on the suffering of the jewish people through the ages
