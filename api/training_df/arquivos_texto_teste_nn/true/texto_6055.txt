washington chicago  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration has moved since he took office last week to curb the flow of information from several government agencies involved in environmental issues  in actions that may have been designed to discourage dissenting views  employees at the environmental protection agency  the interior department  the department of agriculture and the department of health and human services  hhs  have seen directives from the newly minted leadership seeking to limit how they communicate to the public  according to multiple sources  the moves have reinforced concerns that trump  a climate change doubter  could seek to sideline scientific research showing that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming  as well as the career staffers at the agencies that conduct much of this research  all of the agencies affected by the actions have some input on issues related to the environment and have been involved in various efforts related to climate change  including effects on natural resources and human health  on tuesday  a source at the epa said that staff had been told by members of the trump administration not to speak to reporters or publish any press releases or blog posts on social media  epa staff have also been asked not to publicize any talks  conferences  or webinars that had been planned for the next  days  the staffer said  asking not to be named  asked if the epa had been gagged  white house press secretary sean spicer said on tuesday   i don t know     we re looking into it      i don t think it s a surprise we re going to review the policies  but i don t have any info at this time   the agency also was asked by the white house on monday to temporarily halt all contracts and grants pending a review  according to multiple sources  the epa awards billions of dollars worth of grants and contracts every year to support programs around environmental testing  cleanups and research   epa staff have been reviewing grants and contracts information with the incoming transition team   epa spokeswoman julia valentine said in a statement   the goal is to complete the grants and contracts review by the close of business on friday  jan     environmental groups reacted with outrage  new york s attorney general  eric schneiderman  said in reaction to the freeze that his office  will examine all legal options to ensure the epa meets its obligations to keep our state s air and water safe   u s  department of agriculture employees on monday were also  informed in a memo seen by reuters that all communications with the media should be approved by the administration  and social media posts should be reviewed by managers  to remove references to policy priorities and initiatives of the previous administration     the department  meanwhile  disavowed another email sent on monday to its scientific research unit ordering the suspension of releasing  any public facing documents   including news releases and photos  saying it was sent without permission and should not include a ban on publication of peer reviewed scientific papers   officials at hhs also received a memo ordering them not to send  any correspondence  to other public officials   instead  they must refer any requests for information to senior leaders  who are not to do anything until they have received instructions from the white house staff on its policies  according to a source who read the memo   last week  staff at the interior department were told to stop posting on twitter after an employee retweeted posts about the relatively low attendance at trump s inauguration  and about how the issues of climate change and civil rights had disappeared from the white house website  the department has since resumed tweeting   though some tweets have been deleted  on tuesday  badlands national park  located in south dakota and part of the department of interior  posted a series of tweets about climate change   today  the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last   years   climate   one of the tweets read  by tuesday afternoon  the tweets were gone  a national park service official said the tweets had been posted to the badlands national park account by a former employee who was not authorized to use it   the park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realized that their account had been compromised   the official said  national park service social media managers are being encouraged to use twitter to post public safety and park information but not content related to national policy issues  the official said  trump has promised to promote oil drilling and mining by cutting regulation  including by targeting former president barack obama s initiative to combat climate change  trump also has suggested pulling the united states out of a global pact on climate change signed by nearly  countries last year   trump s nominees to run the epa  interior and the department of agriculture   oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  representative ryan zinke of montana and former georgia governor sonny perdue  respectively   are awaiting senate confirmation   trump has drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro drilling think tanks to build a team charged with preparing the epa for its new leadership  according to a list of the newly introduced  member team seen by reuters on monday  an epa spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment
