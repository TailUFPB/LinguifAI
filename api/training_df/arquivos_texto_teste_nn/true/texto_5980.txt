philadelphia  reuters    president donald trump pushed republican lawmakers on thursday for swift action on a sweeping agenda including his planned u s  mexican border wall  tax cuts and repealing the obamacare law  despite tensions over timetables and priorities  congressional republicans were in philadelphia for a three day retreat to hammer out a legislative agenda  with the party in control of the white house  senate and house of representatives for the first time in a decade   this congress is going to be the busiest congress we ve had in decades  maybe ever   trump said in a speech to the lawmakers at a philadelphia hotel   enough  all talk  no action   we have to deliver   trump added  but trump did not hold an expected question and answer session with the lawmakers  and his speech veered into side issues such as predicting crowd size for an anti abortion march in washington  alleging american voting irregularities and touting winning pennsylvania in the nov   election  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  who initially hesitated in endorsing trump last year and has criticized him on some issues  disputed the notion that congressional republicans were not in synch with the new york businessman who was sworn in less than a week ago having never previously held public office   we are on the same page with the white house   ryan said during a joint news conference with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   this is going to be an unconventional presidency   ryan added   i think you know this by now      i think we re going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that  i think that s just something that we re all going to have to get used to   trump pressed the lawmakers for action on repealing and replacing democratic former president barack obama s affordable care act  known as obamacare  even as republicans scramble to devise a replacement plan  and lowering taxes on  all american businesses  and the middle class  for weeks  republicans talked about formulating an agenda for the first  days of trump s presidency  in recent days  the talk has turned into a  day agenda for passing major legislation before the lawmakers  august recess   it s going to take more than simply  days   ryan said  ryan said that it is  our goal is to get these laws done in    without guaranteeing that a replacement for obamacare and a tax reform bill would be enacted by the end of december   mcconnell said lawmakers will take up legislation to provide   billion to   billion to pay for trump s planned wall along the u s  mexico border  trump signed an executive order on wednesday for the wall to proceed  part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration  although the action has tested already frayed relations with mexico  house republican leader kevin mccarthy said the pace of legislative action may frustrate trump   president trump comes from a different world   mccarthy told reporters   out in the business community  he likes things done fast  and he s going to continue to push them   thousands of anti trump protesters took to the streets in philadelphia  a heavily democratic bastion that is one of the cities that could be stripped of federal funds for protecting illegal immigrants under a trump directive  marchers carried signs including   fascist pig    protect my health care    immigration makes america great    planet over profit  and  impeach trump   during his speech  trump took time to explain his side of the story on mexico s president canceling a meeting next week because of trump s insistence that america s southern neighbor eventually pay for the wall  mexico has said it will not  trump said a tax reform bill  will reduce our trade deficits  increase american exports and will generate revenue from mexico that will pay for the wall  if we decide to go that route   mcconnell and ryan did not say whether congress would offset the wall s cost by cutting other programs or simply add to huge budget deficits that republicans have criticized for years  ryan and mcconnell also indicated congressional republicans do not plan to modify u s  law banning torture even as trump considers bringing back a cia program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas  black site  prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used   i think the director of the cia  mike pompeo  has made it clear he s going to follow the law  and i believe virtually all of my members are comfortable with the state of the law on that issue now   mcconnell said   torture s not legal   ryan said   and we agree with it not being legal  in a highly unusual move for a visiting foreign leader  british prime minister theresa may  who will see trump in washington on friday  addressed the retreat  calling herself a  fellow conservative who believes in the same principles that underpin the agenda of your party   she was loudly applauded for praising trump s victory   because of what you have done together  because of that great victory you have won  america can be stronger  greater  and more confident in the years ahead   may said
