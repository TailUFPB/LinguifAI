washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on wednesday he  will absolutely do safe zones in syria  for refugees fleeing violence in the war torn country  saying europe had made a tremendous mistake by admitting millions of refugees from syria and other middle eastern trouble spots  trump told abc news in an interview   i don t want that to happen here    i ll absolutely do safe zones in syria for the people   he added  without giving details  according to a document seen by reuters on wednesday  trump is expected to order the pentagon and the state department in coming days to craft a plan for setting up the  safe zones   a move that could risk escalation of u s  military involvement in syria s civil war  the draft executive order awaiting trump s signature signaled the new administration was preparing a step that trump s predecessor  barack obama  long resisted  fearing the potential for being pulled deeper into the bloody conflict and the threat of clashes between u s  and russian warplanes over syria   the secretary of state  in conjunction with the secretary of defense  is directed within  days of the date of this order to produce a plan to provide safe areas in syria and in the surrounding region in which syrian nationals displaced from their homeland can await firm settlement  such as repatriation or potential third country resettlement   the draft order said  creation of safe zones could ratchet up u s  military involvement in syria and mark a major departure from obama s more cautious approach  increased u s  or allied air power would be required if trump chooses to enforce  no fly  restrictions  and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas   still  the document gave no details on what would constitute a safe zone  exactly where they might be set up and who would defend them  jordan  turkey and other neighboring countries already host millions of syrian refugees  the turkish government had long pressed obama  without success  for creation of a no fly zone in syria on its border with turkey  the draft raised the possibility of establishing those safe havens in neighboring countries but did not elaborate  trump s call for a plan for safe zones is part of a larger directive expected to be signed in coming days that includes a temporary ban on most refugees to the united states and a suspension of visas for citizens of syria and six other middle eastern and african countries deemed to pose a terrorism threat  it represents a modified version of the blanket ban on muslims entering the united states that trump initially advocated on the campaign trail last year  sparking criticism from human rights groups and across the u s  political spectrum  u s  military officials had long warned that the creation of no fly zones inside syria would require a large number of additional resources beyond the fight against islamic state and it would be difficult to ensure that jihadist insurgents did not infiltrate those areas amid the chaos of syria s civil war  some republican lawmakers have advocated the creation of such zones  especially to protect civilians fleeing the conflict against attacks by forces loyal to syrian president bashar al assad  during and after the presidential campaign  trump called for no fly zones to harbor syrian refugees as an alternative to allowing them into the united states  trump accused the obama administration of failing to properly screen syrian immigrants  entering the united states to ensure they had no militant ties  obama s aides have insisted the vetting was meticulous and none of the syrian refugees allowed in have been implicated in any attacks   on the campaign trail  trump gave no details as to how he might go about creating such havens  except to say that he would ask gulf states to help pay   all the questions of setting up a safe zone are still there   a u s  official said   if you re going to declare a safe zone  there s a lot of other things  that would have to be analyzed and put in place before it becomes feasible  among the biggest questions would be how to avoid confrontations with russian forces in syria helping keep assad in power    under the broader executive order  which the draft document says is intended to  protect the american people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals   trump would impose a  day suspension of the entry of immigrants from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  the temporary halt is aimed at giving the homeland security secretary  the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence enough time to determine what information is needed from each country to ensure visas are not issued to individuals that pose a national security threat  according to the draft  countries that do not provide adequate information about their nationals will be required to do so within  days or risk being blocked from entering the united states  that would exclude diplomatic visas  nato visas and visas for travel to the united nations  it would also suspend the overall u s  refugee program for  days so the government can study the process and determine if additional checks are necessary  but that could be waived on a case by case basis  it would completely stop refugee processing of syrians until  i have determined that sufficient changes have been made  to the refugee program to ensure  its alignment with national interest   the draft said
