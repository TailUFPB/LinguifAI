london  reuters    the united states will switch course on climate change and pull out of a global pact to cut emissions  said myron ebell  who headed u s  president donald trump s environmental protection agency  epa  transition team until his inauguration  ebell is the director of global warming and international environmental policy at the competitive enterprise institute  a  u s  conservative think tank  and helped to guide the epa s transition after trump was elected in november until he was sworn in on jan    trump  a climate skeptic  campaigned on a pledge to boost the u s  oil and gas drilling and coal mining industries by reducing regulation  he alarmed nations that backed the  paris agreement to cut greenhouse gases by pledging to pull the united states out of the global deal agreed by nearly  countries  however  trump told the new york times in november that he had an  open mind  on the agreement  trump s administration has asked the epa to halt all contracts  grants and interagency agreements pending a review  sources said   the u s  will clearly change its course on climate policy  trump has made it clear he will withdraw from the paris agreement  he could do it by executive order tomorrow or he could do it as part of a larger package   ebell told reporters in london on monday  the top energy official for the european union  meanwhile  said he hoped that trump would stick to the paris deal   i wouldn t hide that in discussion with our partners  there is a lot of anxiety over future u s  policies   said european commission vice president maros sefcovic  who was a key broker in clinching paris agreement   if the  u s  administration decides to go in a different direction  i think sooner or later they will have to come back to the realization that climate change is happening       the timing of any action by trump is difficult to predict because government departments are still in transition  ebell said  adding that he had not met trump in person   any country wanting to pull out of the paris agreement after ratifying it has to wait four years  a source on trump s transition team said last year that there were speedier alternatives  such as sending a letter withdrawing from the  international framework accord that is the parent treaty of the agreement  voiding u s  involvement in both in a year s time  or issuing a presidential order simply deleting the u s  signature from the paris accord  ebell said the  cleanest way  would be to withdraw from the united nations framework convention on climate change itself   whether the u n  secretariat wants the u s  to continue to have a seat at the table is up to them  i don t think trump cares about that  the people who elected him would prefer not to have a seat at the table   ebell said  trump appointed oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  who has led  lawsuits against the epa  as the agency s administrator  though a vote on his nomination has not been scheduled  the president has also drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro drilling think tanks to build its landing team for the epa  according to a list of the newly introduced  member team seen by reuters on monday  ebell also said he thought the political make up of the federal energy regulatory commission  which reviews applications for the construction and operation of natural gas pipelines  will change dramatically under trump   given the way the campaign went  i think you will see very quick executive action to expedite lng  liquefied natural gas  terminals and pipelines   he said
