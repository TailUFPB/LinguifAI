washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump s transition team has asked two cabinet departments for the names of government officials working on programs to counter violent extremism  according to a document seen by reuters and u s  officials  the requests to the state department and the department of homeland security involve a set of programs that seek to prevent violence by extremists of any stripe  including recruitment by militant islamist groups within the united states and abroad  reuters could not determine why the trump team asked for these names  the trump team did not immediately respond to a request for comment  trump has frequently criticized president barack obama for not doing enough to battle islamic militants and for his refusal to use the term  radical islam  to describe islamic state and other militant groups  some career officials said they feared the incoming administration may be looking to undo the work that the obama administration has done on countering violent extremism   they re picking a few issues to ask for people s names   said one government official who spoke on condition of anonymity  reflecting wider fears that those who worked on such issues could be marginalized by the new administration  earlier this month  trump representatives had asked the u s  energy department for the names of staffers who worked on climate change policy  the white house expressed concern that it may have been an attempt to target civil servants  including scientists and lawyers  the energy department balked at providing names and a trump spokesman disavowed the request  the state department declined to comment on specific requests from the trump transition team  the department of homeland security did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment      in a dec   email seen by reuters  trump representatives at the state department sought a list of positions in the counterterrorism bureau s office of countering violent extremism   please indicate names of people serving in those roles and status  political or career    the email said  referring to political appointees and career civil servants  three u s  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said a similar request had been made to the department of homeland security  dhs   in that case  the trump transition team asked for the names of members of an interagency task force on countering violent extremism that the obama administration established in january  the officials said  according to a jan   dhs statement  the task force falls under the leadership of dhs and the department of justice  and includes officials from the federal bureau of investigation  the national counterterrorism center and other government agencies  several of trump s top national security advisers have cast the fight against islamic militants as an existential conflict between civilizations  according to a review of their writings and public remarks  retired lieutenant general michael flynn  trump s pick for white house national security adviser  said in a post on twitter earlier this year   fear of muslims is rational   some counterterrorism experts say that such rhetoric can be used by militant groups to recruit  and will alienate muslim communities whose help is needed to prevent violence  a u s  official said their guess was that the trump team will likely rebrand obama s generic fight against violent extremism into a specific battle against islamic radicalization state department spokesman john kirby told reporters on thursday that the department would be cautious about providing names of employees associated with specific issues  but left open the possibility of providing names on an organizational basis  it was unclear whether the state department shared the names of the officials in the office on countering violent extremism or whether homeland security officials provided names   without getting into the specifics of information either requested by the transition team or provided by the department  i can tell you that     i know of no requests that have been denied   a senior state department official said
