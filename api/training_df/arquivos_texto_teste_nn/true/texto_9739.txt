washington  reuters    a revised criminal justice reform bill moved closer to a full u s  senate vote on thursday when it gained support from more republicans after being stalled for months in congress  in a legacy shaping issue for president barack obama  the measure s sponsors announced four new republican co sponsor senators and a new version of the bill at a press conference in the senate  the measure now has  co sponsors  according to senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley  grassley said he had been waiting for the bill to be finalized before asking senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to bring it up for a full senate vote  but that  it is time for those discussions to start right now   as revised  it still lowers mandatory minimum sentences for some non violent federal drug offenders  but it no longer applies to anyone convicted of a serious violent felony  that change was a response to conservative critics of the bill  which is central to obama s efforts to overhaul the country s federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding  that effort has been a rare example of republican and democratic agreement in the polarized congress    the bill s advocates have said they hope the revisions and new co sponsors  such as republican senators mark kirk of illinois and steve daines of montana  will convince mcconnell to bring up the bill for a senate vote  daines and kirk lent their support after adding minor requirements  including a provision that savings from it go toward purposes such as fighting gangs of national significance  after a group of conservative republican senators led by tom cotton of arkansas claimed in january the reforms would release violent felons  the bill s authors began excising parts of the proposal that eased the sentences of violent criminals   the bill now includes a new mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving the opiate fentanyl  mirroring parallel sentencing reforms that await a floor vote in the u s  house of representatives  the house legislation is likely to contain changes to  mens rea  laws that govern criminal intent  said senator john cornyn  a sponsor of the senate bill  at thursday s press conference   mens rea reform was excluded from the senate measure because its authors were divided on the issue  democratic lawmakers generally oppose strengthening mens rea requirements on the grounds it would enable more corporate malfeasance as it is difficult to prove the  intent  of a corporation  to exclude violent criminals from the senate bill  the authors removed a section that lowered minimum sentences for unlawful gun owners with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses  known as  armed career criminals    such criminals represent nearly a fifth of the   current inmates who would have been eligible for resentencing under the old bill  according to the u s  sentencing commission
