washington  reuters    if the russian government is behind the theft and release of embarrassing emails from the democratic party  as u s  officials have suggested  it may reflect less a love of donald trump or enmity for hillary clinton than a desire to discredit the u s  political system  a u s  official who is taking part in the investigation said that intelligence collected on the hacking of democratic national committee  dnc  emails released by wikileaks on friday  indicates beyond a reasonable doubt that it originated in russia   the timing on the eve of clinton s formal nomination this week for the nov   presidential election has raised questions about whether russia may have been trying to hurt her  to help trump  her republican rival  or to fan populist sentiment against establishment politicians as it has sought to do across europe in recent years   certainly russia has become a master at manipulating information for their strategic goals  witness the information bubble they have created for their threatening behavior in the crimea  the ukraine and elsewhere   said former cia and national security agency director michael hayden   a step like this  however  would be really upping their game   the emails showed that dnc officials explored ways to undermine u s  senator bernie sanders  presidential campaign against clinton and raised questions about whether sanders  who is jewish  was really an atheist  the disclosures confirmed sanders  frequent charge that the party played favorites against him and clouded a party convention clinton hoped would signal unity  not division  two u s  intelligence officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the hack could be part of a broader campaign by russian president vladimir putin to push back against what he thinks is an effort by the european union and nato  a military alliance of european and north american democracies  to encircle and weaken russia  one of the officials called the fear  a hangover  from putin s service in the kgb  the soviet intelligence agency   time and again  we re seeing russia push back at what putin considers russia s mortal enemies   said the other official   he s been actively attacking the u s  backed rebels in syria  buzzing ships and planes in the black sea and the baltic  not to mention invading ukraine and seizing crimea  this fits the pattern   despite clinton s short lived attempt as secretary of state to  reset  u s  russian relations after u s  president barack obama took office in   the leaked emails could damage a candidate the kremlin may consider hostile and benefit her opponent  who has been friendlier  putin accused clinton of stirring up protests against his rule after a december  russian parliamentary election that was marred by allegations of fraud  saying she had encouraged  mercenary  kremlin foes by criticizing the vote   she set the tone for some opposition activists  gave them a signal  they heard this signal and started active work   putin told supporters  asked about claims that russian intelligence had hacked the dnc to obtain the emails  wikileaks founder julian assange told nbc news  richard engel  there is no proof of that whatsoever  and said  this is a diversion  pushed by the clinton campaign  trump s warmer toneanalysts said russia s goal may be much broader than simply meddling in the u s  presidential election   it s a gross oversimplification to suggest that the russian government is all in for donald trump   said andrew weiss  a russia analyst at the carnegie endowment for international peace  a washington based think tank   it s in russia s interest     to portray the united states as riven with popular discontent  xenophobia and high level political corruption   weiss said   it fits nicely with the kremlin s standard narrative     that the white house rushes to criticize others without getting its own house in order   the russian leader may well have been encouraged by trump s comments to the new york times last week that with him in the white house  nato might not automatically defend the baltic states that were once a part of the russian led soviet union      despite public trump putin exchanges of praise  eugene rumer  a former national intelligence officer for russia and eurasia  warned against reaching any quick conclusions about putin s view of trump       we can say with some degree of confidence that they don t like hillary   rumer said   it s less clear that they like trump  although over the years the russians have said they prefer to deal with the republicans    that  they are kind of hard line but they can do deals   a diplomat with experience working on russia said the kremlin also might be betting that clinton will win and is sending a shot across her bow       messing with her like this now puts her on notice that these are tough guys that she s got to be really careful with   said the diplomat  who spoke on condition of anonymity  a u s  intelligence official who is reviewing the emails as part of the investigation into their origin said that those emails describing the privileges the democratic national committee showers on its wealthiest donors bolster the russian narrative of an american political system rigged by the wealthy and riddled with corruption   in addition to countering the u s  narrative that the russian government is a corrupt oligarchy  leaking these emails fits rather conveniently with trump s charges about a rigged system and  crooked hillary    said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss domestic politics
