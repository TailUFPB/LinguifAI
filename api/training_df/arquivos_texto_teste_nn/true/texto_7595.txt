pensacola  fla   las vegas  reuters    democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump attacked one another s character as they pushed their closing arguments six days before the u s  presidential election  while the latest reuters ipsos poll showed clinton s lead over trump rising back to the margin she held last week  many national polls have shown clinton s lead over trump narrowing since the re emergence friday of a controversy over her use of a private email while secretary of state  but the latest reuters ipsos daily tracking poll released on wednesday showed clinton s lead over trump rising back up to  percentage points  the same advantage she held before the fbi announcement related to her email practices   signs of a tightening race have rattled financial markets as investors started to factor in the possibility that the new york businessman might pull off a victory on nov    world stocks  the dollar and oil fell on wednesday  while safe haven assets such as gold and the swiss franc rose  clinton has been regarded as the candidate who would maintain the status quo  an important factor to financial markets  which generally do not like uncertainty  campaigning in pensacola  florida  trump predicted he would win  telling supporters at the outdoor rally   it s feeling like it already  isn t it   we ve got to be nice and cool  nice and cool  alright  stay on point  donald  stay on point  no sidetracks  donald  nice and easy   said trump  whose campaign has at times been damaged by controversial unscripted remarks  trump argued that clinton was unqualified to lead the country  calling her  totally unhinged   speaking to supporters in las vegas  clinton blamed trump for pitting americans against one another  citing his rhetoric on groups like muslims and mexican americans  trump  she said  is  out of his depth   and she called his proposals on foreign policy issues  incredibly dangerous    he doesn t have a clue   clinton said   investor anxiety has deepened in recent days over a possible trump victory given uncertainty about his stance on issues including foreign policy  trade relations and immigrants  trump  who has never previously run for elected office  has run an unorthodox campaign  with policy proposals including reviewing trade pacts such as the north american free trade agreement and imposing a temporary ban on muslims seeking to enter the country  currency traders have sold the dollar this week in part because they suspect trump would prefer a weaker dollar given his protectionist stance on international trade  and in part because the uncertainty surrounding a trump win might lead to a more dovish stance from the federal reserve in the months ahead  instead of the interest rate hike that many expect by year end  a rise in u s  interest rates would make the dollar  and dollar denominated assets  more attractive to investors  a reuters equity market poll last month showed a majority of forecasters predicted that u s  stocks would perform better under a clinton presidency than a trump administration  an average of polls compiled by the realclearpolitics website showed clinton just   percent ahead of trump nationally on wednesday  with  percent support to his   percent  clinton s position is stronger than national polls imply given that the race is decided by the electoral college system of tallying wins on a state by state basis  winning the presidency requires a majority of  electoral votes  and democrats have a built in advantage with large states such as california and new york traditionally voting democratic   clinton looked likely to win at least  electoral votes  meaning she would need to pick up votes in  toss up  states such as florida  north carolina  virginia  ohio  iowa  arizona  colorado and nevada  according to estimates by realclearpolitics on wednesday afternoon  trump  on the other hand  has a steeper path to climb  looking likely to win  electoral votes  meaning he needs more votes from the battleground states  the website showed  both candidates are focusing their final campaign efforts on those crucial states  trump and clinton have campaigned intensively in recent weeks in florida  which yields a rich haul of  electoral votes  a realclearpolitics average of polls in the state puts trump   point ahead of clinton   in north carolina on wednesday  clinton deployed president barack obama to make the case that trump posed a unique threat to the future of the country    the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders   obama told supporters in chapel hill  calling trump temperamentally unfit to lead the nation  trump s campaign announced plans to run three ads during wednesday night s game seven of the world series  held in cleveland  ohio s second biggest city  the ads focus on the renewed controversy surrounding clinton s email server  in an ad titled  corruption   an announcer says   hillary cut deals for donors  now the fbi has launched a new investigation  after decades of lies and scandal  her corruption is closing in
