baton rouge  la  washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump on friday said he was considering imposing a lifetime ban on u s  military procurement officials going to work for defense contractors  a move that could dramatically reshape the defense industry  three days after publicly rebuking boeing co over the cost of the next generation air force one presidential aircraft  trump floated the idea of such a ban at a rally for republican supporters in baton rouge  louisiana   i think anybody that gives out these big contracts should never ever  during their lifetime  be allowed to work for a defense company  for a company that makes that product   trump said   i don t know  it makes sense to me   he added that he  got the idea yesterday  as he thought about  massive  cost overruns for military equipment but needed to  check this out  first before making any decisions  trump said such a ban would make  a big  big difference because the purchasing in this country is out of control  for everything  not only military   the president elect s idea was met with deep skepticism within the u s  defense establishment procurement and weapons program management jobs have long been a good alternative career path within the pentagon for military officers who did not win coveted command jobs  a u s  defense official  speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity  said such a ban would likely discourage people from taking procurement jobs in the pentagon and cause more attrition   the reason a lot of people go in and stay in is because it makes for a nice transition later to a civilian job  it could make people want to avoid that   the official said after being asked about trump s announcement  current rules prohibit pentagon employees from working on the same acquisition matter in the private sector  said andrew hunter  a former pentagon official now at the center of strategic and international studies  a washington think tank  but an industry wide ban on hiring former pentagon officials could backfire badly  he said   no one is going to want to take those jobs  you re going to have the worst of the worst  because no one with any particular talent is going to want a career where they are going to be banned for life for doing what they were trained to do   said hunter  who is director of the center s defense industrial initiatives group  congressional aides also told reuters they were skeptical that such a ban could be enacted  trump singled out lockheed martin s f  stealth fighter jet program for criticism at the louisiana rally  saying it was  totally  totally  like  uncontrollably over budget   the f  is the pentagon s costliest arms program  the defense department expects to spend   billion to develop the plane and buy   of the supersonic  stealthy new warplanes in the coming decades  costs per plane are expected to fall below   million as production ramps up
