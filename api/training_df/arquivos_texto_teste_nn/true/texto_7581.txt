sydney  reuters    the death of australian batsman phillip hughes was a  tragic accident  and not as a result of a failure to enforce the rules of the game or inadequate safety equipment  the new south wales  nsw  coroner s court ruled on friday  hughes was hit on the back of the neck by a rising delivery when playing for south australia in a domestic match at the sydney cricket ground on nov      he died two days later in a sydney hospital  after reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine whether the  year old s death could have been avoided  nsw state coroner michael barnes said he could find no evidence to support the view of hughes  family that he had died in a  very unsafe workplace    the family s grief at losing their much loved son and brother was exacerbated by their belief that unfair play had contributed to his death   said barnes   it is hoped that they accept the compelling evidence that the rules were complied with  phillip was excelling at the crease as he so often did and that his death was a tragic accident   the helmet worn by hughes came under the spotlight following his death  though the nsw coroner said the batsman s death could not have been avoided by wearing different protective equipment   australia s cricket board in may made it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of hughes  the family had been angered that hughes had been subjected to threatening language from an opponent and had suffered a sustained spell of aggressive short pitched bowling that contravened the rules of the game      barnes accepted hughes had received a barrage of short pitch blowing  but all of which fell within the rules of the game  the court said it was unable to rule on whether hughes had been subjected to threatening language  though barnes said it was implausible that no  sledging  had occurred at all during the day   hopefully  the focus on this unsavoury aspect of the incident may cause those who claim to love the game to reflect upon whether the practice of sledging is worthy of its participants   said barnes    an outsider is left to wonder why such a beautiful game would need such an ugly underside
