cincinnati  reuters    when larry harmon tried to vote on a marijuana initiative in november in his hometown of kent  ohio  the  year old software engineer found his name had been struck from the voter rolls  two hours south in zanesville  restaurant worker chris conrad    was also told he was no longer registered  both men later found out why  they had not voted often enough  as the nov   elections loom  officials in ohio have removed tens of thousands of voters from registration lists because they have not cast a ballot since    all u s  states periodically cleanse their voter rolls  but only a handful remove voters simply because they don t vote on a regular basis  and nowhere could the practice have a greater potential impact in the state by state battle for the white house than ohio  a swing state that has backed the winner in every presidential election since   voters of all stripes in ohio are affected  but the policy appears to be helping republicans in the state s largest metropolitan areas  according to a reuters survey of voter lists  in the state s three largest counties that include cleveland  cincinnati and columbus  voters have been struck from the rolls in democratic leaning neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate as in republican neighborhoods  that s because residents of relatively affluent republican leaning neighborhoods are more likely to vote in both congressional elections and presidential contests  historical turnouts show  democrats are less likely to vote in mid term elections and thus are more at risk of falling off the rolls   in the three biggest counties  at least   voters have been removed  the reuters analysis found  the statewide total is unclear  each of the state s  counties manages its own voter rolls  which generally are not made public   unlike other voting rights disputes that have sparked protests and lawsuits  the practice doesn t appear to be driven by one specific party  both republican and democratic officials in ohio have purged inactive voters over the past  years  but neighborhoods that have a high proportion of poor  african american residents are hit hardest  the reuters analysis found   it s absolutely unfair   said donna porter jones  an organizer at amos project  an interfaith group that aims to register   voters from some of cincinnati s poorest neighborhoods ahead of november   ohio secretary of state jon husted  a republican  says canceling registrations for voters who missed three straight federal elections helps keep voting rolls current  since   the state has cleared out more than  million records of people who have moved or died  he said   those who don t vote over a six year stretch or respond to a postcard mailed to their address have only themselves to blame  he said   if this is really important thing to you in your life  voting  you probably would have done so within a six year period   he said in an interview  people who don t respond to the postcard can be removed from voting lists if they sit out the next two federal elections  many other states only remove voters from the rolls if they have died or moved to a new address   you shouldn t be struck of your right to vote because you skipped an election   said kathleen clyde  a democratic state representative who has been fighting the practice  four civil liberties groups sued to end the practice last month  arguing that it violates federal law and unfairly targets low income and minority voters    voting rights advocates say they are concerned that many infrequent voters who helped drive turnout to a record in the  presidential election won t be able to vote in this year s likely matchup between democrat hillary clinton  vying to become the first female president  and republican donald trump  the celebrity billionaire  the ohio lawsuit is one of a number being fought across the country  photo id requirements and other efforts to tighten voting laws have spurred fierce partisan battles and protests in recent months  they follow a supreme court decision in  that struck down parts of the voting rights act  a signature achievement of the civil rights movement in the   the ohio dispute  by contrast  centers on a practice that has been in place for decades but is receiving new attention from civil liberties groups and democrats ahead of november    we are pleased the courts are reviewing the state s actions   said pratt wiley  national director of voter expansion at the democratic party in washington  republican party officials at the local and national level  as well as the trump campaign  did not respond to requests for comment  but tom fitton  the head of judicial watch  a conservative group that has pushed ohio and other states to keep their voting lists up to date  described the lawsuit as a  power play  by civil liberties groups  to ensure that candidates they like are able to steal elections if necessary    federal law prohibits states from removing voters solely because they haven t voted  but it also requires them to keep voter lists up to date  ohio residents who are removed from voting lists must re register at least  days before an election   harmon  the software engineer  backed president barack obama in  but has sat out presidential and congressional elections since then  he says he initially thought he had done something wrong to get kicked off the voting rolls   i felt embarrassed and stupid at the time   said harmon  who is involved in the ohio lawsuit   the more i think about it  the madder i am   he said  in cleveland s cuyahoga county   percent of voters in neighborhoods that backed obama by more than  percent in  were purged last year due to inactivity  according to the reuters analysis of the voter lists  in neighborhoods where obama got less than  percent of the vote    percent of registered voters were removed for that reason  in franklin county  home to the state capital columbus   percent of voters in democratic leaning neighborhoods have been purged since  due to inactivity  only  percent of voters in republican leaning neighborhoods have been purged    the disparity is especially stark in hamilton county  where affluent republican suburbs ring cincinnati  which has one of the highest child poverty rates in the country  in the heavily african american neighborhoods near downtown  more than  percent of registered voters have been removed due to inactivity since   in suburban indian hill  only  percent have been purged due to inactivity   overall    voters have been removed due to inactivity since   a larger figure than obama s margin of victory that year    on a recent rainy afternoon  amos project canvasser marcia mackey tried to get some of those voters back in the system  wielding a clipboard and a smile  mackey asked pedestrians in the over the rhine neighborhood north of downtown cincinnati when they last cast a ballot  if they couldn t remember  she encouraged them to register again   people don t know they ve been purged until they go to the election site and get turned away   mackey said   we need to make sure that people have voices
