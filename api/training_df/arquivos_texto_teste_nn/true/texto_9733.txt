london  reuters    donald trump s first major foreign policy address alarmed american allies  who view the republican front runner s repeated invocation of an  america first  agenda as a threat to retreat from the world  while most governments were careful not to comment publicly on a speech by a u s  presidential candidate  germany s foreign minister veered from that protocol to express concern at trump s wording   i can only hope that the election campaign in the usa does not lack the perception of reality   frank walter steinmeier said   the world s security architecture has changed and it is no longer based on two pillars alone  it cannot be conducted unilaterally   he said of foreign policy in a post cold war world   no american president can get round this change in the international security architecture      america first  is actually no answer to that   carl bildt  a former swedish prime minister and foreign minister who served as un envoy to the balkans in the aftermath of the yugoslav wars of the   said he heard trump s speech as  abandoning both democratic allies and democratic values    trump had not a word against russian aggression in ukraine  but plenty against past u s  support for democracy in egypt   bildt said on twitter  referring to lines from trump s speech that criticized the barack obama administration for withdrawing support for autocrat hosni mubarak during a  uprising  trump s speech  uncharacteristically read out from a teleprompter  seemed aimed at showing a more serious side of a politician who has said he intends to act more  presidential  after months of speaking mainly off the cuff  he promised  a disciplined  deliberate and consistent foreign policy  in contrast to the  reckless  rudderless and aimless  policies of obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton  trump s likely democratic opponent if he secures the republican nomination  the speech included no dramatic new policy proposals that might generate headlines  such as his past calls to bar muslims from entering the united states or to build a wall on the frontier with mexico  where he was specific  like rejecting the terms of last year s nuclear deal with iran  calling for more investment in missile defense in europe and accusing the obama administration of tepid support for israel  he was firmly within the republican mainstream   a major theme   that more nato allies should spend at least  percent of their economic output on defense   is one that has also been taken up by the obama administration itself  including repeatedly during the president s visit to europe last week  nevertheless  trump s rhetoric raised alarm in allied countries that still rely on the superpower for defense  particularly the phrase  america first   used in the  by isolationists that sought to keep the united states out of world war two  former south korean vice foreign minister kim sung han  who now teaches at the korea university in seoul  said trump would be  the first isolationist to be u s  presidential candidate  while in the post war era all the u s  presidents have been to varying degrees internationalists    saying the u s  will no longer engage in anything that is a burden in terms of its relationships with allies  it would be almost like abandoning those alliances   he said   it will inevitably give rise to anti american sentiment worldwide   xenia wickett  head of the u s  and americas programme at britain s chatham house think tank  said the speech  suggests trump would make america s allies less secure rather than more   he talked about allies being confident but all of his rhetoric suggested that america should be unpredictable and that america s allies needed to stand up for themselves   earlier in the u s  nomination process  foreign leaders were not shy to condemn trump openly and publicly  in december  when trump called for his temporary ban on admitting muslims  british prime minister david cameron called him  divisive  stupid and wrong   hundreds of thousands of britons signed a petition calling for trump to be banned from britain for hate speech  which was taken up in parliament  cameron declined to ban trump  but said   if he came to visit our country  i think he would unite us against him   in january  german vice chancellor sigmar gabriel lumped trump together with the leaders of european far right parties as  not only a threat to peace and social cohesion  but also to economic development   these days  with trump now seen as likely to win his party s nomination  european officials are more circumspect in public  but sound no less alarmed in private  a trump presidency  would be a disaster for eu u s  ties   said one senior eu official involved in shaping foreign policy in brussels   right now  we and the obama administration generally understand each other  i don t think we understand donald trump  he has no understanding of the delicate  complex nature of foreign policy on europe s doorstep   nevertheless  some of the policies trump shares with other republicans do have sympathetic audiences abroad  ryszard terlecki  head of the parliamentary group of poland s ruling rightwing law and justice party  said trump had a point when criticizing the obama administration for backing away from plans for increased missile defense   this decision influenced very badly the security of this part of europe  if it weren t for that  the conflict in ukraine would not escalate   he told reuters  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has strongly opposed the obama administration s deal with iran  and trump s speech  like an earlier one to a pro israel lobby group in washington  went down well with some right leaning israelis   trump wants an america that is decent  strong  loyal   but also no patsy  and he sees in israel the most loyal ally of the u s   wrote boaz bismuth  diplomatic correspondent for the pro netanyahu daily israel hayom  in the arab world  where governments and their citizens are also alarmed at the rise of non arab iran  trump s strong rejection of the deal with tehran is a popular position that would have been embraced if expressed by another candidate  but trump s previous call to ban muslims from the united states has made him anathema in the region  emirati political analyst abdulkhaleq abdullah said no speech would be enough to salvage his reputation there   he s a racist and a chauvinist who will never be widely welcomed in the arab world   or  as kuwaiti twitter user mohammed al ammar wrote   some of his speech is correct and logical  but the problem is  he s still  trump
