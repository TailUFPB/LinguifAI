cologne  reuters    donald trump would be  highly unlikely  to be able to renegotiate the global accord on climate change if elected u s  president  the u n  s climate chief said on wednesday  as doing so would require the agreement of  countries   trump  the presumptive republican presidential nominee  told reuters earlier this month he was  not a big fan  of the climate accord and would seek to renegotiate elements of the deal   as we all know  donald trump relishes making very dramatic statements on many issues  so it is not surprising  but it is highly unlikely that that would be possible   christiana figueres  executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change  told journalists at the carbon expo event in cologne  the accord  struck in paris last december  saw countries agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions from  with the aim of limiting the rise in the global average temperature to less than  degrees celsius   an agreement that has been adopted by  countries would require  countries to agree to any new negotiation   she said  she added the current u s  administration was a strong supporter of the deal because it benefits the country  many of the accord s backers say it is in u s  interests to limit greenhouse gas emissions  partly because cuts in the use of fossil fuels would also mean less air pollution  a big cause of disease   trump has said in the past he believes global warming is a concept that was invented by china to hurt the competitiveness of u s  business  the paris agreement will formally enter into force when  nations representing at least  percent of world greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it  china and the united states  representing  percent  say they will join this year  figueres said if this happens the agreement could come into force as early as   it would then be even harder for the u s  to pull out  as rules state any nation wanting to leave has to wait four years from the date of the agreement s entry into force   the length of a u s  presidential term
