shermans dale  penn   reuters    while donald trump often rails against a  rigged  election on twitter and at rallies nationwide  he goes a few steps further in pennsylvania  a state crucial to the republican s fading chances to win the white house  here  he has made direct appeals since august to recruit voters as poll monitors on election day and has pointed specifically at philadelphia as a city beset by voter fraud  despite offering little evidence for any of his claims  his  rigged  election message is resonating with his followers in this traditional battleground state where democratic rival hillary clinton has opened up a wide lead  but his calls for poll watchers on nov   is drawing a mix of confusion  concern and tepid support  in some cases  trump s talk of fraud appears to have made some of his own followers more resigned to an election loss  even though independent studies show u s  voting chicanery is exceptionally rare and certainly never on a national scale  since aug    when trump first urged supporters in the state to  watch other polling places and make sure that it s  percent fine   civil rights groups have expressed fears that some supporters will take the idea too far by forming roaming  vigilante style crowds intimidating voters  trump supporter mark bowman    says he isn t the type to attend a political rally or put campaign stickers on his car  and he isn t confident the election results will be correct   i hate to say it  but i don t have a lot of faith   bowman said   voter fraud is rampant especially in the cities   but  in a comment echoed by nearly two dozen trump supporters in the state s reliably republican central regions  he said he thinks nothing can be done to stop it and that becoming an amateur poll watcher is a step too far   what authority do i have to confront someone   said the resident of shermans dale  a rural community of about   people   your average citizen  you re going to end up in a confrontation with someone  you re going to end up in a bad situation   there are official channels to monitor elections  pennsylvania has a system that allows campaigns and political parties to designate official poll monitors  who are allowed into the polling places and can register official complaints if they think someone isn t a valid voter  a form on the trump campaign s website asks voters to help trump  stop crooked hillary from rigging this election  by becoming a volunteer trump election observer  but in an example of the trump campaign s near non existent effort to organize field operations in key swing states  there is little evidence that the recruitment drive is translating into legions of officially sanctioned volunteers  repeated inquiries from reuters about efforts to staff polling places went unanswered by his campaign  the rules allow each candidate and the state parties to name monitors  with federal and local candidates both on the november ballot  there could be dozens of watchers in a single precinct  but those familiar with past elections say rarely does that happen  instead  campaigns tend to focus on only the most fought over swing districts  steve reigh    a realtor from elliottsburg  pennsylvania  agrees with trump that the election is likely to be rigged  but says he also resigned to the outcome of the election  win or lose   what are you going to do   he said  some trump supporters are branching out on their own  jack posobiec  a navy veteran and special projects director at citizens for trump  a grassroots support group  says he hopes to mobilize   volunteers in several key swing states in the final days of the campaign  including busing supporters from texas to ohio  on oct    trump told a largely white rally of supporters in manheim in central pennsylvania that they should go to neighborhoods other than their own on election day and  watch    you ve got to get everybody you know and you got to watch your polling booths  because i hear too many stories about pennsylvania  certain areas   trump said   so go and vote and then go and check out areas because a lot of bad things happen and we don t want to lose for that reason   dale ho  a voting rights lawyer at the american civil liberties union  said on twitter that trump s calls for  poll watchers  were a  recipe for intimidation and discrimination   the trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment       married trump supporters gina    and larry snyder    of newport agree the election could be rigged but doubt anything can be done about it  including poll watching   candace lowe    of elliottsburg  pennsylvania  said she is resigned to a trump loss because the government  can fudge stuff   turning out en masse to watch polling centers on election night won t change that  she said  in mechanicsburg  an overwhelmingly republican borough of nearly   people  realtor steve johansen helped to set up a trump field office in a skating rink  but he has no plans to monitor any polling places   i have faith in the system   he said
