washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama is expected to sign a bill to provide financial incentives to companies developing treatments for the zika virus  a white house spokeswoman said  but the bill passed by the house of representatives on tuesday is insufficient to meet the challenge   we hope that this legislation encourages private sector partners to address the challenge of zika  but it contains no funding and is ultimately insufficient on its own  since it doesn t provide the    billion in funding that our public health experts have said is needed right now to prepare americans for the imminent local transmission of zika in this country   spokeswoman katie hill said
