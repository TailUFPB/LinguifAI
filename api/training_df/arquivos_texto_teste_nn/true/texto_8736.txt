washington  reuters    republican donald trump s choice of indiana governor mike pence as his vice presidential running mate on friday helped bolster support among some conservatives skeptical about his policies  a crucial step as he prepares to accept the party s nomination next week  some conservatives who had fought against trump s ascendancy in the republican nominating race welcomed his announcement that he had picked pence  a well known social and evangelical conservative  the club for growth  a conservative economic group  had sharply criticized trump s support for protectionist trade policies  on friday  the group noted that as a member of the house of representatives  pence had been a strong voice for  free markets and economic liberty  at a time when the republican leadership had been weak on these issues   today s news gives a similar hope that mike pence will be  effective in pulling the republican ticket toward economic conservatism and limited government   the group said  other conservatives were also heartened by trump s vp pick  which the businessman announced in a tweet ahead of a joint appearance in his hometown of new york on saturday   pence is a principled conservative  man of faith  and talented messenger for republican ideas   said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell   his addition to the ticket will bring even more excitement to the voters who are eager to put a republican in the white house and deny a third term for president obama s liberal agenda   trump    chose pence    over two politicians he considers friends and close advisers  former house of representatives speaker newt gingrich    and new jersey governor chris christie    pence is viewed as a safe choice for trump  the indiana governor s low key demeanor is a contrast to that of the bombastic real estate developer  and he could take the fight to the democrats in the months leading up to the nov   election without upstaging trump  he and trump will have to smooth over some policy differences  pence has said he does not support trade protectionism or a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  two policies that are central to trump s campaign message  in his first public remarks after trump announced his running mate  pence appeared to soften his opposition to a temporary ban on muslims entering the country after he called it   offensive and unconstitutional  in a tweet last december   i am very supportive of donald trump s call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the united states   pence told conservative fox news commentator sean hannity   we have no higher priority than the safety and security of the american people   pence said  adding that he suspended a syrian refugee program in indiana after a shooting rampage last year in san bernardino  california   pence also said he  absolutely  backed trump s promise to build a wall between the united states and mexico to stem illegal immigration and make mexico pay for it  trump said pence had done a great job in indiana and that of all the people he had interviewed for the job   there s nobody that agrees with me fully on everything   pence s selection was slammed by democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s campaign   by picking mike pence as his running mate  donald trump has doubled down on some of his most disturbing beliefs by choosing an incredibly divisive and unpopular running mate known for supporting discriminatory politics and failed economic policies that favor millionaires and corporations over working families   said clinton campaign chairman john podesta  trump had faced a midday friday deadline to announce pence because the governor had to declare by then whether he would be on the ballot in his home state for re election  trump had postponed his announcement  which had been planned for friday  out of respect for the victims in nice  france  an attacker in a heavy truck drove into crowds celebrating bastille day  killing at least  people and injuring scores more in what president francois hollande called a terrorist act  trump is set to be formally nominated as the party s candidate for the presidential election at the convention  which opens in cleveland on monday  traditionally  the vice presidential choice is used to build enthusiasm among party loyalists  the republican national committee expects the convention to draw   people to the ohio city  whose population is about    u s  authorities were preparing for the possibility of violence  whether from demonstrators or planned attacks  the cleveland conclave and the democratic party convention the following week in philadelphia have been given the status of special national security event by the federal government for the first time  and security will be heightened  said republican party spokesman sean spicer  the department of homeland security will send more than   personnel to each convention  secretary jeh johnson said on thursday  speaking before the nice attack  no specific or credible threat to either gathering has been reported  he said
