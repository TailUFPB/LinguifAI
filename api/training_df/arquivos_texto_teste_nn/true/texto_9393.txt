washington new york  reuters    donald trump this week took his use of sordid accusations against democrat hillary clinton to levels unprecedented in modern u s  presidential campaigns  in the latest example of the republican s unorthodox playbook  the presumptive republican nominee is working to gain stronger footing and offset a big advantage clinton is likely to have ahead of the nov   presidential election  a huge campaign war chest that she and her allies intend to use to launch a barrage of attacks against him   trump is using the same strategy he used repeatedly during the republican nomination fight against rivals like ted cruz  making incendiary statements that u s  television networks cannot resist covering  giving him hours of free media and putting his opponents on the defensive   the strategy may already be working  trump has raised more than a few eyebrows with his latest round of attacks against clinton  he has turned history into headlines that play like a virtual reel in the  hour news world of cable tv and the internet  trump s campaign manager  corey lewandowski  said the strategy makes sense   clearly  she s going to have massive amounts of money   lewandowski told reuters   the difference is mr  trump has funded his campaign  what we ve been able to do in this campaign cycle is to generate earned media based on mr  trump s ability to be a straight talker  and genuine and authentic  and i think that s what drives the news cycle   trump s latest salvos include a rape accusation against former president bill clinton dating to the  and the suicide of an aide to the former president in    events that the campaign links to hillary clinton  an online video released by trump has various women accusing the former president of rape or unwanted sexual advances  trump accused hillary clinton of helping to silence the women  the clintons and their supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless and politically motivated  then  in an interview with the washington post  trump suggested that the clintons may have been involved in the  death of vince foster  a former aide to bill clinton and a friend of hillary clinton  even though more than five investigations  including one conducted by republican special prosecutor kenneth starr  concluded that foster committed suicide in a virginia park  trump was alluding to theories over the years that have been circulated in tabloid publications  in the depths of the internet and in books by the clintons  foes  on wednesday  trump s campaign accidentally sent an email to a reporter at politico revealing that the republican plans to next attack clinton regarding whitewater  a real estate scandal that plagued bill clinton s administration  no wrongdoing by the clintons was ever proven  the attacks have put hillary clinton on her back foot  trump  just continues to gobble news cycle after news cycle   said republican pollster kellyanne conway  who ran the super pacs that backed senator ted cruz in the primary and aggressively attacked trump   clinton is spending less time campaigning about the future and more time explaining the past than she would probably like    the barrage puts clinton in a bind  so far  she has opted to ignore trump s personal attacks and her campaign has offered general pushback  but clinton risks the negative onslaught dragging down her standing with the public and irreversibly damaging her general election hopes   i played a lot of hardball in my life  but i don t envy what the clinton campaign is up against here  trump himself has totally changed the political dynamic   said jim manley  a democratic strategist who supports clinton   what they can t afford to do is get in the gutter with the guy  he has absolutely no morals or scruples  getting into the gutter with him is an absolute waste of time   clinton s campaign and the super pacs supporting her will not be without funds to try to combat the attacks and launch her own  at the end of april  she had   million in her campaign account  compared with trump s   million   and the pac supporting her  which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money  had   million at the end of april   a total that is likely to grow over the summer  the pac backing trump is just getting off the ground  clinton will also depend on an army of surrogates to try to combat trump without having to respond to him herself   trump has already proven he can dispatch opponents without spending much money by defining them to voters through aggressive appearances on news programs   republican rival jeb bush had a more than   million advantage going into the primary  but trump painted him as  low energy  and defined him as inept  a characterization bush s money was never able to overcome  the pacs backing republican senators marco rubio and ted cruz spent millions assailing trump  trump was able to leverage extensive coverage of his campaign by the media to combat their attacks while spending little money on advertising  trump has been proven an expert at raising attack lines that have already been settled  but insisting that questions remain  he spent years demanding that president barack obama produce his birth certificate  despite myriad evidence that obama was born in hawaii  including government records of the president s birth in honolulu  for trump  some of the attacks are targeted at young voters   those in their early  and  were too young to have been immersed in news about the scandals of the clinton years     you have a whole series of the population who either  a  don t know anything about it  or  b  weren t paying attention at the time   lewandowski said  a clinton ally said trump is simply trying to distract attention from his own liabilities   such as refusing to release his tax returns and his own history of problems with women   the more he raises these outrageous and outlandish charges   said u s  representative xavier becerra  of california  a democratic leader in the house   the more he keeps you pedaling in a different direction
