berlin  reuters    donald trump s victory has been a shock for america s major partners around the world  but perhaps nowhere has the blow been more painful than in germany  a country that under angela merkel has come to see itself as a bastion of openness and tolerance  on virtually every issue of importance to the german chancellor  from confronting russian aggression and promoting free trade  to combating climate change and tackling the tide of refugees fleeing syria  trump seems likely to turn washington from an ally into an adversary  he invoked the german chancellor s name to insult his democratic opponent hillary clinton during the u s  campaign  calling her  america s merkel   and he described her decision last year to open german borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants as  insane   so although trump s election is being seen as a rejection of the political establishment and liberal democratic values in general  it represents a very personal blow to merkel  europe s most powerful leader  it heaps more responsibility on her at a time when she is nearing an announcement on whether she will run for a record tying fourth term as chancellor next autumn  despite the toll that  years of non stop crisis fighting has taken on her  merkel s aides say that trump s victory and britain s decision in june to leave the european union have  if anything  reinforced her determination to continue   given the challenges we face  in europe and beyond  she can t simply walk off into the sunset  that would look very bad  she has a sense of responsibility   said an adviser  germans have been falling out of love with the united states since george w  bush invaded iraq more than a dozen years ago  but the election of barack obama in  was seen here as proof of america s capacity to correct its  mistakes   obama was hailed as the heir to john f  kennedy  who came to a divided berlin in   two years after construction of the berlin wall began  and reassured germans with the word  ich bin ein berliner   obama  who developed a close relationship with merkel in his eight years in office  will make what promises to be a bittersweet farewell visit to berlin this week  trump s win heralds a hard break in a relationship that grew extremely close during the cold war  before wobbling when germany refused to go along with bush s iraq war and was derided by his defense secretary donald rumsfeld as  old europe   last week  germany s suddeutsche zeitung published a cartoon of a beaming trump opening his jacket to reveal the message  ich bin kein berliner   i am not a berliner  plastered across his chest  this won t stop merkel  a restrained politician who prefers small steps to giant leaps  from trying to work with the brash trump  who rode to victory on the dreamy promise to  make america great again   she is a pragmatist who has maintained dialogue with strongmen like vladimir putin and tayyip erdogan through crises in germany s relationship with russia and turkey  but merkel s statement on wednesday  in the aftermath of trump s election  was telling  in it  she set conditions for cooperation with trump  a provocative message from a close ally to the democratically elected leader of the united states   germany and america are connected by values of democracy  freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man  independent of origin  skin color  religion  gender  sexual orientation or political views   she said   i offer the next president of the united states close cooperation on the basis of these values   merkel s cabinet colleagues have been far more outspoken  foreign minister frank walter steinmeier has denounced trump as a  preacher of hate   vice chancellor sigmar gabriel has called him the pioneer of an international  authoritarian and chauvinist  movement  the german press has not pulled punches either  the cover of der spiegel magazine this weekend showed the head of a grimacing trump hurtling toward earth like a giant flaming asteroid  above the title  the end of the world  as we know it    one of merkel s biggest foreign policy successes as chancellor was rallying the european union s disparate  member states behind sanctions against russia in response to its intervention in eastern ukraine  if trump follows through on his promise to forge a closer relationship with putin  the transatlantic and european front against russia would crumble  leaving her putin policy in tatters  merkel was also the driving force in europe behind the ambitious trade deal between the eu and united states  known as ttip  the transatlantic trade and investment partnership   that agreement  still in the negotiation phase  seems sure to die under trump  whose protectionist promises  should they become reality  would hit few countries harder than germany  whose economic strength depends heavily on the openness of the global trading system   nowhere would a move toward renationalization be more dangerous   former german foreign minister joschka fischer wrote this week  germany  he predicted  would pay  the highest economic and political price  if the wave of populism led to a further weakening  or even a collapse  of the eu  trump s presidency will challenge germany on a number of other fronts  from climate and fiscal policy to defense spending and financial regulation  trump has promised to do what merkel and her veteran finance minister wolfgang schaeuble have resisted for years  take advantage of an ultra low interest rate environment to invest vast amounts of public money in modernizing infrastructure  it was ironic that in the same week trump was elected  germany was finalizing a  budget that is a model of fiscal restraint  how long schaeuble will be able to stick to his cherished  schwarze null   or balanced budget  with trump demanding that europe shoulder more responsibility for its own defense  is unclear  but one thing does seem clear  in trump  germany faces its biggest test since the fall of the berlin wall   to suggest that germany has suddenly become the new leader of the western world is not only absurd but dangerous   because it raises expectations that simply can t ever be met   a senior german official said
