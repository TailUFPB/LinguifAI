miami washington  reuters    republican donald trump on wednesday invited russia to dig up tens of thousands of  missing  emails from hillary clinton s time at the u s  state department  vexing intelligence experts and prompting democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on americans   russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   trump  the republican presidential nominee  told reporters  trump made the remark at a testy news conference at his doral golf resort in florida that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the philadelphia convention where clinton on thursday will accept the democratic presidential nomination for the nov   election  the clinton campaign shot back that trump was posing a possible national security threat by encouraging a foreign power to conduct espionage in the united states  some intelligence experts said the comments raised questions about trump s judgment  a spokesman for trump  jason miller  tried to tamp down the storm of protest  saying trump did not urge russia to hack clinton s emails  trump said on twitter that if anyone had clinton s emails   perhaps they should share them with the fbi   the criticism of trump s comments reverberated at the democratic national convention where speakers brought up the episode to try to intensify democratic support for clinton  who is running neck and neck with trump in the polls   donald trump today once again took russia s side  he asked the russians to interfere in american politics   longtime clinton supporter and former cia director leon panetta said   donald trump     is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the united states of america to affect the election   another speaker  retired u s  rear admiral john hutson  said of trump   this morning  he personally invited russia to hack us  that s not law and order  that s criminal intent   trump was referring in his remarks to a private email system clinton kept while secretary of state from  to   she handed over thousands of emails in  to u s  officials probing that system  but did not release about   emails she said were personal and not work related  a federal bureau of investigation probe of the issue found no basis for criminal charges  but fbi director james comey said this month there was evidence clinton was  extremely careless  in her handling of classified information  trump dismissed suggestions that wikileaks  release of embarrassing democratic party emails last week was engineered by russia to help nudge the u s  election toward trump  who has been called  very talented  by russian president vladimir putin   it s just a total deflection  this whole thing with russia   said trump   i never met putin  i don t know who putin is    the democratic party chairwoman  debbie wasserman schultz  resigned on sunday after the leaked emails showed party leaders favoring clinton over her rival  u s  senator bernie sanders  for the presidential nomination  cyber security experts and u s  officials have said there was evidence that russia engineered the release of the sensitive party emails in order to influence the presidential election  throughout a day of campaigning  trump suggested the culprit could be china or even  as he said in scranton  pennsylvania   a  pound person lying in bed    four letter words  russia has brushed aside suggestions it was involved   i don t want to use four letter words   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters on tuesday  trump has alarmed european allies and many u s  national security experts with talk of forcing nato nations to pay more for the u s  security umbrella   by the way  if they don t pay  bye bye   he said in toledo  ohio  on wednesday night  he has praised putin in the past and said this week that if elected  he would seek an alliance with moscow to take on islamic state militants  but he sought to distance himself from putin at his news conference  saying his closest interaction with russia was selling a florida home to a russian for more than he paid for it  a u s  state department spokesman declined to comment on trump s remarks on wednesday  trump s vice presidential running mate  indiana governor mike pence  took a different approach from the republican nominee  saying he expected the fbi to get to the bottom of the matter   if it is russia  and they are interfering in our elections  i can assure you both parties and the united states government will ensure there are serious consequences   pence said in a statement  during the news conference  which lasted more than an hour  trump also called barack obama  a democrat  the most  ignorant  president ever and said vice president joe biden was not bright  asked if he would recognize crimea as russian territory  trump said he would be  looking into that   crimea has long been part of ukraine  but russia annexed it in  after pro russian separatists and special forces took over the region  the u s  government considers it still part of ukraine
