montpelier  vt   reuters    still sifting through the wreckage of the nov   election  democratic leaders nationwide are struggling to find a new message to claw back support and avoid years in the political wilderness       not only do republicans control the white house and both the u s  senate and the house of representatives  they now hold  governor s offices   new england  long considered reliably democratic  is a prime example of the party s demise  republican phil scott won in vermont over democrat sue minter who was criticized  like presidential nominee hillary clinton  for failing to develop an economic message that resonated with voters worried about good paying jobs      considered a liberal bastion  vermont has a tradition of sometimes choosing a republican governor to keep one party from having too much control  elsewhere  republican chris sununu will replace a democratic governor in new hampshire while maine and massachusetts already have republican governors   we lost the governorship of freaking vermont   lamented washington based democratic strategist chris kofinis   we didn t just lose an election  this was a national rebuke  this was biblical      republicans also command  state legislatures and have full control   meaning they hold the governor s office and both legislative chambers   in  states  including swing states such as florida  ohio  michigan  and wisconsin  when president barack obama was elected in   they controlled just nine   there are more republicans at the state legislative level than there have ever been   said tim storey  an analyst with the national conference of state legislatures       republicans scored a major coup when they seized the senate in traditionally liberal minnesota  giving it full control of the legislature  and they gained full control of next door iowa   the party s message  structure and apparatus are broken   said kofinis  who was chief of staff to moderate democratic senator joe manchin of west virginia   we haven t acknowledged it for years because we had the white house   obama s two terms masked a crumbling party infrastructure  during obama s tenure  democrats lost over  state legislative seats  at least  governorships and both houses of congress   party insiders are reluctant to blame the popular obama but cite plenty of reasons for the decline  these include a muddled economic message  an overemphasis on emerging demographic groups such as minorities and millennial at the expense of white voters  a perception the party is elitist and aligned with wall street  a reluctance to embrace the progressive populism of senator bernie sanders  the former presidential hopeful  and failure to field strong candidates in key states  there is an emerging consensus  they add  that the party has been too focused on winning national races and has not invested enough in local campaigns  along with a grudging admission that republicans have done a better job of competing on the ground  as a result  a poor performance by the democrats in the  midterm elections gave republicans control of statehouses across the country  allowing them to redraw legislative maps to fashion districts that would help ensure their long term electoral success   i think the foundation was built back in    wisconsin governor scott walker told reuters   there was a big wave and then for many of us that were elected in    we got reelected in   in battleground states   wisconsin  florida  ohio  michigan  you look at the states that were key to the presidential win  were states where republicans did well in   and then sustained it    under resourced  democrats are working to recover and looking ahead to governor s races in new jersey and virginia next year to make up lost ground  governor s offices have become crucial for another reason  republican governors signed voter suppression measures in states such as north carolina that democrats believe damaged turnout  sununu has said that as one of his first acts as governor in new hampshire  he would like to end the state s practice of allowing same day voter registration  as with redistricting  it is another lever of power that republicans can wield to make sure they remain in the majority for a long time  obama has said he will actively support a new party initiative  the national democratic redistricting committee  that seeks to restore state level democratic power   mark schauer  a former michigan congressman who is a senior adviser to the effort  said the goal is to have a central organization direct resources into critical local races  schauer  who lost his congressional seat after republican legislators excised his home county from his district  said deep pocketed democratic donors have not always appreciated the need to support state races    a state senate race isn t as sexy as a presidential or big u s  senate race   schauer said   jessica post  executive director of the democratic legislative campaign committee  the party arm charged with overseeing state races  agreed   we have felt under resourced   when howard dean  the former vermont governor and presidential candidate  ran the democratic national committee  he adopted a   state strategy   investing funds in every state  even ones perceived to be hostile to democrats  in an effort to identify viable candidates for local office   while dean s plan was not the sole reason  democrats had election successes in  and   when dean left the dnc  his strategy faded and the party s fortunes at the state level began to decline   dean is a candidate to run the dnc again and has said he will revive the strategy if elected to the post    what is happening is a result of decades of smart organizing by conservatives who have very simply poured resources  talent and energy into creating an infrastructure at the state  local  and now national level   said bill lofy  a long time democratic strategist in vermont   he said governor elect scott  was very effective at making this  in a generic sense  about kitchen table economic issues in a way that paralleled with the presidential race   and like trump  he said  scott  spent very little time talking about how is going to implement the policies he was proposing  it was more about scott telling voters   trust me  i m on your side
