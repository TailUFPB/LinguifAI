new york  reuters    president elect donald trump escalated a fight with u s  spy agencies on wednesday  just nine days before he takes over their command as president  and accused them of practices reminiscent of nazi germany  the republican said leaks from the intelligence community led to some u s  media outlets reporting unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in russia   i think it was disgraceful  disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out  i think it s a disgrace  and i say that     that s something that nazi germany would have done and did do   trump told a news conference in new york  trump acknowledged for the first time that russia likely hacked the democratic national committee and the emails of top democrats during the  presidential election   i think it was russia   he said  pointing out that other countries were also hacking the united states          trump s comments about spy agencies such as the cia are likely to intensify tensions between the intelligence community and the president elect  who initially disparaged its conclusion that a russian hacking campaign was aimed at boosting his candidacy against democrat hillary clinton      trump  who takes office on jan    called a dossier that makes salacious claims about him in russia  fake news  and  phony stuff    u s  director of national intelligence james clapper said he spoke with trump on wednesday evening and told the president elect he did not believe the media leaks came from the intelligence community   i expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press  and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security   clapper said in a statement  he defended including the dossier in the intelligence report trump received on friday  saying  part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security   clapper said he emphasized to trump that the dossier was not produced by the u s  intelligence community and intelligence officials have not judged whether the information is reliable  two u s  officials said the allegations about trump  which one called  unsubstantiated   were contained in a two page memo appended to a report on russian interference in the  election that was presented last week to trump and to president barack obama      trump said  without offering evidence  that the news he had been briefed on the memo  was released by maybe the  u s   intelligence agencies  who knows  but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that                    cnn reported on tuesday about the existence of the memo  buzzfeed published a fuller  page document produced by christopher steele  a former british foreign intelligence official  that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by trump and alleged links between him and people in russia      the claims were included in opposition research reports that were made available to democrats and u s  officials last year  one u s  official said investigators had so far been unable to confirm material about trump s financial and personal entanglements with russian businessmen and others whom u s  intelligence analysts have concluded are russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of russian intelligence  some material in steele s reports has proved to be erroneous  the u s  official said          in the news conference  trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with moscow during the presidential campaign  and said he had no loans or business deals with russia    he defended his goal of better ties with russian president vladimir putin   if putin likes donald trump  i consider that an asset  not a liability   he said    the new york real estate developer complained about leaks from meetings he has with intelligence agencies and suggested they were to blame        i have many meetings with intelligence  and every time i meet  people are reading about it  somebody s leaking it out   he said  the long awaited news conference was a freewheeling affair  with trump aides cheering from the sidelines at one point and the president elect angrily refusing to take questions from a cnn reporter  outside  about a dozen protesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street from trump tower  holding signs with the slogans  dump trump  and  allegiance to america not russia  as fifth avenue traffic streamed by          it was trump s first news conference in about six months and about  reporters jammed into the lobby at his manhattan offices     questions extended to many issues that will face him when he takes office  he vowed to soon begin negotiations with mexico on building a border wall and said he will nominate a supreme court justice to fill the seat left by the death of conservative antonin scalia within two weeks of taking office  he also said he would offer a plan to repeal and replace obama s signature health care law once his choice for health and human services  tom price  is confirmed by the senate  trump gestured to large stacks of manila folders as he described how he will separate himself from his global business operations  which includes hotels and golf courses as well as assets like a winery and modeling agency  to avoid conflicts of interest once he takes office  he also talked about how he plans to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas plants  slamming drug companies for  getting away with murder  on pricing  u s  stocks slipped to session lows  before
