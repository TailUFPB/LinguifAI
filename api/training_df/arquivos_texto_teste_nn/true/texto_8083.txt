 reuters    wells fargo   co customers aiming to sue the bank over bogus accounts opened in their names may be in for an unpleasant surprise  the fine print requires them to take their claims to an arbitrator instead of a court  mandatory arbitration rules inserted into account opening agreements prohibit customers from joining class actions or suing the third largest u s  bank in court  instead  the agreements require individual  closed door arbitration   u s  senators highlighted the issue on tuesday as they grilled wells fargo chief executive officer john stumpf during a hearing  asked if he would set aside the mandatory arbitration agreements for customers affected by the phantom accounts  stumpf demurred   i m not an expert in that   he said  adding he would talk to his legal team  that was not enough for some lawmakers   if we had class action on this in       the problem never would have gotten so out of hand   senator elizabeth warren  a democrat from massachusetts  said later  when questioning regulators about the practice  class actions can be more affordable for unhappy customers  especially those with limited resources  because they can band together to sue  rather than having to hire lawyers individually  consumers also complain that target companies often choose the arbitrators  proceedings are confidential  and decisions are hard to appeal  three wells fargo customers filed a lawsuit friday in a utah federal court  seeking class action status on behalf of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide they say were harmed by the san francisco based bank s fraud and recklessness  it was unclear whether they could get around the mandatory arbitration clauses  though  last year  wells successfully invoked the clauses to defend against a class action suit tied to bogus accounts  in that case  the judge said customers had to arbitrate because of agreements they signed when opening legitimate accounts at the bank  the consumer financial protection bureau  a brainchild of warren  was part of the regulatory group that negotiated a   million settlement from wells fargo over the bogus accounts  the bureau is considering rules to ban banks  credit card issuers and other companies from forcing customers to submit to arbitration and waive their right to join class action lawsuits  under the proposal  companies could still use arbitration  but would have to tell consumers they could join class action lawsuits instead  mandating arbitration when signing up for financial products has become standard practice after a  u s  supreme court decision validated the practice  still  the tide may be turning  said joseph peiffer  a new orleans lawyer who has represented investors and others in class action lawsuits    class actions dissuade companies from ripping people off a thousand dollars here and a thousand dollars there   peiffer said
