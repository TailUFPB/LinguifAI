algonac  mich  parker fox drifted out of the donald trump rally in a sort of euphoric daze  along with the thousands emptying into the parking lot alongside him   after leaving a trump rally  you re very pro trump   he recalled a few weeks later  describing a noisy communion with people who understood that politics mattered  unlike some people he could name at his high school   it was so enthusiastic and so energetic you could feel it in your body  it gave you chills   he d barely had time to calm down when he learned through facebook that his other favorite presidential candidate would also be passing through his quiet corner of eastern michigan bernie sanders  in fact  the u s  senator from vermont would be at the same community college the very next day  this thrilled fox  his first presidential election as a voter he was  and the two most crowd whipping  pundit defying  establishment bucking candidates in the entire race were practically paying him personal visits   as it turned out  the residents of this part of michigan were especially fond of the two men who had done the most to upend the  presidential race  both sanders and trump won the state  with sanders  narrow win in the democratic contest stupefying pollsters who had predicted a comfortable lead for hillary clinton  both did especially well in st  clair county  with double digit victories over their rivals  and  down at the precinct level  they barnstormed algonac  a town of about   people about an hour s drive from detroit on a curve of the st  clair river in the county s southern end corner  and neighboring clay  home to another   or so  including fox and his family  in some algonac and clay precincts  sanders and trump won more than two thirds of the votes  residents have a needlessly unflattering nickname for algonac  the swamp  derived  apparently  from the reed marshes that engulf the town s edges and which are prettily dive bombed by feeding birds and buzz with hidden insects  if sanders and trump were the two insurgents of   then the algonac swamp must be a sort of encampment of their guerrilla foot soldiers  what might such a place be like  down in the trenches  an editor s working hypothesis was that a town full of trump and sanders fans might turn out to be the angriest town in america  and so that became our shorthand before my visit in april  only to be laughed at when i finally got the chance to broach the label with residents    of course  no one can persist in a permanent state of anger  especially in an entire town  contempt  on the other hand  can smolder indefinitely  and algonac reeked of contempt  it would take longer than a week s visit to find someone here who does not think washington is  on the whole  a besmirched place of selfish politicians in thrall to the powerful moneyed interests who keep them in office  clinton  fairly or otherwise  is generally seen here as the very embodiment of this  sanders and trump the only possible saviors  trump because he s never held elected office  and sanders  despite his decades in congress  because he is still viewed as a cranky outsider  nonetheless  for a small minority  the idea of a president trump sends them into a panic   fox is young enough to have never had his heart broken by a politician  but he s heard his father  jerry  go off at the dinner table enough times to pick up some of his parents  wariness   he might get a lot of this because i work for the auto industry   said jerry  who has a job at a nearby chrysler truck factory and is a competitive walleye fisherman on the side  father and son were sitting on couches in the family s comfy living room  with large windows looking out onto surrounding woods where deer and turkeys roam  jerry had also been struggling over whether he preferred trump or sanders  and so had decided to let his politics inhaling son make the call for him   i ve always heard dad saying  you know   there goes another plant to mexico    fox said  doing an angry dad voice  as jerry gave a smiling  it s true  nod of recognition  and so fox marveled to hear trump lambast companies for moving production abroad  or sanders  refrain that   factories have closed down in america since   the rallies were like a fox family dinner blown up to stadium size  compassion versus wall building should either candidate want to make a movie adaptation of their campaign speeches  they could do worse than to set it in algonac and clay  a few strip mall businesses and a scattering of mostly two story  middle class homes  none too far from the teal waters of the st  clair river  along which massive freighters creep carrying goods to and from canada  to wander around algonac  a predominantly republican place  is to encounter familiar stump speech lines made manifest  there s the town s old chris craft power boat factory that made algonac a proud little manufacturing hub until it closed in   a hole that s never quite been filled or forgotten  algonac falls within the gravitational pull of detroit s big three automobile companies  the factories of general motors  ford and fiat chrysler are major employers  and families  fortunes are tied to international trade deals that both trump and sanders deride  ford  in particular  has come under attack from trump for expanding its manufacturing in mexico  the only other language besides english on the signs at the nearest major airport  detroit metropolitan  is japanese  viewed by some residents as an unnecessary concession to visiting japanese automobile executives  when talk turns to immigration sanders in terms of compassion  trump in terms of wall building people here are reminded of the u s  border patrol officers they see boating up and down the canadian border  which floats somewhere halfway across the st  clair river  both candidates decry what they say is the undue influence of american billionaires on politics  in algonac  they tend to picture manuel moroun  a detroit businessman  in the local version of this role  he proposed building a bridge that was widely opposed here  connecting the mainland to harsens island  a peaceful outpost of clay township  home to about   people and a couple of bald eagles and currently accessible only by a small   car ferry  regulators denied the   million plan in june  in some ways  voters have changed little since the   when pollster stan greenberg first visited neighboring macomb county and announced that he had discovered the reagan democrat  the belief persists that the system is so rigged that politicians  largesse only flows to those much richer than you  or much poorer  leaving you to struggle unaided  the difference this time and everyone agrees it s different this time is that there were two viable seeming chances to send a man to washington who would be the very personification of your contempt  some were voting for trump only in his capacity as a stink bomb   you guys know the story  i m sure  of jesus christ in the temple  when he goes into the temple and he turns everything upside down   said jay deboyer  the only person dressed in a suit on a weekday afternoon in johnnie lega s  a popular riverside algonac dive bar filled with nautical themed clutter  he worked behind the bar years ago when he was a student before becoming a salesman for a company that made trusses and other lumber products for the home building industry  now deboyer is the county clerk  whose job includes running elections here  he has a close shaved head and silver goatee  his suit fits well  and he speaks in neat paragraphs of political analysis  he was evoking a rare moment in the gospels  in which the normally sanguine christ appears to get angry at the corrupting quality of money  as he explained why the county s primary results were more or less as he anticipated   now  we can argue from a christian perspective  was that christ like  we can have that debate  that discussion  but for every circumstance there s a reaction and there s a resolution   in his analogy  christ was trump  but sanders  too  and also  in a sense  the voters themselves  newly awakened at the possibility of disruption   in these non engaged individuals who are becoming engaged  they want him to go into the temple and turn the tables upside down   deboyer said   that means we need to shake it up  we need to come back to the people in control   in deboyer s view  this may be the first election in which the so called culture wars will not prove decisive  deboyer is a republican  though he declined to say for whom he voted  he s pro gun and opposes abortion  but is unfazed  for example  by trump s difficulty in stating what his policy on abortion access would be  most trump voters he knows don t care if they only agree with  two in  things  that trump says  according to deboyer  they just want a change  he described his family s finances to explain why   i don t have a bunch of debt  i have a mortgage and a couple of car payments  i don t have a pension  i have to save in a  like everyone else  it s impossible for me to save enough money to pay for my kids to go to college   he has a  year old son and a  year old daughter  who is applying to duke   mathematically impossible  i live in a    house  i drive a dodge pick up truck and a jeep  i don t have any credit card debt  none of that  and it s mathematically impossible for me to save enough for retirement and enough to send my kids to college  household income of     with no debt  do you understand how a person in my exact financial category gets sucked into that world  between those two  if i tend to lean to the left  i m all in with bernie sanders  if i tend to lean right  i m all in with donald trump  frankly  even if he s wrong  what he s saying are the only options i have  the only hope i got   leaving johnnie lega s to head into algonac proper  you pass by the taxidermy store of paul burczycki a trump supporter with qualms  he is angry with the government not least because his insurance payments went up with the passage of the affordable care act   trump s a tough guy to vote for   he said   he s a loose cannon  maybe that s all part of his master plan   further down the road  on the right  there s peter beauregard s algonac harbour club on the right  a marina and restaurant on the spot of the old chris craft factory   he s a trump fan  too   i m a lifetime republican who has been disenchanted like  i guess  a lot of people in our town  so i m definitely for the outsider   beauregard said   and i ve upset several of my local colleagues who are republicans  if you re a republican you either love him or you hate him  there s nobody on the fence   life here revolves around the water  almost as many driveways are graced by boats as cars  garfield wood  a pioneering boat builder and racer who once lived in algonac  broke the water speed record in   tearing along the st  clair in a boat powered by airplane engines at   miles per hour  chris craft made a landing craft used by the u s  military in the d day invasion at normandy  as well as mahogany hulled powerboats that are still cherished by nostalgic collectors  the michigan senate is contemplating a bill that would recognize clay township  algonac s neighbor  as  the sturgeon angling capital  of the state  and some residents think it will sail through committee  it s beautiful in the summer  residents say  with people boating in the sunshine and the restaurants busy with seasonal visitors  nevertheless  multiple residents liked to efface the town using the same little shorthand list  as if they d all memorized it from the same source  algonac  it s three dollar stores  one grocery store  three pharmacies  and that s about it  about  percent of the residents are white  according to the last census  compared to  percent for the united states as a whole  both trump and sanders have found their most reliable support among those in this racial group  it is only after several days in algonac  at the annual american indian festival at the local high school  that i find someone willing to say she is a clinton supporter  if in a limited sense  ringed by chairs in the school gym  dancers moved to throbbing drums  fox furs  tribal jewelry and dreamcatchers were for sale at stalls around the gym s edge  many run by members of tribes from walpole island  just across the canadian border  susan wrobel  the festival s organizer and a lifelong algonac resident  runs a weekly community meeting where she teaches children anishinaabemowin  the language of her ojibwe tribe  she said elders there have been  shaking their heads  in wonder and fear that trump could become president   i was very pleased whether it was hillary or bernie  i actually i like them both   she said  she had just bought some new earrings  which danced as she spoke   so i chose the republican ticket to vote for my favorite republican  and that was kasich  i love kasich  he s the only one that talked about doing something about the national debt  and i loved that  so i thought  well  the democratic ticket s taken care of for me   michigan s primaries are open to all voters regardless of party affiliation  and strategic voting is common  a few days after this conversation  john kasich  the ohio governor  would drop out of the race  once again  it was time for the algonac clay historical society s monthly meeting  some of the women at the society are particularly interested in the victorian era and were making final arrangements for a forthcoming talk on victorian hair fashions   hats and tea cups are encouraged   noted the flyer  trump struck them as unnecessarily crude   i don t like the name calling   said marilynn genaw  who was in charge of ordering the strawberries they d need for the tea   it s good manners not to say something derogatory about an individual   she was still deciding on how to vote  joan bulley  a former algonac bank teller and the town s de facto historian in residence  could also do without trump s brusqueness  but wonders if it points to an underlying virtue   one thing about donald trump is he tells it as it is   she said   i don t care for his rudeness  his insults  but he gets things done   sanders  she said  is at least  a little bit more dignified  in his speeches   she dislikes clinton   she doesn t tell the truth  i don t like that   bulley s grievance with the federal government is that she has never quite forgiven it for transforming the city s waterfront under the  urban renewal  push of the  and    urban renewal demolished our town  she said  she pointed to an exhibit in the society s museum  a little hand drawn map of the businesses that used to line a walkable   century main street on the riverfront  koch s jewelry store  the starlight dance pavilion  the algonac theatre  for the most part  those buildings were demolished and replaced with a pleasant  if quiet  boardwalk backed by tidy lawns  and  on the other side  the sort of boxy  parking lot fringed architecture that lures chain stores and franchise restaurants  she kept pointing at the exhibits   this was henry s on the corner   she said  referring to one of her favorite restaurants   it s now a parking lot  which is stupid  if they would have saved some of these stores we would at least have something to attract people   as the historical society meeting breaks up for homemade snacks and cake  i meet bud zeigler    who spent  years sanding down chris craft powerboats on the assembly line until the factory moved to florida  taking some of his colleagues with it  soon after  he ended up as a carpenter making pontiacs at general motors down the road  working there for  years until retirement  his complaint about the government is that it s always the same old faces in charge  who never seem to get things done   i voted for bernie sanders   he said   i just wanted to break it up a little bit  because everybody figures this one is favored  that one is favored  well  give the other guy a chance   he chuckles a bit at this   somewhere along the line you ve got to get somebody in there that maybe can change things a bit with a new thought in their head  without having the same ones always running for office  families running  you know   even in late april  there was little doubt that it d be clinton versus trump come november  trump thinks he can flip michigan  a state that has reliably gone with thedemocratic presidential candidate for years  to support him  at the schoolhouse grille  a buzzing restaurant on harsens island  two women stepped outside at the end of the saturday night dinner rush  sheltering from the drizzle in an outdoor bar area  the two friends discussed how they would approach the polling booths in november  kristin bane  who owns the restaurant and was seeking to escape the kitchen s heat  is a democrat who voted for sanders  she likes obama not least because she also spent part of her childhood in hawaii  opposes fracking and thinks the government should spend more on education  nancy bryson  who came out for a smoke and whose family runs the island s ferry service to the mainland  most admires the two presidents bush   i enjoy listening to bernie   bryson said   i do  and i think that there are so many things that he s saying that i m   you know what  i agree with you wholeheartedly  but i don t want the government to tell me that i have to do that  i don t want to be taxed to do that    bryson argued that trump would help bring the country back to its founding principle  bane was unconvinced   how can we vote for a man who s proposing to build a wall that we have spent so many years breaking down in other countries   bane said as bryson lit a cigarette    my grandfathers and my uncles have died because they were trying to break down walls in other countries so that we could live free and we want to build one  that s the wrong message    ok  i disagree with you there but i love you   bryson replied  her mother was an immigrant  she explained  arriving at ellis island from copenhagen as a  year old girl  the barriers to immigration are higher than they were in the ellis island era  but bryson said there was still no good reason to immigrate to the united states through anything but the legal channels    i ve been wanting to have this conversation for a long time   bane said  without backing down on her point   it s good that we can do this and not get angry and stomp our feet about it   they found common ground in their dislike for clinton   and benghazi   bryson said   i mean it s just unforgivable what happened there    i think she s a professional liar   bane said  i agree   still  for bane  the idea of having to vote for someone other than sanders in november left her anguished   i could say   oh  you know  change  yes change  i want change  and so trump is the quickest way to a change in government   i could tell myself that hopefully it s going to work out for the best  but i can t get past some of these issues like the wall  and i can t get past some of these issues like abortion   a woman should go to jail   what the fuck   it became apparent that bryson was not aware that trump has said he now opposes abortions  this new information was absorbed quickly    oh  he s going anti   she said   well you know what  here s the bottom line  he s just trying to buy the christian base   neither was surprised at how well sanders and trump had done in michigan  the common ground with them is change   bane said   anti establishment   bryson said   here s how i feel   bane said  in a sort of closing statement   i would hope that bernie would get in at least to in to run against trump  i have no time for hillary clinton  and when it comes down to it i more than likely will not vote for her  and if it comes down to her and trump  even though i cringe and i think what s going to happen  i at least will have some hope of some kind of change  something s going to shift if he gets in there  something s got to give  and at least there would be that hope still attached to him  with her  i almost fear her  i think she s a dangerous woman  i think she s an extremely dangerous woman   again  she worried about trump s wall and his position on abortion   a painful change is still change  the two women smiled at each other and hugged and then hurried through the drizzle back into the restaurant  fox and his parents were approaching november with less trepidation  after attending the trump and sanders rallies in quick succession  he made up his mind and informed his parents  who were similarly torn between the two  of his decision  fox thinks women should be allowed to have abortions and that same sex couples should be able to marry  views he attributes to his age  and here he felt he parted company with trump   i couldn t find anything with bernie i disagree about  at all  and that s the reason  as simple as it gets   also  he said   it seemed like trump didn t need my help   he said  which was part of his father s thinking  too  they would vote for trump in november instead  fox s mother  tracy  came in from work and sat down in an armchair opposite her sons  her husband moved to sit at the floor by her feet  the family talked politics for another hour as the room darkened  illuminated only by a muted cnn flashing on the television   both of my guys won   fox said with satisfaction   so that s cool   this report first appeared in  the american
