washington  reuters    the u s  oil and gas industry on wednesday welcomed president elect donald trump s choice of former texas governor rick perry to head the u s  department of energy  and wasted no time making its first specific request of him  to support increased exports of america s natural gas overseas  trump named perry as his pick for the top u s  energy job on wednesday morning  handing the portfolio to a climate change skeptic with close ties to the oil and gas industry  and who previously proposed abolishing the department  the choice adds to a list of drilling proponents who have been tapped for top jobs in trump s administration  worrying environmental groups but fitting neatly with trump s promise to revive oil and gas drilling and coal mining as president by cutting back on federal regulation  jack gerard  president of the washington based american petroleum institute representing oil and natural gas companies  said he welcomed perry s nomination  and called on him to make increasing exports of u s  natural gas a  top priority    as the former governor of texas  rick perry knows the important impact that energy production has on our nation s economy  in his new role at the energy department  he has the opportunity to encourage increased exports of domestically produced natural gas   he said in a statement  natural gas companies are eager to access foreign markets for their supply after a decade long drilling boom that triggered a domestic glut and depressed prices   the oil industry successfully lobbied for an end to a decades old crude oil export ban in december  following a slump in prices  a move meant to help american companies weather lower prices at home  there is no ban on natural gas exports  but u s  law requires american companies to obtain authorization from the energy department before being able to ship it overseas  and there are tough permitting requirements for building the specialized facilities that make shipping gas possible  the united states exported its first cargo of liquefied natural gas earlier this year from an export facility on the gulf coast  but the industry has complained that boosting exports to match global demand has been constrained by a slow and opaque bureaucratic process  u s  energy exports have long been a contentious political issue  dividing lawmakers seeking to balance the benefits of low consumer prices at home and american energy independence against opportunities for companies to expand access to potentially lucrative foreign markets  trump  who takes office on jan    has made energy a central part of his agenda  vowing a revival in the oil  gas and coal industries  and picking industry allies for top administration jobs   on tuesday  trump selected oil giant exxon mobil corp s ceo rex tillerson as secretary of state  his environmental protection agency pick is oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  a foe of democratic president barack obama s initiatives to combat climate change  trump said during his campaign he would pull the united states out of a global deal to curb emissions of carbon dioxide signed in paris last year  though he has since confused observers by saying he would keep an  open mind  on the accord  an overwhelming number of scientists say carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels contributes to changes to the climate that are leading to sea level rise  droughts and more frequent violent storms  trump s transition team said perry s tenure leading texas  the nation s second most populous state and a major producer of oil  gas and wind power  from  until  made him a strong pick for energy secretary   trump said in a statement perry had created  a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state  and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy   the department is responsible for u s  energy policy and oversees the nation s nuclear weapons program   perry is a former presidential rival and critic of trump who unsuccessfully sought the republican nomination in  and   his nomination requires senate confirmation  if confirmed  he would replace ernest moniz  a physicist who was one of the chief negotiators in last year s iran nuclear deal  after his tenure as texas governor  perry joined the board of directors of energy transfer partners  a texas based company building the dakota access pipeline in north dakota that has been stalled by protests by the standing rock sioux tribe and supporters  anthony scaramucci  a member of the trump transition team s executive committee  said the president elect was focused on preserving the environment as well as boosting u s  energy production    whether you believe in climate change or not  we want clean air  we want clean water for the american people  what we also want is energy independence   scaramucci told cnn  billionaire environmental activist tom steyer  who backed trump s democratic opponent hillary clinton in the nov   election  said he hoped perry s nomination would be blocked   trump no longer has to abolish departments  he can dismantle them from within   steyer said   it s now up to the senate to defend our health  our economy and our democracy by defeating this nomination
