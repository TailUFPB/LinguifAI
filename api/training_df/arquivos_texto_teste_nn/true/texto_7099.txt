washington  reuters    it is no surprise that democrats in the u s  congress will oppose donald trump but the most important resistance to fulfilling the president elect s agenda is beginning to emerge from republicans on capitol hill  a small number of influential republicans in the senate are threatening to block appointments to trump s administration  derail his thaw with russia and prevent the planned wall on the border with mexico  the party held onto control of the senate at the nov   election but by only a thin margin  putting powerful swing votes in just a few hands  that empowers republican senate mavericks such as rand paul of kentucky and ted cruz of texas  both were bitter rivals to trump in the  republican presidential primary   paul  a libertarian lone wolf  says he will block senate confirmations if trump nominates either former new york mayor rudy giuliani or former u n  ambassador john bolton to be secretary of state  south carolina s lindsay graham has started publicly outlining places he might be willing to oppose trump  he is against the mexican border wall and is delivering warnings against trump s intention to revoke legal status for undocumented immigrants brought here as children   although that would not require congressional approval   graham  a traditional republican foreign policy hawk  strongly disagrees with trump s attempt to improve ties with russia   i am going to be kind of a hard ass  on russia  graham told reporters recently   we can t sit on the sidelines  and let cyber attacks blamed on russia  go unanswered               the early stirrings of opposition from senate republicans are a sign that the new york businessman  who has never held public office  might run into harsh political realities soon after taking office on jan            other senators who might defy trump are arizona s john mccain and jeff flake  nebraska s ben sasse  florida s marco rubio  maine s susan collins and alaska s lisa murkowski  said senior senate aides and lawmakers      these lawmakers have ruffled feathers in the past and some have a good political reason not to fear trump  paul  mccain  murkowski and rubio do not have to run for reelection until   graham  collins and sasse will have to face the voters in   cruz and flake have an earlier election  in   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  whose job is to keep the republicans in line  knows the challenges ahead  a senior republican aide said mcconnell is  loathe  to spend time trying to move bills that lack the needed senate votes   mcconnell is aware he will not have the support of some of his own lawmakers on bills that could pass the republican controlled house of representatives  such as appropriating money to build the mexican wall and further abortion restrictions  the aide said  but trump has a history of taming what appear to be well entrenched republican opponents  he won the party nomination against all the odds and some of his staunchest opponents like rubio and cruz ended up endorsing him          and swing votes in the senate cut two ways  the democrats have their own potential renegades such as west virginia s joe manchin  who has already declared his support for trump s nomination of republican senator jeff sessions as attorney general  such swings by democrats toward republicans may be likelier ahead of the  elections  when democrats must defend more vulnerable senate seats than republicans  senate democratic leader chuck schumer must deal with this  trump said over the weekend he and schumer  always had a good relationship   republicans are likely to control only  seats in the  seat senate  meaning three defections within the party are enough to block cabinet appointments which only require  votes  vice president elect mike pence would break   ties  the task for mcconnell gets more difficult when it comes to passing legislation  which requires  votes  known as cloture  to allow a bill to move forward  if trump plans to sign a bill while in office  perhaps one that will change immigration law or restrict abortions  mcconnell will have to keep all republicans in line and win over an additional eight democrats  trump could deliver on campaign promises that do not require legislative approval like blocking the trans pacific partnership trade deal or ending the iran nuclear pact  the repeal of the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  enjoys robust republican support and would be done through a legislative maneuver that does not require any democratic support   collins and murkowski have a history of crossing the aisle to join democrats and could shy from abortion restrictions  cruz has never feared disrupting senate business to prove a point or seek concessions in legislation   sasse did not waver from his staunch criticism of trump through the campaign  flake has said he is  eating crow  after trump s win  but he could defect on immigration and border security  issues he has previously joined with democrats on  paul was asked last week on msnbc if he would put a hold on giuliani or bolton  in the senate  a hold allows a single senator to delay a confirmation  he left open the possibility of such a move  saying   i feel pretty strongly about it    he said   we have a   majority  all it would take is two or three republicans to say they can t go along with giuliani and can t go along with bolton
