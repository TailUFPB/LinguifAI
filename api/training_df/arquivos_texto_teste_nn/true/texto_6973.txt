washington  reuters    change at the federal reserve could come quickly with president elect donald trump s team pledging to promptly fill high level central bank jobs and roll out a tax and fiscal plan that could rewrite policymakers  core economic assumptions    fed officials already say their plan to gradually increase interest rates may need to be accelerated to accommodate the new administration s economic proposals  which could push inflation higher  the concerns for fed chair janet yellen are broader as she faces a  month window to preserve her legacy and try to ensure the central bank s independence in the face of a possible four or more trump appointees to its seven member board of governors  yellen s term as fed chief expires in february   and trump is likely to name a successor in synch with his desire to cut financial regulation  lower corporate taxes  reorder fiscal policy  and possibly impose some of the constraints on the fed that republicans in congress have long advocated   yellen    a ranking fed official for the past  years and the top u s  central banker since   laid out a long list of concerns during recent questioning before congress  that any fiscal boost not blow up the deficit and be tailored to improve growth and productivity  that the regulations crafted after the   financial crisis not be trashed  that the fed not be hamstrung by policy rules or political pressure   there is clear evidence of better outcomes in countries where central banks can take the long view  are not subject to short term political pressures   yellen said in her testimony   sometimes central banks need to do things that are not immediately popular    fed officials would not comment on whether trump and yellen have spoken  or describe the contact so far between the central bank and the republican businessman s transition team  trump transition officials could not be reached for comment  it remains unclear how deep a stamp trump wants to put on the fed  or what he feels about issues like central bank independence that are fundamental to yellen and her peers   trump s sharp comments about yellen during the presidential campaign  when he accused her of setting monetary policy to help democrats  rattled fed officials who felt he had crossed a line  but it is not known whether he ll be content to merely change personnel   fed vice chair stanley fischer s term also runs out in    or whether he hopes to infuse the central bank with a different operating philosophy altogether  congressional republicans are expected to push legislation forcing more oversight of the central bank  possibly tying it to a monetary policy rule that more mechanically sets rates  among the candidates mentioned as yellen s possible replacement is stanford university economics professor john taylor  whose  taylor rule  is often used in analysis and as a reference point in debate over the usefulness of rules in general  in his first comments after being named as trump s choice for treasury secretary  steven mnuchin indicated in a fox business interview that the new administration s plans could quickly alter the collegial and consensus driven dynamic yellen has tried to mold   the plan is to move soon to fill two open board seats at the fed  and appointing one of those as a vice chair of supervision  will be a big priority   said mnuchin  a former goldman sachs partner and hollywood financier  many analysts feel such a move could prompt the resignation of fed governor daniel tarullo ahead of the expiry of his term in   giving trump a fifth board seat to fill  a former clinton administration economic advisor appointed to the fed by president barack obama  tarullo currently handles regulatory issues but has never been formally named vice chair  he would not comment on his plans in a public appearance last month   financial markets  which had been spooked by trump s anti trade comments during the campaign  so far appear to expect  smooth sailing and a sober version of trumpism  the prospect of major tax reform has bolstered u s  stocks  especially in the financial sector where regulations are expected to be eased  and the dollar has rallied against major currencies  yet for the fed  trump s victory brings a new and possibly unnerving sort of uncertainty  the fed has the equivalent of a university full of phd economists who can employ sophisticated models to gauge how new tax or fiscal policies might change growth  inflation and unemployment   what they can t model is the fallout if a major trade agreement is summarily ripped up  or if trump follows through on campaign threats to declare china a currency manipulator   do you think the ideologue or the pragmatist prevails   said cornerstone macro analyst roberto perli  who like many in the markets argues that trump s most volatile rhetoric won t find its way into practice   fed officials have so far struck a cautious note    it is time to be patient and see how things unfold   governor jerome powell said at the brookings institution in washington on wednesday   but some feel that policymakers may need to get on top of the coming wave   fed officials can t simply dismiss the prospect of legislative reforms anymore   dartmouth university economics professor and former fed adviser andrew levin said   it seems practically inevitable
