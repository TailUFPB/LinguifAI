 although the second amendment people  maybe there is  i don t know   he continued  the u s  constitution s second amendment guarantees the right to bear firearms  before the remark  trump had been emphasizing his case against clinton  who is leading in national opinion polls in the race for the nov   election  some in the audience in north carolina who were seated behind trump could be seen wincing when he made the comment  clinton s campaign called the remark  dangerous    a person seeking to be the president of the united states should not suggest violence in any way   it said    when asked to clarify what trump meant  his campaign said he was referring to getting supporters of the second amendment to rally votes for trump in the election   it s called the power of unification    amendment people have amazing spirit and are tremendously unified  which gives them great political power   the trump campaign said in its statement  immediately after trump made his comment  many on

introducing trump later at another rally in north carolina  in fayetteville  former new york mayor rudy giuliani accused the news media of taking the remark out of context to help clinton get elected   what he meant by that was you have the power to vote against her   giuliani said to cheers   you have the power to speak against her  you know why  because you re americans    it proves that most of the press is in the tank for hillary clinton   he added   they are doing everything they can to destroy donald trump   the u s  secret service  which provides security details for both trump and clinton and rarely comments on political matters  when asked for a response on trump  said   the secret service is aware of the comment        trump later told fox news channel s  hannity  program that  nobody in that room  thought he meant anything other than to rally support against clinton   this is a strong powerful movement  the second amendment   trump said   hillary wants to take your guns away  she wants to leave you unprotected in your home   this is a tremendous political movement   by day s end  trump was drawing criticism on several fronts  another chapter in a campaign marked by bitterness and  partisanship  michael hayden  a former cia director who on monday was among  republican national security experts to denounce trump in a letter  said on cnn   you re not just responsible for what you say  you are responsible for what people hear   u s  senator elizabeth warren  a liberal firebrand who loves tweaking trump  tweeted that the republican nominee  makes death threats because he s a pathetic coward who can t handle the fact that he s losing to a girl   trump senior adviser kellyanne conway fought back in a tweet of her own  calling warren a  disgrace   gun rights  which have long stirred strong emotions in america  have been a particularly potent issue in the  presidential campaign as violence has convulsed some u s  cities  trump has planted himself firmly on the side of gun owners with a  law and order  campaign  before his remark about clinton on tuesday  he had said islamic state militants who killed  people in france last year could have been stopped if some of the victims had been armed  the clinton campaign has challenged trump when in the past he has accused her of planning to abolish the second amendment if elected president  clinton

heels of a discordant week on the campaign trail for trump  a businessman seeking his first public office  he came under fire from within his party for belatedly endorsing fellow republicans in re election races and a prolonged clash with the parents of fallen muslim american army captain humayun khan  on monday  trump seemed to be heeding republican advice to stick to a message of criticizing clinton and other democrats while putting forward economic policy proposals in a speech in detroit  trump s vice presidential running mate  mike pence  asked if he believed trump was inciting violence toward clinton  told nbc s philadelphia affiliate   of course not  no   but democrats called trump s remarks another sign of a candidate unfit for the white house   don t treat this as a political misstep  it s an assassination threat  seriously upping the possibility of a national tragedy   crisis   u s  senator chris murphy  a democrat  said in a tweet  overall sentiment on social media posts
