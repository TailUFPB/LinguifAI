washington  reuters    a defense policy bill that president barack obama is expected to sign into law this month will give president elect donald trump greater influence over u s  foreign broadcasting entities  the national defense authorization act passed by congress last week includes a provision abolishing the broadcasting board of governors  an independent body that oversees government backed media outlets such as the voice of america and radio free europe  and replaces it with a chief executive nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate  the election victory of republican businessman trump  who has had a stormy relationship with some media outlets he accuses of being biased against him  has raised concerns among some officials about whether the media outlets can maintain their editorial independence under a trump appointed ceo it is not clear  however  if the change is intended to give the president greater influence over news  information and fact checking that u s  government supported broadcasters send to russia  cuba  china and other authoritarian states  or whether it is simply an effort to make those efforts more effective  there has been support from both republicans and democrats for reorganizing the broadcasting operation to reduce bureaucracy and increase efficiency   a senior u s  official familiar with the broadcasting agencies said he was not aware of the trump transition team making contact with the board of broadcasting governors and associated agencies   we have no  concrete  indication that anything bad s going to happen   the official continued    congressional aides familiar with the issue said they thought such concerns were overblown  noting that the chief executive must be confirmed by the senate and that the organization s basic structure would remain in place  minus the nine member board  they said the reorganization plan was developed with input from members of both parties in congress  as well as democratic officials from the obama white house  however  some officials in the state department and the u s  intelligence community have said they are worried that trump is not wary enough of russian president vladimir putin  who considers radio free europe radio liberty s efforts  to promote democratic values  an attempt to undermine his government  the board of governors would first be transitioned into an  international broadcasting advisory board  to advise the new ceo  but that also would be phased out
