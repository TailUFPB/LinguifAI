atlanta  reuters    u s  democrats elected former labor secretary tom perez as chairman on saturday  choosing a veteran of the obama administration to lead the daunting task of rebuilding the party and heading the opposition to republican president donald trump  members of the democratic national committee  the administrative and fundraising arm of the party  picked perez on the second round of voting over u s  representative keith ellison  a liberal from minnesota  following one of the most crowded and competitive party leadership elections in decades  perez faces a challenge in unifying and rejuvenating a party still reeling from the nov   loss of democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  he immediately made ellison his deputy  after losing the presidency and failing to recapture majorities in congress  party leaders are anxious to channel the growing grassroots resistance to trump into political support for democrats at all levels of government across the country   we are suffering from a crisis of confidence  a crisis of relevance   perez  a favorite of former obama administration officials  told dnc members  he promised to lead the fight against trump and change the dnc s culture to make it a more grassroots operation  perez  the son of dominican immigrants who was considered a potential running mate for clinton  overcame a strong challenge from ellison and prevailed on a   second round vote  ellison  who is the first muslim elected to the u s  congress  was backed by liberal leader u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  the showdown between candidates backed by the establishment and progressive wings of the party echoed the bitter  primary between clinton and sanders  a rift democrats will try to put behind them as they turn their focus to fighting trump  those divisions persisted through the months long race for chair  as many in the party s liberal wing were suspicious of perez s ties to the establishment and some democrats raised questions about possible anti semitism in ellison s past  some ellison supporters chanted  not big money  party for the people  after the result was announced  but both perez and ellison moved quickly to bring the rival factions together  at perez s urging  the dnc suspended the rules after the vote and appointed ellison the deputy chairman of the party   i am asking you to give everything you ve got to support chairman perez   ellison told dnc members after the vote   we don t have the luxury  folks  to walk out of this room divided   perez said the party would come together   we are one family  and i know we will leave here united today   perez said   a united democratic party is not only our best hope  it is donald trump s nightmare   trump took a dig at perez and democrats in a tweet offering his congratulations on the election   i could not be happier for him  or for the republican party   trump said  perez and ellison wore each other s campaign buttons and stood shoulder to shoulder at a news conference after the vote  perez said the two had talked  for some time  about teaming up  and ellison said they had  good synergy    we need to do more to collaborate with our partners in the progressive movement   perez said  adding he and ellison would look for ways to  channel this incredible momentum  in the protests against trump and against republican efforts to repeal president barack obama s healthcare plan  sanders issued a statement congratulating perez and urging changes at the dnc   it is imperative that tom understands that the same old  same old is not working   sanders said   we must open the doors of the party to working people and young people in a way that has never been done before   the election offered the dnc a fresh start after last year s forced resignation of chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  who stepped aside when the release of hacked emails appeared to show dnc officials trying to help clinton defeat sanders in the primaries  both perez and ellison have pledged to focus on a bottom up reconstruction of the party  which has lost hundreds of statehouse seats under obama and faces an uphill task in trying to reclaim majorities in congress in next year s midterm elections  perez said he would redefine the role of the dnc to make it work not just to elect democrats to the white house but in races ranging from local school boards to the u s  senate  pledging to  organize  organize  organize    i recognize i have a lot of work to do   he said   i will be out there listening and learning in the weeks ahead   perez fell one vote short of the simple majority of   votes needed for election in the first round of voting  getting   votes to ellison s   also on the first ballot were four other candidates   idaho democratic party executive director sally boynton brown  election lawyer peter peckarsky  and activists jehmu greene and sam ronan  pete buttigieg  the mayor of south bend  indiana  withdrew just before the voting  while brown  greene and ronan dropped out after the first round
