washington  reuters    federal election observers can only be sent to five states in this year s u s  presidential election  among the smallest deployments since the voting rights act was passed in  to end racial discrimination at the ballot box  the plan  confirmed in a u s  department of justice fact sheet seen by reuters  reflects changes brought about by the supreme court s  decision to strike down parts of the act  a signature legislative achievement of the  civil rights movement  voting rights advocates told reuters they were concerned that the scaling back of observers would make it harder to detect and counter efforts to intimidate or hinder voters  especially in southern states with a history of racial discrimination at the ballot box  the supreme court ruling undercut a key section of the act that requires such states to obtain u s  approval before changing election laws  the court struck down the formula used to determine which states were affected  by doing so  it ended the justice department s ability to select voting areas it deemed at risk of racial discrimination and deploy observers there  the fact sheet said  eleven mostly southern states had been certified as needing federal observers by the department  federal observers can still be sent to monitor elections but only when authorized by federal court rulings  currently  courts have done so in five states  alabama  alaska  california  louisiana  and new york  according to the justice department  a justice department spokesman declined to comment on the fact sheet or say how many people will be deployed to monitor voting until closer to the nov   election pitting republican donald trump against democrat hillary clinton  in recent presidential elections  the justice department has sent more than  people to watch elections around the country  they were split into three categories  the supreme court ruling reduced that to two  according to the document  one category is justice department staff  who have no statutory authority to access polling sites but still monitor voting nationwide  they must rely on local and state authorities to grant them access to polling locations  a second group are federal observers trained by the office of personnel management with unfettered access to polling sites  they are only deployed by federal court order  a third group   which the document said has been eliminated by the supreme court decision   are federal observers deployed to jurisdictions that the attorney general selected based on evidence of possible racial discrimination  they were also trained by the office of personnel management and had full access to polling sites  attorney general loretta lynch said on friday the justice department s ability to deploy election observers had been  severely curtailed  by the supreme court s decision  since congress passed the  act  federal observers have gathered evidence of unlawful activity and prepared reports from polling sites that can be used as evidence in court  in the november  presidential election  the last for which the justice department provided numbers of federal observers  about  federal observers and more than  department personnel were dispatched to polling sites in  jurisdictions in  states   the mix of tools has shifted   said justin levitt  who oversees the justice department s voting section  the department still has the ability to send in personnel and take legal action against election officials where necessary  he said in an interview  but justice department staff who monitor elections have significantly less authority than federal observers  at any point on election day  justice department staff can be denied entry to a voting area or asked to leave  unlike a federal observer  that could make it more difficult to gather evidence of voting problems and potentially make it harder to prosecute cases of suppression  say voting rights advocates  suppression can take a number of forms  such as intimidating or misinforming voters  or denying them access to voting materials in their own language  relying on justice department personnel to monitor elections is  a far cry  from federal observers who are statutorily authorized to be inside the polling place  said gerry hebert  executive director of the washington  d c  based non profit campaign legal center  hebert  a former senior justice department voting rights official  oversaw teams of federal observers in the u s  south before leaving the department in   federal observer reports have been cited in court cases by groups alleging voter fraud  in sandoval county  new mexico  federal observer reports showed that native american voters had difficulty getting voting information in their native languages during the decade between  and   according to a  court order in a case the united states brought against the county  dale ho  director of the american civil liberties union s voting rights project  said federal observers are especially needed this year because  states have tightened restrictions on voting since the last presidential election   we re very disappointed by the decision of the justice department   said ho  the supreme court ruling did not mention the federal observer program specifically   so i don t think this decision was inevitable   he added  anita earls  the executive director of the southern coalition for social justice and a former senior official in the justice department s voting section  said the guaranteed ability of federal observers to examine voter registration rolls and remain inside polling stations makes them more effective than justice department staff at catching voter suppression
