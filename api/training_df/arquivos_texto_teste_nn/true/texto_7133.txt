san francisco  reuters    the main u s  visa program for technology workers could face renewed scrutiny under president elect donald trump and his proposed attorney general  senator jeff sessions  a long time critic of the skilled worker program  h  visas admit   workers and another   graduate student workers each year  the tech industry  which has lobbied to expand the program  may now have to fight a rear guard action to protect it  immigration attorneys and lobbyists said  trump sent mixed signals on the campaign trail  sometimes criticizing the visas but other times calling them an important way to retain foreign talent  sessions  however  has long sought to curtail the program and introduced legislation last year aiming to make the visas less available to large outsourcing companies such as infosys  such firms  by far the largest users of h  visas  provide foreign contractors to u s  companies looking to slash information technology costs   thousands of u s  workers are being replaced by foreign labor   sessions said at a february hearing  a spokesperson for sessions did not immediately respond to a request for comment  a trump transition team spokesperson declined to comment  the h  visa is intended for specialty occupations that typically require a college education  companies use them in two main ways to hire technology workers  tech firms such as microsoft and google typically hire highly skilled  well paid foreign workers that are in short supply  they help many of them secure so called green cards that allow them to work in the u s  permanently  by contrast  firms such as infosys and tata consultancy services  both based in india  use the visas to deploy lower paid contractors that critics say rarely end up with green cards  infosys did not immediately respond to a request for comment  a tata spokesman declined to comment  h  visas are assigned through a lottery once a year by u s  citizenship and immigration services  this year  companies filed   petitions for the   available visas  a cap set in u s  law  they are awarded to employers   not employees   and tied to specific positions  both democratic and republican critics have argued that companies such as walt disney co and southern california edison co  scepe a   a utility  have used the program to terminate in house it employees and replace them with cheaper contractors  sessions last year urged then attorney general eric holder to investigate southern california edison s use of h  visas in a letter than was also signed by democratic sens  bernie sanders  richard durbin and sherrod brown  disney and edison did not immediately respond to requests for comment but have said previously that they paid foreign contractors comparably with local staffers  the justice department in  settled a visa fraud case with infosys for   million  federal investigators accused infosys of using easier to obtain business travel visas to import foreign workers who were required to have h  visas  investigators also alleged that infosys told foreign workers to lie to u s  officials about the cities where they would work  in the settlement  infosys denied the allegations but agreed to retain a third party auditor for two years and to provide the government with detailed descriptions of what its visa holders were supposed to be doing in the u s  several constituencies have called for program reforms  including the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  that industry s largest professional association  it wants the lottery ditched in favor of a system that would award visas to companies offering the highest paying jobs  said russ harrison  director of government relations   that could potentially shut out employers looking to mine the program for cheap foreign labor  sessions included a similar measure in his  bill  tech industry groups also want changes  fwd us   the immigration lobbying group backed by facebook co founder mark zuckerberg   supports setting higher minimum wages and giving priority to companies that sponsor h  workers for green cards   we re going to advocate for expanding the program  but we re also going to advocate for reforming the program   fwd us president todd shulte said in an interview  the current program mainly benefits big companies at the expense of both u s  and immigrant workers  said gaurav mehta  a  year old h  holder from new delhi who works for a cyber security firm in san francisco  h  workers struggle to switch jobs without risking deportation  he said  which allows employers to pay them less   the current system is not working for americans  and it s not working for immigrants   he said  some trump allies expect him to keep the program mostly intact  including shalabh  shalli  kumar   an indian born chicago businessman who donated    to his campaign    he has said to us that these are amazing people and it would be crazy to let them go   kumar said in an interview  but kumar has urged trump to eliminate country by country quotas that create long waits for indian and chinese nationals to get green cards  john miano  an attorney with the immigration reform law institute   a conservative group that has been aligned with trump   also supports prioritizing h  applications from companies offering higher pay  such a change would hit the outsourcing firms hard  the top  recipients of h  visas in  were all outsourcing firms  according to government data compiled by the ieee  tata consultancy services topped the list by securing   h  visas  amazon  by contrast  ranked number  and was awarded just  h  visas  google and microsoft ranked no   and   with facebook at no   and apple at no    some h  visa holders aren t waiting  sofie graham   a marketer at the san francisco startup buildzoom com and a dual irish and british citizen   secured her h  visa last year  although she could have worked for six years on the visa  she and the company decided to apply for a green card   everywhere i looked  people were saying we should have fewer h    she said   i just wanted to get a green card as soon as possible    this version of the story has been refiled to clarify that the institute of electrical and electronics engineers represents engineers and not engineering companies
