washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  congress hope to convince president elect donald trump to support an untested strategy of using the tax code to promote exports while slashing corporate taxes  framing it as a way to fulfill his campaign promises to restore blue collar jobs  the plan would be one way to help republican lawmakers reconcile their long standing goal of tax cuts with the often populist campaign rhetoric of trump  who has attacked the north american free trade agreement  nafta  and other trade deals as bad for u s  workers  critics say it risks running afoul of global trade rules and increasing costs for u s  consumers  analysts also say that any export gains could be short lived if the strategy causes the dollar to strengthen  wiping out any price advantage for u s  products in international markets  it is likely to undergo months of debate as part of a larger package of proposals offered in congressional republicans   a better way  economic plan  but at least one trump adviser already seems to have a favorable view of the export focused  border adjustability  strategy   if we have a border adjustable tax system  that can solve a lot of these trade issues that trump is talking about   economic analyst and trump adviser stephen moore said in an interview   you re going to tax what s imported and not going to tax what s exported  so we re going to reduce the trade deficit and we re going to have more companies come in here   moore said  border adjustability s details are not clearly explained in a summary of the  a better way  plan from house speaker paul ryan and house tax committee chairman kevin brady  but the tax foundation  a think tank that closely studies business tax policy  said the strategy would be implemented by making revenue from sales to non u s  residents non taxable  while preventing importers from deducting the cost of goods bought from non residents  brady told reuters that border adjustability would  virtually eliminate  any tax incentive for u s  companies to move operations overseas and encourage foreign investment to return to the united states   we ve got a great argument  i think   he said  steven mnuchin  trump s pick for u s  treasury secretary and co author of the president elect s tax plan  described tax reform on wednesday as  something that happens absolutely within the first  days of this presidency   wilbur ross  trump s nominee for commerce secretary  did not mention tax policy directly but said the trump administration s aim would be to increase exports in part by getting rid of  non tariff  barriers  the perceived winners under a border adjustability approach would include u s  manufacturers that export heavily  while large volume importers  such as u s  retailers  could be hurt  that distinction was already dividing corporate lobbying groups   while retailers support an overhaul of the tax code   the tax on imports proposed in the house blueprint is cause for concern for retailers   said christin fernandez  spokeswoman for the retail industry leaders association  a washington group  the industry group s members include wal mart stores inc  home depot inc and target corp  some version of border adjustability could attract support from democrats  senator ben cardin  a maryland democrat who sits on the senate finance committee and the panel s tax subcommittee  said he strongly favors the idea  but he called the emerging house plan  very  very questionable  because it would use tax on corporate income rather than a consumption tax  tax lawyers and other experts have said such an approach risks violating long standing world trade rules that allow countries to adjust their trading positions through indirect taxes  such as a sales tax  but not with direct taxes like the u s  corporate tax        it would lead to uncertainty on how it would be treated internationally  and that s bad for business   cardin told reuters       trump s transition team and other trump advisors on the economy did not respond to requests for comment  brady has said border adjustability would pass muster with the world trade organization  which polices global trade  the wto declined to comment on the plan  border adjustability is only one component of the  a better way  blueprint  it would also slash the corporate income tax rate to  percent from a top rate of  percent  repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax  and let businesses write off capital investments immediately  altogether  the house republicans  corporate tax plan would reduce u s  corporate tax revenues by about   billion over  years  estimated the non partisan tax policy center  perpetuating a long term decline in the corporate tax take  combined with an equally ambitious package of individual income tax cut proposals put forward in the  better way  package  the republican plan would boost the federal deficit by about    trillion over a decade  the center estimated  advocates of border adjustability note that u s  trading partners including china use value added taxes to favor exports over imports and say the house proposal would level the playing field for u s  companies   but some tax experts have questioned how effective it would be  kyle pomerleau and stephen entin of the tax foundation wrote in june that the increased demand abroad for cheaper u s  made goods would boost the dollar s value and cancel out gains for exporters  still  supporters of the plan believe it could win the favor of the president elect  who has railed against u s  companies that have shifted production abroad and scaled back u s  operations  trump has already ruled out u s  participation in the ambitious trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade deal and has vowed to renegotiate or quit nafta   when trump understands how the blueprint works  particularly the border adjustability provision  which will create a huge incentive to make stuff in the united states  i think he ll be delirious
