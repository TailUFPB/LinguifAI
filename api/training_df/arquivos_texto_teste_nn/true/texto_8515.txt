washington  reuters    a former cia officer and congressional staffer on monday launched a long shot bid for president  a republican billing himself as a conservative alternative to donald trump who disenchanted voters can rally around  there is virtually no chance that the newly announced candidate  evan mcmullin  could win and only a slight chance he will even be able to get his name on the ballots of key states  mcmullin has no name recognition across the country and was not even well known in the capitol where until monday he was the chief policy director for the organizational body of all republicans in the house of representatives  but that will not stop some conservatives from pitching him as an option in the nov   election for those who never warmed to trump and remain adamantly opposed to democrat hillary clinton   donald trump appeals to the worst fears of americans at a time we need unity  not division   mcmullin wrote in a letter announcing his candidacy   with the stakes so high for our nation and at this late stage in the process  i can no longer stand on the sidelines    mcmullin s campaign was first reported by msnbc and buzzfeed  he could not be immediately reached for comment  trump was formally anointed his party s nominee last month after beating  rivals in the state by state primary contests  but many republicans have been concerned about trump s policies  such as his proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country  and his free wheeling  often insulting rhetoric  mcmullin has never held public office  in addition to lacking a quick source of campaign cash  he will face immediate hurdles to try to get his name on enough ballot papers to make himself a serious candidate  texas  for example  requires third party candidates to get more than   signatures from residents who did not vote in either the republican or democratic primary  and the deadline for that was in early may   deadlines to get on the ballots have also lapsed for north carolina  illinois and florida  all large states that also could be pivotal in the election  the best mcmullin could likely hope for would be to simply play spoiler to trump in a handful of states  eating away at the new york real estate developer s ability to win states that are generally reliably republican  mcmullin would join two other third party hopefuls   gary johnson  who was nominated by the libertarian party  and jill stein  who will represent the green party  in recent polls that included trump  clinton  stein and trump  the two third party candidates have both struggled to get above  percentage points in the polls  mcmullin  who according to his linkedin profile worked in congress since   has been a frequent critic of trump on social media  calling him an authoritarian and criticizing his stance on civil rights as well as his refusal to release his tax returns  prior to working in congress  mcmullin spent  years as an operations officer for the central intelligence agency   trump  meanwhile  was seeking to reset his campaign with a big economy policy speech on monday after a rough patch last week  he was widely criticized  including by some senior republicans  for engaging in a public dispute with the parents of a muslim american soldier killed in iraq
