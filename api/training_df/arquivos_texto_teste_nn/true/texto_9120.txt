manchester  n h  washington  reuters    republican donald trump on monday placed responsibility for a mass shooting in florida squarely at the feet of radical muslims  who he said were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and  trying to take over our children   the presumptive republican presidential nominee drew on the country s deadliest mass shooting to sharpen his vow to ban muslim immigrants  proposing that the united states suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is  a proven history of terrorism   in his national security speech  trump said it was time to  tell the truth about radical islam   the day after  people were killed at a gay nightclub in orlando by a gunman  likely self radicalized  who had sworn allegiance to the rebel group islamic state  his comments contrasted sharply to those of hillary clinton  the wealthy businessman s likely democratic rival in the nov   election  who urged increased intelligence gathering and more airstrikes on islamic state territory  and cautioned against  demonizing  american muslims   if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans   women and children  gay and straight  jews and christians and all people   then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now   trump told the crowd in new hampshire  he went on to lambaste clinton s policies  saying they would allow  hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east  to enter the united states without adequate security measures  there would be  no system to vet them  or to prevent the radicalization of    their children   he said   not only their children  by the way  they re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is  and we don t know what s happening   trump said that  if elected  he would use the executive authority of the presidency to impose stronger controls on immigration to protect americans from attacks  fine tuning his earlier campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of foreign muslims to shore up national security   when i m elected  i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states  europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats   he said  he noted that the parents of the florida gunman  omar mateen    were born in afghanistan  pointing to specific incidents such as the sept      attacks  trump said threats were posed by people with roots in pakistan  saudi arabia and somalia  the immigration ban  he said would last until  we are in a position to properly screen these people coming into our country  they re pouring in  and we don t know what we re doing   trump s hard line proposals on immigration have helped fuel his surge in popularity among some conservative voters  but they have also triggered heavy condemnation from minority and human rights activists  and his political opponents   many of whom have called his rhetoric racist  trump has rejected the criticism  and has said he is often misunderstood by the media and his opponents   anti woman  anti gay  in her response to the florida massacre  clinton  warned against demonizing muslim americans and called for increased efforts to remove islamic state propaganda from the internet  more air strikes in areas held by the group and better coordination with allies in the region    the orlando terrorist may be dead  but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very strong  and we must attack it   she said in a speech in cleveland  she specifically criticized three u s  allies   saudi arabia  qatar and kuwait   for allowing its citizens to fund mosques and schools that train jihadists   she also proposed stricter gun control laws  reiterating previous calls to prohibit people on terrorism watch lists from buying firearms  she pointed out that while the federal bureau of investigation was aware of mateen as a possible threat  he was still able to purchase a gun legally    it s important that we stop the terrorists from getting the tools they need to carry out the attacks  and that is especially true when it comes to assault weapons like those used in orlando and san bernardino   california  clinton said  drawing a standing ovation from the crowd  trump challenged clinton to explain why she favored letting syrian civil war refugees into the united states  he said his policies would better protect american women  gays and lesbians  jews and christians  trump s support among women and gay voters lags far behind that of clinton   radical islam is anti woman  anti gay and anti american   said trump   he accused her of having ties to saudi arabia   saudi arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the clinton foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays   he said in a facebook post   hillary must return all money from such countries
