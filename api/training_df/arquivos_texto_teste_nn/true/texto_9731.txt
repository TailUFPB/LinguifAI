oklahoma city  reuters    oklahoma lawmakers will take up legislation next week aimed at ensuring sex crimes do not go unpunished in the state because the victims were unconscious or intoxicated when they occurred   in march  oklahoma s highest criminal court ruled the state s rape law addresses sexual assault cases involving people who were either unconscious or intoxicated when they were victims of abuse  but the court ruled that oklahoma s forcible sodomy law  which also pertains to oral sex  did not address such cases  the ruling was in response to allegations that a tulsa teenager sexually assaulted a girl who had passed out after a night of drinking  a lower court judge had dismissed the case last year  oklahoma representative scott biggs  a republican  said on friday he is filing legislation to define forcible sodomy in a way that includes unconscious victims  the bill  which is widely supported  is expected to be heard by the oklahoma legislature in the coming week  biggs said   the judges made a grave error  but if they need more clarification  we are happy to give it to them by fixing the statute   biggs said in an interview  the state s highest criminal appeals court said in its ruling   sodomy cannot occur where a victim is so intoxicated as to be completely unconscious at the time of the sexual act of oral copulation    it added   we will not  in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense  enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language   the ruling in march had gone mostly unnoticed until the public interest journalism site oklahoma watch reported on it this month  sparking a public outcry  the case from  involved two high school students who were drinking and smoking marijuana with friends  the boy testified the oral sex was consensual but the girl said it was not  according to oklahoma watch  which added that the teen s dna was found on the girl   unfortunately  legal minds often get stuck on questions of semantics  when it is clear to most of us what the intent of the law is   biggs said   i can t stress enough how sorry i am for the victim and that she was denied justice   he added
