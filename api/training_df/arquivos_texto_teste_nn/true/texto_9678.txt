new york  reuters    donald trump s vow to round up and deport all of america s undocumented immigrants if he is elected president could shrink the economy by around  percent  according to a study to be released on thursday by conservative think tank the american action forum      the research adds to concerns about the republican presidential nominee s policy proposals  which range from tearing up international trade agreements to building a wall along the u s  border with mexico      about   million of the more than  million immigrants living in the united states illegally are employed  according to government statistics  removing them would cause a slump of    billion to    billion in private sector output  the washington based non profit said in its analysis      the study added that removing those workers could leave potentially millions of jobs unfilled due to a lack of legal workers willing to do them  industries with the highest share of undocumented workers include farming  construction and hospitality  according to the research   the things donald trump has said are utterly unworkable   said douglas holtz eakin  the forum s president  and the top economic adviser to senator john mccain s  presidential campaign      asked about the study on thursday  trump said he thought the analysts misunderstood his immigration policy  adding he wanted people to come into the country if they came  through the system    i saw that report and they don t even have it right   trump said in an interview on cnbc   we certainly don t want to shrink our economy       trump  who effectively locked up the republican nomination this week  has called for the deportation of anyone living in the united states illegally  arguing foreign workers hold down salaries and contribute to unemployment      that position has drawn strong opposition from business leaders like the conservative billionaire koch brothers as well as from human rights advocates  trump has further angered opponents by saying mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states  and by calling for a temporary ban on muslims entering the country to shore up national security       but his hard line stance on immigration also has triggered strong support among many u s  voters      some   percent of respondents to a reuters ipsos poll conducted in september said they want to see most or all undocumented immigrants deported  compared with   percent who want to see most or all of them stay      the american action forum analysis used data from the bureau of labor statistics to estimate the value of the output from undocumented immigrants      the study did not factor in potential impacts of mass deportations on consumption  investment and other economic factors  the group said      the u s  economy is projected to produce some    trillion worth of goods and services in   according to the international monetary fund  a loss of   billion in output would amount to about  percent of that figure
