new york  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump on thursday appeared to weigh into a debate over a controversial u s  biofuels program with a proposal that would back the position of billionaire investor carl icahn  one of his wealthiest backers  in a factsheet on economic policy  the trump campaign slammed a system of buying and selling biofuel blending credits that it said was bankrupting smaller oil refiners   the system is a central part of the renewable fuel standard  rfs   the federal program that requires fuel sold in the united states to contain a minimum volume of biofuels  such as ethanol  the comments were later removed from the trump campaign website  a trump spokesman said an incorrect version of the factsheet was temporarily placed online  he said trump remains committed to the renewable fuel standard  it was unclear whether the comments reflected a changed stance from trump on the country s more than decade old rfs program  which he has previously voiced support for  but they echoed the position of icahn  who recently called on federal regulators to level the playing field in the credits system to favor independent refiners like cvr energy inc  cvi n   in which icahn is the majority shareholder  icahn s office did not return an email and call when asked to comment   these regulations will give big oil an oligopoly by destroying the small to mid size refineries   the factsheet on trump s economic policies said   these requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country   it added     the comments underscored a growing schism within the oil sector pitting large oil companies against independent oil refiners  it also touches on a debate between the interests of big oil and big corn  which strongly backs the mandated use of ethanol in fuels and the credit system to make it work   the rfs has hurt independent refiners  who do not always have the ability to mix biofuels into their gasoline and diesel before they send it to gas stations  to sell their gasoline without the required biofuel content  they have to buy credits from oil companies that have blended the fuels  those credits have cost the companies billions of dollars  and  looks set to be the most expensive on record to buy the credits  known as rins philadelphia energy solutions inc pesc n said last week that it plans to slash benefits and reduce staff  citing the high cost of buying rins as one of the principal reasons it needed to make the cuts  independent refiners are pressing environmental regulators for changes to the program that could increase the amount of credits the larger companies need  industry sources have said  for its part  big oil favors a repeal of the whole program  rather than a tweak that may land it with increased costs  biofuels advocates also are against a change to the program
