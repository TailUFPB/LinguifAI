 reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump s effort to clarify his position on illegal immigration during visits to both sides of the u s  mexico frontier on wednesday did little to sway moderate republicans near the border  a dozen voters in arizona told reuters on thursday  they were either unaware of his whirlwind tour or found that his uncharacteristically diplomatic demeanor during a visit with mexican president enrique pena nieto in mexico city was overshadowed by his return to his usual fiery rhetoric when back on u s  soil a few hours later   i hope that he does really  in his heart  have a little more compassion than what he spouts out   said dave mitchell    of surprise  arizona  a self described moderate who says he is begrudgingly planning to vote for trump  arizona  a reliably republican state in past elections  could prove to be a close race in the battle between trump and democratic rival hillary clinton  the reuters ipsos states of the nation project  which is based on a national online opinion poll  found trump leading clinton by only  percentage points in the state as of aug     trump s last minute visit on wednesday to mexico was designed to appeal to moderate voters  including those most affected by illegal immigration  who are worried that the real estate mogul and former reality tv star lacks the temperament to engage in international diplomacy   pena nieto had on wednesday afternoon hailed the impromptu meeting with trump as  open and constructive   trump later referred to the mexican leader as his friend and a  wonderful  president  but only hours after leaving mexico  trump delivered a speech in phoenix  arizona  in which he again emphasized his desire to build a wall along the southern border and deport millions of people who had entered the united states illegally   pena nieto later rebuked trump as a threat to his country  trump launched his campaign last year on a promise to build a wall along the mexican border to stop illegal immigration  and accused mexico of sending rapists and drug dealers into the united states  clinton s campaign announced on wednesday night it would begin running tv commercials in arizona  a sign it sees a chance of winning there on nov    for many moderate republicans in arizona  trump s efforts on wednesday fell flat  linda yaeger  a  year old retired air force officer who teaches at a community college in glendale  said she watched trump s appearance in mexico on her tablet between classes  she said she had hoped trump would take a more moderate tone after the meeting with the mexican president  but was disappointed by his speech later that day in her home state   being a moderate republican means  being  an endangered species right now   yaeger said  explaining that she felt the party had moved too far to the right    lois pidde    an office manager in casa grande  said she agreed with trump that immigration is a problem  but opposed his proposed solutions  such as the need for a border wall or a suspension of muslim immigration to shore up national security    i used to be able to turn him off when he was on  the apprentice  and i d like to keep it that way   she said  referring to trump s reality tv show  she said she was likely to vote for new mexico governor gary johnson  the libertarian candidate  josh jensen    a border patrol agent from southeastern arizona  said he thinks trump s plan to build a wall is ill conceived and is voting for johnson too   i was thinking maybe hillary over trump   jensen said   but i can t vote for either one of the two candidates   april chase    of arizona  was aware of trump s trip to mexico but did not watch it  a moderate republican  she plans to write in u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont   who lost the democratic primary campaign to clinton  she said she felt trump was dishonest   so i kind of steered away from that
