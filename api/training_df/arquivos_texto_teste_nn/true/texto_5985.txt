washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday ordered construction of a u s  mexican border wall and punishment for cities shielding illegal immigrants while mulling restoring a cia secret detention program as he launched broad but divisive plans to reshape u s  immigration and national security policy  a draft executive order seen by reuters that trump is expected to sign in the coming days would block the entry of refugees from war torn syria and suspend the entry of any immigrants from muslim majority middle eastern and african countries syria  sudan  somalia  iraq  iran  libya and yemen while permanent rules are studied  less than a week into his presidency  trump has moved aggressively to put his stamp on a range of policies  including steps to gut the healthcare system devised by his predecessor  and make clear that as president he is not turning toward more moderate positions than he took as a candidate  his directives on wednesday signaled a tough action toward the roughly  million illegal immigrants already in the united states  most from latin america  whom he already has threatened to deport  in a move critics called a slight to the integrity of american democracy  trump also said on wednesday he would seek a  major investigation  into what he believes was voter fraud in the november election  despite overwhelming consensus among state officials  election experts and politicians that it is rare in the united states    we are going to restore the rule of law in the united states   trump told an audience that included relatives of people killed by illegal immigrants at the department of homeland security after signing two executive orders  the directives ordered the construction of a multibillion dollar wall along the roughly   mile    km  u s  mexico border  moved to strip federal funding from  sanctuary  states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants  and expanded  the force of american immigration agents  his plans prompted an outcry from immigrant advocates and democratic lawmakers who said trump was jeopardizing the rights and freedoms of millions of people while treating mexico as an enemy  not an ally  and soiling america s historic reputation as a welcoming place for immigrants of all stripes   the border wall is about political theater at the expense of civil liberties   said christian ramirez  director of the southern border communities coalition immigrant advocacy group   it is not national security policy  border communities are among the safest in the nation  and patrolling them with tens of thousands of heavily armed  poorly trained  unaccountable agents puts lives at risks  this will turn these communities into de facto military zones   ramirez said  the white house said the wall would stem the flow of drugs  crime and illegal immigration into the united states   we are in the middle of a crisis on our southern border  the unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from central america is harming both mexico and the united states   trump said  adding   a nation without borders is not a nation   the immigration crackdown has sparked fear among so called  dreamers   whose parents brought them to the united states illegally and who received temporary deportation relief and work permits from president barack obama  trump said the dreamers should not fear deportation   they shouldn t be very worried   trump told abc news in an interview broadcast on wednesday    where you have great people that are here that have done a good job  they should be far less worried   he said  adding   we ll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks   house of representatives speaker paul ryan also said the  dreamers  should not be worried   we re focused on physical security of the border  we re focused on those who are coming to do us harm from terrorist states and things like that   he told msnbc  trump is also expected to order a review that could lead to bringing back a cia program for holding terrorism suspects in secret overseas  black site  prisons where interrogation techniques often condemned as torture were used during former republican president george w  bush s administration  two u s  officials said   trump s actions could further test relations with mexico  the wall plan has infuriated mexicans  trump s policies  including his demand that the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada be renegotiated or scrapped  have put mexico s government on the defensive  trump and mexican president enrique pena nieto are due to meet next week  pena nieto said on wednesday night that he  regrets and disapproves  of the push by trump to build a new wall along the border  officials in cities such as new york  los angeles  chicago  philadelphia  boston  denver  washington  san francisco and seattle offer some forms of protection to illegal immigrants  billions of dollars in federal aid to those cities  often governed by democrats  could be at risk under trump s move  in the abc news interview  trump said construction on the wall would start within months  with planning starting immediately  and that mexico would pay back to the united states   percent  of the costs  mexican officials have said they will not pay for the wall  the white house said trump s goal was to get the wall started as quickly as possible using existing government funds and then work with the republican led congress on further appropriations  trump made cracking down on illegal immigration a key element of his presidential campaign  with supporters at his rallies often chanting   build the wall   the cost  nature and extent of the wall remain unclear  trump last year put the cost at  probably   billion   although other estimates are higher  and he said the wall would span   miles    km  because of the terrain of the border  trump s directives would end the practice known by critics as  catch and release  in which authorities apprehend illegal immigrants on u s  territory but do not immediately detain or deport them  the directives also include hiring   more u s  customs and border protection agents used to apprehend people seeking to slip across the border and tripling the number of u s  immigration and customs enforcement agents used to arrest and deport immigrants living in the united states illegally  they also create more detention space for illegal immigrants along the southern border to make it easier to detain and deport them  the intent of the proposals regarding refugees and immigrants from the seven muslim majority nations is to head off islamist violence in the united states  the draft directive on immigration also suspends the u s  refugee program for four months while determining whether permanent changes to the system are needed
