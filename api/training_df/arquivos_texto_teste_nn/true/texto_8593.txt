new york  reuters    in a presidential campaign notable for its negativity  the option of  neither  candidate appears to be an appealing alternative  at least to participants in the reuters ipsos opinion poll  many voters on both sides have been ambivalent in their support for democratic nominee hillary clinton and republican nominee donald trump  complicating the task of the pollsters trying to track the race  that sentiment may help explain an apparent skew that recently emerged in the reuters ipsos poll results  given the choice  a relatively large group of voters opted for  neither other  candidate compared with other major polls  leading to an underreporting of several percentage points for one or other of the two major contenders at times in the race  as a result  reuters ipsos is amending the wording of the choice and eliminating the word  neither   bringing the option in line with other polls       the amended reuters ipsos tracking poll will be published later friday  available at polling reuters com   from the beginning of june until the middle of july  the reuters ipsos survey showed consistently lower support for trump than other polls were capturing  at times  the reuters ipsos poll showed clinton with a lead over trump as wide as about  percentage points among registered voters   five percentage points higher than clinton s lead in some other comparable polls  to determine the cause  the pollsters examined what made the reuters ipsos poll different  their conclusion  by giving respondents the option of  neither other   the survey appears to have captured greater numbers of ambivalent voters unwilling to commit to either candidate than other major polls  which only offer the choice of  other   during the period analyzed  the historically high antipathy for both major candidates  paired with the option of selecting  neither other   meant the reuters ipsos poll probably underreported trump s support before the republican convention  perhaps by  to  percentage points   more recently  the  neither other  option appeared to lead to an underreporting of clinton s support in the run up to the democratic convention  said cliff young  pollster and president of ipsos public affairs  which partners with reuters on the poll  the pollsters estimated the clinton shortfall at  to  percentage points  tom w  smith  director of the center for the study of politics and society at the university of chicago  said the earlier trump numbers in the reuters ipsos poll could have indicated a softness of support for trump among a relatively small group of conservative voters who had yet to come to terms with his candidacy   it is plausible that a similar effect among democratic voters may be hitting clinton now when presented with the option of  neither   he said  and the skews displayed by the  neither  phenomenon may indicate there is a chance for some gains among alternative party candidates  smith said  tim mclheny  a  year old civil servant from vermont who describes himself as a moderate republican  is a case in point  when asked in the reuters ipsos poll who he will vote for in november  he skipped both trump and clinton and opted for  neither other    it is the lesser of two evils   mclheny said  he said he will cast his ballot for the candidate he believes will do the best for civil servants  ultimately  however  he said he may well grudgingly opt for trump come november  here s how the pollsters reviewed their methodology and decided to drop  neither   ipsos tested three alternate versions of the presidential preference questions on different groups in a survey and compared those results to the outcome of the established version of the tracking poll   that test found eliminating the word  neither  from the  neither other  response increased trump support by between  to  percentage points on any given day leading up to the republican convention  it also increased clinton s support  but by a smaller margin  spotlight ipsos na com  p  since the convention  however  trump s support seems to have solidified among wary supporters  now  the  neither  issue appears to be affecting clinton in the survey  on tuesday  for example  the established tracking poll had the candidates tied at  percent each  a  point lead for clinton on july  had vanished in two weeks   polling reuters com  poll  filters   dates   type smallest  but eliminating  neither  from the  neither other  answer produced a different result  in that case  clinton was ahead   percent to  percent  on tuesday   when asked the question in the new way   percent of voters opted for  other   by comparison   percent opted for  neither other  in the version of the survey that showed the race tied  the three point gap suggests the  neither  phenomenon was now working against clinton  in the nearly five years reuters ipsos has been offering the  neither other  option to respondents in presidential polling  it has never yielded such a skew  the results highlight how poll designs and methodologies can yield significantly differing results  and how important differences can emerge from the way a question is framed  the economist yougov poll  like the reuters ipsos survey  is conducted online  it uses a similar battery of questions  but does not offer the  neither other  option  just  other   in economist yougov s july  poll  clinton was ahead by  percentage points among registered voters  with trump at  percent  the nbc news surveymonkey online poll gives three options  clinton  trump  or  no answer   which more firmly prods respondents to make a choice  in their july  poll  clinton led trump by one point   to   among registered voters  telephone polls tend to ask voter preference as an open ended question  or just offer respondents the choice of the democratic and republican candidates  among phone polls  such as the abc news washington post and nbc wall street journal surveys  clinton recently led by four to five points  the cbs new york times telephone poll of registered voters had the race tied at  percent each  the reuters ipsos presidential preference poll result and other results in the survey are updated twice a week
