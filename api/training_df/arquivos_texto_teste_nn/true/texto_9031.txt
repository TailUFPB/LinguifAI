washington  reuters    facing slumping poll numbers and a shakeup of his team  u s  republican presidential candidate donald trump takes a detour from the campaign trail this week to visit his golf resorts in scotland  trump leaves thursday on a three day trip centered on the grand reopening of trump turnberry  which the new york businessman bought in  and renovated at an estimated cost of   million  he will also visit his other scottish golf property in aberdeen  his visit to scotland  the birthplace of his mother  comes as britain votes on thursday on whether to remain in the european union  trump has said britain would probably be better off if it left the eu  he will hold a news conference on friday when he will doubtless be asked to respond to the vote  trump s trip abroad comes at an unusual time given the political calendar  with less than a month left until the republican convention in cleveland where he is to be formally nominated  trump is lagging in fundraising and campaign organization and taking heavy fire from democrat hillary clinton  his likely opponent in the nov   election  he is under pressure to adopt a more presidential demeanor and strengthen his campaign organization after a rocky period in which he criticized a u s  born federal judge as unfair because of his mexican heritage and took fire for his response to the killing of  people at an orlando  florida  nightclub  just this week  he fired campaign manager corey lewandowski at the urging of family members alarmed at the direction of his campaign  it also emerged that he had only    million in cash on hand at the end of may to fund his campaign  compared with  clinton s war chest of   million  his poll numbers have also dropped  after sealing the nomination seven weeks ago  trump was basically tied in national polls with clinton  but she has crept ahead in many polls in the past two weeks  trump and his aides see the scotland visit as a chance to showcase his far flung business empire and job creating abilities  aides said the trip also reinforced his ancestral ties to scotland and his love of family  with his children playing an important role in his business dealings  but many republicans see trump s trip to scotland as a waste of valuable time   it has nothing to do with running for president   said republican strategist rick tyler  who was a spokesman for  former presidential candidate  u s  senator ted cruz of texas   it speaks to the non seriousness of the campaign when you re taking time off the campaign trail to leave the country for a place where there are no voters   trump s golf properties are among his proudest business possessions and he is particularly proud of turnberry  where the british open has been played four times  including the famed  duel in the sun  in  when tom watson edged jack nicklaus by one stroke  limiting the trip to his golf properties means there are likely to be fewer chances for missteps like  republican nominee mitt romney s gaffe filled trip to london  jerusalem and poland four years ago  but it offers little chance for trump to burnish his foreign policy credentials   traditionally  nominees take overseas trips to build their foreign policy chops   said republican strategist scott reed  trump is not meeting british prime minister david cameron  who has denounced trump as divisive for his proposed muslim ban and anti immigrant rhetoric
