bethlehem  pennsylvania  reuters    the unraveling of the coalition that was supposed to carry hillary clinton to the white house had a lot to do with voters like jim mcandrew in counties like northampton  pennsylvania  mcandrew    a retired steel worker  voted democrat in every presidential election for half a century  this year he stayed home  and northampton county  a heavily white  heavily democratic  largely working class area that backed president barack obama in  and   went for donald trump  a republican  mcandrew  who voted for obama in the two previous races  was intrigued by trump  but decided eventually that  all he does is insult everybody     women  black people  white people  rich  poor  he s an idiot   he considered clinton  but was concerned by the scandal over her handling of classified material on a private email server as secretary of state   i hated both of them  so i just said   the hell with it    mcandrew said  his wife  also a life long democrat  went to the polls without him   and voted republican    first time ever   he said  trump s ability to flip reliably democratic counties like northampton helped drive his victory in the presidential election this week  it was critical to his win in pennsylvania and other rust belt states  a bulwark in the democrats  electoral strategy for winning the white house  and it helped fuel his victories in critical swing states  such as florida and north carolina  it s not that trump s economic populism and  america first  messages generated widespread enthusiasm  he won some of those counties with far fewer votes than mitt romney captured as the republican nominee in   nationwide  trump s   million votes are about   million behind the   million romney got when he lost four years ago  based on initial projections  but clinton s troubles holding on to democratic voters were far more stark  some crossed party lines for trump or backed an independent   many just stayed home   clinton won the popular vote with   million votes   million fewer than the   million obama won in   and her weakness in traditionally democratic areas helped cost her the electoral college that chooses the winner of the election  clinton came across as a status quo candidate unlikely to shake up the washington establishment  says mike sly    a retiree and independent voter in pinellas county  florida  who backed obama in  and voted for trump this year  clinton s message failed to convince him that she would address his concerns about the state of the economy and rising health insurance premiums under obama s affordable care act  the race  came down to basically what change do i think is going to happen  and how i think it is going to happen   sly says   i felt that hillary really carried too much baggage to be trusted   clinton s loss in florida  a key battleground state  stemmed partly from her inability to hold voters like sly in white  middle  and working class areas that previously went democrat  in vote rich pinellas  a beach community popular with retirees in the tampa bay region  trump won  percent of the vote  besting clinton s  percent  in   obama won  percent  nationally  initial projections show low voter turnout of just over  percent  the worst since the contested election of   when republican george w  bush defeated then democratic vice president al gore  in obama s first victory  turnout was more than  percent  clinton beat trump among black and hispanic voters  but her effort to forge a winning coalition by leveraging that strength in diverse  urban areas was upended by trump s strength among whites  meanwhile  trump still managed to hold roughly the same level of minority support that romney got in   the pattern held true not only in rural areas  but also in many suburbs  particularly in the rust belt and the south  that tipped towards obama in the previous two presidential races   it was pretty much a base election  but one group was better at turning out their voters than the other   says susan macmanus  a university of south florida political science professor  in gates county  north carolina  trump s vows to crack down on illegal immigration and police muslim communities for radicalism resonated  says eric j  earhart    pastor of the evangelical upper room assembly church   there has been a definite shift over the past eight years away from us being a judeo christian nation   earhart adds  and many congregants worry about that  the rural county of   people went for obama in  with  percent of the vote  but it flipped into trump s column in this year s race  giving him  percent  thomas hill    chairman of the gates county republican party  says voters also were attracted to trump s blunt speaking and his pledge to bring back manufacturing jobs that went overseas   trump s economic message  which included a promise to kill free trade agreements that are unpopular among many working class voters in industrial areas  also succeeded in macomb county  michigan  a predominantly white area north of detroit  the number of voters casting ballots in the county jumped by more than   over   and trump captured  percent of the vote to clinton s  percent  four years ago  obama won the county with just under  percent of the vote    you ve got a lot of blue collar workers here  and      a lot of union guys  and they went republican   says david phair    a construction worker and trump voter who didn t cast a ballot in    they re tired of politicians   phair also liked trump s promise to end illegal immigration   i m looking forward to how he s going to handle illegal aliens   in pennsylvania  northampton county and neighboring lehigh county  once reliant on steel companies  have bounced back from the industry s decline  in bethlehem  which straddles the two counties  new development has mushroomed around the old steel mill  including a sands casino resort with   employees   e commerce companies  white collar firms and big corporations  such as olympus  the japanese imaging giant  have also  moved to the region  lehigh and northampton counties have a larger share of households than the state as a whole that earn more than     about  percent  all that suggests ripe country for clinton  but the counties also are whiter and older than the country as a whole   and trump dominated voting among older whites  around the table where mcandrew has a weekly poker game in the basement of the united steel workers office in bethlehem  the retired men of the city s steel mills have different opinions on why clinton failed to match obama s success in the region  but they agree that she didn t offer a compelling message  among the five at the table  all lifelong democrats  only three cast votes for clinton   she was going to continue everything the way it is and a lot of people think there are things that need to be changed   says ken rayden    who voted for clinton  but mainly out of party loyalty   she didn t show the people anything new
