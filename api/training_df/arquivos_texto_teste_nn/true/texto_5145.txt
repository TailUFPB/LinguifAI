washington  reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions said on thursday he would stay out of any probe into alleged russian meddling in the  presidential election but maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose he met last year with russia s ambassador  sessions  a longtime u s  senator who was an early and high ranking player in president donald trump s campaign before becoming the country s top law enforcement official  announced the decision after several fellow republicans in congress suggested the move would be appropriate   i have recused myself in the matters that deal with the trump campaign   sessions told reporters at a hastily arranged news conference  sessions said he had been weighing recusal   ruling himself out from any role in the investigations   even before the latest twist of the controversy over ties between trump associates and russia that has dogged the early days of the trump presidency  the president backed sessions  saying democrats had politicized the issue and calling the controversy a  total witch hunt   sessions  announcement did nothing to quell concerns among congressional democrats  a number of whom called for sessions to step down  trump and republicans who control congress are trying to move past early administration missteps and focus on issues important to them  including immigration  tax cuts and repealing the obamacare healthcare law  u s  intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump s favor  the kremlin has denied the allegations  sessions denied he had contact with russian officials when he was asked directly during his senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general whether he had exchanged information with russian operatives during the election campaign  he told reporters he was  honest and correct  in his response  although he acknowledged he  should have slowed down  and mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator   i never had meetings with russian operatives or russian intermediaries about the trump campaign   sessions said  adding he felt he should not be involved in investigating a campaign in which he had had a role  in a statement on thursday night  trump said sessions  did not say anything wrong  he could have stated his response more accurately  but it was clearly not intentional        sessions  meetings with russian ambassador sergei kislyak were disclosed on wednesday night by the washington post  sessions received kislyak in his senate office in september and also met him in july at a heritage foundation event at the republican national convention that was attended by about  ambassadors  trump fired national security adviser michael flynn last month after disclosures that flynn had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with kislyak before trump took office and that flynn misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  the recusal means sessions  a powerful member of trump s inner circle  will not be briefed on details of any probe  should the federal bureau of investigation decide to move forward with charges  sessions would not be in a position to weigh in on whether the department of justice should take the case  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi urged sessions to resign and said  his narrow recusal and sorry attempt to explain away his perjury  were inadequate  adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  said sessions  explanation for failing to tell the senate about his meetings  is simply not credible   he called on sessions to step down and said the justice department should name an independent prosecutor to investigate russian interference  democrats on the house judiciary committee asked the fbi to launch a criminal investigation into sessions  statements to  congress about his communication with russian officials  sessions is one of many  subjects  of a government investigation of any contacts between the trump campaign and russia  two u s  officials familiar with the probe said  the officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said sessions was not now a  target  of the probe by the fbi  the treasury department  the cia and the national security agency  the investigation  one of the officials said  had a number of subjects because of the numerous contacts between associates of trump  including flynn  and the russian embassy in washington as well as russian and some ukrainian businessmen and companies  at least two other officials in trump s campaign said they also spoke with the russian ambassador at a conference on the sidelines of the july convention last july  usa today reported on thursday  trump s son in law and adviser jared kushner also met with kislyak in december at trump tower in new york  an administration official said on thursday  confirming a report in the new yorker  while there is nothing legally wrong with such meetings  the reported contacts raise questions about the white house s repeated statements that it knew of no further contacts with russian officials beyond those by flynn  trump has accused officials in former democratic president barack obama s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about russia contacts  the white house dismissed the disclosure of the sessions meetings as a partisan attack  saying his contacts with the ambassador had been as a member of the armed services committee  trump called frequently during his campaign for improved relations with russia  drawing criticism from democrats and some republicans  ties with russia have been deeply strained in recent years over moscow s military interference in ukraine  military support for president bashar al assad in syria and president vladimir putin s intolerance of political dissent  with his administration on the defensive over russia  trump s enthusiasm seems to have cooled  and his top foreign policy advisers have begun talking tougher about moscow  the russian embassy in washington  shrugging off the uproar  said on thursday it was in regular contact with  u s  partners
