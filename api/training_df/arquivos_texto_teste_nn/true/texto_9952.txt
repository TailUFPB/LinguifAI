washington  reuters    two u s  senators on wednesday issued a formal draft of a controversial bill that would give courts the power to order technology companies like apple to help authorities break into encrypted devices or communications for law enforcement or intelligence purposes  the proposal arrives just days after an earlier draft leaked online and drew fire from security researchers and civil liberties advocates who warned it would undermine internet security and expose personal data to hackers  those same groups on wednesday said the new draft is little different from the leaked version  the bill comes as the u s  justice department has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force apple  aapl o  to unlock encrypted iphones  senators richard burr and dianne feinstein  the senate intelligence committee s republican chair and top democrat  said in a statement they intended now to  solicit input from the public and key stakeholders before formally introducing the bill    i am hopeful that this draft will start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law   burr said   based on initial feedback  i am confident that the discussion has begun   the new discussion draft does not require manufacturers or communications companies to process  transmit or store data in any particular format   rather  it requires companies  upon receipt of a court order  to turn over to the government  data in an intelligible format  even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner  companies must ensure their products  be capable of complying   the bill states  critics say that amounts to a ban on strong encryption  the latest version of the bill narrows the scope of cases where a court can issue an order  those include crimes that caused or could cause death or serious injury or that involve drug offenses or child victims  in addition to foreign intelligence operations  according to the text  andrew crocker  staff attorney at the electronic frontier foundation  a digital rights group  said changes in the new discussion draft were minimal and the bill still threatened internet security because companies would only be able to comply by weakening encryption in all their products  the proposed legislation  which is expected to continue facing strong opposition from the technology sector and privacy advocates  faces an uphill battle in a gridlocked congress   this flawed bill would leave americans more vulnerable to stalkers  identity thieves  foreign hackers and criminals   said democratic senator ron wyden in a statement
