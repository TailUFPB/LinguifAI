washington  reuters    some u s  intelligence officials are concerned that donald trump s  shoot from the hip  style could pose national security risks as they prepare to give him a routine pre election briefing once he is formally anointed as the republican presidential nominee  eight senior security officials told reuters they had concerns over briefing trump  whose brash  unpredictable campaign style has been a feature of his rise as an insurgent candidate  despite their worries  the officials said the  top secret  briefing to each candidate would not deviate from the usual format to avoid any appearance of bias  most of the officials asked for anonymity to discuss a domestic political issue  current and former officials said that the scandal over hillary clinton s use of emails also raises concerns about her handling of sensitive information  the likely democratic nominee is facing an fbi probe into whether security was compromised and laws were broken by her use of a private email server for government business while she was secretary of state   the only candidate who has proven incapable of handling sensitive information is hillary clinton   said michael short  a spokesman for the republican national committee   if there is anyone they should be worried about it is hillary clinton    but trump s lack of foreign policy experience  his volatile style  and his little known team of foreign policy advisers make him a unique case  the officials said     people are very nervous   said one senior u s  security official   intelligence and other security and foreign policy officials are also trying to determine  who on  trump s  team are trustworthy  the official added   we ve never had a situation like this before  ever   a spokesperson for trump s campaign did not respond to a request for comment  other officials downplayed such worries  noting that the traditional briefing  while classified as top secret  is mostly a broad overview of national security issues and does not include the most sensitive government secrets about intelligence sources and operations   in the post second world war era  confirmed u s  presidential nominees have traditionally received the briefing from intelligence officials   including spy agency chiefs   covering a broad range of national security issues  the nominees are usually briefed shortly after their party nominating conventions  and are allowed to include one or two aides who must undergo security checks  current and former officials say the nominees are explicitly warned not to share the contents of the briefing  which includes detailed intelligence assessments   after election day  presidents elect receive the same presidential daily brief  or pdb  that the sitting president gets  complete with material on the intelligence agencies  sources  methods  and covert operations  rep  adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  told reuters that he shared some of the concerns over how trump  who has never held public office  might use information from the briefing       i would be very concerned with mr  trump s ability to know what he can and can t discuss  publicly about the contents of an intelligence briefing  said schiff  who has endorsed clinton for president  schiff said one consequence of intelligence agencies  worries about trump s reputation as a loose cannon could be that briefers circumscribe some of the information they provide to trump and hillary clinton  his prospective democratic opponent  trump has tended to make broad brush statements on foreign issues rather than delve into policy nuances  he drew criticism from some former national security officials last month when  without evidence  he quickly tweeted that the downing of an egyptair flight appeared to be a terrorist attack    clinton is honing in on national security as a key potential weakness for trump  and is set to deliver a foreign policy speech on thursday designed to portray the billionaire businessman as unfit for the white house   officials familiar with the views and policy of director of national intelligence james clapper s office  which will give the in person briefings  say it will do its utmost to avoid any suggestions of political favoritism or bias   officials say the spy agencies  intend to follow past practice and give identical briefings to both nominees  one former intelligence official said clinton could have an advantage in the briefing because she would likely ask more probing questions than trump  a newcomer to foreign policy  the briefings provide an  overview of pressing issues and hot spots around the world   said former cia officer david priess  who briefed attorneys general and fbi directors  but not presidents  one u s  intelligence official said that trump s style may not be such a risk because the briefings are general in nature and often track publicly available information   if he reads the papers every day  he won t hear much that will surprise him   the official said  current and former officials said that covert operations and the intelligence agencies   sources and methods   which are among the nation s most tightly guarded secrets  are never discussed in the pre election briefings
