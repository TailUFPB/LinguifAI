 reuters    legal advocacy groups seeking to challenge president donald trump in court over alleged conflicts of interest said filing lawsuits is part of a larger strategy to highlight their concerns and put political pressure on the white house  in a lawsuit on monday  ethics watchdog citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington contended payments to trump s businesses for hotel rooms and office leases run afoul of the emoluments clause of the constitution  which forbids u s  officeholders from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval   trump on monday called the lawsuit  without merit   and legal experts have noted significant barriers to success in court  such as whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue   the american civil liberties union is also preparing a lawsuit over trump s alleged violations of the emoluments clause  said aclu executive director anthony romero  beyond winning favorable rulings  cases can serve to  gum up the machinery of the government and rob the trump administration of momentum   he said   lawsuits can also serve to frame the public debate and gain the attention of congress and government officials  romero said    this should be an area where we let a thousand legal flowers bloom   he told reuters on tuesday   laurence tribe  one of the attorneys representing crew  said the purpose of its lawsuit was to force trump to abide by the constitution  and that he felt confident they would achieve a favorable outcome in court   he also said bringing the case can accomplish other goals    one of the things that this lawsuit will achieve is increased public understanding of what the issue is   he said  aside from the emoluments clause  conflict of interest laws that govern the executive branch generally do not apply to the president or vice president  said erwin chemerinsky  dean of uc irvine school of law and another of crew s lawyers  presidents largely enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties   the office of government ethics sets policy for executive branch employees  but it does not investigate complaints or bring lawsuits  if oge officials find evidence of wrongdoing  they refer it to the department of justice for civil or criminal prosecution    crew also filed a complaint with the general services administration over trump s hotel in washington d c   which he leases from the federal government  the complaint alleges the business violates the terms of the lease  which says it cannot be held by an elected officeholder  it is unclear whether that issue will ultimately be litigated in the courts   federal courts maintain strict rules about who has the legal right  or standing  to sue  the u s  department of justice will likely raise a standing challenge to crew s case in the form of a motion to dismiss  said deepak gupta  another attorney representing the group   a spokeswoman for the department of justice said it is reviewing the complaint and would respond as appropriate   in its lawsuit  crew argued that it should be allowed to bring the emoluments case because it has been forced to spend money and divert resources away from its traditional agenda of tracking campaign contributions and ethics monitoring  legal experts have said that will be a difficult argument to win  tribe  a professor at harvard law school  said crew felt confident it would win on standing  he also noted that additional plaintiffs  have expressed interest in bringing litigation  either as part of our case or others   he declined to identify them or discuss strategy details  romero also said the aclu is seeking a  suitable plaintiff   andy grewal  a professor at the university of iowa college of law  said that adding a plaintiff with more concrete allegations  such as a hotel that claims it has lost business to trump s hotels  would still be an uphill battle   it would be hard to prove  for instance  that a diplomat would have stayed at another hotel instead of trump s  he said  ultimately  no court has determined whether ownership by a president or government official of a corporation that sells products to a foreign government would violate the constitution  he said  and that could present an additional barrier to success
