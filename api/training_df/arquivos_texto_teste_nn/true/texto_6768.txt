 reuters    no wall street firm is set to do better under u s  president elect donald trump than goldman sachs group inc   but the selection of several current and former goldman bankers to high profile positions in his administration could reignite flames of resentment against the bank  and the wall street elite it represents  which trump himself fanned during his campaign  goldman s shares have jumped by nearly a third since trump s nov   election victory  outpacing gains by rivals  as investors bet on a resurgence in trading stocks and bonds due to increased volatility  and the prospect of less onerous financial regulation  but trump s selection of steve bannon as chief white house strategist and steven mnuchin as his nominee for treasury secretary   both of them former goldman bankers   has prompted an outcry from democratic senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders  who have pledged to resist trump s efforts to dismantle recent financial reforms  trump s expected pick of gary cohn  goldman s second in command  to advise him on economic policy  has only made that chorus louder   the proximity of so many goldman executives to the seat of power could make sympathetic treatment of banks more likely  some critics have said  but at the same time  the public display of goldman s reach could stir up calls for renewed scrutiny just as wall street wants to see some restrictions imposed after the  financial crisis eased      goldman has spent the last couple of years doing their work quietly  but now they have the focus on them  which means people who weren t interested in them last week  now are   said erik gordon  a business professor focusing on investment banking at the university of michigan   in the harsh spotlight  every wrinkle  scar and freckle shows   u s  governments have a tradition of choosing former goldman bankers for key positions  stretching back to president franklin d  roosevelt        but during the latest financial crisis  when main street bailed out wall street  goldman s connections within government and the profits it made selling toxic mortgage debt led rolling stone writer matt taibbi to call it  a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity   popular anger at wall street generally and goldman in particular provided the backdrop to the dodd frank post crisis regulations  which made it much more expensive for banks to trade securities as they had before  following the financial crisis  goldman acknowledged it needed to do more work to improve the firm s image with ordinary people  current and former executives have said   while goldman   the leader in the lucrative business of advising on mergers and acquisitions   had previously thrived on keeping its head down  focusing on clients and shunning the media  it began to focus more closely on its reputation    we ve withdrawn from some businesses and withdrawn from some opportunities out there in the world because we decided we shouldn t do that type of business because the brand and the reputation was too valuable   cohn said in a  interview with a canadian newspaper  executives also started giving more interviews and the bank rolled out its first nationwide advertising campaigns aimed at regular people that emphasized its role in alternative energy and job creation  bank friendly regulations  goldman s engagement with main street has grown more important as the bank has entered consumer markets  launching an online lending business earlier this year  called marcus  with video ads on facebook  hulu  pandora and youtube  despite efforts to revamp its image  goldman has remained a byword for elitism  something that trump tapped into during the election campaign  releasing a television ad that characterized chief executive lloyd blankfein as part of a  global power structure  that had robbed america s working class   the bank s association with trump s government may reignite feelings of anger that ad may have stirred up    if the decisions made by the trump administration are seen as supporting the  old wall street   that will bring the connection with goldman to the forefront   said jim marous  a financial industry strategist who works with banks on branding and marketing  for now  investors do not appear to be worried  with its consumer operations just a small sliver of its overall business  they are confident that any negative publicity goldman may suffer will be far outweighed by the positive benefits that will flow from having more bank friendly regulations   goldman will always be linked with politics  even if that goes away from time to time   said jerry braakman  chief investment officer of first american trust  which holds shares in goldman sachs   money and politics always go together
