washington  reuters    the environmental protection agency has told several lawmakers it aims to end late on friday a freeze on grants and contracts that had been ordered by the white house  congressional aides said  the freeze has led to widespread concerns in states and cities about whether there would be delays in efforts to monitor and clean up toxic pollution  particularly lead pollution in drinking water  that would put the health of americans at risk  the trump administration on monday asked the epa to temporarily freeze grants  contracts and interagency agreements pending a review  the epa allocates   billion in contracts annually on projects ranging from cleaning up polluted industrial sites to testing of air and water quality  the concerns were acute in flint  michigan  where children for years have been exposed to dangerous levels of lead in drinking water  after representative dan kildee  whose congressional district includes flint  and michigan s two u s  senators wrote to president donald trump asking whether programs would be delayed  the epa told them that grants to clean up the water would be uninterrupted  congress last year approved   million to clean up water in flint    the epa told some lawmakers it was continuing to award environmental program grants and revolving loan fund grants to states and tribes and was  working quickly to address issues related to other categories of grants   aides said  but flint and other cities exposed to lead poisoning remain concerned about testing    the people of flint also rely on other epa contracts to conduct independent water testing and provide expertise when it comes to ensuring water quality   said mitchell rivard  a kildee spokesman  who was waiting for news from the epa and trump about those programs  an official from another midwestern city that has suffered lead poisoning  speaking on condition of anonymity  said local politicians had asked the epa if programs would be slowed but had received no answers  a former epa head of grants said the freeze was troubling because it showed a  total lack of communication about it with states  tribes and communities    they re supposed to be epa s partners in keeping people safe and health  so they should have been consulted  or at least warned   said karl brooks  a former acting assistant administrator at the agency  if every polluted community has to push politicians to write letters to the epa  the agency  will be spending most of its time answering congressional letters and not getting lead out of water or mercury out of our air   he said
