 reuters    u s  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton and republican candidate donald trump are in a tight race ahead of the nov   u s  presidential election   following is a weekly roundup of financial market analysts  views on the u s  elections and the likely implications of a trump or clinton win on financial markets    more coverage  bit ly  see related factbox  reut rs  david kostin  u s  portfolio strategy research  goldman sachs  a so called  wave election  would occur if one party registers large congressional seat gains and has the potential to implement policy changes    following six prior  wave elections   s p  typically fell during the subsequent  and  months  our strategies  buy health care equipment and services sell pharma and biotech  own firms with high government sales   and  own high overseas cash    whether it s hillary or trump  the u s  is unlikely to break out of secular stagnation  with respect to the election  our focus will remain on the impact that the next u s  president will likely have on fiscal and monetary policies  as well as the global growth outlook  unfortunately  we don t see either candidate as likely to purse a true  pro growth  agenda that will break the u s  economy out of its current malaise     interest rates   we see rising upside risk for longer term u s  rates  regardless of the outcome in november  the biggest upside risk for a sustained increase in longer term rates is rising risk premiums   credit growth   with trump s negative comments regarding dodd frank  our sense is a trump victory could jumpstart lending  we believe a hillary win would create even stiffer headwinds and more regulation for the financial services industry   sector recommendations    buy on clinton win  sell on trump

 in a rare example of bipartisan support  both candidates have discussed the need to repair crumbling infrastructure    the correlation between infrastructure spending and equity returns has deteriorated in recent years  but candidates  outsized plans could still be a tailwind for infrastructure levered stocks    names  overweight  rated eaton corp and  equal weight  rated pentair preferred plays  given both companies  leverage to infrastructure investments and attractive relative valuation   utilities and clean energy sector   hillary clinton has been an outspoken advocate of renewable energy and improving resiliency of the electric grid  while donald trump has made numerous statements in support of fossil fuels  we see a trump presidency as largely maintaining the current level of utility infrastructure spend  while a clinton presidency could result in meaningful upside  particularly in clean energy  thus  from the standpoint of long term growth  we see a positive risk reward for utilities going into the election          market moves   in this presidential election  there is no social mandate coming from economic dislocation  nor a likelihood of any party receiving a super majority that would cause major legislative change  as a result  any election based  market  movement   before and after   should prove temporary  clearly  there is a lot of rhetoric  but that does not equal legislative success   global markets   we analyzed equity returns before and after the u s  election  the hang seng tends to do well one month before the election and then performs till the end of the year  the nikkei  tends to do well one month afterwards  interestingly  the vix consistently rises one and three months before the election while the dollar tends to strengthen  bonds tend to do better after the election result going into the year end   clinton win   if elected  we believe that hillary clinton would push for expanded trade deals  including a revised or modified tpp like agreement  albeit these deals would likely include increased protections for us workers  as well as expanded provisions for trade adjustment assistance      trump win   donald trump  if elected  is likely to actively oppose any expansion of trade  and he plans to withdraw from tpp  direct the secretary of commerce and treasury to identify violations of trade agreements and unfair trade practices  renegotiate nafta  and  use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes      chris krueger  cowen washington research group  cowen and company trump win  gop sweep   positive
