washington  reuters    supporters of merrick garland  president barack obama s u s  supreme court selection  on tuesday launched a new push to persuade the republican led senate to act on the nomination before the nov   presidential election  but their calls fell on deaf ears  with senators returning to work after a seven week summer recess  senate democratic leader harry reid called the refusal of republicans to consider garland s nomination  disgusting and repugnant    republicans have deadlocked our entire system of justice because of the republican senate s dysfunction   reid said  obama s nomination of the moderate appeals court judge has been pending without action for  days  longer than any other supreme court nominee in u s  history  the u s  constitution gives the senate the job of confirming a president s judicial nominees  in a move with little precedent in american history  republicans led by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell have refused to take any action on obama s nominee  insisting that obama s successor make the pick   the senate is returning from the longest recess in nearly half a century  and perhaps the republican leadership was hoping that americans had forgotten about the unprecedented obstruction of a supreme court nominee   said senator patrick leahy  the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee  we need nine  a white house allied group  will hold a news conference in front of the supreme court building on wednesday with democratic senators and lawyers who previously worked as clerks for garland  republicans sounded unconvinced  mcconnell  has been crystal clear for the last seven months   an aide to the senator said on tuesday   the next president will select the nominee   the nine seat court has been one justice short since the february death of long serving conservative antonin scalia  with four liberals and four conservatives now on the bench  an appointment by a democratic president could end decades of conservative domination on the court  the white house has called garland s confirmation a top priority for the legislative work period that began on tuesday and ends in early october   in remarks last month  republican judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action on garland in a  lame duck  session immediately after the election  his panel would hold any confirmation hearings  some conservatives worry that if democrat hillary clinton defeats republican donald trump in the election  she would nominate someone more liberal than garland  but in a statement on tuesday  grassley reiterated that  the next president should choose justice scalia s replacement  and said his meetings with home state voters during the recess  only bolstered the point that iowans should have the opportunity to have a voice in the direction of the supreme court for the next  years
