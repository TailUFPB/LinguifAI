administration has issued directives to agents to more aggressively enforce immigration laws and more immigrants are coming under scrutiny by the authorities  for parents of u s  citizens who are ordered removed  the u s  immigration and customs enforcement  ice  agency  accommodates  to the extent practicable  the parents  efforts to make provisions  for their children  said ice spokeswoman

the parents decide whether or not to take the children with them  randy capps of the migration policy institute  mpi   a washington based non profit that analyzes the movement of people worldwide  said that while putting contingency plans in place is a good idea  he does not think the level of fear is justified  during the previous administration of president barack obama  a democrat  the likelihood of both parents being deported was slim  capps said      he doubts there will be a huge shift under republican trump toward deporting both parents   the odds are still very low but not as low as they were   and this is just the beginning of the administration   he said  about five million children under the age of  are living with at least one parent who is in the country illegally  according to a  study by mpi  most of the children   percent  were u s  citizens  the study found  in the second half of   ice removed   parents who said they have at least one u s  born child

focusing on a narrower slice of immigrants  those who had recently entered the country or committed serious felonies  trump has said he would still prioritize criminals for deportation  in rural new

and gomez  who works on a horse farm  are both from honduras  they entered the united states illegally  and do not have papers  unlike their daughter  who has been granted asylum  and their  year old

her daughter that she could live with her aunt in miami and is considering drafting paperwork that would give her relative some legal rights if she and her husband are deported  the  year old tries to comfort her mother   she tells me   mami  tranquila  don t be afraid  i am scared too but don t worry everything will be ok     rebecca kitson  an immigration attorney in albuquerque  new mexico  says

which then must be notarized at a cost of about    but some parents here illegally say they have had trouble finding affordable help  melvin arias    a new jersey landscaper from costa rica who entered the united states illegally  years ago  said he decided after hearing news of stepped up immigration enforcement to take legal precautions for his five year old son and six month old daughter  who are both u s  citizens  but when he asked for help from two different lawyers  arias was told preparing legal documents would cost him between   and     he is looking for a cheaper way to obtain the paperwork he needs   if there comes a time when both of us have a problem  i want there to be a responsible person who can come and get  for us  to take them to wherever we might be   arias said
