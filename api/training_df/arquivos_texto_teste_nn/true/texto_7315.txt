 reuters    the trump organization said on friday it was vetting new business structures aimed at transferring management control to three of president elect donald trump s children and a team of executives  the trump organization said in a statement it was planning to transfer control of the portfolio of businesses to donald trump jr  ivanka trump  eric trump and other executives  earlier on friday  the three trump children   the oldest of trump s five children   were also named as members of trump s presidential transition team executive committee     this is a top priority at the organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations   a spokesperson for the trump organization said in a statement  federal conflict of interest law does not apply to the president  but most white house occupants in the last few decades have voluntarily placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid any suggestion of impropriety  experts in government ethics said that giving over control to trump s children would do virtually nothing to prevent potential conflicts of interest  since there s usually no daylight between one s personal interest and the interest of one s immediate family members   it doesn t meet any of the standards of a blind trust if the kids are running the company   said kenneth gross  a washington lawyer who specializes in advising political clients on compliance and ethics  gross noted that the official transition team roles that ivanka trump  donald trump jr and eric trump now have would appear to complicate matters further   if they re going to be involved in government functions    and they re starting down that road   and running the business  that s going to make it very difficult to separate the government and business functions and deal with the conflicts of interest   gross said  all three children already have roles in the trump organization  according to the company s website  ivanka trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions  charged with domestic and global expansion of the company s real estate interests  donald trump jr is an executive vice president  and works to expand the company s real estate  retail  commercial  hotel and golf interests nationally and internationally  eric trump is executive vice president of development and acquisitions  responsible for new project acquisition  development and construction globally  typically  a blind trust involves turning over assets to an independent financial manager with no prior relationship to the owner  in addition  a blind trust derives its name from the idea that the owner would no longer know what assets are sold or bought  for instance  someone with extensive stock holdings would have no way of knowing which companies  shares he or she still owned in a blind trust  trump s portfolio includes interests in hundreds of limited liability companies  many overseas  as well as numerous real estate properties both domestic and foreign  short of selling the entire trump empire  experts said  he will find it difficult to create a trust sufficiently  blind  to avoid the possibility of any conflicts
