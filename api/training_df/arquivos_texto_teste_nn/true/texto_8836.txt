washington  reuters    the white house and congressional democrats pressured republicans on thursday for bipartisan zika funding legislation  saying the public health battle against the mosquito borne virus is being undercut by efforts to ram through a bill with less funding  but there was no sign that republicans would abandon their    billion measure  raising the chance that congress will leave the growing health crisis unattended until september   in a conference call  the director of the centers for disease control and prevention said the lack of funding has made it difficult for the health agency to ramp up mosquito control and diagnostic testing and pursue new research  president barack obama asked the republican controlled congress in february for    billion in emergency funding to fight zika  but as lawmakers prepare to leave for a seven week recess on july   senate democrats who defeated the republican measure last week predict it will only fail again   we are at the  hour and  minute before congress is gone all summer   said democratic senator bill nelson of florida  which is among a number of southern u s  states likely to be hard hit by the zika virus  u s  health officials say zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly  a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies   over the past few days  obama has urged senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and senate democrats to adopt a bipartisan approach  on thursday  democrats called on mcconnell and house of representatives speaker paul ryan to revive a bipartisan measure that passed the senate in may  mcconnell has said he would stick with the current legislation  which was agreed by house and senate negotiators and has already passed the house   a senior senate republican aide dismissed the call for change as  cover  for democratic efforts to block the republican measure  a ryan spokeswoman said   we hope senate democrats do the right thing and end their filibuster   even some democratic aides expressed skepticism that mcconnell or ryan would change course         the cdc is monitoring  pregnant u s  women with laboratory evidence of zika infection  in puerto rico  where zika has been rampant for months  as many as  pregnant women are infected every day  cdc director thomas frieden said  altogether  there are more than   zika cases in the united states  the cdc said  all contracted the virus outside the united states  in a lab or through unprotected sex   frieden said the cdc has spent most of the   million it has received for zika in the united states on state and municipal efforts  funding  staffing and equipment   it s frankly difficult to navigate with so many unknowns   frieden said   that s why we haven t been able to do things like begin ramping up centers of excellence to improve the performance of diagnostic tests  of mosquito control and to begin some of the really in depth studies   additional funding would also aid vaccine research and help community health centers in areas with the highest zika transmission rates   the republican measure failed in the senate on june  when democrats objected to republican provisions  including one to prevent planned parenthood from receiving funds to combat what can be sexually transmitted infection  the legislation would also take money from battling the ebola virus and from funds set aside to implement the obamacare health insurance program in u s  territories   they ll force yet another failed vote on this cynical legislation and then pack their bags for the longest senate vacation since    senate democratic leader harry reid said  the world health organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that zika can also cause guillain barre  a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults  the connection between zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in brazil  which has now confirmed more than   cases of microcephaly that it considers to be related to zika infections in the mothers
