london  reuters    any moves by donald trump to ban muslims from entering the united states or bring back waterboarding to interrogate suspects could have repercussions for some of his sprawling foreign business interests   from his golf course in scotland to luxury resorts in indonesia  a review of press releases published on the trump organization website shows that  of  new acquisitions or joint ventures announced over the past five years were overseas  these include the purchase of golf courses in ireland and scotland and deals to license his name to developers and manufacturers in dubai  indonesia  india  azerbaijan  brazil  mexico and panama  the deals underscore the potential conflicts of interest trump will face after he is sworn in as president on jan   and his vulnerability to criticism that he is open to foreign influence  foreign governments could potentially seek to exploit trump s business interests to affect his decision making  or to punish him through his pocket book for decisions they object to  trump s transition team declined to comment for this story  in the  months to may  trump earned up to   million from licensing his name to developers in emerging markets  according to a filing with the u s  office of government ethics   the licensing deals are the best of all because there s no risk   trump told reuters in an interview in june   i have  deals right now  going forward  right now    all over the world  in china  in indonesia   he added   trump s foreign business interests  tmsnrt rs   trump has said he will hand control of his company to his children   however  when he met with his indian business partners last week it prompted a chorus of criticism that the wall between trump and his company was still too porous  the trump organization has said a business structure will be set up that complies with  all applicable rules and regulations   trump has yet to commit to setting up a blind trust that would formally sever his ties with his business    i m very confident he s not breaking any laws   kellyanne conway  a senior adviser to trump  told reporters at trump tower in new york on monday  trump could face a backlash against his business interests in middle eastern and asian markets if he follows through with his campaign promise to ban muslims from entering the united states  and continues to be open to restoring waterboarding   a form of interrogation widely viewed as torture   or creating a national registry for muslims  analysts said   if the muslim registry is introduced  he will have serious issues finding muslim local partners   said professor koen pauwels  a marketing specialist at ozyegin university  istanbul  there would be a  backlash  if trump substantially tightens visa restrictions on muslim visitors  pauwels added  in december   trump s anti muslim comments cost him business in the middle east when a major chain of department stores halted sales of his glitzy  trump home  line of lamps  mirrors and jewelry boxes in the region  trump has long identified the middle east as a major growth market  and his company is working with dubai based real estate giant damac properties to build two golf clubs   including one with a course designed by tiger woods   and a gated island community outside the city   his daughter ivanka said last year the organization was in talks on deals in qatar and saudi arabia  trump has a licensing deal with a developer for a trump branded retail complex in istanbul  he also has signed deals in indonesia  the world s most populous muslim country  to put his name on a redeveloped luxury golf resort in java and a luxury cliff top hotel and residential development in bali  and it is not just in the middle east that trump could face repercussions for any foreign policy decisions  trump s    billion billion pound golf and residential project north of aberdeen in scotland could also be affected  warned councilor isobel davidson  who sits on the panel responsible for approving planning applications for the project  if trump proceeds with any anti muslim proposal  it could make it harder for him to advance his development  she said   councilors are not supposed to take the character of the applicant into consideration when we are making a planning decision but sometimes it s quite hard not to   she said  analysts said they saw more potential upside for trump s business from his election than downside  very simply  people would want to be associated with the personal brand of the u s  president   it will have a boost because he has become more famous that he was before   said professor chiranjib sen  azim premji university in india s bangalore  one test case could be china  which the trump organization has identified as a  top priority among high potential emerging markets   according to a  press release  on the campaign trail  trump threatened to label china a currency manipulator and impose import tariffs on chinese imports   suisheng zhao  a china expert at the university of denver  said if trump did impose tariffs and more robustly challenged china s interests in the south china sea  beijing could tell chinese businesses to abandon any talks or deals with the trump organization  trump branded property could also present a target for bombings or other kinds of attacks  said professor peter neumann  of the international centre for the study of radicalisation and political violence at king s college london   from a terrorist s perspective  it s a very attractive target   he said  what trump does not do could also affect his foreign business interests   mehmet ugur  professor of economics and institutions  at the university of greenwich business school  said that trump s businesses could benefit if he takes a softer line on countries accused of human rights violations   countries such as turkey  china and indonesia would  be more than happy to welcome trump organization   he said
