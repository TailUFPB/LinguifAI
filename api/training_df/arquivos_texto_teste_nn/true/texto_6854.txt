washington  reuters    bank lobbying groups are pressing the u s  senate to once again work on reforming the country s consumer financial watchdog agency   but this time around they may see those changes become reality  in a letter to senate leaders released on wednesday the groups  including the consumer bankers association and the credit union national association  called for legislation to change the leadership of the consumer financial protection bureau from a single director to a five member commission  which they say would make the agency more accountable  they also asked congress to void the cfpb s recent rule on prepaid cards and halt work on regulations for mandatory arbitration  payday lending  and third party debt collection using a law known as the congressional review act  the cfpb s sole director has  unprecedented authority over financial institutions  with minimal oversight   they wrote in the letter  which was also signed by the independent community bankers of america and the national association of federal credit unions  the director s power to both create regulations and carry out enforcements  including levying million dollar fines  can  have sweeping and longlasting effects   the groups wrote  many have supported commission leadership since the cfpb was first created in the  dodd frank wall street reform law to protect everyday consumers from bad actors in the areas of mortgages  student loans  credit cards and banks  recently  the cfpb and other agencies fined wells fargo   co   million for creating fake accounts  republicans drafted the first senate bill to change the cfpb  currently headed by richard cordray  in  and then introduced similar legislation in the following three years  in the house of representatives  the financial services committee recently approved a sweeping bill to also create a commission to run the agency  democratic president barack obama has stood in the way of establishing a commission with his veto pen  president elect donald trump  a republican  is expected to support changes  the single director structure allows the cfpb to move quickly and eliminates the risk of protracted fights among commission members  proponents say  a three judge panel in the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia recently agreed the director has too much power  although it ruled that could be remedied by allowing the president to fire the director without cause   the government petitioned the entire court for a review of the decision  the court has signaled it will vote on the petition before trump s jan   inauguration  and many expect it will go ahead with the review  in an unusual step revealing the case s importance  it asked the solicitor general to file a separate brief  lawyers say the separate brief may be a form of due diligence  showing the court has heard all sides  or  it could be a way to  lock in  the current administration s opinion to create consistency with the next one  the solicitor general under trump would represent the cfpb if the case goes to the supreme court
