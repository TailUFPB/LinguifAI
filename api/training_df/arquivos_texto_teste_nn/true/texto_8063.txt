 reuters    democratic u s  presidential nominee hillary clinton and republican rival donald trump face off on monday in the first of a series of televised debates that could prove crucial to who wins the white house on nov    the first debate will take place at hofstra university on new york state s long island  the commission on presidential debates has scheduled two more such presidential matchups and a vice presidential debate in october  the rhetorical contests  which first appeared on television in   have provided some of the most memorable moments and quotations in modern american political history  here is a look at the highlights over more than five decades    seventy million viewers watched the first televised american presidential debate  which pitted republican vice president richard nixon against democratic nominee john f  kennedy  nixon was recovering from a hospital visit and had a  o clock shadow  having refused makeup  in contrast  kennedy s delivery was smooth and charismatic  viewers focused on what they saw  not what they heard  kennedy won the election    in the first tv debate in  years  democrat jimmy carter faced off against unelected incumbent president gerald ford  this was also the first time vice presidential candidates debated on television  with republican u s  senator bob dole squaring off against democratic u s  senator walter mondale  carter benefited when ford said   there is no soviet domination of eastern europe  and there never will be under a ford administration   news media played up ford s remark as a major blunder  and many analysts thought it helped carter win the  election    carter appeared only in a second debate with republican ronald reagan after boycotting the first one because it included a third party candidate  john anderson  the president accused reagan of planning to cut medicare healthcare funding for the elderly  reagan  who had complained carter was misrepresenting his stands on any number of issues  said   there you go again   and chuckled  prompting audience laughter and coining a catchphrase  reagan won the election  the encounter attracted   million viewers  the highest number ever for a presidential debate  according to ratings company nielsen    reagan    successfully defused the issue of his age during the second debate with democratic candidate walter mondale    when he quipped   i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign  i am not going to exploit  for political purposes  my opponent s youth and inexperience   reagan was re elected    the second presidential debate involving republican vice president george h w  bush and democratic challenger michael dukakis opened with a question to the massachusetts governor on whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife  the question was posed to bring out the human side of a candidate dubbed  the ice man   his laborious response on an emotional issue did just the opposite  bush won the election  the vice presidential debate came alive when u s  senator dan quayle  bush s running mate  compared himself politically to john f  kennedy  democratic u s  senator lloyd bentsen replied in quiet  deadly tones   senator  i served with jack kennedy  i knew jack kennedy  jack kennedy was a friend of mine  senator  you re no jack kennedy      this year s three debates became the first time three candidates   bush  democrat bill clinton  and independent ross perot   shared the platform  clinton won the election    in the second debate between republican bob dole and clinton  dole was asked by a student whether at  he was too old to understand the needs of young people  he replied that at his age  intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom  clinton retorted   i can only tell you that i don t think senator dole is too old to be president  it s the age of his ideas that i question   clinton was re elected    vice president al gore and republican contender george w  bush took part in three debates   we all make mistakes  i ve been known to mangle a syllable or two myself   bush said during the second of the debates  purposely mispronouncing the word  syllable   during the first encounter  gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while bush spoke  the texas governor and son of george h w  bush won the election    the last debate between bush and democratic u s  senator john kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles  with bush sticking to simple arguments while kerry released an array of facts to make his case  bush was re elected    the three obama john mccain encounters averaged   million viewers  more than the average for the three debates in   according to nielsen  republican u s  senator mccain  his back against the wall  turned in his best performance in the last debate  but democratic u s  senator barack obama won the white house  the vice presidential debate riveted about   million americans  and thus tied as the second most viewed debate ever      republican alaska governor sarah palin and democratic u s  senator joe biden clashed on the economy and iraq during a lively but polite debate  she frequently displayed a folksy style  at one point  she said   aw  say it ain t so  joe   adding a  doggone it  for good measure  biden and palin both said they would work to change current u s  economic policy to make it more friendly to middle class workers  but biden said that mccain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out    obama stumbled in his first debate with republican challenger mitt romney  surprising and worrying his supporters  but in the second debate  romney  responding to a question about gender pay equality  said he had  binders full of women  as candidates for cabinet posts  the phrase became a meme on social media  with tweets  original artwork and a facebook group spoofing the former massachusetts governor
