he could lose out in a contested convention  they said they plan to do all they can to exert pressure on party leaders to prevent someone else getting the nomination  several trump supporters suggested that tensions could escalate if the party was seen as trying to deny trump the nomination despite his commanding lead in delegates won in primary contests   the plan either way is send a message to the republican establishment to respect our votes   said ralph king  a member of the cleveland tea party   if the party tries to parachute in a white knight to steal the nomination  it s
