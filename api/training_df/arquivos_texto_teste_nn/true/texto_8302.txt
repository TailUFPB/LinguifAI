phoenix  reuters    republican presidential nominee donald trump vowed on wednesday that anyone who is in the united states illegally would be subject to deportation if he is elected  sticking with his hardline position after flirting with a softer approach  in a major speech in the border state of arizona  trump took a dim view of the  million people who crossed into the united states illegally  a week after saying many were  great people  who had lived in the country for years and contributed to american society  he said all people in the united states illegally would have  only one route  to gain legal status if trump were to win the nov   presidential election   to return home and apply for re entry    our message to the world will be this  you cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the united states by illegally entering our country   trump said   people will know you can t just smuggle in  hunker down and wait to be legalized   he said   those days are over   trump again vowed that mexico would pay for construction of a  great border wall  between the two countries  he spoke hours after mexican president enrique pena nieto told trump in a face to face meeting in mexico city that mexico would not pay for it   we will build a great wall along the southern border   trump said   and mexico will pay for the wall    percent  they don t know it yet  but they re going to pay for the wall   trump said at a joint news conference with pena nieto that he and the mexican leader did not discuss who would pay for the wall  pena nieto remained silent on the issue at the event  but said later on twitter he did raise the issue   at the beginning of the conversation with donald trump i made it clear that mexico will not pay for the wall   pena nieto said in a tweet  trump used the phoenix speech to clarify his stance on illegal immigration after prevaricating on the issue last week  he returned to the hardline rhetoric that powered him to the republican presidential nomination over  rivals  heartening those conservatives drawn to trump by the issue  ann coulter  a conservative activist who had fretted that trump might be softening  tweeted   i hear churchill had a nice turn of phrase  but trump s immigration speech is the most magnificent speech ever given   correct the record  an organization supporting democratic nominee hillary clinton in the nov  presidential election  slammed trump   tonight confirmed what we knew all along   there is no  softening    correct the record spokeswoman elizabeth shappell said  trump s  america first  positions are aimed at rallying middle class people who feel they have lost jobs to illegal immigrants or to the outsourcing of jobs abroad  however  he may have put himself at risk of limiting his ability to broaden his base of support to include more hispanic americans and more moderate republican voters who do not think it is possible or practical to crack down on all illegal immigrants   in his speech  trump emphasized that his priority would be to quickly deport those among the undocumented population who have committed serious crimes   as with any law enforcement activity  we will set priorities   trump said   anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation  that is what it means to have a country    he said he would form a commission to study which regions or countries he would suspend immigration from  saying syria and libya would be high on his list  this would be his way of carrying out his proposed ban on muslims from some countries without getting into their religious affiliation  trump said he would also establish a  deportation task force  to identify criminals subject to deportation  would triple the number of federal deportation officers  and increase the number of border patrol stations  trump is trailing clinton in opinion polls and the new york businessman s aides hoped the trip would make him look presidential and show he was willing to deal head on with  thorny issues such as relations with mexico  pena nieto said at the joint news conference with trump in mexico city that the many millions of mexicans in the united states deserved respect  however  he offered only a mild rebuke of trump for his rhetoric   the mexican people has felt aggrieved by comments that have been made  but i was sure his interest in building a relationship is genuine   pena nieto said  a few dozen demonstrators gathered beneath a monument to mexican independence in the center of the capital to protest against the visit  some holding placards emblazoned with captions such as   you are not wall come  and  trump and pena out      trump has been pilloried in mexico since he launched his white house campaign last year  clinton  a former secretary of state  said on wednesday trump could not paper over his previous harsh language against mexico   it certainly takes more than trying to make up for more than a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again   she told a convention of the american legion military veterans  group in cincinnati
