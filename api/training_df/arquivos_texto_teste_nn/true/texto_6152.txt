washington  reuters    donald trump took over as u s  president on friday in the same way he conducted his upstart campaign  with a mixture of blustery salesmanship and naked contempt for the established political order   in doing so  he sent a clear signal to the country and the world  he plans to govern as he campaigned  refusing to align himself even with his own republican party and taking his message directly to the american people  he did nothing to dispel concerns that he would bring the cult of personality he built over the election campaign into the white house  and he offered little in the way of olive branches to the tens of millions of americans who did not vote for him in the most divisive election in modern u s  history  a former reality tv star  trump offered an apocalyptic vision of reality  an america besieged by crime  immigration  terrorism and unfair trade deals    the american carnage stops right here and stops right now   he pledged  as he presented himself as a champion of the ordinary american     the gloomy picture trump sketched of the nation flies in the face of evidence that the economy is in healthy shape  crime is down and the nation is relatively safe and secure   after warning the public on the extent of the problems  trump suggested  as he did during his campaign  that he and his  movement  are the only solution  he did not mention the republicans in congress with whom he will partner to govern and certainly not the democrats who have fiercely opposed him   trump campaigned as an outsider  railing against the sins of both his republican party and the democratic party  and  it became clear as he delivered his speech on the steps of the capitol  that he intends to remain that outsider  the rebel leader who takes power with one foot still on the battlefield  continuing the populist themes from his campaign  he condemned the politicians who he said have for years prospered at the expense of the public   he eschewed the high flying rhetoric typical of such occasions in favor of more blunt  populist declarations   politicians prospered   but the jobs left  and the factories closed   he said   the establishment protected itself  but not the citizens of our country    we are transferring power from washington d c  and giving it back to you  the american people   aundrea friedley    of nampa  idaho  who was in the crowd watching his speech  likened it to a  powerful punch  and praised trump for returning power to the people        trump won the majority of the u s  electoral college vote  but lost the popular vote to his opponent  hillary clinton  by nearly  million votes  making any attempt to unify the country that much more difficult     we assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city  in every foreign capital and in every hall of power   trump said   from this day forward a new vision will govern our land  from this moment on  it s going to be america first   his proposals though for ramped up infrastructure spending  strong border controls and the strong isolationist tone of his speech may not jibe with traditional republican priorities  at the same time  however  trump has assuaged nervous republicans by selecting a cabinet that has largely affirmed bedrock conservative principals  and he plans to quickly begin signing executive orders designed to roll back some of former president barack obama s progressive policies  in trump s speech  historians said  there were echoes of franklin d  roosevelt with trump mentioning  the forgotten  americans left behind by the forces of trade and globalization  of richard nixon s  silent majority   and of ronald reagan s pledge to restore the nation s greatness   but  said julian zelizer  a historian at princeton university  there was also  more anger physically and verbally than in the past  with trump punctuating his speech with pointed hand gestures   trump spent little time trying to expand his appeal to the  majority of americans who view him unfavorably  according to opinion polls  instead  he appeared to speak directly to his most fervent supporters  his speech perhaps was most reflective of reagan s  address  in which the then president spoke of  economic affliction  and  idle industries  but reagan inherited an economy struggling with stagflation and an unemployment rate of   percent  by contrast  under the departing obama  the economy has added private sector jobs in  consecutive months and the unemployment rate stands at   percent   the picture painted by trump  is probably not one that every american shares   said thomas alan schwartz  a presidential historian at vanderbilt university  still  he said  trump has tapped into a  sense of national crisis and decline       belinda bee    came to see trump from mooresville  north carolina  saying she believed he would successfully combat islamic terrorism and that he would remain a political outsider   the country now belongs to the people and not the politicians   she said
