orlando  fla   reuters    republican presidential nominee donald trump acknowledged on thursday that his campaign was struggling in utah  a usually rock solid republican state  on a day in which he briefly set aside his self confidence for a rare display of doubt   trump made the comment in urging conservative christian evangelicals to organize support for him in several key states where the nov   election is likely to be decided  such as ohio  florida and virginia  the wealthy new york businessman has suffered a number of self inflicted wounds in recent days that have given the advantage in the campaign to democrat hillary clinton   we re having a tremendous problem in utah   trump told a conference room filled with evangelical pastors  blaming a  false narrative  that has been built up around his candidacy  he has repeatedly blamed the news media for dishonest tactics  a surveyusa opinion poll conducted for the salt lake tribune in june showed clinton and trump tied  other polls have given trump a lead but not the type of advantage that previous republican nominees have enjoyed in the state  the normally confident trump never apologizes and is loathe to admit that he might face difficulties  but in talking to the national association of home builders earlier in miami beach  trump admitted his past years before he became a politician could be causing him problems now   if i had planned for it  i wouldn t have had such a rocky path   he said   i wouldn t have spoken to howard so much   that was a reference to his many appearances on the  howard stern show  radio program  he has been estimated to have appeared on the show more than two dozen times over  years  and the conversation frequently turned ribald   trump  who is trailing clinton in virginia  a formerly republican state that democratic president barack obama won in  and   urged evangelicals to help him in that state as well  in doing so  trump pledged to rewrite the so called johnson amendment  the  change in the u s  tax code that prohibits church leaders from using the pulpit for political purposes   if we get those people to vote  we re going to win in virginia   he said   if they don t vote  it s not going to happen   trump also said  we need help in ohio   the state where he held his republican national convention last month  ohio governor john kasich  who lost to trump in the republican primary race  has refused to endorse trump   we re very close in ohio  but we need help   trump said  trump has seen a steady stream of moderate republicans vow not to support him  such as u s  senator susan collins of maine  and  republican national security experts signed a letter opposing him   all this is evidence of fissures in the party over the bellicose rhetoric and positions of trump  who on wednesday called obama  the founder of isis   the acronym for islamic state  and clinton  the co founder   trump joked that winning the white house and doing a good job as president might be his only way to salvation   so go out and spread the words and once i get in  i will do the thing that i do very well   said trump with a smile   i figure it s probably maybe the only way i m going to get to heaven  so i better do a good job
