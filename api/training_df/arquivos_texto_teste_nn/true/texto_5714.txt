sacramento  calif   reuters    u s  president donald trump does not have the authority to withhold funding from the university of california at berkeley where violent protests led to the cancellation of a speech by a far right editor  academics and experts said on thursday  trump threatened to cut funds for the university s flagship berkeley campus in a twitter posting accusing the institution of failing to support free speech and practicing violence against innocent people  but academics and experts interviewed by reuters said state universities mostly receive federal funds in the form of research grants and financial aid to students  and these cannot be revoked for reasons related to freedom of speech   there is nothing in current legislation that would allow president trump to do that   said don heller  a provost at the university of san francisco and an expert in public education financing  uc berkeley receives between   million and   million annually in federal funding for research  and about   million for student financial aid  officials said  some of that can be withheld but only in very specific circumstances  such as the publication of fraudulent research or the refusal of a university to comply with the title ix law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs  to add freedom of speech to that list of offenses would take new legislation in congress  heller and other experts said  and even if such a law were passed  berkeley s situation would be highly unlikely to be affected  said terry hartle  vice president for government and public affairs at the american council on education   that is because in berkeley s case  the university had attempted to facilitate the speech on wednesday night  cancelling it only after police became concerned about safety   because the crowd had grown so violent and agitated  it was our recommendation to the speaker that his public safety was in jeopardy   uc berkeley police department spokeswoman sergeant sabrina reich said in a telephone interview   milo yiannopoulos  an editor at breitbart news  was escorted by police from the campus as a relatively small group among the  protesters smashed windows and set fires and the campus was put on lockdown  there were no injuries  yiannopoulos has been a provocative figure on the internet  for years  and has been widely criticized for comments he has made about muslims  black lives matter activists and feminists  trump  whose aide steve bannon previously ran the right wing  nationalist breitbart site  tweeted his response shortly before dawn in washington on thursday   if u c  berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view   no federal funds   the president wrote    his administration was not immediately available for further comment on thursday  longer term  there were some steps a trump administration could take that would affect the university   for instance  the department of energy could conceivably seek to relocate the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  which is in the hills above the campus and is managed by the university of california  said bob shireman  a former deputy undersecretary for education in the obama administration   there are things that if a president really wanted to punish some particular college they could influence those decisions but it would take a long time and there would be a lot of reaction   said shireman  a senior fellow at the century foundation
