richmond  reuters    virginia republicans on monday sued to nullify democratic governor terry mcauliffe s order restoring voting rights to   felons  a move that could affect the november presidential election  the lawsuit in the virginia supreme court asked justices to require the voting registrars not to sign up felons based on mcauliffe s april  order and to cancel felons  registrations since the order was issued  republicans argued that mcauliffe s order was unconstitutional  the lawsuit was headed by leaders of the republican controlled state legislature   the governor is authorized to restore the voting rights of any convicted felon through an individualized grant of clemency  but he may not issue a blanket restoration of voting rights   the lawsuit said  virginia is considered a key swing state in the  election  the governor s order could tip the balance in favor of the democratic candidate who wins the party s nomination  house speaker william howell said in a statement that  mcauliffe s order violated  years of practice   governor mcauliffe s executive order defies the plain text of the constitution  flouts the separation of powers  and has no precedent in the annals of virginia history   howell said  mcauliffe and other democrats have hailed the restoration of rights to felons who have served their sentences and completed probation as being long overdue  since signing the order  mcauliffe has said that nearly  percent of the felons whose rights were restored are nonviolent offenders who have been free for more than a decade  caucasian felons made up   percent of the total whose rights were restored  and african americans   percent  before mcauliffe s order  felons had to petition the governor individually for restoration of their voting rights   about two dozen states have eased restrictions on felons casting ballots over the past two decades  according to the sentencing project  a prison reform advocacy group
