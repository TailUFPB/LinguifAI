washington  reuters    when is a tweet just a tweet  a debate is percolating in the u s  state department  where diplomats measure their words with demitasse spoons  on how to handle donald trump s twitter commentary if he continues to tweet after he becomes u s  president on jan    by tradition  anything the president says is regarded as u s  policy and can be repeated to foreign officials without fear of contradiction  at least from the white house  but trump has questioned bedrock planks of u s  policy  such as whether taiwan is part of  one china  or whether washington would defend nato allies  causing consternation at home and abroad   i have never hesitated to take anything that potus said in speeches  press conferences  and other remarks as anything but policy   a midlevel diplomat who has served on four continents wrote dec   on an internal state department discussion board  in reference to the president of the united states  potus     but what about tweets   he asked   given the president elect s penchant for using  twitter  in a much more spontaneous context than most other usg officials  how should fsos regard those statements   he added  referring to      u s  government  usg  foreign service officers  fsos    in theory  we all should have a firm grasp of what is hyberbole  sic  and what is not  but in practice we should not be so sure  i for one am done making assumptions in this area for at least the next four years   the diplomat added  he then appealed to the state department s bureau of public affairs to issue an aldac  or formal message to  all diplomatic and consular posts   clarifying matters  the post  titled  is a tweet policy   on  the sounding board   a forum on the state department s intranet  prompted thoughtful  though equally perplexed  comments  another official wrote that he was confident president barack obama s comments are to be taken  seriously and literally   trump may want his tweets to be taken both  seriously and figuratively   he wrote   assuming there is a strategy here  it would seem that it would be to create a sense of ambiguity around issues previously thought to be settled for the purpose of leveraging a better deal to advance usg interests   he added   miscommunication may be the very purpose of the president elect s tweets   a spokesman for the state department said it would have no comment on how the next administration and president may use social media  obama has tweeted since  from the account  potus  rather than suggesting specific policies  obama used the handle to encourage americans to vote  to cheerlead for hillary clinton  trump s election opponent  and to remember the recently deceased  including writer elie wiesel and golfer arnold palmer  from his twitter account   realdonaldtrump  trump has mocked clinton as  crooked hillary   attacked a former miss universe and sniped at the parents of a muslim american u s  army captain who died in iraq after the soldier s father spoke against him  on nov    he tweeted  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  but provided no evidence for the claim  which electoral officials have denied  trump lost the popular vote by close to three million votes  the president elect has not said definitively whether he will continue tweeting after jan    trump s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment  a third official said the entire government would need to deal with the issue to  limit the amount of miscommunication a specific potus tweet could engender    as the great bette davis line goes   fasten your seatbelt  it s going to be a bumpy ride    he wrote
