orlando  fla   reuters    orlando nightclub killer omar mateen had expressed sympathy for a variety of islamist extremists  including groups in the middle east that are sworn enemies  the fbi said on monday  as a picture began to emerge of the angry  violent man who carried out america s deadliest mass shooting  u s  authorities said they had found no direct links between islamic state and mateen  the u s  born son of afghan immigrants who killed  people at a gay nightclub in orlando on sunday         mateen    was shot dead by police who stormed the pulse club with armored cars after a three hour siege  in  calls during his rampage  the killer expressed allegiance to islamic state leader abu bakr al baghdadi      but federal bureau of investigation director james comey  said mateen had made comments favorable to multiple armed islamist movements and people  which  adds a little bit to the confusion about his motives   president barack obama said mateen was likely a homegrown extremist    so far  we see no indication that this was a plot directed from outside the united states and we see no indication that he was part of any kind of network   comey told reporters in washington   we re highly confident this killer was radicalized at least in some part through the internet       islamic state  which controls territory in iraq and syria  reiterated on monday a claim of responsibility  although it offered no signs to indicate coordination with the gunman          in calls to authorities on sunday  mateen also mentioned support for the boston marathon bombers and a florida man who became a nusra front suicide bomber in syria  comey said  nusra is an al qaeda offshoot which is at odds with islamic state in syria s civil war          co workers reported mateen to the fbi in  after he had made  inflammatory and contradictory  statements  including a claim that he had family connections to al qaeda and membership of shi ite militant group hezbollah  a bitter rival  the fbi s miami office investigated mateen for  months and interviewed him twice but found no evidence of a crime or connection with a militant group  comey said the fbi was also  working to understand what role anti gay bigotry may have played  in the attack   the massacre reverberated on the presidential campaign trail  where republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton  the two likely opponents in the nov   election  clashed over how to confront violent islamist extremists      trump proposed suspending immigration to the united states from countries with a history of terrorism against america  europe or u s  allies  while clinton warned against demonizing muslims and called for tougher gun safety measures  obama is to visit orlando on thursday to pay respects to families of the victims  the orlando killings followed the massacre of  people in san bernardino  california  last year and raised the question of whether the united states will have to confront jihadist attacks in the homeland for years to come   comey said tracking apparent lone wolf attackers like mateen was like finding  needles in a nationwide haystack  while also trying to work out what kind of people could become radicalized  the florida shooting spree began early on sunday when the club was packed with some  revelers at a latin music night  many fled as the gunman raked the crowd with bullets from an ar  style semiautomatic rifle and a pistol  an initial wave of officers charged into the club and trapped mateen in a bathroom  orlando police chief john mina told reporters  that allowed many patrons to flee  although others were trapped in the restroom with mateen  leading to a standoff  police negotiated with mateen for about three hours before breaking a hole in the wall  which allowed hostages to escape  mateen also emerged from the hole and was shot dead by officers  police said  some  people were wounded and  remain hospitalized at orlando regional medical center  michael cheatham  chief trauma surgeon at the hospital  told fox news he expects all of the survivors in the hospital to survive   amanda alvear s last snapchat video post began with a shot of her on the dance floor of the nightclub surrounded by friends  it ended with gunshots ringing out over the music  alvear    was identified by police as one of those killed at pulse  her friend mercedez flores    who worked for target   was also on the list  another victim was edward sotomayor    a marketing manager at a florida based gay themed travel company  he was a legend in the industry  his boss  al ferguson  said   pastor deyni ventura visited a survivor in the hospital  whom she identified only as norman  who had taken refuge in a handicapped bathroom stall crammed with  people  norman could hear the shooter laughing loudly as he sprayed gunfire over and under the bathroom stall   they couldn t see the shooter but they could hear him laughing   ventura said  intimating a loud cackling laugh  norman  who was shot four times  crawled over the bodies of his friends to safety  everyone else in the stall died  ventura said  most of the people fatally shot were latino  more than half of them of puerto rican origin and at least three of them mexican citizens  hundreds of people attended a vigil on monday night for the dead in downtown orlando          law enforcement officials searched for clues as to whether anyone had worked with mateen on the attack  said lee bentley  the u s  attorney for the middle district of florida  but officials said they believed there had been no other attackers and had no evidence of a threat to the public  mateen s ex wife  sitora yusifiy  described him as mentally unstable and violent toward her   he would get mad out of nowhere  that s when i started worrying about my safety and then after a few months he started abusing me physically very often   she told reporters  the couple split in  after four months of marriage      when mateen met with his father the day before the killing  he betrayed nothing of the rage that would soon erupt   i didn t notice anything wrong   seddique mateen said in an interview   he was very slick   in the close knit muslim community of about  families in fort pierce  florida  mateen was known as quiet with few friends   he wasn t a people person  he was not extremely friendly but he wasn t rude either   said mohammed jameel    who worshipped at his mosque      mateen was an armed guard at a gated retirement community  and had worked for the global security firm   gfs l  for nine years            he told the fbi during its investigation of him that he had made pro islamist remarks because he was angry at co workers who he felt were discriminating against him and teasing him for being a muslim  comey said
