washington  reuters    the u s  senate overwhelmingly passed a compromise version of an annual defense policy bill on thursday without controversial provisions such as requiring women to register for the draft or allowing contractors to make religion based hiring decisions  ninety two senators backed the    billion national defense authorization act  or ndaa  and seven opposed it  because it passed the house of representatives by a similarly large margin last week  the bill now goes to the white house for president barack obama to veto or sign into law  a white house spokesman told a briefing he did not yet have a position on the bill to report  the  bill  the last of obama s presidency  includes some republican backed initiatives with which he has disagreed in the past  it includes a    billion increase in military spending  when there has been no similar increase in non defense funding  the bill also bars closures of military bases  although top pentagon officials say they have too much capacity  and it blocks planned reductions in active duty troop numbers  and it continues policies that bar transfers of prisoners to u s  soil from the detention center at guantanamo bay  cuba  which obama had hoped to close  while his administration has shipped most inmates from the controversial prison  the democrat is not expected to accomplish his goal of shuttering it before he leaves office jan    obama s successor  republican donald trump  wants to keep guantanamo open  and expand it  the ndaa passed both chambers in the republican led congress with margins large enough to overcome a veto  and the compromise legislation features many provisions such as a military pay raise and an expansion of a landmark human rights bill  that are extremely popular in congress   after months of negotiation  the senate and house armed services committees unveiled a compromise version of the ndaa last month that left out the russell amendment  a  religious freedom  measure democrats said would have let federal contractors discriminate against workers on the basis of gender or sexual orientation  overturning obama s executive order  some house republicans said they hoped to revisit that provision after trump takes office  when they do not have to worry about a veto threat from a democratic white house  the bill also excluded a provision that would have required women to register for the military draft  now that pentagon leaders are moving to allow them into combat  a provision recommending that the u s  conducts yearly high level military exchanges with taiwan  which beijing sees as a breakaway province  made it into the final bill  china s defense ministry said in a statement on its official microblog on friday that it was  firmly opposed  to the move  which would  inevitably damage u s  interests
