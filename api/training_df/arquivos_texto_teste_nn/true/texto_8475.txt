washington miami beach  fla   reuters    republican donald trump called president barack obama and democratic rival hillary clinton the  co founders  of islamic state  ratcheting up his assertion that they are responsible for the rise of the militant group and sparking renewed criticism of his leadership ability  clinton s white house campaign on thursday called the remarks a  false claim   in clinton s latest response to a series of attacks by trump in which he has sought to portray america as less safe  blaming democrats and depicting himself as the only one who can restore security  democrats  in turn  have used trump s often hyperbolic statements ahead of the nov   election to argue that he is unfit to be president and lacks the temperament to be trusted with matters of national security   this is another example of donald trump trash talking the united states   clinton senior policy adviser jake sullivan said in a statement   what s remarkable about trump s comments is that once again he s echoing the talking points of putin and our adversaries to attack american leaders and american interests  while failing to offer any serious plans to confront terrorism or make this country more secure   sullivan said  referring to russian president vladimir putin  for republicans uncertain about whether trump has the discipline to maintain focus for his campaign  the latest comments were concerning  many see the new york real estate mogul as spending too much time fighting within his own party and have called on him to refocus his campaign message on clinton    isis is a solid gop message to show contrast with hillary clinton and the failures of the obama clinton administration   said alice stewart  a republican strategist who remains undecided about the nominee  using acronyms for islamic state and the republican party   even so  she added   trump should have simply said that the obama administration s decision to pull all troops out of iraq  with no stay behind agreement  created a vacuum and allowed isis to metastasize  it s absurd for him to say that obama and clinton are founders of isis    and he can t blame the media for this   a group of about  republicans  including five former members of congress  called on the republican national committee to stop helping trump in the wake of his recent remarks and instead focus on getting members of congress re elected   trump s divisive and dangerous actions are not only a threat to our other candidates  but to our party and the nation   the letter stated  in response  trump said he would stop raising money for the republican party if it ends its help for his campaign   if they want to do that they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy   he told fox news   i m the one raising the money for them   some republicans see a small silver lining in trump talking more about clinton   it is helpful   at least to the rest of the ticket   that he is focusing a little more on clinton than on other republicans  whether defeated primary opponents or other elected officials who are on the ballot  for a change   said former new hampshire republican chairman fergus cullen  who is not supporting trump    but tomorrow  or later today  he could blame  republican senator  jeff flake for a rod s retirement   cullen said  referring to yankees player alex rodriguez s decision to leave professional baseball   i have zero confidence in trump s ability to stay on one message or to drive one message for any length of time longer than about  seconds       trump has previously criticized clinton for supporting the iraq war in  while she was a u s  senator  trump frequently says  to contrast himself with clinton  that he opposed the war   but in interviews before the invasion he did voice support  now  trump is arguing that in trying to end the war and withdrawing u s  troops in   clinton  who was secretary of state at the time  and obama created islamic state   republicans frequently trace the birth of islamic state to the obama administration s decision to withdraw the last u s  forces from iraq by the end of    but many analysts argue its roots lie in the decision of george w  bush s republican administration to invade iraq in  without a plan to fill the vacuum created by saddam hussein s ouster  it was bush s administration  not obama s  that negotiated the  agreement that called for the withdrawal of all u s  forces from iraq by dec      clinton posted on twitter that trump s comments are disqualifying   anyone willing to sink so low  so often should never be allowed to serve as our commander in chief   she wrote  the white house declined to comment on trump s claim  appearing in miami beach  florida  on thursday morning  trump repeated his attack for the third time  saying the u s  government  has unleashed isis     in fact  i think we ll give hillary clinton     most valuable player   trump said   isis will hand her the most valuable player award  her only competition is president barack obama       trump first made the assertion in a speech on wednesday night in florida  saying   i call them co founders  of islamic state   in an interview on thursday morning  trump defended the remarks   is there something wrong with saying that   trump told cnbc   why   are people complaining that i said he was the founder of isis  all i do is tell the truth  i m a truth teller   trump was also asked by radio host hugh hewitt if he  meant that  obama  created the vacuum  he lost the peace    no   trump responded   i meant he s the founder of isis  i do    the democratic national committee lambasted trump s remarks   donald trump should apologize for his outrageous  unhinged and patently false suggestions on the founding of isis   the dnc said in a statement   this is yet another out of control statement by a candidate who is unraveling before our very eyes    former new york city mayor rudy giuliani defended trump on cnn  saying his remarks were  legitimate political commentary
