after going through a week reminiscent of napoleon s at waterloo  republican presidential nominee donald trump will likely claim that indiana governor mike pence s performance in tuesday s vice presidential debate gave a boost to their campaign   that would be overstating it   the debate probably changed few votes in the  presidential election  the question is whether it will change any votes in the  contest   in this year s race  the debate was something of a wash  virginia senator tim kaine  the democratic vice presidential nominee  came across like an over caffeinated prosecutorial chipmunk   interrupting at every occasion  and at moments that weren t occasions at all   a gentle soul who s uncomfortable in the attack dog role that the clinton campaign has assigned him  kaine plainly overcompensated by piping up whenever pence sought to evade debate moderator elaine quijano s questions   and because pence spent the evening evading  kaine spent the evening interrupting  though at the start  the interruptions actually preceded the evasions  and often interrupted quijano s interjections as well   pence surely had the better podium manner  no great achievement   even if his response to all kaine s and quijano s questions about the true man of the hour   trump   was to change the subject  or  if pressed  to deny that trump had said what  in fact  trump had said   when the  second clips are aired and re aired  kaine s attacks on trump and pence s non responses will redound mildly to clinton s advantage   but what does the debate tell us about the future of both parties  pence was surely playing to the gop s religious right on tuesday  with his anti choice religiosity   in that sense  he was trying to supplant texas senator ted cruz as the holy rollers  favorite son in the  republican primaries   i m assuming  of course  that trump will not be running for his second term    pence would bring some clear advantages to this contest  unlike cruz  pence didn t desert the party s nominee  though cruz came slinking back last week and finally endorsed trump   pence hasn t waged a scorched earth war against the republican leadership  he doesn t bear a disquieting resemblance to bela lugosi  for all these reasons  pence will likely be the religious right s candidate to take on president hillary clinton in    should pence become the nominee  however  the gop standard bearer would likely only widen the already yawning gap between republicans and a majority of the american electorate  the affirmation of traditional right wing positions that pence delivered last night   against progressive taxation and all regulation  against a woman s right to choose   would yield the party precious little support among millennials  who will be by far the largest age group in the  electorate   as for kaine  it s hard to think of any wing of the democratic party that would flock to him as a future standard bearer after last night s gravitas free performance  it s increasingly unclear why clinton chose him to be her running mate  because that apparently meant miscasting him as her surrogate trump attacker   in both his convention speech and his debate performance  kaine has shown himself not up to the task  some alternatives to kaine   labor secretary tom perez comes to mind   would clearly have been better suited to the role  perez would also have been better suited to help clinton win more support from the one constituency that she most needs to do better  millennials  many still don t see clinton as signifying any change or embodying the values that vermont senator bernie sanders championed   kaine is a man of many virtues  and certainly could step into the presidency if he had to  but as a candidate and as a politician able to speak to younger voters and the sanderistas   that is  the future of the democratic party   he s been distinctly underwhelming   meanwhile  quijano jumped around  one topic to another  almost as manically as kaine  moderating is no easy job  but it must be said that quijano shaped an uncommonly disjointed evening   more important   both her questions on the economy   still the american public s no   concern   focused on the debt and balancing the budget  at a time when the disabling effects of economic inequality and the need for greater public investment in infrastructure are belatedly receiving the recognition they deserve   and when the candidates  differences on these and other economic issues are vast   the size of the debt was hardly the topic on which the public needed to hear from the candidates   between quijano s topic hopping  kaine s interruptions and pence s evasions  the debate flashed by as cacophonously and at times as incomprehensibly as a game of pinball   despite all the clamor  it was resoundingly clear by evening s end that kaine is not the democrats  future leader  and pence  while he could be the republicans   is not likely to be america s
