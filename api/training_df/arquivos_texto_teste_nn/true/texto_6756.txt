washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump said the united states did not necessarily have to stick to its long standing position that taiwan is part of  one china   questioning nearly four decades of policy in a move likely to antagonize beijing  trump s comments on  fox news sunday  came after he prompted a diplomatic protest from china over his decision to accept a telephone call from taiwan s president on dec     i fully understand the  one china  policy  but i don t know why we have to be bound by a  one china  policy unless we make a deal with china having to do with other things  including trade   trump told fox  trump s call with president tsai ing wen was the first such contact with taiwan by a u s  president elect or president since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition from taiwan to china in   acknowledging taiwan as part of  one china   beijing considers taiwan a renegade province and the subject is a sensitive one for china  chinese officials had no immediate reaction to trump s remarks  after trump s phone conversation with taiwan s president  the obama administration said senior white house aides had spoken with chinese officials to insist that washington s  one china  policy remained intact  the administration also warned that progress made in the u s  relationship with china could be undermined by a  flaring up  of the taiwan issue  following trump s latest comments  a white house aide said the obama administration had no reaction beyond its previously stated policy positions  in the fox interview  trump criticized china over its currency policies  its activities in the south china sea and its stance toward north korea  he said it was not up to beijing to decide whether he should take a call from taiwan s leader   i don t want china dictating to me and this was a call put in to me   trump said   it was a very nice call  short  and why should some other nation be able to say i can t take a call    i think it actually would ve been very disrespectful  to be honest with you  not taking it   trump added  trump plans to nominate a long standing friend of beijing  iowa governor terry branstad  as the next u s  ambassador to china  but trump is considering john bolton  a former bush administration official who has urged a tougher line on beijing  for the no   job at the u s  state department  according to a source familiar with the matter  in a wall street journal article last january  bolton said the next u s  president should take bolder steps to halt china  military aggressiveness in the south and east china seas   bolton said washington should consider using a  diplomatic ladder of escalation  that could start with receiving taiwanese diplomats officially at the state department and lead to restoring full diplomatic recognition  in the fox interview  trump brought up a litany of complaints about china that he emphasized during his presidential campaign   we re being hurt very badly by china with devaluation  with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don t tax them  with building a massive fortress in the middle of the south china sea  which they shouldn t be doing  and frankly with not helping us at all with north korea   trump said   you have north korea   you have nuclear weapons and china could solve that problem and they re not helping us at all   economists  including those at the international monetary fund  have widely viewed china s efforts to prop up the yuan s value over the past year as evidence that beijing is no longer keeping its currency artificially low to make chinese exports cheap  the global times  an influential tabloid published by the ruling communist party s official people s daily  said in an editorial that trump was  naive like a child on diplomacy  and that the  one china  policy  could not be bought or sold   when the time comes  the chinese mainland will launch a series of  decisive new policies toward taiwan   the paper said    we will prove that all along the united states has been unable to dominate the taiwan strait and trump s desire to sell the  one china  policy for commercial interests is a childish urge   it said  wang yiwei  an international relations professor at beijing s elite renmin university  said trump was possibly using the taiwan issue to try and strike a bargain with the united states over trade   he wants to get the best possible trade deal with china he can so that he can boost the u s  economy   wang said  some u s  analysts warned that trump could provoke a military confrontation if he presses the taiwan issue too far   china is more likely to let the whole relationship with the united states deteriorate in order to show its resolve on the taiwan issue   said jessica chen weiss  an associate professor of government at cornell university and an expert in chinese nationalism   when the decision to end a decades long practice is made with so little warning and clear communication  it raises the likelihood of misunderstanding and miscalculation and sets the stage for a crisis between the united states and china over taiwan   chen weiss said  mike green  a former top adviser on asia to former president george w  bush  said ending the  one china  policy would be a mistake because it would throw the u s  china relationship into turmoil and jeopardize beijing s cooperation on issues such as north korea  but green  who is now with the csis think tank  said he did  not believe that trump intended to go that far and there was  logic to serving beijing notice that he will not be dictated to on issues like taiwan    president obama was too accommodating to beijing early on and it reduced his leverage as china asserted itself on issues like the east and south china seas later   green said  on sunday  china s top diplomat  state councilor yang jiechi was traveling to u s  neighbor mexico  according to the official news agency xinhua  but mexican officials could not offer details   mexico has been deepening ties with china  which is partly funding a multi billion dollar wholesale mobile network while china offshore oil corporation took two of the eight blocks of deep water oil fields offered in a historic auction this month
