moscow  reuters    for all their mutual praise  russian president vladimir putin and u s  president elect donald trump are likely to disagree on many things  but trump s election win could hand moscow an elusive prize   the lifting or easing of western sanctions  rolling back those sanctions  imposed by the united states and the european union to punish moscow for its  annexation of ukraine s crimea and support for separatists in eastern ukraine  could spur investment in russia s flat lining economy  that might make it even easier for putin  who is trying to plug holes in the state budget inflicted by low oil prices and sanctions  to win a fourth presidential term in  by allowing him to show he has returned the economy to growth    clearly the chances of sanctions being lifted on russia have risen substantially   charles robertson  renaissance capital s global chief economist  said   that would improve the investment climate for russia   russia s rouble currency and stocks gained on the trump election victory  ukraine s dollar denominated bonds tumbled to multi month lows  reflecting pessimism about what a trump presidency means for the divided and indebted country  the kremlin had been bracing for fraught relations if the white house had been won by hillary clinton   a politician putin once accused of stirring up protests against him and who state media portrayed as an anti russian warmonger  trump was portrayed in a more positive light  putin described him as  very talented  and in kremlin backed media he was cast as a plucky political maverick  still  few in moscow had believed the republican candidate would win  apart from a group of trump supporting nationalists who gathered in a moscow bar decorated with a triptych of putin  trump and french front national leader marine le pen  once it became clear he had won  russia s parliament erupted in applause and putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with washington  state tv ran a clip of a russian doppelganger of trump taunting a cowed clinton lookalike and margarita simonyan  the boss of rt  the kremlin s english language tv news channel  said she would drive around moscow with a u s  flag to celebrate  but russian glee was tempered by a recognition that trump s pre election promises might be diluted and that deep contradictions between moscow and washington would remain  even if trump and putin adopt a friendly tone in public  trump s attempts to ease restrictions on doing business with russia could also be constrained by congress  which has shown it has little patience for the kremlin s military adventures  executives with western firms say the biggest obstacle to deals with russia is not the sanctions themselves but the prospect that more could be imposed and the zeal with which existing sanctions are enforced  if a trump white house were to send a signal to businesses that it was taking a more lax approach  investments could start flowing again with sanctions still in place  a softer u s  stance could also weaken european sanctions resolve  the bloc s measures have already started to look wobbly  with some member states finding ways to circumvent them  others saying it is time to discuss moving on  and some business groups in countries such as germany lobbying against them  until now  washington has helped stiffen european resolve  when russia placed a eurobond in may this year  many european banks decided not to take part because they did not want to fall foul of u s  financial regulators   america was the leader there and amazingly has been able to hold europe together  on sanctions    political analyst masha lipman told reuters   with donald trump in the white house i think there may be changes  something that might be beneficial for russia   putin needs sanctions lifted as they risk hurting his re election prospects  russia s central bank is forecasting economic growth of up to  percent next year  well below the level russian households have come to expect  after previous slumps  recoveries have been driven by foreign lending and investment  there are already some signs that the economy is hurting support for putin  a trend that is only likely to grow in the  months until the russian presidential election  kremlin watchers said that  even if u s  relations were less antagonistic with trump in the white house  any deal would involve hard bargaining on both sides  russia is seeking formal recognition from the world that crimea  part of ukraine  is now russian territory  something it has only got so far apart from a handful of nations  it also wants kiev to do more to implement a peace deal covering eastern ukraine  where pro russian separatists hold sway  in syria  where russia is helping president bashar al assad fight a war with air strikes and military assistance  moscow wants the west to drop ideas about changing the government  abandon help for what it says are hardline islamists  and drop talk of possible no fly zones  one possibility is a quid pro quo  with russia making concessions on syria in exchange for the united states ceding ground on ukraine and sanctions   for russia the key point is ukraine  if trump says that america does not care about ukraine  then that is all that russia wants to hear right now   georgy bovt  editor of the russkiy mir magazine  told reuters   on syria it will be easier to reach a deal  i think that on assad  russia will be willing to compromise because ukraine is more important for russia   much has been made in russian and western media of the perceived similarities and differences between putin and trump  who have never met  both are fond of tough talking and some russian politicians have suggested the pair might be able to forge a close working relationship similar to the one the russian leader enjoyed with former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi   trump has said he might even meet putin before his inauguration  putin s spokesman said there were currently no plans for such a meeting    people familiar with both men s leadership styles advised caution however  saying both were relatively thin skinned when it came to criticism  andrey kortunov  director general of the russian international affairs council  a think tank close to the foreign ministry  told reuters the fact that trump was an untested politician would also be a worry for the kremlin   he s a loose cannon and you never know what to expect from him   he said  there were also concerns the two men might be too alike    the problem is that both of them  putin and trump  are macho   sergei markov  a kremlin connected analyst and former pro putin lawmaker  told reuters   they could try to take the measure of each other  we can t let that happen
