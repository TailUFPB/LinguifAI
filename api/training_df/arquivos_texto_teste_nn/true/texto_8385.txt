washington  reuters    mylan nv s move on thursday to expand discount programs for its epipen allergy treatment was welcome but not sufficient  a spokesman for u s  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said in a statement   discounts for selected customers without lowering the overall price of epipens are insufficient  because the excessive price will likely be passed on through higher insurance premiums   clinton campaign spokesman tyrone gayle said   since there is no apparent justification for the price increase  mylan should immediately lower the overall price of epipens
