washington  reuters    u s  house republicans on friday won passage of a measure starting the process of dismantling obamacare  despite concerns about not having a ready replacement and the potential financial cost of repealing democratic president barack obama s landmark health insurance law  the house of representatives voted   to instruct committees to draft legislation by a target date of jan   that would repeal the  affordable health care act  popularly known as obamacare  the senate approved the same measure early thursday  no democrats supported the initiative  nine republicans voted against the measure  with this vote  republicans began delivering on their promise to end obamacare  which also was a campaign promise of republican president elect donald trump  the program  which expanded health coverage to some  million people  has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system  the resolution passed by the house and senate does not need presidential approval  since it is part of an internal congressional budget process  but once the obamacare repeal legislation is drafted  both chambers will need to approve it  and a presidential signature will be required  by that time  trump will have been sworn in as president  he has urged congress to act quickly to repeal and replace the democratic program  obamacare was enacted nearly seven years ago   over republican objections   in an effort to expand coverage and give new protections for people with pre existing health conditions and other barriers that left them without insurance  in the past few years  the house has voted more than  times to repeal or alter obamacare  but republicans had no hope a repeal would become law as long as obama was president and could veto their bills  house speaker paul ryan  a republican  said obamacare was collapsing and action was urgent  for people who have health insurance through the obamacare system  he said   the deductibles are so high it doesn t feel like you ve got insurance in the first place   we have to step in before things get worse  this is nothing short of a rescue mission   ryan said  democratic leader nancy pelosi rebutted republicans  claims that the law was a failure   the rate of growth in healthcare costs in our country has been greatly diminished by the affordable care act   she said   in the more than  years that they have been measuring the rate of growth  it has never been slower than now   the choice before lawmakers  she said  is  affordable care versus chaos   harvard university economist david cutler warned that there could be trouble in u s  insurance markets if lawmakers do repeal the law but a replacement is slow in coming   you could create a lot of havoc   he said  adding that some insurers  may get out of the market entirely   trump applauded congress s efforts with a friday morning tweet saying   the  unaffordable  care act will soon be history    the president elect  who takes office on jan    pressed lawmakers this week to repeal and replace it  essentially simultaneously   republican leaders would like to finish the repeal process within weeks  but some lawmakers think it could take far longer  some republicans have expressed concern about starting a repeal before agreeing on how to replace provisions of the complicated and far reaching law   the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget estimated repealing obama s signature health insurance law entirely would cost roughly   billion over  years  republicans say a good replacement would give states more control of a healthcare program and provide more stability on health insurance premiums
