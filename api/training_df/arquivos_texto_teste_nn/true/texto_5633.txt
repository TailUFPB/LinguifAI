  corrects first paragraph to make it  jurist  instead of  justice  as robart is not a justice  by mica rosenberg and nathan layne  reuters    u s  judge james robart emerged from relative obscurity on saturday as the first jurist to come under fire from the president since he took office after his temporary order to lift donald trump s immigration ban  in a reaction that went viral on twitter  trump called the  year old robart a  so called judge  whose  ridiculous  opinion  essentially takes law enforcement away from our country   to those who know robart  who has been on the federal bench in seattle for more than a decade after his appointment by another republican  president george w  bush  the ensuing drama surrounding the move was a far cry from the judge s standard   he is relatively apolitical   said douglas adkins  a private equity investor and former investment banker who has known robart since childhood   he s not a conservative or a liberal  he s a man interested in the law and fairness   late on friday  robart grabbed national headlines with his decision to temporarily lift trump s week old travel ban for citizens of seven mainly muslim countries and refugees  his ruling was just a first step in considering the merits of the case challenging the ban  the justice department on saturday filed a formal notice that it intends to appeal the ruling  as a candidate  trump had criticized federal judge gonzalo curiel  who was overseeing a case against his trump university   arguing curiel could not be impartial because of his mexican heritage and trump s vow to crack down on mexican immigrants  but by lashing out at robart as president  trump s anti judiciary stance takes on new importance  it hits at the very heart of the checks and balances system meant to protect the country from government abuse of power          coincidentally  in his wide reaching ruling on friday  robart emphasized that the three branches of government   the executive branch  congress and the judiciary   should function as equals   the work of the judiciary  and this court  is limited to ensuring that the actions taken by the other two branches comport with our country s laws  and more importantly  our constitution   robart wrote   reached by email  robart declined to comment on trump s tweets  a graduate of whitman college in walla walla  washington  and georgetown university law center  robart spent  years in private practice at the law firm now known as lane powell  before being appointed to the bench by bush in   adkins said robart and his wife have no children but have been foster parents to several immigrant children over the years  primarily from southeast asia  robart could not be reached for comment   the judge served in the past as the president of the seattle children s home and was a former trustee of the children s home society of washington  according to his official biography on the federal court website  those organizations provide mental health services for at risk youth and help troubled families   his involvement with children may have helped contribute to his understanding of the people impacted by this ruling but would not have shaped his interpretation of the rule of law   said paul lawrence  who was one of the attorneys who filed an amicus brief backing washington state in the immigration case  during his confirmation hearing  robart recalled providing pro bono legal services early in his career to  people who in many times felt that the legal system was stacked against them   he said he learned that the law  could be  if properly used  an opportunity for them to seek redress if they had been wronged   according to a transcript of the testimony  often sporting bow ties with his black robes  robart is known for saying from the bench in  that  black lives matter   he cited the statement popularized by protesters during a hearing about a  consent decree with the federal government that required the seattle police department to address allegations of bias and excessive force  in   robart put a temporary hold on a state rule change that would have cut government funding for disabled children and families in washington    when faced with a conflict between the financial and budgetary concerns     and the preventable human suffering   robart wrote in that opinion   the balance of hardships tips in the favor of preventing human suffering   adkins said he thought his friend would be able to take trump s attacks in stride   his view is that criticism is important   said adkins
