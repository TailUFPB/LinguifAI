 new york  reuters    if the u s  presidential election were held today  democrat hillary clinton would win the key swing states of florida  ohio and virginia and have a  percent chance of beating republican donald trump to become america s first female president  according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project   the project  which combines opinion polls with an analysis of voting patterns under different election scenarios  shows clinton currently beating trump in the popular vote by six percentage points and ahead in  states  including most of the larger population ones that heavily influence the outcome of the election   at the moment  clinton would win at least  votes in the electoral college  the body that ultimately chooses the next president  just two shy of what she needs to win the white house  on average  the former secretary of state would win by  electoral college votes   trump would win at least  states  many of them with smaller populations  giving him a minimum of  electoral votes   the election is still  weeks away  and a great deal could change prior to nov   the candidates are running about even in eight states  including pennsylvania  michigan and north carolina  and the polling sample is too small to determine the winner in alaska  wyoming and washington d c  but trump would need to win the  states currently in his column and sweep all of the remaining  toss up  states to win the presidency   that is a steep challenge for trump  whose bare knuckled  anti establishment campaign helped him win the republican party s nomination but has so far failed to build broad support with voters   if trump cannot draw in far greater numbers of women  moderate republican voters and minorities  he will almost surely lose the white house race  according to the polling project   consider  for example  what would be an ideal scenario for trump  white men with below average incomes showing up in record numbers on election day  this group strongly favors the real estate mogul  yet even if all of them vote it wouldn t hand trump any of the states currently slated for clinton or any of the toss up states  clinton would still win the election   the reuters ipsos states of the nation project is driven by an online survey that gathers responses from about   people per week  respondents answer questions about their demographic background  their party affiliation and their choice for president  their responses are weighted according to the latest population estimates  and each respondent is ranked according to their likelihood to vote   once the poll is complete  the project tallies the levels of support and estimated error for both candidates  and then runs multiple election simulations given their respective support  a separate set of simulations is run for each state and washington d c  the project runs more than  million simulations to determine the chances that one candidate would win   representatives from the clinton and trump campaigns did not respond to requests for comment on the project   a polarizing candidate  trump has called for a more extensive border wall with mexico  a ban on muslim immigrants and a rejection of international trade agreements  his personal attacks  including his criticism of the parents of a muslim american soldier killed in action  have undermined his support within the republican establishment   still  clinton is far from guaranteed a victory in november   a majority of americans have an unfavorable opinion of both trump and clinton  and nearly one out of four likely voters says they do not support either of them for president  according to a separate reuters ipsos poll   the candidates are scheduled to square off in a series of televised debates  and a poor showing by either could quickly change the dynamic of the race  a strong showing by a third party candidate could also influence the outcome   democratic party operatives also fear there may be more revelations about ties between wealthy foreign donors to the clinton family charity  the clinton foundation  and the state department under her stewardship  clinton has denied any impropriety but trump has seized on the disclosures as a new line of attack against his rival    there s always a chance of an october surprise   something definitive and striking about clinton   that could change the race   said tom smith  who directs the center for the study of politics and society at the university of chicago   but  short of any scandals by the clintons  i just don t see any way that trump catches up    if trump were to rely heavily on support from white voters  he would face an extremely narrow path to victory  even if all male and female white voters showed up at the polls  and turnout among blacks and hispanics was half of what it was in   respectively  the project shows clinton would still be favored to win   it appears that trump s best chance is to turn out republican voters in huge numbers and hope that a lot of democrats stay home   there s only one problem with this  republicans appear to have turned out as strongly as democrats only once in presidential elections since at least   that was in   when the electorate was made up of  percent of republicans   percent of democrats and  percent of independents  according to exit poll data collected by the roper center for public opinion research at cornell university    there s still a lot of this demolition derby of an election to go   said donald green  a political scientist at columbia university   a lot of people who support trump don t have a very good record of voter turnout  and who knows if they show up this time
