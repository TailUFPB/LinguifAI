 reuters    the top risk to u s  growth would come if u s  president elect donald trump keeps his protectionist promises  according to a reuters poll that shows economists have not joined in the market exuberance since the shock november vote  for most of his campaign and after the election  trump vowed to make sweeping changes to u s  trade and immigration policy  threatened to impose steep tariffs on chinese imports and proposed hefty tax cuts  while financial markets have retreated in the past week and hopes of a sudden spurt in inflation have faded  u s   year treasury yields are still up more than  percent since election day  and stocks have hit record highs  still  more than two thirds of the  respondents to the question in the reuters survey taken over the past week said trump s protectionist policies were the biggest threat to the world s largest economy this year   there is no question that near the top of the list of downside risks is the potential for more follow through on the anti free trade rhetoric   said jim o sullivan of high frequency economics   i am kind of assuming that the  incoming  administration will be practical on this   said o sullivan  the top forecaster of u s  economic data in reuters polls for   the second year in a row he achieved that distinction  the strong dollar  which hit a  year high early this month and is up close to  percent since trump was elected  poses an additional near term risk   worries around the globe over trump s confrontational style and a strengthening dollar are likely to be key themes among political and business leaders at the world economic forum in davos  switzerland  this week  sweeping tax cuts for businesses and individuals  and the prospect of some infrastructure spending  have also not brightened prospects for u s  economic growth  which trump has said he aimed to boost to   percent  more than  percent of respondents said  no  when asked if now was the right time for such aggressive tax cuts  with the economy close to full employment  the unemployment rate was   percent in december  the latest poll estimated growth slowed to   percent in the fourth quarter from   percent in the third quarter  through   economists predicted the economy would expand at an annual rate of   percent to   percent each quarter  just   percentage point higher than the previous estimate  the full year median was   percent  the most optimistic growth forecast for any point in  was   percent  far short of the post financial crisis peak of   percent hit in the fourth quarter of    obviously people have been assuming the growth sapping parts  protectionist measures  are not followed through  but they may have run ahead of themselves in predicting how much stimulus will be enacted and how much growth will be boosted   said o sullivan  who was also the most optimistic on growth among the top forecasters  a little fewer than one third of the respondents  including three of the top  u s  economy forecasters in reuters polls last year  upgraded their  growth outlooks in the latest poll  many of them  like o sullivan  said it was mainly on the assumption trump would not follow through on his restrictive trade agenda and instead focus on boosting growth through fiscal measures  while those projected growth rates may be considered healthy for the economy at such a late stage of the recovery cycle  they could do little to boost inflation much beyond the federal reserve s  percent target  inflation pressure is more likely to come from a round of retaliatory tariffs if trump s protectionist agenda becomes a global reality  even though pay growth is forecast to average   percent this year  up from   percent in december s poll  the fed s preferred gauge of inflation  the core pce price index  will probably average   percent in  and   percent in   unchanged from the last poll  fed policymakers recently warned that with the economy close to full employment  an expansive fiscal policy could lead to faster rate hikes than currently priced in  pushing the u s  dollar higher   if the unemployment rate falls some more  it is going to add to upward pressure on wages and inflation and reinforce the case for fed tightening   o sullivan said  the wider poll of over  economists  including  large banks that transact directly with the fed  showed rates would remain unchanged at   percent to   percent until the second quarter  when a  basis point hike is likely  a follow up increase is expected in the fourth quarter  taking the fed funds rate to a range of   percent to   percent  fourteen economists  however  forecast a hike by march   for other stories from the poll
