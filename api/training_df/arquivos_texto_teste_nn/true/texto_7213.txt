washington  reuters    one day before u s  president elect donald trump s first meeting with a foreign leader  japanese prime minister shinzo abe  japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in new york it would take place  who would be invited  or in some cases whom to call for answers  uncertainty over the talks shows the difficulties in turning trump from a freewheeling businessman into a sitting president with a watertight schedule and a fully functioning administration by his inauguration on jan                  japanese and u s  officials said on wednesday the state department had not been involved in planning the meeting  leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined   there has been a lot of confusion   said one japanese official   the meeting was only agreed to last week and trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in manhattan s trump tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration   while world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits  it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high level diplomatic talks in the united states without detailed planning  abe is on his way to an asia pacific summit in peru  state department spokesman john kirby said that to his knowledge  trump s transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders  trump is expected to use the abe meeting to reassure japan and other asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric  advisers to trump said   but trump  a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience  and abe  a veteran lawmaker  have differences on policy issues such as free trade      several trump aides did not immediately answer requests on wednesday for comment about the abe visit or contact between the transition team and the state department     speculation about top appointments to the trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition  new jersey governor chris christie  was removed last week and replaced by vice president elect mike pence  transition team officials said on wednesday night that trump planned to announce  landing teams  on thursday that would begin setting up staff in key agencies  like the state and justice departments  they added in a conference call with reporters that those who begin working on the teams would have to sign an agreement not to lobby for five years after they leave the administration  keeping with a trump campaign promise to institute a ban on lobbying for executive branch employees   trump on wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team  singling out the new york times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him since his upset victory over democrat hillary clinton in the nov   presidential election      the republican real estate magnate said on twitter he had taken  calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing  nytimes said  russia  u k   china  saudi arabia  japan    the times  a frequent target of trump s twitter blasts  said on tuesday that u s  allies were  scrambling to figure out how and when to contact mr  trump  and blindly dialing in to trump tower to try to reach him  the newspaper said trump was working without official state department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders           the failing  nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition   trump tweeted  without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect   it is going so smoothly  also  i have spoken to many foreign leaders       trump and pence had spoken to  foreign leaders  the transition team said on wednesday  trump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a u s  president elect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory  but some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure       egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi  an army general who seized power three years ago  appears to have been the first leader to speak to trump after the election  ahead of closer allies like the leaders of britain and germany  sisi s office called trump last wednesday and the incoming u s  president told him it was  the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election    australian media reported that prime minister malcolm turnbull was the second leader trump spoke to  after the australian ambassador to the united states got trump s personal phone number from australian golfer and trump friend greg norman   trump also talked on the phone to the leaders of britain  germany  turkey and other allies    but a phone call on monday with russian president vladimir putin  in which the two men agreed to aim for  constructive cooperation   raised eyebrows among democrats and traditionalist republicans worried about a resurgent moscow  trump also met britain s anti eu brexit campaigner nigel farage at trump tower last weekend  ahead of any meeting with british prime minister theresa may  state department spokesman kirby said   there s been no outreach to date  from trump s transition aides   but it s not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the president elect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders   despite fevered speculation  trump has yet to say who will fill cabinet positions such as secretary of state  treasury secretary or defense secretary  his team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of democrat barack obama to the white house after he won the presidency in    trump could add son in law jared kushner as a top white house adviser  the wall street journal reported on wednesday  kushner  who is married to ivanka trump  has been a central adviser during the campaign and transition  the trump transition team has repeatedly denied it is seeking high level security clearance for kushner  a federal anti nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration  but the journal said it was not clear if the law applied to a position inside the white house  it added kushner had indicated he would avoid the issue by not taking pay for any white house work        kellyanne conway  a senior trump aide who served as his campaign manager  said she did not think kushner was seeking an official role in the white house   i just hung up the phone with jared  and we didn t discuss that   conway told reporters on wednesday night   i think he just wants to be incredibly helpful to his father in law as he s been all along   south carolina governor nikki haley will meet with trump on thursday  the transition team said  she emerged on wednesday as a potential candidate for secretary of state  after speculation emerged that jpmorgan chase   co chief executive jamie dimon remained a contender for treasury secretary  the bank s stock price dropped
