 washington  reuters    with more than  nominees now selected  donald trump s cabinet appears much like the president elect himself  mostly older  white males  many of them wealthy  who see themselves as risk takers and deal makers and prize action over deliberation   trump  who says washington is  broken  and controlled by special interests  has largely eschewed technocrats with long government experience  instead  he has built a team of bosses   trump s roster of agency heads and advisers conspicuously lacks intellectuals  lawyers  and academics of the sort sought by some past presidents  in their place are titans of business and finance from the likes of exxon mobil and goldman sachs and no fewer than three retired generals in key positions   commentary  mr  trump  here s what other presidents learned from the cia u s  intelligence agencies feud with republicans over russian hacking obama points finger at putin for cyber attacks on u s  election  many of them are people used to getting their way but will now have a boss to answer to   trump   while navigating the sometimes frustrating and sprawling bureaucracy of the u s  government  the incoming trump administration is poised to undo as much of president barack obama s accomplishments as possible  while also attempting to advance a conservative policy agenda in areas such as taxes and healthcare   a former senior u s  official who knows rex tillerson  the former exxon mobil ceo who is trump s nominee for secretary of state  and marine general james mattis  trump s pick for defense secretary  predicted a massive clash of egos in the cabinet   tillerson and mattis are  accustomed to dominating whatever space they find themselves in  and that probably will now include the situation room and even the oval office    trump s transition team has said the cabinet is intended to be a mix of experienced washington hands and newcomers  but former presidents who brought in outside blood have at times seen political neophytes make costly errors  experts said   of the  cabinet members and white house advisers chosen to date by trump   are white men  there are four women  none of whom hold what might be considered a top tier agency post  there is one african american  one asian american and one indian american  there are no hispanics   like the real estate magnate who chose them  several have no government experience  others have been hostile toward the agencies they will lead if the u s  senate confirms them early next year   julian zelizer  a presidential historian at princeton university  said trump is building a cabinet in his own image  blunt talkers with real world experience    surrounding yourself with military guys and money guys sends a certain message   zelizer said   a certain kind of cutthroat aggressive dealmaker is how  imagines himself to be    obama  who leaves office in january  relied on experienced hands to form his cabinet in   he named his rival for the democratic presidential nomination  hillary clinton  as his secretary of state  robert gates  who served the previous administration  remained at the pentagon  and obama made longtime justice department official eric holder attorney general   some of trump s picks do have similar experience  and he has packed his on the ground transition teams at various agencies with government veterans and ex lobbyists  a reuters review found earlier this month   the newcomers to washington will rise to the administrative challenge  said those who know them   republican representative tom price  trump s choice to lead the department of health and human services  is  decisive by nature   said fellow republican lawmaker tom cole  he credited price s career as a surgeon  which is also the former profession of ben carson  trump s choice for secretary of housing and urban development   carson  said henry brem  a neurosurgeon who worked with carson at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore  has a  cool head  and is unafraid to give strong opinions   he s a gentleman  he speaks his mind  he has great ideas   and nobody in the world intimidates him    rick perry  trump s choice for energy secretary  served three terms as governor of texas and had to  balance a very conservative and increasingly ideological grassroots  support base  with a very influential business community   said james henson  director of the texas politics project at the university of texas at austin    whether he can do that do that in a bureaucratic setting  in an environment as competitive as a cabinet with a lot of obviously large egos  i think is another question   henson said   several of trump s picks have never held any sort of government post and have little  if any  background in policy making  including tillerson  treasury nominee steven mnuchin  a goldman sachs alumnus  commerce pick wilbur ross  a billionaire investor  and gary cohn  the goldman sachs executive who would chair trump s economic council   in   mnuchin purchased indymac  a lender that failed during the financial crisis and helped transform it into onewest  now a thriving retail bank in southern california   kevin kelly  a managing partner at recon capital partners  an investment firm in stamford  connecticut  said that kind of real world savvy could make government more effective   those with high level corporate experience are used to having to please shareholders  board members  employees  and the community  kelly said   it takes a very precise and dedicated person to deliver across those constituencies    the outsider approach hasn t always worked  in   president george w  bush s treasury secretary  paul o neill  the former chief executive of aluminum producer alcoa inc  rattled markets with a series of careless remarks that seemed to herald economic policy shifts that differed with the white house s stance  he ultimately was fired    management of large  public agencies is really difficult and requires bringing in experienced and knowledgeable people and working in ways that doesn t alienate people   said thomas mann  an expert on governance at the brookings institution   anthony scaramucci  an adviser to the trump transition  has acknowledged that too much inexperience could be harmful to trump s young administration    washington is a very healthy immunological system   he said   you ll see a full blown organ rejection if you put too many status quo disruptors in washington
