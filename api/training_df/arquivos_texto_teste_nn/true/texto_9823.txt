washington  reuters    rarely have two u s  presidential front runners needed more from running mates than hillary clinton and donald trump  the democratic and republican leaders in the  white house race are unusually unpopular nationally  polls show  despite their success with voters in their respective parties  clinton has struggled to generate excitement about her candidacy and assuage voter concerns about her trustworthiness  while trump fares badly among women and minorities in polls  their weaknesses only increase the importance of their vice presidential pick  who could potentially help them rally support in key demographics ahead of the nov   vote   if each gets their party s nomination   hispanic advocacy groups are lobbying clinton to choose a hispanic running mate  the person most often mentioned   julian castro  the housing and urban development secretary who is one of the party s rising stars   is opposed by liberal activists who accuse him of favoring wall street firms in the sale of distressed mortgages  some of the groups have started an online petition against castro s candidacy  which has angered the latino victory fund  a nonpartisan advocacy group that has been pushing for a latino vice presidential nominee    these attacks against secretary castro are completely unfounded  short sighted  and only serve to pit us against each other   said cristobal alex  the fund s president  the u s  hispanic chamber of commerce has called on clinton to choose castro   democratic strategist joe velasquez  a clinton supporter  said a hispanic running mate could make a difference in swing states like florida  colorado  nevada and virginia  which have large hispanic populations  polls show hispanic voters overwhelmingly dislike trump  in part because of his comments likening illegal immigrants to criminals  u s  labor secretary tom perez has also been mentioned as a possible latino pick  but clinton s decision isn t clear cut  given trump s unpopularity with some moderate republicans  she may want a vice president who can wrest away some of those voters  someone like tim kaine  a senator from virginia who personally opposes abortion but supports a woman s right to choose  or new jersey senator cory booker  who has close ties to the financial sector   there was no immediate comment from castro  kaine  perez or booker  clinton though could give a higher priority to winning over liberal democrats  who see her as too pro wall street and have flocked to her rival  senator bernie sanders of vermont  sherrod brown  a senator from ohio who is a fierce opponent of global trade deals  and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts  a fierce critic of the banking industry  have both been named as possible vice president picks    brown and warren did not respond to requests for comment  the clinton campaign confirmed a report in the boston globe that clinton would include at least one woman in any short list of vice presidential candidates to be vetted  democratic strategist chris kofinis is skeptical that clinton needs to spend much time appeasing the liberal wing of her party if she wins the nomination   as much as people have made out this race between clinton and sanders to be an ideological death match  donald trump will do more to bring the democratic party together than anyone has ever done   he said  trump is viewed unfavorably by  percent of democrats      according to a recent reuters ipsos tracking poll   but other democrats fear the increasingly bitter clinton sanders battle  has fractured the party  jim manley  a former top aide to senate minority leader harry reid  said clinton s pick  has to be viewed through a prism of  among other things  their ability to bring on sanders voters   reuters ipsos polling suggests clinton would struggle to attract some sanders voters  when asked what they would do if clinton was the nominee   percent of sanders supporters said they would stay home on election day and  percent said they would vote for the republican nominee  forty nine percent said they would vote for clinton  both the clinton and trump campaigns refused to comment on the vice presidential speculation  saying they remain focused on winning their respective nominating contests  clinton holds a commanding lead among the party delegates who will pick the party s nominee  but sanders has pledged to keep fighting  trump may not have the republican nomination locked down until the summer  if he can beat off challenges by texas senator ted cruz and ohio governor john kasich  who is running a distant third in the republican race  typically  vice presidential selections are vetted for weeks after a candidate has emerged as the party s nominee and are announced shortly before the party conventions in the summer   trump s polarizing candidacy could make his job of finding a running mate more difficult  for much of the campaign season  many in the republican establishment  along with well funded political committees  have been looking for ways to keep trump from winning the republican nomination  trump has stated his preference for an established office holder rather than a political neophyte like himself  specifically listing wisconsin governor scott walker  florida senator marco rubio  and kasich   walker  who has endorsed cruz  laughed when he was asked about the prospect  but has been noncommittal  rubio has repeatedly rejected the idea  kasich last week said there was  zero chance  of his playing second fiddle to trump  despite mounting speculation that he would be an ideal candidate because of his deep government experience and ohio s crucial role as a general election swing state   a source close to kasich told reuters the governor has no interest in working with trump as the two don t agree on much   cruz  too  said this week he would not be trump s running mate  while telling reporters in hollywood  florida on wednesday that  a trump kasich ticket loses to hillary clinton   tony fratto  a republican strategist  said trump may be forced to turn to  guys at the end of their careers  not people who believe they have a future  someone in their last act who has nothing to lose by accepting an offer from trump    that might include new jersey governor chris christie  who has been one or the few establishment politicians to campaign for trump  or florida governor rick scott  who has endorsed trump  both are in their final terms in office   christie was asked about the prospect in an interview with a new jersey radio station on thursday   the way i think about these things  you never say  never    he said   other names linked to trump include former new york mayor rudolph giuliani  alabama senator jeff sessions  a trump adviser  and ben carson  the retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate  there was no immediate comment from sessions  scott and giuliani  armstrong williams  a close adviser to carson  said the former white house hopeful doesn t want the slot   at this point he has no interest in being in politics     none   williams said   i think trump is looking for someone with government experience  someone who is more political
