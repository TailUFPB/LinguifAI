new york  reuters    hospitals and health insurers are gaining confidence that their nightmare scenario   millions of americans instantly losing health insurance once president elect donald trump delivers on a promise to  repeal and replace  obamacare   is looking more like a bad dream than becoming reality  the early view from the healthcare sector still includes an end eventually to president obama s signature health program  but trump s picks to head the u s  health department and its top regulator on tuesday  along with his recent softening on some aspects of the existing law  is a sign to some sector insiders that instead of chaos  an orderly transition of up to three years to replace it with a plan that healthcare companies actually want could be in store  trump tapped republican representative tom price  an orthopedic surgeon who drafted legislation years ago to replace the affordable care act  aca   as head of the u s  department of health and human services  consultant seema verma  who helped vice president elect mike pence create a medicaid expansion plan in indiana  is his choice to lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services  both must be confirmed by the u s  senate   democrats bemoan the choices  saying they will gut the  law that gave insurance to about  million people through the creation of new individual health insurance and the expansion of medicaid for the poor  but some healthcare companies  including insurers  doctors groups and hospitals  said they were encouraged by the appointments of experienced healthcare insiders   from our standpoint  we want to make sure that as many people as possible maintain  insurance  coverage   said dr  mario molina  ceo of molina healthcare  which provides medicaid and obamacare individual insurance plans   i think the pieces of the healthcare puzzle are kind of coming together for us now   that picture looks increasingly like lawmakers will bring trump a  repeal  bill in january that lays out at least a two year timeline for changing the law  house majority leader kevin mccarthy said tuesday that the house would start working on repealing and replacing obamacare  right away   but with a transition period to allow changes to be phased in over time  that period could be up to three years  warned senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch  in order  to work through the problems    kathleen harrington  chair of policy of government relations for the mayo clinic  said so far she likes what she hears from republicans on changes to health insurance     we are very encouraged with the approach we re hearing so far from president elect trump in terms of having a focused review and removing certain parts of it   she said  the key for republicans is shifting the bulk of the oversight of individual insurance and the medicaid program to the states  and changing the way both are funded   insurers  who currently submit individual plans to both the state and the federal government  say this will allow them to sell more flexible health plans  for hospitals  the verma appointment and pence s medicaid expansion in indiana are signs that one of their major sources of government reimbursement for medical services could continue to grow  to be sure  it remains unclear what the overall impact will be on medicaid and medicare going forward  both insurers and hospitals are watching for any negative impact from any changes  and anticipated cuts in funding  investors have already been playing the winners and losers of reforming health insurance  the nasdaq biotechnology index has gained  percent since trump was elected as the possibility of hillary clinton enacting new legislation on drug pricing disappeared  on the other hand  shares of hospital chains have sold off sharply  including a  percent decline for tenet healthcare  on the fears that millions of newly uninsured patients will need care but not be able to pay their bills if and when the aca is repealed  pence  who is expected to take a large role in shaping the administration s healthcare policy  backed a plan in indiana developed by verma in which beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their healthcare   it s pretty clear that she is on the side of expanding medicaid  but putting some conditions on it   said joseph antos  a health policy expert at the conservative american enterprise institute  antos expects the replacement plan to also include individual insurance that has a form of federal subsidies  as envisioned in house speaker paul ryan s proposed plan to replace obamacare  agilehealthinsurance com  which sells short term health insurance plans that are allowed to exclude benefits guaranteed under the aca  expects the law to allow more choice so that insurers can design cheaper plans to hit a certain price point of   per month or   per month  as they did before the aca  according to executive director sam gibbs   prices of obamacare insurance rose about  percent for  and large insurers including unitedhealth group have abandoned plans for next year  saying that they are losing too much money on sick customers  under price and verma  it could be the states once again making most of the decisions about mandatory benefits with the federal government providing only a broad framework  gibbs suggested   at benefits company stride health  which sells and manages healthcare benefits to  gig  workers like uber drivers  ceo noah lang said that he would want to be sure that the replacement plan has tax credits available to people as they need them  rather than at the end of the year only  blair childs  senior vice president at hospital purchasing group premier  said members of congress are already asking healthcare companies for input on a roadmap for the aca replacement    the offices we ve talked to are saying  don t talk to me about what you don t want  talk to me about what you do want  how do we solve this   childs said  the ryan plan  known as a better way  envisions block grant funding for medicaid  the creation of vouchers for medicare coverage  and the elimination of the advance paid premium subsidies for individual insurance  it is seen as the foundation of the eventual plan  some republican lawmakers hope that this new health reform law will get democratic support and pass the  vote threshold in the senate  price  who has presented his own replacement plan  is now turning to a job of managing a massive agency that oversees the u s  food and drug administration  medicare  medicaid  the children s health insurance program and other programs  and will be tasked with implementing what congress ultimately sends him  childs said   the relevant thing is the ryan plan and what elements of that can be put into law   childs said
