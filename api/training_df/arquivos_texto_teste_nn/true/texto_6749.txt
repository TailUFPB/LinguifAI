washington  reuters    the federal reserve inaugurates the trump era this week with a near certain interest rate increase and new economic forecasts providing a first glimpse into whether the u s  election has reshaped the central bank s growth and inflation outlook  fed fund futures show a  percent probability that the fed will lift rates by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of its two day policy meeting on wednesday  according to the cme group  all  economists in a reuters poll expect a rate hike in the wake of a string of solid u s  economic reports  more telling will be whether the stock market rally and jump in bond yields triggered by trump s nov   victory will push the fed to an inflection point of its own and a higher projected pace of rate increases for  and beyond  the republican businessman is inheriting a good economy  one that grew by   percent in the third quarter  the fastest pace in two years  there are  however  concerns that his plan to reduce taxes  cut regulation and increase infrastructure spending could not just boost the economy but also fuel higher inflation  since first published in   the fed s quarterly  dot plot  of projected interest rates has generally moved in one direction   down   and any post election change will show whether policymakers expect trump s policies to shake things up  as of september  fed officials  median projection was for two rate increases next year and a long run  neutral  level of   percent  a rate increase this week would be the first since last december and only the second since the   financial crisis      their path is going to move up faster and a little sooner   said steve rick  chief economist for cuna mutual group  he said the economy was running at its potential  and that was the fed s cue to  exit stage right  and steadily move rates to normal  fed officials have long hoped that other government policies would take the place of monetary engineering  which some believe may have lost its effectiveness in lifting economic growth   they have warned in recent weeks that any new government spending should specifically be designed to boost productivity in an economy that is already near full employment and facing a high public debt burden  the fed s new forecasts will indicate if policymakers feel that the monetary to fiscal handover is on the horizon  or need more time for the trump administration s plans to become more detailed and move through congress  fed chair janet yellen is scheduled to hold a press conference at   p m    gmt  on wednesday to elaborate on the economic outlook and policy statement  she ll have a broad set of issues to cover since her last press conference in september   from the federal open market committee meeting itself  to the likelihood she will be replaced in early  and the risks she foresees from the trump agenda  trump repeatedly attacked yellen during the election campaign  accusing her of holding down rates to help his democratic rival  since the election  he has expressed his disapproval of corporate america  criticizing boeing  ba n   and took credit for a deal to keep hundreds of jobs at an indiana plant from being moved to mexico   the president elect also will be under scrutiny after this week s fed meeting for clues about how he plans to handle his relationship with the central bank   there is a real risk that he could be openly critical of the decision to raise rates next week   paul ashworth  an economist with capital economics  said in a note last week   that could upset markets and raise serious issues about whether trump intends to leave the fed alone or try to influence its decisions  top u s  elected officials  in particular the president  typically avoid criticizing the fed s short term rate decisions  emphasizing instead the need for monetary policy to be set independently   if he remains silent after the announcement to raise interest rates next wednesday  then we can begin to assume that it will be business as usual for the fed   ashworth wrote  trump s plan to cut taxes and regulation and funnel fresh billions into capital projects must pass congress  and it may be well after that before any new programs meaningfully effect economic forecasts  but policymakers also watch the markets closely  it may be hard for the fed to stick with its ultra slow pace of rate hikes if a major tax overhaul and fiscal spending plan are unleashed   td securities analysts said that fiscal policy at this point in the economic recovery could prompt  an inflationary demand shock  that adds nearly a percentage point to economic growth  but spurs the fed to raise rates much quicker than expected   by nearly an extra percentage point per year   that scenario of a central bank caught behind the curve and forced to act faster is one that yellen and other policymakers have said they hope to avoid out of fear it could prompt a recession   fed officials in recent days have acknowledged the trump agenda may cause them to switch gears  though it is not clear how soon   at this juncture  it is premature to reach firm conclusions   new york fed president william dudley said last week   but  since trump won the election  dudley added   the stock market has firmed  bond yields have risen and the dollar has appreciated     market participants now anticipate that fiscal policy will turn more expansionary and that the  fomc  will likely respond by tightening monetary policy a bit more quickly than previously anticipated   for a graphic on the trump inflection  click
