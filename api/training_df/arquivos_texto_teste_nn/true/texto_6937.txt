manila washington  reuters    philippines leader rodrigo duterte described as  encouraging  his phone call with u s  president elect donald trump on friday  during which he felt a rapport between them and gave assurance that ties were intact  despite a period of rocky relations  trump s seven minute chat with the firebrand philippine president follows months of uncertainty about one of washington s most important asian alliances  stoked by duterte s hostility towards president barack obama and repeated threats to sever decades old defense ties  duterte s anger was unleashed following obama s concerns about possible human rights abuses in his war on drugs  during which more than   people have been killed  duterte said trump was  sensitive  and understanding about his crackdown and was encouraged by what he interpreted as trump s indication he would not interfere   i could sense a good rapport  an animated president elect trump  and he was wishing me success in my campaign against the drug problem   duterte said in comments his office released on saturday   he understood the way we are handling it     i supposed that what he really wanted to say was that we would be the last to interfere in the affairs of your own country   he added   we are doing it as a sovereign nation  the right way  and he wishes us well  and i said that  well  we assured him of our ties with america   his special adviser  christopher go  had earlier said in a text message to media that trump had invited duterte to visit the white house next year  there appeared to be confusion  however  duterte mentioned an invite to washington and new york  and that trump asked him to notify him of his presence  if i m around   a statement issued by trump s transition team made no mention of that  it said the two men  noted the long history of friendship  between their countries and would work closely on  matters of shared interest and concern   duterte made waves when he visited china in october and announced his  separation  from the united states   in five months in office  he has upended philippine foreign policy by berating the united states  pursuing a new alliance with russia and also china  with which manila has a history of bitter disputes  his diplomacy has created jitters among asian nations concerned about beijing s influence and washington s regional staying power  duterte told democrat obama to  go to hell  and called him a  son of a bitch  whom he would humiliate if he visited the philippines  despite his optimism about trump s win  it has not stopped duterte railing against what he calls a u s  history of  hypocrisy  and  bullying  worldwide  republican trump told reuters during his campaign that duterte s comments about obama had showed  a lack of respect for our country   but he also stressed the  very important strategic location  of the philippines  a source who has advised trump s transition team on security policy said the president elect would start a  clean slate  with duterte   he is perfectly capable of talking to duterte in an open way without being wedded to previous policy failures   the source said of trump  sometimes called the  trump of the east  because of his brash  mercurial style  duterte has threatened repeatedly to scrap u s  defense ties  saying he  hates  having foreign soldiers in the philippines  joint military exercises look set to be downsized as duterte demanded and uncertainty surrounds the  enhanced defence cooperation agreement  edca   a deal of strategic importance because it allows u s  access to philippine bases on a troop rotation basis   edca is a concern and some of the things duterte has said are a concern   said the advisor to trump s team   that is not going to change based on who the president is   some experts say duterte s appointment of special envoys to washington suggest he aims to keep good ties  among those is real estate tycoon jose antonio  who bought the rights to name a new commercial project in manila  trump towers   ernest bower of the bower group asia consultancy said it was likely the call was set up by trump s philippine business partners and a core group of advisers  including his children  bower said trump s win could offer duterte a face saving way to step back from his anti u s  stance  while duterte offers trump a chance to stress the importance of asian alliances  duterte said it would be  great for our country  if trump visited manila next year when it chairs the association of south east asian nations and summits of asian leaders  and trump wanted to attend  bower said that may have been fortuitous for trump   my guess is he was more interested in making a point   that he could deal with duterte in ways obama couldn t   than in the strategic wisdom of driving alignment with the asean chair
