washington new york  reuters    democrats are showing little interest in cooperating with the republicans who control congress on legislation to dismantle the obamacare health insurance law but some are signaling a willingness to collaborate on action to curb rising drug prices  republican u s  president elect donald trump pledged two weeks ago to bring down drug prices  addressing an issue that could appeal to voters in both parties  he did not say how he would accomplish this although he previously suggested he was open to allowing importation of cheaper medicines from overseas  nineteen senate democrats this week urged trump to push the issue with republican lawmakers  many of whom have resisted government action to rein in medication costs  persistently rising drug prices have imposed a heavy burden on consumers  many americans cannot afford their medicines or face increasing co pays on prescription drugs  the  affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  enabled about  million americans who previously had no medical insurance to get coverage  it is considered outgoing democratic president barack obama s signature legislative achievement and an important accomplishment for his party  republicans  who will control both the white house and in   condemn it as a government overreach  trump and congressional republicans have vowed to repeal and replace it  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said senators will start the repeal process shortly after jan    trump takes office on jan    a house of representatives leadership aide told reporters drug pricing was one of several areas republicans would use to reach out to democrats to solicit their involvement in obamacare replacement legislation  along with the medicaid insurance program for the poor  and children s healthcare    we are going to try and find where the other side wants to engage   the aide said  democrats may be difficult to persuade  democratic senator amy klobuchar of minnesota said drug pricing proposals might have been part of a bipartisan healthcare reform package to address obamacare issues  if republicans were not insisting on repeal first  placing the two parties in opposite camps    my vision before the election was that we would have some form of reform package  and now that s murky because of this effort to repeal   klobuchar said in a telephone interview  republican lawmakers have angered democrats with their plan to use arcane congressional budget procedures to repeal obamacare as quickly as possible  without having to secure any democratic votes  this approach would thwart procedural hurdles democrats could pursue under normal circumstances  republicans including senator john thune of south dakota  a member of his party s senate leadership  have said they want democrats to work with them to replace obamacare once it is repealed  they will almost certainly need them   in the  seat senate  republicans need a super majority of  to clear procedural hurdles and pass replacement legislation  with  republican senators  they would need to attract at least eight democrats   if they genuinely wanted to work with us on fixing the affordable care act  we would have that conversation before they repealed   democratic senator chris coons of delaware said of the republicans  americans can obtain health insurance from private insurers through the affordable care act by buying it on state or federally run exchanges  in   costs on the individual insurance market rose  insurers including unitedhealth group inc and aetna inc pulled out for   saying they were losing too much money  more insurers may drop out for   making insurance plans more expensive   lawmakers in both parties expressed outrage after mylan nv raised the price of a pair of the generic drugmaker s lifesaving epipen allergy treatments to more than   this year from   in   klobuchar has worked with iowa republican senator charles grassley on drug pricing issues  introducing legislation that would help put an end to brand name drug companies paying generic drugmakers to delay marketing low cost competing medications  she was among the democrats who sent trump the letter on drug costs  they suggested five areas of cooperation  allowing the medicare insurance program for the elderly to negotiate prescription prices  increasing transparency  stopping abusive pricing  encouraging incentives for innovation  and supporting generic competition for branded drugs  in addition  republican senator susan collins of maine democratic senator claire mccaskill of missouri this week released a report detailing drug pricing abuses at valeant pharmaceuticals international and turing pharmaceuticals  health policy expert joe antos of the american enterprise institute think tank said democrats may refuse to work on obamacare replacement legislation for some time  especially if republicans delay the repeal s effective date by up to three years   democrats can just say  we don t have to do it now   antos said  stuart butler of the brookings institution think tank said it will get harder for democrats to stay on the sidelines after a repeal because hospitals  insurers and americans who may lose their coverage will press for action   i think they  democrats  will get as much political capital out of not engaging as they can  and then i think their own constituents will start to push them   butler said
