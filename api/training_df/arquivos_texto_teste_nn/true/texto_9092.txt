washington  reuters    the awkward efforts of republicans to embrace their party s standard bearer donald trump looked particularly painful in congress this week as lawmakers ducked into elevators  dashed away from reporters  ignored questions or  worse  tried to answer them   only days after a furor over his criticism of a mexican american judge  the presumptive presidential nominee sent republicans reeling again by renewing his call for a ban on muslim immigration after a gunman who pledged allegiance to islamic militants killed of  people at a florida nightclub  then former reality tv star trump waded into two sensitive topics for social conservatives by embracing the lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  community and suggesting the country may need certain new gun control measures    for lawmakers accustomed to well crafted talking points and predictable lines of questioning  the week marked a chaotic flurry of contorted responses or terse  tight lipped replies  senator john barrasso of wyoming walked away when asked about trump s embrace of the lgbt community  saying   i don t know what the latest is  i haven t read anything  i haven t been watching   florida senator marco rubio  a former trump adversary in the presidential primaries  had to bat away two trump questions before he could announce that he is considering running for re election   a decision that could determine whether republicans retain control of the senate in the nov   election  senator ted cruz  another rival in the primaries  refused to respond directly to the speech in which trump hardened his line on muslims while senate intelligence chairman richard burr called it  an ok speech  before stepping into an elevator and refusing to respond to any more questions    the trump challenge is obvious even for seasoned republicans            i m spending my days commenting on everything that donald trump says   lamented john mccain  chairman of senate armed services committee  orrin hatch  the longest serving republican in the senate  ricocheted from rejection of trump s comments on muslims to doubts about the legality of his proposed immigration ban to bafflement over the billionaire s response to the orlando shootings   trump controversies have also overshadowed house speaker paul ryan s rollout of a policy agenda  a campaign document that was supposed to help bring trump s position more into line with mainline party doctrine   asked on thursday whether he was bothered by having to contend with trump s remarks  ryan called trump  a different kind of candidate    in  a different kind of year    asked how many more times he would be called on to do so  ryan said   i don t know the answer to that question either   in an ironic message to his critics among the republican leadership this week  trump had this to say   be quiet  just please be quiet  don t talk  please be quiet  just be quiet   ryan s response      you can t make this up sometimes   he said    a political neophyte who has never held elected office  trump has also said he may not need much from his republican colleagues on capitol hill anyway   we have to have our republicans either stick together or let me just do it by myself  i ll do very well   he said in a cnn interview   a lot of people thought i should do that anyway  but i ll just do it very nicely by myself
