cleveland  reuters    donald trump accused democratic rival hillary clinton of a legacy of  death  destruction  terrorism and weakness  as u s  secretary of state and vowed to be tough on crime and illegal immigrants in a speech on thursday accepting the republican presidential nomination  trump s  minute speech was designed to set the tone for the general election campaign against clinton  an answer to republicans who say the best way he can unify the divided party is to detail why the democrat should not be elected on nov    as the crowd chanted   lock her up  for her handling of u s  foreign policy  trump waved them off and said   let s defeat her in november   thousands of supporters who were gathered in the convention hall roared their approval   when it was over  trump was joined on stage by family members as balloons cascaded from above and confetti blew around the arena  a cnn snap poll of viewers of the speech said  percent had a  very positive reaction  to the address and  percent a somewhat positive reaction  while  percent said it had a negative effect  social media sentiment toward trump based on tweets that mentioned his name was slightly more negative than positive shortly after his speech   the acceptance speech by trump    closed out a four day convention that underscored his struggle to heal fissures in the republican party over his anti illegal immigrant rhetoric and concerns about his temperament  the event was boycotted by many big name establishment republicans  such as  nominee mitt romney and members of the bush family that gave the party its last two presidents  trump presented a bleak view of america under siege from illegal immigrants  threatened by islamic state militants  hindered by crumbling infrastructure and weakened by unfair trade deals and race related violence  accusing illegal immigrants of taking jobs from american citizens and committing crimes  trump vowed to build a  great border wall  against the border crossers   we will stop it   trump said  trump took positions in conflict with traditional republican policies  he said he would avoid multinational trade deals but instead pursue agreements with individual countries  he would renegotiate the nafta trade accord linking the united states  canada and mexico  he would penalize companies that outsource jobs and then export their foreign made products back into the united states   we will never sign bad trade deals   trump thundered   america first   the new york businessman  who has never held elected office  filled his speech with some of the bravado he used to win the republican nomination over  rivals  punctuating his rhetorical points by waving an index finger   i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves   trump said   nobody knows the system better than me  which is why i alone can fix it   in his speech  trump portrayed himself as a fresh alternative to traditional politicians  willing to consider new approaches to vexing problems and help working class people who may feel abandoned  laying out his case against clinton  he denounced nation building policies that were actually put in place to some extent by george w  bush  without mentioning by name the republican president who launched wars in afghanistan and iraq  trump said policies pursued by clinton in iraq  libya  egypt and syria had made a bad situation worse  he blamed her for the rise of islamic state militants and blasted her willingness to accept thousands of syrian refugees   after  years of wars in the middle east  after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost  the situation is worse than it has ever been before  this is the legacy of hillary clinton  death  destruction  terrorism and weakness   trump said  clinton senior adviser john podesta dismissed the speech as painting  a dark picture of an america in decline  and called it a reminder that trump  is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the united states   john weaver  a senior adviser to ohio republican governor john kasich  a former presidential rival to trump  said in a tweet that trump had delivered the  saddest  darkest  most depressing acceptance speech in modern history    trump needed a strong performance on thursday night to improve his chances of getting a boost in opinion polls as democrats prepare for their own  more scripted convention next week in philadelphia  in a contest that pits two politicians viewed as unfavorable by large segments of the american people  trump also accused clinton    of being the puppet of big business  elite media and major donors who want to preserve the current political system   that is why hillary clinton s message is that things will never change  my message is that things have to change   and they have to change right now   trump said  trump said he would speedily address the violence that has dominated headlines  such as the shooting deaths of five dallas police officers earlier this month  he vowed to defeat  the barbarians of isis   the acronym for islamic state   i have a message for all of you  the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end  beginning on jan      safety will be restored   trump said  the next president takes office on jan    the prevailing narrative at the cleveland convention has not been about trump s positions  but dominated instead by the failure of he party s various factions to unite behind trump  a series of distractions at the convention largely thwarted a bid by the trump campaign to show him as a caring father and magnanimous business leader who would bring greater prosperity and safety to the united states   but in the end  many of these points were made when ivanka trump  trump s daughter  introduced her father   i have seen him fight for his family  i have seen him fight for his employees  i have seen him fight for his company and now i am seeing him fight for our country   she said  trump s text of his speech  released by his campaign   included extensive footnotes to show where the material originated  that was perhaps in reaction to the speech given on monday night by trump s wife melania  who was accused of plagiarism when she repeated lines from a  speech by michelle obama  obama s wife  a staff writer for the trump organization later took responsibility for the misstep
