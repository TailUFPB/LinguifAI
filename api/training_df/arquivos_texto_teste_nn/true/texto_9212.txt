washington  reuters    u s  house speaker paul ryan unveiled a national security policy featuring stronger defense on thursday  part of his agenda to unify republicans after a divisive primary campaign  but softening some of the hard lines taken by the party s presumptive presidential nominee  donald trump  the plan is sharply critical of president barack obama  blaming the democrat for  eight years of broken promises  concessions  and retreat  in the syrian civil war  nuclear deal with iran  chilly relations with russia and dealings with a bellicose north korea  it would overturn or back away from what obama allies see as his foreign policy achievements  including the iran deal and his moves toward normal relations with communist ruled cuba  and it criticizes efforts to close the guantanamo detention center   it s not too much to say that our enemies no longer fear us and too many of our allies no longer trust us  and i think this is a direct result of the president s foreign policy   ryan said as he and other house republicans introduced the plan at the council on foreign relations  while not providing figures  the plan also calls for an end to military rollbacks and demands  adequate  predictable budgets   trump  whom ryan has endorsed in the presidential race  has made a promise to erect a massive wall along the mexican border   a centerpiece of his campaign  the plan announced on thursday includes a range of border security measures such as  high fencing   aerial surveillance and radar  but not a large wall  the plan echoes some of trump s concerns about muslim immigrants  with calls to tighten refugee screening and discussion of ways to prevent the radicalization of youths   we must constantly reassess our defenses in order to find and close security gaps so that islamist militants cannot slip into our country undetected   ryan s plan said  representative michael mccaul  the chairman of the house of representatives homeland security committee  said the intention was not to target followers of any one religion  but to do everything possible to not admit those who would attack americans   what we have to do is target the threat and make sure that they don t come in   said mccaul  one of several republican committee chairmen who joined ryan at the report presentation  the plan is not isolationist  it takes a strong line on battling militants abroad  saying the united states must keep all options on the table and  eliminate terrorist sanctuaries    trump has been critical of some u s  alliances  ryan s plan  in contrast  underscores the importance of nato  it also includes many standard republican policy prescriptions  such as strong ties to israel  advocacy of severe sanctions on iran and an insistence that washington should stand up to russia  it also calls for more trade agreements and says foreign aid programs should make recipient countries self sufficient  the plan calls for increased security for diplomats and facilities overseas  in that context  it mentions the  attacks on benghazi  which many republicans cite to criticize then secretary of state hillary clinton  trump s rival in the white house race  several of thursday s speakers criticized clinton as they blasted obama s foreign policy  because she was the nation s top diplomat during the first four years of his term   democrats sought to tie the plan to some of trump s most controversial statements  including his rejection of alliances like nato  advocacy of waterboarding and calls for attacks on the families of terrorist suspects   perhaps this agenda is light on details because the republican presidential candidate has offered a truly disturbing vision of america s role in the world   representative eliot engel  the top democrat on the house foreign affairs committee  said in a statement  ryan  the country s highest ranking elected republican  has described the agenda as a way to offer voters a coherent policy message for   he unveiled an anti poverty agenda on monday  initiatives on regulation  constitutional authority  healthcare and tax reform are expected in the coming weeks
