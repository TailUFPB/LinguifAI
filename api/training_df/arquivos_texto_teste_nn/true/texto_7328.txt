washington beijing  reuters    the election of climate change skeptic donald trump as president is likely to end the u s  leadership role in the international fight against global warming and may lead to the emergence of a new and unlikely champion  china  china worked closely with the administration of outgoing president barack obama to build momentum ahead of the  paris agreement on climate change  the partnership of the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters helped get nearly  countries to support the pact at the historic meet in france s capital  by contrast  trump has called global warming a hoax created by china to give it an economic advantage and said he plans to remove the united states from the historic climate agreement  as well as reverse many of obama s measures to combat climate change   he has appointed noted climate change skeptic myron ebell to help lead transition planning for the environmental protection agency  which has crafted the administration s major environmental regulations such as the clean power plan and efficiency standards for cars and trucks  beijing is poised to cash in on the goodwill it could earn by taking on leadership in dealing with what for many other governments is one of the most urgent issues on their agenda   proactively taking action against climate change will improve china s international image and allow it to occupy the moral high ground   zou ji  deputy director of the national centre for climate change strategy and a senior chinese climate talks negotiator  told reuters  zou said that if trump abandons efforts to implement the paris agreement   china s influence and voice are likely to increase in global climate governance  which will then spill over into other areas of global governance and increase china s global standing  power and leadership   chen zhihua  a representative of the chinese delegation and official in the climate change division of the national development and reform commission  the country s economic planning agency  said chinese and other countries  efforts will not change if the united states withdraws from the agreement    action by the international community will not stop because of the new government of the united states  we still have confidence the international community will join hands and continue our efforts on climate change   he told reporters at the  nation u n  meeting being held in marrakesh to start fleshing out the implementation of the  paris agreement  the paris agreement seeks to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century and limit global warming to  well below   degrees celsius    fahrenheit  above pre industrial levels  each country has put forward national plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  some have raised concerns that without involvement and financial support from the united states  emerging economies like india may feel inclined to back out  one of the key advisors to obama s team on climate change said he hoped china would take on the mantle and keep the global climate deal alive   beijing should  continue to work in the spirit that we worked together in and before paris   said andrew light  former senior adviser to previous u s  special envoy on climate change todd stern  it is an ironic twist for the government of the world s second largest economy  for years  beijing fought attempts by foreign governments to limit carbon emissions  claiming it should be allowed the same space to develop and pollute that industrialized nations had  but with its capital often choked by smog and its people angry about the environmental devastation that rapid development has wrought across the country  beijing has become a proponent of efforts to halt global warming rather than a hindrance   china is acting on climate for the benefit of its own people   said erik solheim  executive director of the un environment programme   i am confident china will take a lead role   china has powerful domestic and global imperatives to play a high profile role in continued global climate change talks  meant to avert more heat waves  droughts  floods and rising sea levels that could cause trillions of dollars of damage by   china sees a perceived role as global climate leader as way to bolster its aspiration to become a  clean energy superpower  by leading in renewable energy technology such as wind and solar power and asserting itself as a key geopolitical power          dealing with the pressures of continued urbanization in some of the world s largest cities has already put china ahead  said andrew steer  the president of environmental think tank the world resources institute   beijing is innovating to build low carbon cities  he said       it sees carbon as an indicator of economic inefficiency   steer said  trump s victory over democrat hillary clinton darkened the mood of delegates attending the current round of climate talks in marrakesh      some delegates at the talks say that china is already setting an example       china is surprising us daily  whatever they ve promised they re delivering   said tosi mpanu mpanu  of democratic republic of congo  who heads the  nation group of least developed countries at the talks
