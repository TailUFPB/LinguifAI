washington  reuters    concerns about coordinating u s  derivatives regulation with that of other countries dominated a senate committee s hearing on thursday to consider two nominees for seats on the commodity futures trading commission  members of both parties asked the nominees  chris brummer  a georgetown university law professor  and brian quintenz  an investment firm founder who once worked for a republican representative  about cooperation with other countries during the agriculture committee hearing   the committee will vote on the nominations in a separate business meeting  if approved  the nominations then go to the full senate  the cftc oversees the u s  derivatives market and recently gave swap dealers an extra month to comply with a new cross border rule on collateral for uncleared swaps  after asia s market froze from uncertainty about the changes  the european commission announced this summer it was delaying its implementation of similar rules  both brummer and quintenz spoke of the need to build strong relationships with other countries  but brummer emphasized the u s  role in leading rulemaking   overall  i think that it s hard   to lead if you don t lead by example  i think if you want to have a cross border regulatory environment that is high quality then the united states should commit to the highest standards and find those who are like minded   he said  meanwhile  quintenz worried firms could exploit timing gaps between different countries  rules implementation for financial gain  calling it  regulatory arbitrage    someone does have to go first but i don t believe that s the full analysis   he said   i believe the full analysis is  after you go first how long will it be until all the jurisdictions move and what is the size of the regulatory arbitrage you re creating  and once other jurisdictions move  will there be regulatory arbitrage going forward   republican senator thom tillis said that in the current situation  it s almost like we re being penalized for good behavior    we re on time  some of the other key players are not   our banking industry is suffering as we move forward with regulations that make us globally make us un competitive   he said  separately  at a speech on thursday  cftc chairman timothy massad said he had been assured by european counterparts that their delay in implementing their swaps margin rule would be short and he hoped it would be in place by march   he added the cftc will explore actions it could take if the delay stretches on longer
