raleigh  north carolina  reuters    on election day in   joetta teal went to work at a polling station in lumberton  north carolina  like all poll workers  she was required to stay until voting booths closed  so she decided to cast her own vote there  that was a mistake  she later discovered  what she didn t know was that under a  state law she had to vote in the precinct where she lived  the polling station where she voted was not in her precinct  so her vote was not counted      a reuters review of republican backed changes to north carolina s voting rules indicates as many as   votes might not be counted in this year s nov   presidential election if a federal appeals court upholds the  law  besides banning voters from voting outside their assigned precinct on election day  the law also prevents them from registering the same day they vote during the early voting period   the u s  justice department says the law was designed to disproportionately affect minority groups  who are more likely to vote out of precinct and use same day registration  backers of the law deny this and say it will prevent voter fraud  the battleground state has a recent history of close races that have hinged on just a few thousand votes  barack obama  a democrat  won north carolina by just   votes in   in   mitt romney  a republican  narrowly carried the state by a margin of just   percent      reuters reviewed state election board data showing the number of north carolinians who made use of out of precinct voting and same day registration in previous elections  including march s state nominating contest  or primary  when voters nominated their preferred presidential candidate       the reuters analysis includes some assumptions  for   votes to go uncounted on nov    north carolinians would need to vote in the same numbers and in the same ways they have in previous elections  including the march primary    in that primary  after a court temporarily ordered a stay on  the bans    north carolinians voted out of their assigned precinct and   registered the same day they voted       the north carolina board of elections did not respond to requests for comment on reuters  findings       north carolina senator bob rucho  a republican who backed the law  declined to comment specifically on the findings but disputed the notion that the law suppressed votes  saying the increased turnout between the  and  elections shows it has not had a disparate impact on minority voters   how can it show voter suppression when more black voters voted and more white voters voted  and there was more opportunity  and there are more black voters registered than there were before        turnout between those elections did rise by   percentage points for black voters and by   percentage points for white voters  according to data the state election board entered as evidence in court    advocacy group democracy north carolina  however  said their poll monitors saw many people attempting to vote out of precinct in  who were told by officials their ballots would not count  and as a result cast no vote  and it says   voters would have used same day registration to vote in  if it had not been banned  basing its findings on a review of election board data  hundreds of hotline calls  and the observations of more than  poll monitors    north carolina board of elections executive director kim strach said her office looked into claims of voters being turned away  but generally did not find statewide evidence of it       the fourth u s  circuit court of appeals  which is considering legal challenges to the law from the justice department and civil rights groups and citizens  is expected to issue a ruling in the next few weeks  north carolina s senate passed its new voting laws weeks after the u s  supreme court voted  to  in june  to eliminate a requirement that nine states mostly in the south with a history of discrimination  including north carolina  receive federal approval before changing election laws  had that requirement been in place   it may have blocked the provisions now at issue   said kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  a non profit legal defense fund  the justice department alleged a  race based purpose  to the new law in a legal brief  studies the department cited show that minority and low income voters are more likely to use same day registration and out of precinct voting because they are less likely to own a car or have flexible working hours  these voters are also more likely to vote for democratic candidates    if you pick out precisely the way minority voters are engaging with the process  that s intentionally treating minority voters differently   justin levitt  who oversees the justice department s voting unit  said in an interview       north carolina state officials say the changes cut fraud by making it harder for people to cast multiple ballots or impersonate other voters   the justice department said in court documents that voter fraud was  virtually non existent  in the state  rucho  the state senator  said while the law banned some voting methods and cut the early voting period from  to  days  it extended the hours during which voters could vote       we opened up more locations for them to vote  more times to vote  more flexible times   said rucho  four person team    teal  who is african american  was one of  north carolina voters reuters contacted whose votes were invalid in  because of the law      ten of them  including teal  did not realize their votes were not counted until informed by reuters  one was told his vote would not count by a voter advocacy group  and the other three were told by poll workers that their ballots likely would not count  in all    ballots were rejected in the  election because they were cast out of the voter s assigned precinct   up from  rejected for the same reason in   according to the reuters review of provisional ballots       if they could have just sent people letters and told them exactly where to go  that would have been helpful   teal said  the north carolina board of elections website has a tool for residents to look up their assigned precincts  but teal did not know about it  this year she plans to vote early  in other developed democracies   the government takes a greater responsibility for ensuring that voter registration lists are kept up to date and accurate   said tova wang  senior fellow at the policy research group demos      the election board has been trying to educate north carolinians about the ban on out of precinct voting through ads and a four person voter outreach team that travels around the state to raise awareness about the changes  said strach  the board s director        we re telling people  go find out where you are  make sure you re showing up at the right precinct   strach said   related stories   insight native americans move
