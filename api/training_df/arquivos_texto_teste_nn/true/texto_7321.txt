janesville  wisc   reuters    semi retired wisconsin pig farmer john lader does not think much of donald trump as a messenger  but voted for what he described as the republican president elect s message of change and economic hope for america   the last few years  there hasn t been much optimism and hope among working people in rural areas in this country   said lader    who lives in the farmland outside the southern wisconsin city of janesville  around  miles   km  to the northeast in the state s biggest city of milwaukee  jose boni  who cleans offices at a local university and rents out several homes  heard a different message  trump s plan to build a wall on the u s  mexican border and vow to deport the estimated  million immigrants who are in the united states illegally  most of whom are hispanic    he doesn t care about our community or working people  he only cares about himself   said boni    an ecuador born u s  citizen  the different worlds of lader and boni help illustrate the rural urban divide that was critical to the outcome of tuesday s u s  presidential election  a country once defined by regional voting now is more clearly divided by the differences between rural and urban voters  the combination of a strong trump turnout in the countryside and a weak showing by democrat clinton in the cities went a long way toward deciding the election  rural and small town working class white voters  who already tended to vote republican  propelled trump  urban areas  where black and hispanic voters are concentrated along with college educated voters  already leaned toward the democrats  but clinton did not get the turnout from these groups that she needed  for instance  black voters did not show up in the same numbers they did for barack obama  the first black president  in  and   trump beat clinton by  percentage points among voters who live in non metropolitan areas  while clinton bested trump by about  percentage points in urban areas  according to the nationwide reuters ipsos national election day poll  steven schier  a political science professor at carleton college in northfield  minnesota  said rural voters  feel they ve lost something  that america is moving away from them    trump came up with the perfect slogan for them in  make america great again  because it hits them exactly where they live   schier said  democratic presidential candidates had won in wisconsin in every election since   until trump s victory on tuesday  in wisconsin  overall turnout was lower than in the  presidential election  trump actually was a few hundred votes shy of  republican nominee mitt romney s total in the state  but clinton was around   votes short of obama s  tally  she ended up around   votes behind trump in the state   those couple hundred thousand democratic voters for whatever reason decided not to vote   mordecai lee  a political scientist at the university of wisconsin milwaukee   they stayed home  and wisconsin went republican  i think that was the pattern around the country    turnout in milwaukee s hispanic neighborhoods was down  percent versus   while citywide turnout in milwaukee fell  percent   clinton took   percent in milwaukee county  which includes the city  to trump s   percent  but trump won in rural counties  for example taking   percent to clinton s   percent in fond du lac county in the middle of the state and   percent to   percent in florence county in the far north  in milwaukee  election day canvassers found trump s comments about immigrants were not enough to get people to the polls  christine neumann ortiz  director of community group voces de la frontera  said about  percent of the voters reached by the group in milwaukee raised concerns about clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state or were undecided    if we reached people  we were able to convince them to vote  but i don t think we could ever have reached enough by ourselves to overcome trump s advantage with white working class voters   neumann ortiz said  the rural landscape was rich trump territory  with people concerned about a slump in commodity prices and layoffs among manufacturers  rural areas  especially in the midwest and northeast  have also seen a demographic shift in recent years with the arrival of hispanic immigrants  demographer william frey of the brookings institution think tank in washington said census data from  to  showed hispanic populations in non metro counties in the midwest rose  percent while the white population fell  percent   the counties still are  percent white  but those voters are feeling the change  frey said   they re a little bit fearful of it  and if they re being hit hard economically  that can add to it   frey added  austin arndt  a beef cattle farmer and neighbor of john lader outside janesville  hometown of republican speaker of the u s  house of representatives paul ryan  said his vote was more against clinton than for trump  he said his vote was based on trump s promise to cut taxes and repeal obama s signature  healthcare law  which has enabled millions of previously uninsured americans to gain medical coverage but is detested by conservatives as a government overreach   from the social point of view as candidates  they were both terrible people   said arndt     for me  it was all about the economics
