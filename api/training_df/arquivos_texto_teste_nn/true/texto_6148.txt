washington  reuters    president donald trump is ordering federal agencies to undermine obamacare through regulatory action  a move that could weaken  enforcement of the requirement for americans to buy health coverage and give insurers leeway to drop some benefits   trump s first executive order  signed hours after taking office on friday  directs the federal government to scale back regulations  taxes and penalties under president barack obama s healthcare law  the affordable care act  aca    republican lawmakers  who are working on new legislation to repeal and replace obamacare  praised the order as showing trump s commitment to gutting the program and lowering steep healthcare costs they blame on the law  trump did not specify which parts of the program would be affected by his order  and any changes are unlikely to affect  the government funded or subsidized insurance plans covering more than  million people in    trump s nominee to head the u s  department of health and human services  georgia representative tom price  has said there was no plan for  pulling the rug out  on millions of americans  healthcare as a replacement is designed  but the scope of trump s order drives home the uncertainties of that process  healthcare experts said   the order could affect virtually anything in the law  provided it is couched as a delay in implementing the law   said stuart butler  a senior fellow at the brookings institution  trump s administration could decide to delay or not enforce the individual mandate  a requirement that americans buy health coverage if they do not already have benefits from their employer or the government  as well as a similar requirement for employers of a certain size to insure their workers  experts said  others say those changes  if not handled carefully  could force insurance premiums higher and make healthcare less affordable for americans   outcomes that trump and republicans say they are trying to avoid   the administration has to run a really fine line here   said dan mendelson  chief executive of the washington based consulting firm avalere health   they re not going on record as saying what they re going to do at this point   the administration could also alter  or fail to enforce  requirements that insurers cover a basic set of health benefits in all of their plans  from maternity and newborn care to mental health services   this could be a signal to the insurance industry that they could offer new products that  for example  didn t include maternity benefits  in order to attract more sales from people who would prefer a slimmer package   said joe antos of the american enterprise institute think tank  republican lamar alexander  chairman of the senate health committee  said last week that price  once confirmed  could relax requirements for u s  states to get exemptions from the law  as well as make it easier for states to get waivers on the medicaid health plan for low income households   allow states more flexibility to determine the essential health benefits     that s probably the single most important step that could be taken to create a market where more insurers are likely to sell policies   alexander said   his committee is one of several in the house and senate working on repealing and replacing obamacare   three of the largest health insurers   aetna inc  unitedhealth group incand humana inc   have essentially pulled out of the market offering health insurance to individuals under obamacare  citing financial losses for covering a population that was sicker than they had expected  the remaining players include anthem inc  as well as insurers that specialize in administering lower cost medicaid plans  such as molina healthcare inc  ana gupte  a senior healthcare analyst at the investment bank leerink partners  said trump s executive order could reassure people in the market that obamacare will be dismantled one way or another   that could be positive for insurers who would no longer face the law s health insurance tax  she said  but it could negatively impact acute care hospitals that have seen more customers and insurers that sell policies to state medicaid programs  which could shrink in size   it s clear that congress is looking to repeal the law and that it s poised to happen with a replacement  this is one more avenue to make sure their agenda is executed   gupte said
