washington  reuters    fbi director james comey was driven in part by a fear of leaks from within his agency when he decided to tell congress the fbi was investigating newly discovered emails related to hillary clinton  law enforcement sources said on thursday  the examination of the email traffic is now being carried out under the tightest secrecy by a team at federal bureau of investigations headquarters in washington  the sources said  requesting anonymity because of the inquiry s sensitivity  several sources said it was unclear whether the fbi would make any further public disclosures about its latest review before tuesday s presidential and congressional elections  two sources said such disclosures were unlikely  another source  recently in contact with top investigators   said   it depends on how it goes and what they find   the source said that  as of thursday   nobody really knows  whether the fbi will have anything further to say before the election   dropping like a bombshell on the u s  presidential campaign  comey s disclosure last friday in a letter to senior lawmakers just days before the elections raised questions about his motives and drew criticism from some over his timing  comey disclosed that the fbi was looking at emails as part of a probe into clinton s use of a private email system while secretary of state  without describing the emails  content or how long the inquiry might take  the fbi normally does not comment on ongoing inquiries   the latest emails examination was moving forward  expeditiously   said one source close to the review  the new emails turned up as fbi investigators were examining  electronic devices used by former democratic representative anthony weiner in connection with an alleged  sexting  scandal  weiner s estranged wife  huma abedin  is a clinton confidante  two law enforcement sources familiar with the fbi s new york field office  which initially discovered the emails  said a faction of investigators based in the office is known to be hostile to hillary clinton  a spokeswoman for the fbi s new york office said she had no knowledge about this   democratic party sources said such a faction was likely responsible for a recent surge in media leaks on alleged details of an ongoing fbi investigation of the clinton foundation   the fbi has made preliminary inquiries into clinton foundation activities and alleged contacts between trump and associates with parties in russia  according to law enforcement sources  but these inquiries were shifted into low gear weeks ago because the fbi wanted to avoid any impact on the election  the fbi previously had spent about a year investigating clinton s use of the unauthorized server at her home in chappaqua  new york  instead of the state department system after classified government secrets were found in some of her emails  comey had said in july that while there was  evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information  our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case
