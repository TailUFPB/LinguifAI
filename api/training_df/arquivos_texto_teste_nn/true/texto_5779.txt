washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday urged senate republicans to  go nuclear  and impose a rule change to force a simple majority vote on confirmation if democrats block his u s  supreme court nominee  neil gorsuch  as democrats maneuvered for a hard fight  gorsuch  a federal appeals court judge from colorado seen as a conservative intellectual  began holding private meetings with senators  starting with top senate republican mitch mcconnell  to drum up support for his nomination a day after trump picked  the  year old for a lifetime job on the country s top court  trump s fellow republicans control the senate    democrats signaled on wednesday they would set up a procedural hurdle  known as a filibuster  requiring  votes  rather than a simple majority  to move toward confirmation of gorsuch  the president urged mcconnell to change long standing senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for supreme court nominees  a move dubbed the  nuclear option   if democrats block gorsuch   we want to have him  gorsuch  go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process  because they re very demeaning on the other side  and they want to make you look as bad as possible   trump said  referring to democrats   if we end up with that gridlock  i would say   if you can  mitch  go nuclear    trump said at a white house meeting with conservative advocacy groups  supreme court nominations require senate confirmation   if confirmed  gorsuch would reinstate the supreme court s conservative majority  in place for decades until justice antonin scalia s death last feb    the court s ideological shift could prove pivotal on a range of issues including presidential powers  abortion  the death penalty and transgender  gun and religious rights  trump s comments came as democrats plotted strategy on how to deal with gorsuch s nomination  they remain furious over mcconnell s refusal last year to let the senate hold confirmation hearings or a vote on democratic president barack obama s nomination of merrick garland to succeed scalia on the court   some democratic senators  arguing that republicans stole a supreme court seat from obama  announced their opposition to gorsuch  while others said they were willing to hear him out  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor that if gorsuch could not meet the same standard republicans insisted on for obama s supreme court nominees  at least  votes for confirmation   then the problem lies not with the senate  but with the nominee    the answer should not be to change the rules of the senate  but to change the nominee to someone who can earn  votes  sixty votes produces a mainstream candidate   schumer added  to get those  votes  republicans hope to lure eight democrats up for re election in  in republican leaning states or states that voted for trump last november  those include democrats from indiana  north dakota  west virginia  missouri  michigan  montana and wisconsin as well as closely divided maine  senator sherrod brown  a democrat from republican leaning ohio  already announced he would vote against gorsuch  senator tammy baldwin of wisconsin said she would review gorsuch s record but was  deeply troubled  over his stances against disabled students  workers and women s reproductive healthcare  senator jon tester of montana said in an interview he wanted to review gorscuch s record on women s rights and other issues  adding the judge s stance on end of life issues  distresses me   gorsuch is known for siding with the christian owners of a company that challenged federal requirements that businesses provide insurance coverage for women s birth control and for writing against euthanasia and assisted suicide  the influential  deep pocketed americans for prosperity is promising a vigorous effort to help gorsuch get confirmed and is using its network of wealthy contributors to build support  especially in battleground states  the organization is led by multi billionaire brothers charles and david koch  it has been ramping up its political campaign donations in support of republican candidates for the senate and other offices      schumer said that while trump campaigned as someone who would  be for the working man and woman   he now had chosen a supreme court nominee who  sides with ceos over citizens    unfortunately  judge gorsuch has proven to have a judicial philosophy outside of the mainstream and time and again has subjugated individual rights to those of corporations   said democratic senator kirsten gillibrand of new york  who came out in opposition to the nomination   senator joe manchin  a moderate democrat who met with the nominee on wednesday  said a supreme court nominee should have to win the support of  senators but urged fellow democrats to give gorsuch a chance  manchin  whose home state  west virginia  voted overwhelmingly for trump  is up for re election in   senate aides said republicans were hoping the judiciary committee could hold hearings and a vote on the nomination by late march  paving the way for confirmation by the full senate in the first week of april  if that happens  gorsuch could be on the high court in time to year a major transgender rights case
