paris  reuters    nissan is halting joint development of luxury cars with daimler s mercedes benz  sources close to the companies told reuters  suspending a key project in their seven year partnership and potentially hitting profitability at a new shared factory in mexico  nissan   t  decided in october its premium infiniti brand would not use     an upgraded daimler  daign de  car platform that the companies have jointly funded  in part because infiniti was not performing well enough to absorb mercedes technology costs  the sources said   it wasn t possible to close a deal on the basis of    said one of the people   the targets set by infiniti were too difficult to achieve   the move could reduce efficiency at a   billion shared factory opening this year in aguascalientes  mexico  where the companies had planned to use the same compact car architecture to cut complexity and production costs  two of the sources said  it could also ultimately force nissan to write down part of a  million pound    million  investment at its uk plant that included mercedes based tooling  they added  daimler and nissan pursue joint programs only when  beneficial for both sides   the companies said in separate statements to reuters  without directly addressing emailed questions about their plans for  vehicles  projects are constantly reviewed against targets to account for  developments beyond the control of management   they added  and discussions about joint development of future premium compact cars are ongoing   nissan s decision deals a blow to the broad cooperation deal struck between renault nissan boss carlos ghosn and his daimler counterpart dieter zetsche in   it also underscores the mixed results of nissan s battle over almost three decades to transform infiniti into a significant global player in the lucrative luxury car market  the decision predates donald trump s election as the next u s  president  the sources said  and was unrelated to campaign vows to penalize mexican imports that have rattled the auto industry  ford  f n  on tuesday scrapped a planned compact car plant in the country  nissan and daimler are pushing ahead with aguascalientes  where they will build infiniti and mercedes models for the u s  and other markets from a single assembly line opening in   the project nonetheless faces weakening u s  demand for smaller cars that contributed to ford s cancellation and has further raised profitability hurdles for new infiniti compacts  persistently low oil prices accelerated the market shift to larger vehicles in   ford sales chief mark laneve said on wednesday   all the growth was suvs and trucks   infiniti has struggled outside the united states  last year selling   vehicles in western europe and   globally   less than  percent of nissan s overall tally and barely one tenth of mercedes s expected  million deliveries  the first infiniti appeared in   the same year as the launch model for toyota s   t  upscale lexus brand   which has since grown three times bigger by sales  modern carmakers pursue economies of scale by increasing the number of models built on each underlying platform   an adaptable chassis accommodating different body sizes  engines and alternative component sets for every part of the vehicle  the retreat on luxury compacts leaves intact the sharing of engines between infiniti and mercedes  and small cars between renault and daimler s smart  the three groups also collaborate on vans and pickups  but joint premium car development for mexican production was  one of the largest projects between the renault nissan alliance and daimler   ghosn said when unveiling the program in   a year later  after upgrading its plant in sunderland  england  nissan began building the infiniti  hatchback on the current mfa architecture developed for the mercedes a class and derivatives  the plant added the  suv in   extending infiniti s push into smaller vehicles  nissan has now ditched plans to use the updated mercedes platform for successors to those models planned for aguascalientes  the sources said   or for any future infinitis  other cancellations include a compact mercedes based infiniti  sedan earmarked for the plant in   instead the single  less efficient assembly line will build mercedes cars including an a class sedan and subsequent mini suv alongside infiniti vehicles based on renault nissan architecture  starting with a new  suv this year  nissan was forced to conclude that the infiniti brand would not command the higher prices required to turn a profit on vehicles stuffed with mercedes technology  one source explained    one of the lessons learned is that if you have the costs of a luxury vehicle but not the pricing  it s hard to be profitable   he said  nissan may end up writing down some sunderland investment in mercedes based tooling that had been intended to outlast the current  and   people with knowledge of the matter said   the company is still paying its share of  development costs running to hundreds of millions of euros for a platform it no longer plans to use  they said  but will leave daimler with a higher share of some production costs in aguascalientes  the setback may also show the limits of ghosn s consensual approach to economies of scale as head of both renault  rena pa  and nissan  whose  year old alliance is underpinned by significant cross shareholdings  the slow pace of integration has contributed to upheaval at the recently created alliance powertrain division  charged with  converging renault and nissan engineering  plans to build infinitis on mercedes technology had encountered resistance at nissan from the start  one source said   once again  ghosn has been unable to break through the wall of engineers to force commonality
