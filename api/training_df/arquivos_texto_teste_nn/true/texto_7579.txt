boston london  reuters    stocks are listing  bonds are drifting and suddenly gold is back in vogue  global investors appear to be facing the prospect that next week s u s  presidential election may not play out as they have been expecting  until last friday  when the fbi said it had re opened a probe of democrat hillary clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  the prevailing view among the investment set had her coasting to victory  and most investors have said in surveys they were more comfortable with that outcome than a victory by republican donald trump  now  though  several polls depict an ever tightening race as the clock counts down to election day on tuesday  although the latest reuters ipsos poll showed clinton still with a  point lead  investors generally see clinton as a known quantity who would not make major changes that would upend financial markets  while trump s positions have been difficult to nail down  yet against the tumultuous political backdrop  some of the biggest american stock funds remain either too sanguine  too confused or too focused on extending the bull market to guard against an election day result that could shock the world like the brexit vote did in june  u s  large cap mutual funds  which oversee   trillion in assets  are heading into the showdown for the white house with only a thin layer of cash to absorb any potential shocks from the stock market   gerry sullivan  who runs usa mutuals    million barrier fund  said it would be hard to reposition his portfolio even if he knew the election results ahead of time    there is so much confusion   sullivan said  u s  funds that invest in stocks with large market capitalizations are not showing any drastic moves toward precaution  overall  they have only   percent of their assets dedicated to cash  according to the latest data from morningstar inc  these same funds held more cash  about   percent  before barack obama defeated john mccain in   multi asset investors are more defensively positioned  especially those outside the united states  according to the latest reuters asset allocation poll  funds in europe held   percent of their portfolios in cash in late october  while u k  based funds had some   percent of their holdings parked on the sidelines   investors are holding higher than normal levels of cash   said mark haefele  global chief investment officer for ubs wealth management in london  who oversees around   trillion in assets   that s one way of hedging the uncertainty   nonetheless  haefele said   we ve not seen significant de risking around the election  but we have seen generally a consistent level of caution in the global client base   with uncertainty about the outcome on the rise  a risk off mood has enveloped markets around the world   the s p  index has declined for eight days in a row  its longest losing streak since the market crash in october   while a benchmark for global stocks  the msci all world index  has dropped for seven of the last eight sessions  both sit near four month lows   safe haven bonds  recently under pressure from expectations the u s  federal reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year  have seen only a modest boost in the meantime  but gold has surged to a one month high near    an ounce   the trades you re seeing in the market at the moment will go further in the event of a trump victory   said mike bell  global market strategist at jp morgan asset management in london   you d expect more downside to u s  equities  the dollar and treasury yields   more than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by northern trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility  prices for certain s p  index options expiring in the days after the election indicate a market swing of between  and  percent  in either direction  by then  still  portfolio managers sitting on a lot of cash  some with more than  percent of assets  say the stockpile is not a sign of worry about the outcome of the race    it s due to the diminished risk reward profile of investment opportunities in a mature profit cycle   said meggan walsh  a portfolio manager at the   billion invesco diversified dividend fund   we do not feel the election is an investable event   some value oriented large cap fund managers say the stock market is over valued and they are on high alert for a market correction as the election coincides with a bull market nearing completion of its eighth year    it can be tempting to forget that nasty downturns happen with some regularity  and there is never a bell rung to announce their arrival   portfolio managers arik ahitov and dennis bryant recently warned investors in the   million fpa capital fund   after britain surprised the world with a vote to leave the european union  the s p  index tumbled nearly  percent on june   it soon recovered  however  and had regained record territory by mid august  even in britain  the referendum s unexpected outcome has yet to show it has long lasting effects for investors outside of the currency market  where the british pound has sunk to a three decade low against the dollar  london s ftse  index is up around  percent from its post brexit trough  the fpa capital fund managers had nearly  percent of the fund s   million in assets in cash during the third quarter  they see the stock market as too expensive and are ready for a high level of panic  if that happens  according to their october letter to investors   an elevated level of forced selling  combined with a lack of liquidity  might result in challenges for many fully invested products such as index funds  many etfs  and funds that have no to very low levels of cash cushions   the fpa capital fund portfolio managers said    in a down market  cash helps mitigate losses and affords one the opportunity to buy when others are being forced to sell  generally the best time to buy
