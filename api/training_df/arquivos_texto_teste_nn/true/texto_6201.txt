washington  reuters    rick perry  president elect donald trump s pick to run the u s  energy department  said during a senate confirmation hearing on thursday that global warming caused by humans is real  but that efforts to combat it should not cost american jobs  the comment marks a shift for the former texas governor  who had previously called the science behind climate change  unsettled  and a  contrived  phony mess   it also clashes with trump s statements during his campaign for the white house that global warming is a hoax meant to weaken u s  business   i believe the climate is changing  i believe some of it is naturally occurring  but some of it is also caused by man made activity  the question is how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn t compromise economic growth  the affordability of energy or american jobs   perry said  perry s    hour hearing before the senate committee on energy and natural resources was one of the shortest and least contentious in a long list of sessions to vet trump cabinet nominees since last week  the committee has not yet scheduled its vote on perry s nomination  as energy secretary  perry    would oversee a substantial chunk of trump s energy portfolio  he would lead a vast scientific research operation credited with helping trigger a u s  drilling boom and advancements in energy efficiency and renewable energy technology  and would also be in charge of maintaining the united states  nuclear weapons arsenal  trump  who will be sworn in as president on friday  has promised to bolster the u s  oil  gas and coal industries  in part by undoing federal regulations curbing carbon dioxide emissions  he has also suggested pulling america out of a global climate change pact signed in paris in   calling it expensive for u s  industry   he sees perry  who was governor of texas from  to  and whose nomination has the support of the energy sector  as someone who can help usher in jobs growth  perry added during his hearing that he regrets having previously called for the department s elimination   a proposal he made during his failed bid for the republican presidential nomination in   that proposal  which has become known as his  oops  moment  came during a presidential candidate debate when he could not initially remember all of the three cabinet level departments he wanted to eliminate  commerce  education and energy   after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the department of energy  i regret recommending its elimination   he said in his opening remarks  democrats on the committee expressed worry that perry would weaken the energy department s functions and potentially target its army of scientists focused on climate research  perry sought to assuage them   i am going to protect the men and women of the scientific community from anyone who would attack them   he said in response to a question from democratic senator maria cantwell of washington state about whether he would cut the department s climate science budget  when pressed on whether there would be budget or staff cuts to key research programs at the department  perry said   i will be an advocate  for the programs      but i m not sure i m going to be   percent successful   he distanced himself from a questionnaire the trump transition team sent to the department in december demanding names and publications of employees who had worked on climate issues  after an uproar by critics who said it amounted to a witch hunt  the team disavowed the survey      i didn t approve it  i don t approve of it  i don t need that information   perry said  perry said much of his focus running the department would be on renewing the u s  nuclear weapons arsenal  more than half of the department s    billion budget goes to maintaining nuclear weapons and cleaning up nuclear waste     as a former air force pilot during the days of the cold war  i understand the deterrent value of our nuclear weapons systems  and the vital role they play in keeping the peace   he said  perry said he was generally supportive of a state s right to block the siting of nuclear waste dumps  like yucca mountain in nevada  but fell short of ruling out the federal government s power to impose them over state objections in some cases  nuclear waste disposal is one of the top hurdles to growth in the u s  nuclear power industry   department leadership under perry would represent a pivot from being run by learned scientists to a person who is known for close ties to energy interests   the current energy secretary  ernest moniz  is a nuclear physicist who led technical negotiations in the  iran nuclear deal  while the previous head  steven chu  is a nobel prize winning physicist     perry recently resigned from the board of directors of energy transfer partners lp  the company building the dakota access pipeline opposed by native americans and environmentalists
