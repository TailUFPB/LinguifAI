new york  reuters    move over  janet yellen  the federal reserve chief has a challenger for the title of speaker most scrutinized by wall street  and it s donald trump   all new u s  president elects are closely monitored by the financial community for clues about what their policies mean for markets  but trump s speaking style  often using enthymemes or incomplete sentences that leave room for interpretation  along with vague or contradictory campaign promises make him all the more challenging to decipher    his statements are crazy  he says peculiar things  like building the wall and getting mexico to pay for it  that you know are just not going to happen   said allan meltzer  a fed historian and professor of political economy at carnegie mellon university  in pittsburg    but his actions as opposed to his statements have been very moderate   he said  exhibit a for how trump has policy makers and investors hanging on his every word came shortly after the republican s conciliatory acceptance speech early wednesday  bonds fell and stocks gained as investors placed tentative bets that trump s somewhat vague platform of economic stimulus would translate into corporate profits and higher inflation  the stakes are high  with a republican controlled house and senate  trump has the opportunity to use his time in office to radically reshape the american economy   he has pledged dramatic tax cuts  infrastructure spending and economic deregulation  and wants to repeal obamacare  these measures he says will turbo charge growth and help boost the wages of those who have lost out in a globalized world where  middle class  jobs have been squeezed  with the u s  budget deficit at just   percent of gross domestic product  compared with   percent in   and near record low interest rates  trump has room to undertake a large scale fiscal boost  at least in the short term   his restrained acceptance speech hinted that infrastructure was a priority  trump said he would  rebuild our highways  bridges  tunnels  airports  schools  hospitals  and  our infrastructure  which will become  by the way  second to none   on the campaign trail  trump s speeches were full of superlatives and unfinished thoughts that only complicated matters for traders and economic policy watchers  these enthymemes are a rhetorical device at the heart of a persuasive speaking style that has helped catapult the billionaire to the white house  trying to parse his words is one thing  actually putting money to work quickly base on them brings far more risk than usual  according to brian shapiro  ceo of spag funds  a small global macro hedge fund manager based in new york    i won t react to it  but the world will   he said   i think people will have a heart attack if they react to every word   economic advisory firm fathom consulting dubbed the election outcome  trump lite   a world in which as president elect he would be unwilling or unable to enact some of his more extreme policies such as building a wall at the mexico border  mass deportations of immigrants and wide ranging protectionist measures   markets are waiting to see if we are going to have the campaign trump who spoke in rhetoric  or trump the president who is going to be more pragmatic in his approach   said komal sri kumar  president of sri kumar global strategies  economists and fund managers  as well as the fed s policymakers  are looking to see which issues trump will prioritize  so far  indications are he would pursue tax cuts  additional military spending  and revamping president barack obama s affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  chicago fed president charles evans  speaking to reporters as americans voted on tuesday  said he would try to figure out whether or not the new president s fiscal policies  would be more simulative  about the same  or worse   adding the level of market volatility would provide a clue   trump has no defined economic team  it is unclear whether he will follow the lead of say peter navarro  a professor at the university of california at irvine  whose studies suggest a tougher trade stance against china  or whether he could cleave to wall street allies such as former goldman sachs alumnus steven mnuchin  who has been mooted by trump as a potential treasury secretary   trump s fiscal plan as it stands is pretty vague and it doesn t add up   said paul ashworth  toronto based chief u s  economist at capital economics   we expect some fiscal plan that will pursue the republican agenda  but it s likely to be much smaller in scale than the one originally envisaged by trump    while these policy questions are expected to persist even after trump succeeds obama in january   the nature of the trump cabinet appointments and the tone of their confirmation hearings will either ease or amplify the uncertainty premium in the markets   wrote steven ricchiuto  u s  chief economist at mizuho    beyond navarro and mnuchin  all eyes will be on whether many of the conservative economists  like columbia university business school dean glenn hubbard  who abandoned trump during a divisive campaign could ultimately return as advisors   yet the reality tv host turned president elect has struggled in the past to maintain the measured tone shown in his victory speech  during his campaign  for example  trump appeared to suggest the united states could renegotiate its debts to obtain a better deal  a comment he quickly rowed back upon   his past criticisms of yellen as someone who should be  ashamed  of her policy actions  and comments that she was keeping interest rates low for political reasons  could roil markets if repeated during his wait to take office in january    he has managed to keep it under control some of the time   meltzer said   whether he will be able to do that as president will very much determine whether he is successful
