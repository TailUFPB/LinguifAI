cincinnati  reuters    democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  speaking to a u s  veterans group on wednesday  made an open appeal to republican and independent voters concerned about rival donald trump s national security credentials and his fitness for office   this election shouldn t be about ideology  it s not just about differences over policy   clinton told an american legion convention in cincinnati   it truly is about who has the experience and the temperament to serve as president and commander in chief   clinton  a former secretary of state and former u s  senator  at times sounded like the republican candidates trump defeated to win his party s presidential nomination  she highlighted the united states  role as a global superpower and celebrated  american exceptionalism   a term frequently used by conservatives in a foreign policy context   when we say america is exceptional     it means that we recognize america s unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress   clinton told the veterans   when america fails to lead  we leave a vacuum   she harshly rebuked trump  accusing him of advocating a retreat from global affairs and suggesting that his calls for u s  forces to torture terror suspects and threaten their families would make the country less safe   the speech came on the same day that trump was slated to meet with mexico s president  enrique pena nieto  in mexico city in an attempt to bolster his own foreign policy profile before delivering a speech on immigration policy wednesday evening in arizona  in her speech  clinton cited the endorsements of dozens of members of the republican foreign policy establishment  on wednesday  she secured another one from james clad  a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under president george w  bush  in a comment that has sparked criticism from many republicans  trump has called the u s  led nato military alliance obsolete  although he has since pledged to work with nato to defeat islamic state  he has also vowed to build a wall along the u s  border with mexico and to make mexico pay for it  brian katulis  a national security analyst at the liberal center for american progress think tank in washington  said clinton s remarks were in line with  a bipartisan consensus about how we can best keep america safe and secure   trump  he said  stands outside that consensus   something the clinton campaign has attempted to exploit in courting republican voters concerned about his rhetoric and lack of government experience   john feehery  a republican strategist in washington  said clinton s approach could peel off some wavering voters  but could cost her support from liberals and others who are wary of overseas conflicts after protracted wars in afghanistan and iraq   it could lose her votes on the left from folks who are tired of us blundering into any more wars   he said   most voters think we should focus on the home front
