nuevo laredo  mexico  reuters    glafiro montemayor s scrubland near the u s  border may not look like much but within a few years he hopes to transform it by building a giant new bridge across the rio grande  setting his sights on billions of dollars in u s  mexico trade  hailing from a long line of mexican customs brokers  montemayor bristles at u s  republican candidate donald trump s promise to build a wall between the two countries and his threat to rip up the north american free trade agreement  nafta   a treaty that has been good to nuevo laredo  montemayor believes nuevo laredo s border bridges are near capacity and he wants to build another on his wiry  mesquite filled land that could eventually develop into a bi national free trade zone  luring investment and jobs   he  trump  wants to build walls  and the bilateral relationship requires that we build bridges   montemayor said in his air conditioned office  surrounded by hunting trophies  like montemayor  many in trade dependent nuevo laredo fear trump s proposed policies could threaten the city s economic future and they hope democratic candidate hillary clinton wins the nov   election  nonetheless  some fear clinton  who was first lady when her husband bill signed nafta in   may have absorbed some of the anti trade views espoused by trump and her democratic primary campaign rival bernie sanders during a bruising campaign   in particular  they fret about her public backtracking over the proposed trans pacific partnership  which is seen as a key driver of future growth for the city       trump calls nafta the worst trade deal ever signed by the united states  claiming mexico got all the benefits and it led to u s  firms shipping jobs south  he has vowed to renegotiate the treaty  or possibly even scrap it   over    billion in trade crosses the u s  mexico border each day and few places rely as heavily on that commerce as nuevo laredo  a feisty northeastern mexican border city full of factory workers and truckers  but also drug traffickers   every day  a  km    mile  line of trucks backs up into mexico  waiting to haul everything from tomatoes to fridge freezers across the world trade bridge into texas  car parts  agricultural products and plastics go the other way   at least  percent of bilateral commerce flows across that bridge and nearly  percent of mexico s value added tax  or about   billion  is collected from the   trucks that cross the frontier each day  the world trade bridge authority says   the bridge  it adds  is now the second most lucrative u s  port after the port of long beach in los angeles  on a visit to the bridge itself  it is easy to understand why mexican drug cartels have fought vicious battles to control the nuevo laredo crossing  turning the city into a hotbed of teenage gunslingers and nervy soldiers   of the   odd trucks that enter the united states each day  officials can only search   at most  drugs move north into the united states and guns and cash easily flow south  bootlegging has long been a way of life here  the former zetas cartel kingpin miguel trevino  aka z   was born in nuevo laredo  and edgar valdez  or la barbie  a one time associate of jailed capo joaquin  el chapo  guzman  is a native of laredo  just across the river in texas    those involved in legitimate cross border trade clam up when talk turns to drug smuggling  a scourge that trump has used to bash mexico  and prefer to talk about lawful commerce  since the september  attacks in   when the united states tightened its borders  nuevo laredo s business community learned the hard way that security was the primary concern for its northern neighbor   those days were terrible  the borders were almost closed   said carlos martinez  a customs broker  radio host and academic  but as a result of u s  security concerns  he said trade practices improved  with the development of efficient programs like the free and secure trade  fast  scheme which allows  trusted importers to transit quickly across the border  ever since  the trend along the border has been for greater integration and more streamlined borders  martinez said  for example  as of   the cross border xpress bridge allows travelers to cross seamlessly between tijuana airport and san diego  that same year  the first new rail bridge between mexico and the united states in over a century opened   so  regardless of campaign politics  some here believe clinton is more committed to free trade than she has shown publicly in this campaign and that even trump will need to protect bilateral trade if he wins  sean doherty  a  year u s  customs and border protection veteran  was involved in the development of the customs trade partnership against terrorism  c tpat   a supply chain program with over   companies enrolled that helps expedite secure cross border commerce   he said the program is one of many border schemes that both the u s  government and thousands of businesses had invested heavily in to create and run    i think  trump  would have a lot of push back or blowback if he tried to disband that type of a program   doherty said    a lot of his rhetoric is just that  rhetoric  and if he does happen to win  i think a lot of things that he s proposing   he ll come back down to earth   miguel conchas  president of the laredo chamber of commerce  is also dubious trump could fulfill all his campaign promises  nonetheless  he said the trump effect is already being felt across the river in texas  the real estate mogul s ascent has helped push the peso currency to record lows  hurting laredo s retail and banking businesses which rely on mexican customers   alfredo espinoza  who runs the world trade bridge trust in nuevo laredo  is downcast about the election  and feels a more protectionist era is imminent    we don t think trump is going to win   he said  speaking in his office overlooking a seemingly endless line of trucks   nonetheless  hillary     won t open the u s  market  she will protect it  that scares us here in mexico
