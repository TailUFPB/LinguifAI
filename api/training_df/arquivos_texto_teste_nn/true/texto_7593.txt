huntington  wv  reuters    when carissa sellards talks to her west virginia university friends about post graduation plans  one dilemma keeps coming up   whether to stay in their home state or strike out for more promising opportunities elsewhere  if recent history holds  over half of them will either not find work or leave the state  contributing to a brain drain of young talent that is pushing the state to try to reinvent its economy and break with a coal industry in long term decline    companies don t come here to invest because they only associate us with coal   said sellards  a  year old sophomore who addressed the state legislature when she was in high school about the lack of opportunities for young people in a post coal economy  the often stark choices faced by sellards and other young  educated west virginians underline the challenges awaiting democratic candidate hillary clinton here and in other  rust belt  states if she wins the nov   election  as most polls suggest she will  west virginia is expected to vote decisively for republican donald trump  who has gained in recent polls and promises to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work by easing environmental restrictions and renegotiating trade deals to america s advantage  it is a message that has resonated with millions of older voters in other rust belt states facing declines in manufacturing jobs and feeling threatened by foreign competition      but it largely rings hollow for college educated millennials like sellards  who are seeking jobs in the service economy or technology sector  by contrast  clinton alienated swathes of west virginia voters by saying earlier this year that  we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business  in transitioning to cleaner energy  coal industry backers have long accused president barack obama of waging a  war on coal  by imposing tougher environmental standards  clinton later apologized for her comment  and has proposed a   billion plan to help revitalize coal communities  the plan promises to secure health benefits for former coal workers  invest in new infrastructure such as broadband access  and repurpose old mines and power plant sites  clinton energy adviser trevor houser has said her challenge will be to help coal and other rust belt communities deal with economic realities rather than  false promises  of restoring dying industries  beneath the nostalgic coal rhetoric  west virginia officials and grassroots groups have quietly started to focus on reversing the flight of college educated millennials to help drive an economic revival   of the   students who graduated from public higher education in west virginia in the last decade    were working in the state in   a work participation rate of   percent  according to a report released by west virginia university s bureau of business and economic research on monday   the state had the  biggest net outflow of college degree holders from    according to the most recent u s  census   one barrier to keeping graduates in state is a business start up rate that is the lowest in the country at   percent in   the most recent year of available data  a reuters analysis of national data shows a strong connection between migration patterns of college graduates and local start up rates  among the  states with start up rates below the  median of   percent   saw a net outflow of college grads between  and   the debate over west virginia s economic future comes as its coal production this year hit its lowest level since the    west virginia s energy sector  which includes coal  natural gas production and utilities  account for  percent of the state s gdp but only  percent of employment  coal industry employment plunged  percent between the fourth quarter of  and the second quarter of   down from nearly   to just over     the government is the state s biggest employer  accounting for  percent of jobs  with healthcare a fast growing sector at  percent  in   west virginia s real gdp grew   percent from the previous year compared to the national average of   percent   the state is one of a few whose population shrank over the past two years  according to the latest national census  by median age it is the second oldest u s  state  four years above the national average      at the west virginia university institute of technology s new campus in beckley  which opened in august  close to some of the state s coal counties  officials hope to turn the struggling city into an innovation hub  in addition to offering courses in burgeoning fields like computer science  sustainable tourism and health care  wvu tech hosts the launch lab  a small business incubator that helps budding entrepreneurs bring ideas to fruition  joe carlucci  a small business coach and director of the launchlab  said west virginia is at the start of a long process of reinvention after decades of mourning coal   they are prepared to plant that seed and not see the shade of that tree   he said   they are seeing that we have to change our own story   although clinton would struggle to regain popularity in rust belt states if elected  these regions would have an incentive to work with her administration to tap into federal grants  west virginia republican congressman evan jenkins  a member of the house appropriations committee who represents the state s southern coal producing regions  said the state cannot turn down assistance to diversify its economy   i want to continue fueling grant making opportunities to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and energy of the state s millennials   he told reuters at a ceremony in august in which federal grants were awarded  but unleashing that spirit will require a significant investment in infrastructure  specifically broadband access  something that local lawmakers ignored when coal was still performing well eight years ago  said chris walters  a  year old republican state senator    walters is focused on getting legislation passed to expand broadband access throughout the mountainous state  which ranks near the bottom of the list of broadband connectivity  just ahead of guam and puerto rico   if we don t give connectivity to our residents  we aren t giving them the opportunity to succeed in the global economy   said walters  in state capital charleston  ngo generation west virginia has helped pass legislation to attract young entrepreneurs seeking low cost alternatives to places like denver or san francisco  including a bill to waive business start up fees to people under  and another to allow crowd funding to help seed new businesses  entrepreneurship also extends to industries like agriculture  which state officials see as an opportunity in the state s rural coal counties  an entrepreneurship program called the coalfield development corporation won a   million grant this year to help train young people from coal counties to run businesses  offering them college classes  life skills and paid apprenticeships  ben gilmer  the  year old director of the corporation s agriculture entrepreneurship program refresh appalachia  said part of clinton s challenge in coal country will be to sell the vision of a future that is unfamiliar  small programs like his can offer concrete examples and help ease the transition  he said   politicians take advantage of people s fear of what comes next   gilmer said   but five years from now  we will have examples and that will speak louder than any rhetoric that s out there
