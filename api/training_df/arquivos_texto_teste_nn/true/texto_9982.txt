washington  reuters    chuck grassley and merrick garland go way back  but when the republican senate judiciary committee chairman and president barack obama s u s  supreme court nominee meet for a private breakfast on tuesday  they will not exactly be sharing fond memories  two decades ago  grassley  an iowa republican  spearheaded a fight against garland s nomination to the influential u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  just like now  a democratic president  in that case bill clinton  submitted garland s nomination to a republican controlled senate  garland  then a top justice department lawyer  was denied a senate confirmation vote in  and  despite earning bipartisan praise  finally  in   after clinton renominated garland upon winning re election in   was he confirmed to a seat on the court that was a launching pad to the supreme court for chief justice john roberts  justices ruth bader ginsburg and clarence thomas  as well as the late antonin scalia  fast forward to   another democratic president has chosen garland to replace scalia only to have grassley and a republican senate maneuver to block the nomination without so much as a judiciary committee hearing   nothin  against him   the  year old grassley  who describes himself as  just a farmer from butler county   told reuters  even so  garland    will sit down with grassley on tuesday and be told that once again  his nomination will be put on ice  in  and   garland was entangled in  what ended up being a   or  year crusade   grassley said  to reduce the number of judges on the federal appeals court that clinton chose him to join  two decades later  grassley again offered no criticism of garland s qualifications  grassley  like senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  has decided to ignore garland s nomination in the hope that a republican will be elected president on nov   and  after taking office in january  would choose a conservative rather than the centrist garland   it s not about him because we re living by the principle  let the people have a voice    grassley said  referring to the november presidential and congressional elections  grassley  no stranger to controversy during  years in the senate  has become the target of democrats  scorn in this supreme court drama  senate democratic leader harry reid said grassley could go down as both inept and the  most obstructionist  judiciary committee chairman in history  other voices have weighed in against grassley and his fellow republicans  with the des moines register newspaper in his home state calling the garland blockade  un american   grassley  facing re election in november  insists he will not buckle  and called the register s editorial  hyperbolic rhetoric   in a senate speech last week  he recounted showdowns dating back to the  when he took on a popular president from his own party  ronald reagan  over budget matters   i am no stranger to political pressure and to strong arm tactics   grassley said  grassley then turned his attention to roberts  criticizing a speech the chief justice made shortly before scalia s death about the politicization of the confirmation process and warning roberts  appointed by republican george w  bush  to keep his mouth shut in the garland fight   now that s a political temptation that the chief justice should resist   grassley said
