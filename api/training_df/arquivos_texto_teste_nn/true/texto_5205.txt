 reuters    u s  president donald trump will target a handful of obama era green regulations  including a federal coal mining ban and an initiative forcing states to cut carbon emissions  in an executive order as soon as next week  a white house official told reuters on wednesday  trump and his fellow republicans who control congress are seeking to unravel former democratic president barack obama s initiatives to combat global climate change  which they say are costly for u s  business and have hampered drilling and mining without providing any clear benefits   rescinding the federal coal leasing moratorium is part of that executive order  which has lots of different components  including the clean power plan   the white house official  who asked not to be named  told reuters  the official said the order was scheduled to come next week  the clean power plan is obama s centerpiece initiative to combat climate change  requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide  but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several republican states  legal experts have said trump could begin the process of killing the regulation by having the environmental protection agency ask the courts to return it to the agency for review  effectively ending its legal defense  killing the coal mining ban would be easier  trump could reverse the ban by asking the department of interior to lift it and resume its coal leasing program  obama s administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in january  as part of a broad environmental and economic review of the program aimed at ensuring lease deals account for coal s contribution to global climate change and yield fair returns to taxpayers  but it angered some western state lawmakers and people in the mining industry  who said it stymied development  trump has already rolled back some obama era green regulations  including the stream protection rule limiting coal mining waste dumping  and the waters of the u s  rule that expands the waterways under federal protection   this version of the story was refiled to fix punctuation in paragraph one
