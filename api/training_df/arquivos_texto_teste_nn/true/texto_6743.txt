washington  reuters    president elect donald trump is stacking his trade transition team with veterans of the u s  steel industry s battles with china  signaling a potentially more aggressive approach to u s  complaints of unfair chinese subsidies for its exports and barriers to imports  led by wilbur ross  a billionaire steel investor and trump s nominee for commerce secretary  dan dimicco  the former ceo of steelmaker nucor corp  and three veteran steel trade lawyers  the team is expected to help shift the u s  trade focus more heavily toward enforcement actions aimed at bringing down a chronic u s  trade deficit  washington trade experts said      based on their past efforts  this could include more challenges to china s trade practices through the world trade organization and more u s  government initiated anti dumping and anti subsidy cases against a wider range of chinese products  the latter would be argued before the u s  international trade commission   a forum where the steel industry has had considerable success  ross  dimicco and other leaders of big steel have been on the front line in u s  trade battles against the world s export superpower  hit by a flood of cheap imports from china and other countries  the u s  steel industry has brought  new cases in the past three years  seeking punitive duties from the commerce department to combat below cost dumping and unfair subsidies that slashed prices of various steel products to historic lows last year  causing layoffs at u s  steel mills   see graphic tmsnrt rs   some of these cases have resulted in massive penalties against chinese imports  including duties of more than  percent on chinese cold rolled steel used in autos and appliances     lawyers robert lighthizer and jeffrey gerrish have represented united states steel and stephen vaughn has represented ak steel in these cases  the three are also part of trump s trade team  lighthizer  gerrish  vaughn  ross and dimicco either declined to comment for this story or did not respond to reuters  requests for interviews  trade experts familiar with their views and their history of confrontation with china  however  say they will not be afraid to push the limits of what is legal under world trade organization rules in defense of u s  trade interests    lighthizer  who along with dimicco is considered a strong candidate to be the new u s  trade representative  is known for his work during the reagan administration pressuring japan into voluntary export restraints    bob lighthizer is very smart  very strategic and totally fearless   said a washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades and asked not to be named because trump s ustr selection process was still under way   if he s in charge you can expect him to use every tool available to create leverage to get china and anyone else to stop the cheating  he is no fan of the wto   lighthizer told a congressional panel in  that the wto s dispute resolution system was ineffective and that the united states  should consider aggressive interpretations of wto provisions that might help us deal with chinese mercantilism   such tactics could include imposing temporary import quotas and surcharges and factoring in the effect of currency manipulation into u s  anti dumping duties  he said  ross  who advised trump s presidential campaign on economic issues  has signaled he will use access to the lucrative u s  consumer market as leverage to negotiate better trade terms  the united states is china s biggest export market  during his presidential campaign  trump vowed to levy a punitive  percent tariff on chinese goods and label beijing a currency manipulator  it is not clear though whether he will follow through on those threats once he takes office  ross told cnn last week that trump will not be  willy nilly slapping a  percent tariff on everything   but will maintain the threat of tariffs as part of negotiations  in an emailed statement to reuters  ross said he would divest  all holdings and board seats that pose conflicts  but declined to answer other questions on his plans for trump s trade policy and engagement with china   the personal blog of dimicco  meanwhile  gives some indication of how he would approach china if he was named head of ustr  he has accused china of waging a  mercantilist trade war  on the united states for two decades  through currency manipulation  unfair subsidies and intellectual property theft  on the issue of currency manipulation  many economists disagree  saying beijing is no longer keeping its yuan artificially undervalued to make its exports cheap  citing the hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves it has spent to prop up the yuan s value this year  a key question for trump s trade team is how far they can push china to change its trade practices without provoking a trade war that will hurt both countries   if what they plan to do is get a little scratchier with china on enforcement within the existing wto rules  that s ok   said scott miller  a china trade expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington   but if they go outside those guardrails  it will be unpleasant because that will draw retaliation    he weiwen  vice president at the center for china and globalization  a government affiliated think tank in beijing  said any punitive action against china by the trump administration would invite a retaliatory response   we will certainly respond in the same way   he said  adding that washington and beijing  should find good solutions that are acceptable to both and not go to extremes  it will hurt both   chinese state media have warned that any new tariffs imposed by trump would lead to retaliation against boeing aircraft  apple iphones and u s  corn and soybeans
