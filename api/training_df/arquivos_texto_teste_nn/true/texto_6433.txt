washington  reuters    president elect donald trump is finding himself caught between his desire to improve relations with russia and fellow republicans who are pushing for a harsher response to what american spy agencies say was the kremlin s meddling in the u s  presidential election  the tacit acknowledgement on sunday by his incoming chief of staff  reince priebus  that russia was behind the hacking of democratic party organizations suggests that trump s maneuvering room could be shrinking  trump has long been dismissive of the u s  intelligence conclusion that russia was behind the election hacks  which russia has denied  or was trying to help him win the november ballot  saying the intrusions could have been carried out by china or a  pound hacker sitting on his bed  but following a report from u s  intelligence agencies last week blaming russian president vladimir putin  russia experts say trump will face growing calls for a stiff military  diplomatic  economic  and perhaps also covert response after his jan   inauguration    the new u s  administration will need to adopt a significantly tougher line   said nile gardiner of the heritage foundation  a conservative think tank in washington that is an influential voice in trump s transition team      republicans in congress wary of trump s push for detente with putin could pressure the new president to withhold the thing the russian leader wants most  a rapid easing of the economic sanctions imposed after russia s  annexation of ukraine s crimea and its support for separatists in eastern ukraine  the russia experts said  u s  intelligence agencies say that since the election  russian spies have turned to hacking other individuals and organizations  including prominent think tanks  in what analysts think is an effort to gain insights into future u s  policies  washington s brookings institution  which is headed by prominent russia expert strobe talbott   received a big wave of attacks the day after the election   but there is no reason to believe its systems have been compromised  said david nassar  the think tank s vice president for communications   republican senator lindsey graham said he and fellow republican john mccain  the chairman of the senate armed services committee  would introduce legislation with stronger sanctions than the ones now in place   we re going to introduce sanctions that     will hit them in the financial sector and the energy sector  where they re the weakest   graham told nbc television s meet the press  retired marine general james mattis  the nominee for secretary of defense who will face a senate confirmation hearing on thursday  is expected to advocate a stronger line against moscow than the one trump outlined during his election campaign that could put him at odds with trump s national security adviser  retired army lieutenant general michael flynn  who has had warmer relations with putin s government  and with rex tillerson  the nominee for secretary of state  who as ceo of exxonmobil had extensive business ties with russia  if mattis does push for a tougher approach to russia  that could empower u s  advocates for strengthening the american military presence in europe  that could include reinforcing u s  troops in the baltic states and poland  analysts say  nato already plans to deploy   additional troops  planes  tanks and artillery to the three former soviet republics in the baltics and poland this year   there is nervousness about trump among europeans at nato   said one european diplomat   any grand bargain with russia would fundamentally change nato s course and threaten europe with disunity   the diplomat said   but we don t expect that  nato is seeking to reassure baltic allies  and the united states is a big part of the deterrent    some advocates of a sterner response to the russian hacking say it should include cyber counterattacks  perhaps by leaking financial information embarrassing to some of putin s aides and close associates  so far  the obama administration has refrained from such action  at least publicly  for fear that it could lead to an escalating cyberwar that could threaten critical infrastructure such as financial transactions and energy transmission  although trump has said the nation needed to  move on to bigger and better things  following the u s  disclosure of alleged russian hacking  it appears that republican and democratic lawmakers are unlikely to drop the issue anytime soon  mccain told nbc he wanted to create a select committee to investigate the russian hacking  if he can convince the republican controlled senate s leaders to charge their minds   in the meantime  he said  key senate committees  including armed services and intelligence  will investigate  experts say the close scrutiny of russia s actions will come just as trump s administration starts to craft a comprehensive strategy on the former cold war foe  it is likely to be weeks or longer before a clear sense of trump s actual russia strategy comes into view   until there s a team in place  until there s a little more organization   i tend to think we re not going to have clear answers   said heather conley  a former deputy assistant secretary of state for europe now at the center for strategic and international studies
