new york  reuters    would donald trump really consider not paying portions of the u s  debt  the prospect riled economists on friday as stories in the new york times and the conservative website the blaze cast fresh scrutiny on comments trump made a day earlier  responding to a question about the national debt  the likely republican presidential nominee said in an interview on cnbc on thursday he would  borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal    when asked if that meant he had taken a page from his own playbook as a businessman and try to get u s  creditors to accept less than the full value of the bonds they hold  he said  no   but added   i could see long term renegotiations where we borrow long term at very low rates   the reaction to his words on friday offered the first time political candidate a taste of how delicate the prospect of discussing economic and fiscal policy can be  it also highlighted a danger for trump as his campaign moves from a crowded  personality fueled contest for the republican nomination to a general election competition where the media and members of the public expect more policy details from the candidates   such remarks by a major presidential candidate have no modern precedent   the new york times wrote in a story saying trump s plan implied he would  negotiate a partial repayment  of u s  debt   it s beyond ludicrous and irresponsible unless you re  say  an emerging market country   wrote the u s  debt analyst david ader  the head of rates strategy at crt capital  in a note to clients early friday morning   a senior campaign adviser said trump had not meant to suggest he would demur on any u s  debt payments   mr  trump was clear in saying that he was not going to renegotiate u s  debt  despite being asked multiple times  and that he would not default on u s  debt  despite being asked multiple times   said the adviser  who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly   all he said is that he believes that long term low interest treasuries would be a better deal for the u s  taxpayer   still  four trump companies have been through bankruptcies in which his creditors were forced to accept far less than the more than   billion he owed them  and in the cnbc interview he spoke of loving to  play with  debt   the united states is nowhere near debt distress   said charles seville  an analyst at fitch ratings inc  who focuses on government debt  seville said if the u s  government were to choose not to repay creditors  it would  undermine faith in the united states s ability to borrow at low rates which is the underpinning of its high credit rating   adding   there s no quick way of reducing the debt burden  it s something that would be a product of fiscal consolidation or faster growth    moreover  given that u s  treasuries are viewed as the safest of safe securities globally  underpinning the dollar s status as the world s preferred reserve currency  any damage to that reputation would likely unleash far flung ructions in financial markets worldwide  the u s  government regularly issues treasury bills  notes and bonds maturing in a range of between four weeks and  years  currently  interest rates on u s  government debt are near historically low levels  meaning the government is able to borrow cheaply  the treasury department has been gradually moving more of its obligations into longer term debt to take advantage of the low rates
