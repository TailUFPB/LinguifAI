washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama called incoming philippines president rodrigo duterte on tuesday to congratulate him on his election win  stressing that their countries  alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law  the white house said  u s  officials have signaled that washington is ready to work with duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades  obama s deputy national security adviser  ben rhodes  told a washington seminar earlier on tuesday that the u s  administration was aware there was some  controversy  surrounding duterte and  statements that drew attention in the past   but he did not elaborate  obama offered his congratulations to duterte as the  presumptive president elect   he won the largest share of the votes in a may  presidential election  according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog  although the official result has yet to be confirmed  obama  highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance     and the longstanding ties between our two peoples  including our shared commitments to democracy  human rights  rule of law  and inclusive economic growth   the white house said  washington hoped  to build on progress made with the last administration  in the philippines  rhodes said   this is a new government and we ll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are   he said when asked about the election  adding that washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption  duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in davao city  and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president  he has denied ordering any of the killings  but has not condemned them  washington has steered clear of the controversy  however  which analysts say reflects the reality of u s  national security interests given china s increasingly assertive stance in asia and maritime disputes in the south china sea  duterte s vows to restore law and order resonated with voters  but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people  rhodes noted u s  support for manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with china in the south china sea through international arbitration  and a recent deal allowing a greater u s  military presence in the philippines    we believe that now as much as ever it s important that the u s  and philippines are seen working together   he said  the u s  stance on duterte could echo its approach toward india s prime minister narendra modi  at one point  modi was unable to obtain a u s  visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of gujarat when he was chief minister  but was later invited to the white house when he became prime minister
