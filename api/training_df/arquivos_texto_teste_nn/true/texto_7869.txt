washington  reuters    paul ryan  the top republican in the u s  congress  took the extraordinary step on monday of distancing himself from donald trump  stirring a backlash from some lawmakers and deepening a crisis over his party s struggling presidential nominee          in a conference call with congressional republicans  ryan all but conceded that democrat hillary clinton was likely to win the white house on nov   and said he would put his full energy into preserving republican majorities in congress so as not to give her a  blank check               ryan  the speaker of the house of representatives  said he would not defend trump or campaign for him after the uproar over the new york businessman s sexually aggressive comments that surfaced on friday      ryan s announcement added to the party s worst turmoil in decades and reinforced the growing sense of isolation around  trump  who has never previously run for public office  clinton has led trump in most national opinion polls for months and trump s poll numbers have begun to drop further since the emergence on friday of a video from  showing the former reality tv star bragging crudely about groping women and making unwanted sexual advances    trump hit back at ryan  the republican vice presidential candidate in   who has frequently been critical of him       paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget  jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee   trump wrote on twitter   ryan  who had expressed disgust over the tape and canceled a campaign event with trump over the weekend  did not completely cut ties to trump  the speaker went back on the republican conference call later to clarify he was not withdrawing his endorsement  many republican members of congress are concerned that trump s chaotic campaign could ruin their chances of holding their majorities in the house of representatives and senate in the november election and could inflict long term damage on the party   during a weekend dominated by criticism of trump over the lewd remarks  a string of members of congress  governors and other prominent republicans called on him to drop out of the race  house republicans gave ryan a rough ride on the call  according to some participants   there was an undeniable opposition to the speaker s tepid support of our nominee   said u s  representative scott desjarlais  a trump supporter  in a comment passed on by an aide   many other lawmakers  some of whom did not want to be named publicly criticizing the speaker  said members frequently told ryan on the call to stand by trump  nonetheless  nearly half of all  incumbent republican senators  congress members and governors have condemned trump s remarks  and roughly one in  has called on him to drop out of the race  according to a reuters review of official statements and local news coverage  republican national committee chairman reince priebus used an afternoon conference call with rnc members to emphasize there was no rift with trump and that the committee  the party s leadership and fundraising arm  still backed the nominee  two rnc members who spoke on condition of anonymity said   any suggestion that the rnc isn t fully supporting the trump pence ticket is wrong   one rnc member said  describing the message   we are fully on board  we are going to devote every ounce of effort and resource into helping the trump pence ticket win and all the other candidates up and down the ballot   any attempt to replace trump on the ballot this close to election day would face huge legal and logistical hurdles  a defiant trump went on the offensive in a vicious presidential debate on sunday  saying clinton  a former secretary of state would go to jail if he were president and attacking her husband  former president bill clinton  for his treatment of women  the debate  the second of three before the vote  was remarkable for the brutal nature of the exchanges between the two  trump stayed on the attack on monday  describing bill clinton as  a predator  and saying   if they want to release more tapes saying inappropriate things  we ll continue to talk about bill and hillary clinton doing inappropriate things  there are so many of them    she goes out and says   i love women  i m going to help women   she s a total hypocrite   he told supporters in ambridge  pennsylvania  clinton accused trump of brushing off criticism of his comments about women    on friday  the whole world heard him talking about the terrible way he treats women  and last night when he was pressed about how he behaves  he just doubled down on his excuse that it s just locker room banter   she told a rally at wayne state university in detroit   the television audience for the debate fell sharply from their first  record breaking encounter in september      nielsen data supplied by cnn for  broadcast and cable channels on monday showed that   million americans tuned into the  minute debate on sunday  well below the record  million that watched the first face off      an nbc news wall street journal opinion poll released on monday showed clinton increasing her lead  the survey  conducted after the video release but before the debate  showed clinton with  percent support among likely voters in a four way matchup including two minor party candidates  compared with  percent for trump      the reuters ipsos state of the nation project released on monday estimated that clinton had at least a  percent chance of winning the  electoral college votes needed to become president  the polling did not capture reaction to trump s performance in sunday s debate or the release of the friday videotape
