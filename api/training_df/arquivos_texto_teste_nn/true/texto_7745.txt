washington new york  reuters    republican donald trump could go down as the least well funded presidential candidate in recent campaigns   entering the final month of the election still without the cash to match the level of staff and advertising that has helped power the campaign of his democratic rival hillary clinton  with less than three weeks until the election  it is too late for trump to amass the amount of cash he would need to unleash a spending assault that might turn his hobbled campaign around  through the end of september  trump raised a total of   million   a far cry from clinton s   million  trump  a new york real estate developer who has boasted about his wealth  pledged to use millions of his personal assets to fund his campaign  in addition to the   million raised  he put in    million during the primary and then added another    million  trump s fundraising deficit has resulted from a series of campaign crises that made wealthy donors reluctant to contribute to his campaign and reflects that he does not enjoy working the fundraising circuit or calling large dollar donors to ask them to write checks  that s a big disadvantage for trump  and it shows in how he has been outspent trying to win the nov   election for the white house  particularly in the two largest spending categories  staff and television commercials  when it comes to staff  trump has spent   million  compared with clinton s spending of about   million   trump had  people on his payroll in september  more than doubling the  he had on staff in july  additionally  trump spent   million on field consultants  part time workers who are not part of the main staff  clinton had  people on her staff in september   on advertising  trump has spent    million while clinton has spent   million   allowing her to blanket the airwaves with a deluge of advertisements  it has also allowed clinton to inject more money into states that have become closer as election day nears  earlier this week  clinton s campaign announced it was spending an additional   million in arizona  a late game decision to try to win a traditionally republican state that now appears within her grasp  overall  trump has spent about   million by the end of september  compared with clinton s   million   trump and clinton can collect donations up to    from a single individual  but can also collect larger checks that are then divided between the campaign and joint fundraisers with the national and state parties   the funds that candidates raise for the national and state political parties are still used for the common effort of hiring staff and getting voters to turn out to the polls  but those funds cannot be used in the most direct parts of running a campaign  like buying television ads or hiring staff that report to the campaign manager  trump s campaign struggled to get organized and build out the infrastructure that is needed to be competitive in the key battleground states  instead  trump has been dependent on the infrastructure built by the republican party  trump has raised   million through joint fundraising committees with the national parties  of which he got   million   by comparison  clinton has raised   million through joint fundraisers  of which   million went to her campaign  since   major party presidential candidates have stopped accepting public funding for their general election campaigns   which placed limits on the amount a candidate could raise and spend  but even the last candidate to accept public funds  senator john mccain in   raised more that year than trump did this election  mccain raised more than   million  that same year  barack obama  in his first presidential race  raised   million  in   mitt romney raised more than   million at this point in the campaign  and obama had raised   million
