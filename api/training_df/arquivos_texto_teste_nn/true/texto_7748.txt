 reuters    republican donald trump had one last chance at a nationally televised debate to reach out to the undecided voters he badly needs to keep his presidential campaign viable   he passed on the opportunity  instead  he chose on wednesday to stay with the strategy he has employed during recent weeks  pump up his hard core supporters and hope that s enough to win   he suggested he might not accept the election result if his democratic opponent hillary clinton wins on nov    called her a  nasty woman   and repeated hard line conservative positions on issues such as abortion and immigration   while that kind of rhetoric was catnip to his passionate  anti establishment base  it is unlikely to have appealed to independent voters and women who have yet to choose a candidate   when you re trailing in the polls  you don t need a headline the next morning saying that you re not going to accept the election results   said ford o connell  a republican strategist who supports trump  with less than three weeks left in the race  trump is behind clinton in most battleground states and is underperforming in almost every demographic voter group compared to the republican nominee  mitt romney  four years ago  party strategists had said before the debate that he needed to use the event to draw in voters beyond his hard core supporters   trump didn t listen or perhaps didn t care  his debate was a continuation of his apparent strategy to ensure his most fervent supporters show up on election day  while betting that his attacks on clinton s character and truthfulness will discourage voting by already skeptical young and liberal democrats  but experts who study voter behavior warned that his attacks on clinton may backfire  saying he may instead awaken democratic voters who have so far been uninspired by clinton   the risk he faces by engaging in a scorched earth policy is that he activates people rather than turning them off   said michael mcdonald  who runs the u s  election project at the university of florida  mcdonald  who tracks early voting returns and absentee ballot requests  said he is seeing larger than expected surges of support for clinton in southeastern states such as virginia  north carolina  and florida  the reuters ipsos states of the nation project  which uses a massive online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all  states  estimates that clinton has a  percent chance of winning the election by about  votes in the electoral college if it were held today  it is against this backdrop that trump has apparently decided to double down on energizing his base rather than broadening it  but the poll results cast doubt on the wisdom of that strategy  if trump s core white  male  working class supporters vote at high rates  as expected  that likely won t be enough to win  trump  for example  already does well with white men who are at retirement age  nine out of  of them are already expected to vote  according to the polling results  so  there is little room to squeeze out more votes  voting rights activists have accused trump of trying to suppress voter turnout by claiming  without evidence  that the election has been rigged against him  he has also said his supporters need to monitor polling stations to ensure a fair vote  which the activists decry as an act of intimidation   should trump s comments succeed in discouraging some democratic voters from turning out  that may also not be enough to help him secure the white house  he still loses under what could be considered a dream scenario for the republican nominee  white men show up in greater numbers than expected  while turnout among racial minorities is lower than expected  in this scenario  the states of the nation project estimates that trump would win the battleground states of ohio and north carolina  and he would have a shot at winning pennsylvania  wisconsin and colorado  even then  clinton would still have an  percent chance of winning the election  there s yet another risk to trump s strategy  by claiming the election is rigged  he could be unintentionally signaling to his supporters that voting no longer matters  michael sopko    a mortgage broker from denver and a trump backer  said before the debate that he sees his vote as pointless   they have already been corrupted   he said of voting machines  speaking ahead of a trump rally in colorado springs   i think the results are already cast
