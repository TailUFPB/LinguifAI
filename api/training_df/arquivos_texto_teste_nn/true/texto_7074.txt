washington  reuters    by picking fellow republican south carolina governor nikki haley to serve as u s  ambassador to the united nations  u s  president elect donald trump s pick rounded out his early cabinet choices with his first woman and ethnic minority  but he also opted for a state politician with little experience in the federal government or international diplomacy who has been a sharp critic  backing two of his rivals and criticizing the harsh rhetoric of the presidential campaign  in tapping the popular governor of a state that supported him  trump s choice could signal an attempt to reach out to minorities in the wake of his nov   victory following a bitterly divisive campaign  his victory has sparked protests and concerns by those worried that his denunciation of immigrants  muslims and hispanics during the campaign could translate into policies eroding civil rights  trump said on wednesday that haley could bring people together and was  a proven dealmaker  who  will be a great leader representing us on the world stage   haley    represents what some republicans have said could be the new face of the republican party  a younger  more diverse generation of leaders who could help bolster conservatives as u s  demographics shift   the daughter of indian immigrants  she drew national attention in  when she led a push to remove the confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds in columbia after a white gunman killed nine people at a historic predominantly african american church in charleston  but haley  now serving her second four year term as governor  has little experience in foreign policy and the diplomatic issues likely to come before the united nations   in a statement on wednesday  she praised the state s residents for taking  a chance on a little known   year old  minority  female governor  when she took office six years ago     like trump  haley came to politics as an outsider  after years working in her family s gift shop in bamberg  a small town an hour south of the state capital  she ran for state representative in  and defeated a nearly  year incumbent  touting her fiscal conservatism while brushing off racial slurs  she won her gubernatorial bid in  on a platform of reform  receiving the endorsement of former alaska governor sarah palin  a former republican vice presidential nominee and darling of the party s tea party wing     still  haley has not hesitated to call out fellow republicans  including trump  in january  she offered the party s rebuttal to president barack obama s state of the union address  seizing the spotlight in what was seen as a strong rebuke of trump   haley called for tolerance and civility in her remarks  although she never mentioned trump by name  she urged americans not to   follow the siren call of the angriest voices   adding   no one who is willing to work hard  abide by our laws  and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country   but she told the federalist society recently that although she was not an early or vocal supporter of trump  she did vote for him and was  thrilled  that he won  born to sikh parents who emigrated to south carolina from india  she is no stranger to u s  racial and ethnic tensions   while trump won with the lowest minority vote in decades   haley has scolded republicans for not working harder to broaden their appeal beyond white americans   our approach often appears cold and unwelcoming to minorities  that s shameful and that has to change   she said in a  national press club speech   it s on us to communicate our positions in ways that wipe away the clutter of prejudices   although she worked to heal the racial tensions that exploded after the gun attack at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in   she has also been critical of the black lives matter movement that gained ground after a series of high profile shootings of unarmed african americans by police   some people think you have to yell and scream in order to make a difference  well  that s just not true   she told the national press club   when the sound is quieter  you can actually hear what someone else is saying and that can make a world of difference       on wednesday  haley said   when the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation  and to our nation s standing in the world  that is a calling that is important to heed   her international experience is largely centered on her efforts to draw foreign businesses to south carolina  including at least eight overseas trips  local media reported  one   a june  trip billed as an economic development mission to europe and the paris air show   cost the state    and drew criticism back home over its luxury accommodations and a hotel party  she said afterwards she did not know how much was spent and had learned a lesson  even as she pledged to keep up the sales pitches  the charleston post and courier reported at the time   there is a method to the madness   she said  according to the newspaper   i am selling the state the only way i know how   the post and courier said her trips included trade show visits and economic development meetings  including stops related to bmw  bmwg de  and volvo  volvb st   two automakers with facilities in south carolina  she has visited germany  sweden  britain  japan  canada and india  it reported  as governor  she has also been embroiled in the thorny issue of nuclear waste amid federal facilities in the state aimed at  storing and converting such materials  earlier this year  she fought to have some nuclear material from japan headed for south carolina moved to new mexico   critics will ask if nikki haley has been engaged in int l affairs  i ve had convos w her on   off over the years  she has a strong worldview   dan senor  a former adviser to  republican presidential nominee mitt romney  said on twitter
