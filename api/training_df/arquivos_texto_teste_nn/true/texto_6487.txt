 washington  reuters    the cia has identified russian officials who fed material hacked from the democratic national committee and party leaders to wikileaks at the direction of russian president vladimir putin through third parties  according to a new u s  intelligence report  senior u s  officials said on thursday   the officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said the central intelligence agency and others have concluded that the russian government escalated its efforts from discrediting the u s  election process to assisting president elect donald trump s campaign   the intelligence assessment was presented to president barack obama on thursday and will be briefed to trump on friday  trump has rejected the broad intelligence community s assessment that russia staged cyber attacks during the election campaign to undermine democratic rival hillary clinton   russia has rejected the hacking allegations   more from reuters  trump says u s  funds spent on border wall would be repaid by mexico  schumer emerges as trump s newest punching bag  beheading attire and sexy suicide vests  satire of isis wives stirs anger and praise  by october  it had become clear that the russians were trying to help the trump campaign   said one official familiar with the full report speaking on the condition of anonymity because the complete version is top secret   in some cases  one official said  the material followed what was called  a circuitous route  from the gru  russia s military intelligence agency  to wikileaks in an apparent attempt to make the origins of the material harder to trace  a common practice used by all intelligence agencies  including u s  ones   these handoffs  the officials said  enabled wikileaks founder julian assange to say the russian government or state agencies were not the source of the material published on his website   in an interview with fox news this week  assange said he did not receive emails stolen from the dnc and clinton aide john podesta from  a state party   assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party   details of the report emerged as the top u s  intelligence official  james clapper  said on thursday he was  even more resolute  in his belief that russia staged cyber attacks on democrats during the  election campaign   not all  intelligence agencies participated in preparing the assessment  an unclassified version of the report is expected to be released on friday morning  two officials said   the report contains some of what the officials called  minor footnotes  about open questions and other uncertainties  in part because some of the evidence supporting the conclusion is inferential   one such example  the officials said  was that intercepted messages and conversations among senior russian officials in putin s inner circle indicated they were aware of the hacking campaign and celebrated trump s election as a victorious end to the campaign   the officials declined to discuss the nature of the communications  including whether they were domestic  international  or both    people who knew what this was about were celebrating a victory over the united states   said one official   another example of inferential evidence  the officials said  was that as time passed and the early leaks attracted media attention that undermined or eclipsed clinton s campaign  the russians increasingly focused their hacking  almost exclusively  on democratic rather than republican targets   there was also strong resemblance   including the use of the same computer malware   the russians have used against targets in europe and the marriage of traditional espionage tactics used by soviet and russian intelligence such as bribery  blackmail and internet vulnerabilities  which they said putin has devoted increasing resources and attention to exploiting   for example  one official said  the democratic databases and email servers the russians hacked also contained personal information that wikileaks has not published   such information could be used to search for financial  medical  browsing history and other records that can be used to target individuals for recruiting efforts by russian spies
