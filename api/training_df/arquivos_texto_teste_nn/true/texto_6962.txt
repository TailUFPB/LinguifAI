brownsville  texas  reuters    the rust colored border security fence starts in a dusty field on the loop family farm in south texas   about  miles inland from the gulf of mexico and a mile north of the southern u s  border  from there  near brownsville  it stretches about  miles west  but with plenty of gaps to drive or walk through  where it exists  the fence doesn t always stop illegal immigrants   it takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall   said farmer ray loop  noting the muddy footprints on several sections of the fence crossing his property  the porous south texas border fence  authorized in   underscores how topography  treaty obligations  legal fights and high costs could frustrate efforts to stretch an  impenetrable  wall over the   mile border   the signature campaign promise of u s  president elect donald trump  the south texas barrier is  more holes than it is fence   said denise gilman  a law professor and director of the immigration clinic at the university of texas at austin  the gaps reflect local political opposition  land rights battles and strategic decisions about where a fence would be most cost effective  according to internal u s  government emails obtained by gilman through a court order and viewed by reuters  trump transition team spokesman jason miller declined to comment on the challenges of border wall construction  saying the president elect would have  plenty of time to discuss policy specifics  after he takes office in january  in an interview with cbs    minutes  last month  trump said for the first time that he would accept fencing in some areas of the border   but some areas  a wall is more appropriate   trump said   i m very good at this  it s called construction  there could be some fencing   loop    is a trump supporter who supports stricter immigration controls  but he has little faith in fences or walls   that is not going to work   loop said from his pickup last month as he passed border patrol cars on his property   there are places where it makes sense logistically  but all the way from texas to california  no   the rio grande valley in south texas has become a focal point for immigration enforcement because it has been a main artery for crossing  u s  customs and border protection said in a statement that fencing is part of an integrated strategy that includes agents on the ground  motion sensors  cameras and airborne monitoring  the washington based center for immigration studies  which supports strong border security  said trump should look beyond his proposed wall for a comprehensive policy   fencing can be very effective in making life difficult for those attempting to clandestinely cross our southern border  but it is not a one stop measure   said jon feere  legal policy analyst for the center  the secure fence act of   signed by republican president george w  bush  underestimated the cost of building a planned  miles of fencing at various places between california and texas  by the time democratic president barack obama declared construction essentially complete in   the allocated    billion had paid for fencing over only about half that distance  according to a u s  government accounting office report  obama voted for the border fence construction when he was a u s  senator  as did democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton   in south texas  original plans for two layers of reinforced fencing over about  miles between laredo and brownsville were scaled down to a gap toothed  single layer barrier of about a third that length  border terrain caused a host of land rights issues that added cost and time to the construction  about   miles of the u s  mexico border are in texas  along the meandering rio grande river  which makes it impossible to build a border wall on the actual border   the international boundary and water commission  set up between the two countries in   prevents any disruption to the flow of the rio grande  effectively requiring any wall to be built on levees in flood plains  that pushed the south texas fence up to two miles north into u s  territory   putting property on the mexico facing side of in into a kind of no man s land  and requiring the government to compensate owners for lost land value  loop s home  and almost all of his farm  are in u s  territory but on the mexico facing side of the fence  he settled the u s  government s eminent domain case on terms that were not disclosed   another eminent domain case filed by the u s  government stretched out for seven years and  court filings  as eloisa tamez fought attempts to put a few acres of family land   awarded in a grant from the king of spain in    on the mexico facing side of the wall  the government settled for an undisclosed sum and agreed to construct several access points in the fence on the property   another telling example of economic loss  the fort brown memorial golf course in brownsville  also behind the wall  closed in  after losing business from customers who mistakenly believed they had to leave the u s  to play a round  trump would have little trouble obtaining land through eminent domain to build a wall for national security purposes  legal experts said  but land owners may now have stronger claims for higher compensation because previous rounds of construction have established concrete examples of lost property value    some property rights and compensation cases filed in the bush years now may carry over into trump s term  legal experts said  trump s wall  if constructed  could bring a flood of new court challenges  they said    the court disputes are going to delay any building for months and years   said efren olivares  regional legal director with the south texas office of the nonprofit texas civil rights project  which has represented landowners in border fence disputes  local political and economic concerns also pose obstacles  one of the large gaps in the fence is just west of brownsville  near an affluent area where residents successfully fought off construction   the government avoided areas with higher land values  according to the internal emails from u s  customs and border protection    they will not build any fence in any area  urban  where real estate costs are too high   wrote jeffrey self  a customs and border protection divisional bureau chief  in a situational report in march   across the southwest border  apprehensions have shot up in recent months as trump made border security a central issue in the campaign  in the year through september  u s  authorities have apprehended   immigrants trying to cross  a jump of  percent from a year ago  according to customs and border protection data  in mccallen  about  miles west of brownsville  mayor jim darling said human traffickers are drumming up business by telling people to cross before the trump wall goes up   now we have a bigger immigration problem   said darling  who holds a nonpartisan office but endorsed republican texas governor greg abbott in his  campaign  if the current fencing in south texas is extended to the west  it would likely end up in rio grande city  where mayor joel villarreal  a political independent  sees it as a waste of government money and a potential windfall for mexican criminal cartels trafficking immigrants    they will have the means to take people across   he said in an interview   and people will have to pay their cut to those cartels
