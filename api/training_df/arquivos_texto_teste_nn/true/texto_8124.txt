lincoln park  ga   reuters    louis brooks    has walked to cast a vote at his neighborhood polling place in georgia s predominantly black lincoln park neighborhood for five decades  but not this year  brooks says he will not vote in the presidential election for the first time he can remember after local officials moved the polling station more than  miles   km  away as part of a plan to cut the number of voting sites in upson county   i can t get there  i can t drive  and it s too far to walk   said brooks  a black retired mill worker and long time democratic party supporter  he said he does not know how to vote by mail and doesn t know anyone who can give him a ride  a reuters survey found local governments in nearly a dozen  mostly republican dominated counties in georgia have adopted plans to reduce the number of voting stations  citing cost savings and efficiency  in seven of those counties  african americans  who traditionally back democrats  comprised at least a quarter of the population  and in several counties the changes will disproportionately affect black voters  at least three other counties in georgia dropped consolidation plans under public pressure  while polling place cutbacks are on the rise across the country  including in some democratic run areas  the south s history of racial discrimination has made the region a focus of concern for voting rights advocates  activists see the voting place reductions as another front in the fight over republican sponsored statewide voting laws such as stricter id requirements that disproportionately affect minority and poorer voters who tend to vote for the democratic party  several of these have recently been struck down by courts that ruled they were designed to hinder minority voting    there is a history in those states of using different strategies to cut voting in minority communities   said leah aden  senior counsel at the national association for the advancement of colored people legal defense and education fund   hogwash   said robert haney  chairman of the upson county board of elections  denying that race was a factor in his board s decision   nobody is trying to keep anybody from voting   said haney  adding that officials would send a ballot to the home of anyone who needed it  he said the cut in polling sites from nine to four was designed to increase efficiency by closing low turnout sites  saving about     the nov   election will be the first presidential contest since the supreme court ruled in  that georgia and all or parts of  other states with a history of racial discrimination no longer need federal approval for election law changes like polling place consolidations  since the court ruling  the reuters survey found  more than two dozen local governments in eight of those states have implemented new cuts in polling places  two thirds of those were met with public opposition  four of the states   arizona  georgia  florida and north carolina   could be election battlegrounds in the fight for the white house and control of the u s  senate   this is part of the story of voting in the south   said willie williams  a black small business owner from daphne  alabama  where polling stations were cut to two from five during last month s municipal elections over the objections of black voters  williams  who still keeps his father s receipt for his poll tax   the tax some blacks in the south had to pay to qualify to vote before civil rights laws in the  eliminated it   says the reduction was  just another tool in the tool kit for shaving off minority votes   daphne city officials denied any racial motivation  saying the changes were meant to improve safety and create better access and parking for voters  still  isela gutierrez  a research director at the liberal group democracy north carolina  says the effects of such cutbacks can be wide ranging   the elections boards aren t lying when they say some of these locations have low turnout and it makes better administrative sense to close them   but the impact can be disastrous   numerous academic studies have found people are less likely to vote the farther they must travel and the longer they must wait in line  which becomes more likely with fewer voting sites   some of these changes individually may affect only a small number of voters  but in the aggregate across the country it will be a very large number of voters   said danielle lang  voting rights counsel at the campaign legal center  a washington based voting rights and campaign finance group  the issue gained prominence in a march primary in arizona s maricopa county  where more than  percent of residents are hispanic  a decision to slash polling places left voters in lines for up to five hours  republican county officials said they misjudged turnout  georgia has been an epicenter for efforts to reduce polling places since the supreme court decision  and in that state  which has not backed a democrat in a presidential election since   polls show republican donald trump and hillary clinton in a close battle for the presidency that could be decided by turnout of minority voters   if you want to restrict voter turnout in minority and disadvantaged communities  a good way is to move a polling place somewhere they can t get to   said stacey abrams  democratic leader in the georgia state legislature  hans von spakovsky  a senior legal fellow at the conservative heritage foundation  said race was being unfairly inserted into the debate on polling place changes   it s election officials making adjustments based on the changing ways people are voting   he said      a reuters analysis  using voter registration lists for  and   found at least two georgia counties where the changes disproportionately affect blacks  a consolidation plan in macon bibb county closed six polling places in black majority neighborhoods  and only two in white majority areas  mcduffie county s decision to eliminate three polling places means two thirds of the county s black voters  and one third of its white voters  will now vote in one location  other changes have had little impact on minority voters  in georgia s lumpkin county  for example  where blacks are just  percent of the population  officials consolidated seven polling locations into one to make the county compliant with federal disability laws  voting rights groups in several states have tried to form patchwork networks to track the changes  which are not well publicized  and then fight back where necessary with threats of lawsuits  petition drives or complaints to federal officials  in upson county  haney said  the elections board dropped a proposal to close a polling site in heavily black salem  a sparsely populated rural area  after residents pointed out the hardship of traveling an extra  miles   km  or more  but the lincoln park site  which had just  voters cast a ballot in person on election day   was more easily combined with a polling place in the center of the nearby town of thomaston  he said  kay king  the only african american member of the elections board in upson county and the only one to vote against the voting site closures  said she knew it meant some lincoln park residents would not be able to vote   they walk to the store  they walk to church   when you don t have transportation to get to something like this  it makes you not want to do it  you just throw your hands up   she said
