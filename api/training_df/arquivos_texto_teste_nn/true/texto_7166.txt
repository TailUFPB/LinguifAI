washington  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump s plan to rapidly deport  to  million illegal immigrants with criminal records would further tax a system already stretched to its limits  current and former u s  immigration officials say  immigration courts  which issue deportation orders  set bond and grant or deny asylum  currently have a backlog of more than   cases   boosting staff could help address the problem but that could prove difficult  officials at the departments of justice and homeland security say they have had trouble quickly finding and vetting enough qualified candidates to fill all the positions for judges and immigration agents that congress has authorized   the executive office of immigration review  which adjudicates immigration cases  has so far been able to fill only  judge positions out of the  congress has authorized because the process is slow by necessity  candidates for the job  face a rigorous screening process comparable to that of the appointment of a u s  attorney   said spokeswoman kathryn mattingly   trump said last week after his election victory that once he takes office he will move to deport or incarcerate up to  million illegal immigrants who have criminal records      at u s  immigration and customs enforcement  a force of   agents responsible for arresting and deporting criminal migrants is already spread thin  while some agents could be redeployed to other areas  more agents would likely need to be hired if deportations were sharply escalated  said an immigration and customs enforcement official who asked not to named  the agency would probably need to add detention space as well  the official added   more apprehensions of migrants could also strain the border patrol  which has struggled to fill open positions  congress has mandated a force of more than   border agents  but it currently stands at just over    former u s  border patrol chief mike fisher said the agency ran into problems a decade ago after congress asked it to double the number of border patrol agents from   to   between  and   the push to hire quickly helped fuel corruption  a march  report by the department of homeland security s independent advisory council found    the report concluded that the rapid hiring was exploited by mexican drug gangs  which sent in cartel friendly applicants for the patrol jobs  once hired  they then facilitated drug smuggling across the u s  mexico border  the agency began using polygraph tests in  to weed out applicants with criminal histories or ties to cartels  fisher said the testing made it harder to find qualified candidates  estimating that by the time he left in   the border patrol made one hire out of every  applicants   i can t imagine if they said  double it  now   fisher said   trump could try to change laws and procedures to expedite deportation processes  which could reduce the need for additional personnel   on friday  trump tapped republican senator jeff sessions to be attorney general  sessions has supported trump s plan to build a wall on the u s  border with mexico and undo obama s executive actions on immigration   during president barack obama s time in office  the united states has deported about   million illegal immigrants  more than under any other president
