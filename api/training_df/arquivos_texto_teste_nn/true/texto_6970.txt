washington  reuters    a last ditch effort in the senate to block or delay rule changes that would expand the u s  government s hacking powers failed wednesday  despite concerns the changes would jeopardize the privacy rights of innocent americans and risk possible abuse by the incoming administration of president elect donald trump  democratic senator ron wyden attempted three times to delay the changes  which will take effect on thursday and allow u s  judges will be able to issue search warrants that give the fbi the authority to remotely access computers in any jurisdiction  potentially even overseas  his efforts were blocked by senator john cornyn of texas  the senate s second ranking republican  the changes will allow judges to issue warrants in cases when a suspect uses anonymizing technology to conceal the location of his or her computer or for an investigation into a network of hacked or infected computers  such as a botnet  magistrate judges can currently only order searches within the jurisdiction of their court  which is typically limited to a few counties  in a speech from the senate floor  wyden said that the changes to rule  of the federal rules of criminal procedure amounted to  one of the biggest mistakes in surveillance policy in years   the government will have  unprecedented authority to hack into americans  personal phones  computers and other devices   wyden said  he added that such authority  which was approved by the supreme court in a private vote earlier this year  but was not subject to congressional approval  was especially troubling in the hands of an administration of president elect trump  a republican who has  openly said he wants the power to hack his political opponents the same way russia does   democratic senator chris coons of delaware and republican senator steve daines of montana also delivered speeches voicing opposition to the rule changes  the u s  justice department has pushed for the changes to the federal rules of criminal procedure for years  arguing they are procedural in nature and the criminal code needed to be modernized for the digital age  in an effort to address concerns  u s  assistant attorney general leslie caldwell wrote a blog post this week arguing that the benefits given to authorities from the rule changes outweighed any potential for  unintended harm    the possibility of such harm must be balanced against the very real and ongoing harms perpetrated by criminals   such as hackers  who continue to harm the security and invade the privacy of americans through an ongoing botnet  or pedophiles who openly and brazenly discuss their plans to sexually assault children   caldwell wrote  a handful of judges in recent months had dismissed evidence brought as part of a sweeping fbi child pornography sting  saying the search warrants used to hack suspects  computers exceeded their jurisdiction  the new rules are expected to make such searches generally valid  blocking the changes would have required legislation to pass both houses of congress  then be signed into law by the president
