washington beijing  reuters    the white house said on monday it had sought to reassure china after president elect donald trump s phone call with taiwan s leader last week  which the obama administration warned could undermine progress in relations with beijing  the statement from a spokesman for u s  president barack obama highlighted concerns about the potential fallout from trump s unusual call with taiwan president tsai ing wen on friday  which prompted a diplomatic protest from beijing on saturday  white house spokesman josh earnest said senior national security council officials spoke twice with chinese officials over the weekend to reassure them of washington s commitment to the  one china  policy and to  reiterate and clarify the continued commitment of the united states to our longstanding china policy   the policy has been in place for  years and is focused on promoting and preserving peace and stability in the strait separating china and taiwan  which is in u s  interests  earnest said    if the president elect s team has a different aim  i ll leave it to them to describe   he said   the chinese government in beijing placed an enormous priority on this situation  and it s a sensitive matter  some of the progress that we have made in our relationship with china could be undermined by this issue flaring up   he said  the call with taipei was the first by a u s  president elect or president with a taiwan leader since president jimmy carter switched diplomatic recognition to china from taiwan in   acknowledging taiwan as part of  one china   china regards taiwan as a renegade province  despite tensions over matters ranging from trade to china s pursuit of territorial claims in the south china sea  the obama administration has highlighted cooperation on global issues  such as climate change and iran s and north korea s nuclear programs  earlier on monday  china s foreign ministry said trump was clear about china s position on the taiwan issue and that china had maintained contacts with his team  vice president elect mike pence sought to play down the telephone conversation  saying on sunday it was a  courtesy  call  not intended to show a shift in u s  policy on china  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  who has been mentioned as a possible secretary of state in the trump administration  said on monday he thought reaction to the taiwan call was being overblown   he got a call  he took it  and again  he s getting calls from everyone  so i think probably a lot more is being read into it than is the case  really   corker said  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang would not say directly whom china had lodged  stern representations  with about trump s call  repeating a weekend statement it had gone to the  relevant side  in the united states   the whole world knows about the chinese government s position on the taiwan issue  i think president elect trump and his team are also clear   lu told a daily news briefing   in fact  china has maintained contacts and communication with the team of president elect trump   he added  repeating a previous assertion  although he did not give details  lu also said he would not speculate on what prompted the call  but described the matter of taiwan as the most important and sensitive question between china and the united states   former u s  secretary of state henry kissinger  who was white house national security adviser when president richard nixon made his historic visit to china in   told a forum in new york on u s  china relations that he had been  very impressed at the calm reaction of the chinese leadership  to trump s call  kissinger  who met with trump last month  said it suggested beijing may be looking to develop a  calm dialogue  with the new u s  administration  trump  who vowed during his campaign to label china a currency manipulator  issued more tough rhetoric on sunday   did china ask us if it was ok to devalue their currency  making it hard for our companies to compete   heavily tax our products going into their country  the u s  doesn t tax them  or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the south china sea  i don t think so   trump said on twitter  china is not currently viewed as a currency manipulator by either the treasury department or the international monetary fund  the world trade organization says chinese tariffs on imported goods are generally higher than u s  tariffs  china  taiwan  the philippines  vietnam  malaysia and brunei claim parts or all of the energy rich south china sea  through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually  lu would not be drawn on directly commenting on trump s tweets but defended the china u s  relationship   the china u s  economic and trade relationship has over many years always been a highly mutually beneficial one  otherwise it couldn t have developed the way it has today   he said  the diplomatic contretemps was one of several recently for the republican president elect  a real estate magnate who has never held public office and has no foreign affairs or military experience   trump  who takes office on jan    is still considering his choice for secretary of state  the global times  an influential tabloid published by the ruling communist party s official people s daily  said in an editorial on tuesday that china would have to meet trump s  reckless remarks  head on   trump s china bashing tweet is just a cover for his real intent  which is to treat china as a fat lamb and cut a piece of meat off it   the paper said
