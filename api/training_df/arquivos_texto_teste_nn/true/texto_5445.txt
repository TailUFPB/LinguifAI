washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump supports the goal of peace between israel and the palestinians  even if it does not involve the two state solution  a senior white house official said on tuesday  speaking a day before trump holds a white house meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  the official said peace was the ultimate goal    whether that comes in the form of a two state solution if that s what the parties want  or something else   the official said  adding that trump would not try to  dictate  a solution  failure by a u s  president to explicitly back a two state solution would upend decades of u s  policy embraced by republican and democratic administrations  it has long been the bedrock u s  position for resolving the long running israeli palestinian conflict and has been at the core of international peace efforts  any sign of a softening of u s  support for eventual palestinian statehood could also anger the muslim world  including sunni arab allies  which the trump administration needs in the fight against islamic state and to back efforts against shi ite iran  trump considers middle east peace a  high priority   the white house official said  the president has given his son in law  jared kushner  the job of negotiating a peace deal   we would want to work on it very quickly   the official said  trump s choice for u s  ambassador to israel  david friedman  who has not yet been confirmed by the senate  will not be involved in the president s discussions with netanyahu on wednesday  the official said  friedman advocates settlement building and has questioned the two state solution   the white house said earlier this month that israel s building of new settlements or expansion of existing ones in occupied territories may not be helpful in achieving peace  the statement was a shift in tone for trump  who signaled during the campaign that he could be more accommodating toward settlement projects than his predecessor  barack obama
