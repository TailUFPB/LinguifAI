washington new york  reuters    the mass shooting in orlando  florida has allowed donald trump to seize upon a familiar issue he has used to great advantage  the threat of islamist militants and his plan to limit muslim immigration to the united states  offering him what could be a crucial moment to re boot his sputtering presidential campaign   but while rank and file voters might respond positively to trump s renewed call for a ban on some muslims entering the country  his reaction to the massacre showed few initial signs of winning over republican foreign policy figures who have spurned the new york mogul   it s a missed opportunity to present a different image   said peter feaver  a top national security council aide in the george w  bush white house   he has doubled down on policies i oppose and that aren t going to solve the problem   trump said in a speech monday in new hampshire he would suspend immigration from countries  where there is a proven history of terrorism  against the united states  he said radical muslim immigrants were  trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis  islamic state  is   after the worst mass murder in modern u s  history on sunday left  dead  trump s speech was hastily refashioned from a broad critique of democratic rival hillary clinton to a dire warning of the threat from islamist militants  although islamic state has claimed responsibility for the attack  u s  officials have maintained that omar mateen s motives were unclear and that he had no known direct links with the syria based group  mateen  they said  was likely radicalized over the internet  a week ago  the presumptive republican presidential nominee s bid was taking on water  he was being battered by fellow republicans for his comments about the hispanic heritage of a federal judge  and clinton was pulling away in the polls  a renewed focus on national security could provide trump with the chance to expand his appeal both to undecided voters and to the republican foreign policy establishment  while trump at times seems to relish being at odds with the establishment  the unhappiness among the party s hawks isn t just a matter of hand wringing  it means if trump does reach the white house  he could have a difficult time recruiting talented  experienced advisers   max boot  an influential conservative at the council on foreign relations  said the orlando tragedy  could have provided an opening for trump to rally republicans against terrorism   but instead  boot said  trump has been  partisan and petty   boot criticized trump for suggesting on monday that president barack obama may sympathize with radicalized muslims and for reviving the proposed muslim ban   his performance has been in character   boot said   which is to say appalling   trump has alarmed some mainstream republicans with vows to shred international trade deals  his demands that mexico pay for a border wall and his questioning of u s  foreign policy pillars such as its security commitments to nato and asian allies   clinton struck a very different tone in a speech on monday  urging  statesmanship  not partisanship  and  clear  rational discussion  on how to protect the united states from terrorist threats  eliot cohen  a top ranking state department official during the bush administration  called trump s reaction to the shootings  opportunistic and shallow  and  not what americans expect from a president     lanhee chen  a top aide to mitt romney during his  presidential campaign  suggested trump will not be able to refine his image   while it would be true in most cases a big speech like this could reset the decks  i think the challenge with donald trump is always who he is at his core   chen said  but voters are another matter  trump s swift rise within the republican party was at least partly due to the strident tone he has taken toward immigrants and refugees  when trump responded to last year s terror attacks in paris and california with a call for banning muslims from entering the country  he surged in the reuters ipsos poll in the weeks that followed  opening up a  point lead over his republican primary rivals   republicans continue to be strongly supportive of trump s approach to handling terrorism  this month  two thirds of republicans said they agreed with trump s proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country   overall   percent of americans said they agreed with a muslim ban while  percent said they disagreed  with another  percent not sure  according to another reuters ipsos poll from may  to june   the poll of more than   people has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of about   percentage points  combating islamist extremism was on the mind of texas billionaire doug deason  a major republican donor who told reuters he will meet with trump later in the week to discuss his support   nothing trump has said since the orlando shooting has caused him to re think backing him  deason said   peter king  a u s  congressman from new york  said his party s foreign policy establishment will eventually have to get on board with trump   as one of the two major candidates for president  he will have to get advice or consultation with top national security people   king said
