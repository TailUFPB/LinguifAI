san francisco washington  reuters    donald trump s rise to de facto republican nominee for president poses an unusually high level of uncertainty for investors and businesses  potentially weighing on the economy and the federal reserve s plan to raise interest rates this year  uncertainty is always present in elections and the fed has hiked rates during past campaign seasons   graphic  tmsnrt rs   but the possibility of the firebrand new york real estate mogul occupying the white house presents a step up in risk because of the unconventional policies he has proposed and a lack of detail on how they will be achieved  economists say  promising to  make america great again   trump has raised fears of a trade war by saying he would slap steep tariffs on chinese and mexican imports  he has also vowed to deport all  million undocumented migrants in the united states  and suggested  though later retracted  a partial default on u s  debt  fed officials say they avoid discussion of domestic politics at rate setting meetings  transcripts from previous election year policy discussions show that political uncertainty is a factor in their thinking  though there is no clear pattern of a loosening or tightening bias in the run up to elections  in recent comments  some fed officials have acknowledged that campaign rhetoric could spill over into the economy   if consumers  because of political rhetoric  are slowing their spending or just pausing a little bit  or capex is slowing down   that i ve got to take into account   dallas fed president robert kaplan told reuters last thursday   asked his view of trump s policy proposals  he said   if i have one  you ll never know what that is  i will never allow that to seep into my work    atlanta fed president dennis lockhart said that it was fair to say the election  could be a factor in this year s economy   the fed kept rates on hold at     percent last month and signaled it was in no rush to raise them again soon  citing slowing economic activity despite an improved labor market  fed policymakers in march forecast two rate hikes this year after raising them last december for the first time in nearly a decade  a reuters poll of economists released on thursday showed they have pushed back their expectations for the fed to raise interest rates again to september from june  fed chair janet yellen and other fed policymakers have often cited uncertainty over the economic  financial and policy outlook as a factor in their interest rate decisions  the vix measure of stock market volatility is one approach to measuring uncertainty  querying influential business owners is another  the exact mix of measures the fed uses is not known  stanford university professor nick bloom s economic policy uncertainty index  which he presented to yellen and economists at recently as april last year  is another approach that the fed considers  the index analyzes newspaper coverage of policy related economic uncertainty and divergence between economic forecasters  predictions on the u s  outlook among other factors     when uncertainty is high  firms put on pause hiring and investment decisions   bloom said in an interview   if trump looks like a serious contender and is still making  mexican wall  and  trade rape  comments we will have the mother of all policy uncertainty spikes running up to the election    trump has said he would build a wall on the mexico u s  border and accused china of  raping  the u s  with unfair trade policies   a rise in the index  bloom said  would foreshadow declines in production  investment  and employment   policymakers pay close attention to financial market volatility as well as economic data  the fed delayed an expected hike last september after china s sharp economic slowdown caused stock market drops and a tightening in financial conditions  a strong trump candidacy could similarly upset markets  economists say  a reuters ipsos poll released on wednesday showed trump running nearly even with democrat hillary clinton among likely u s  voters  a dramatic turnaround since he became his party s presumptive nominee  traders see a   percent chance of a republican taking the presidency  according to futures prices on the iowa electronic market    if trump gains in the polls and the market reacts poorly  that  market turmoil  would be a good argument for the fed to stay on hold   said cornerstone macro economist roberto perli  a former fed board staffer  china and mexico are the second and third largest trading partners of the united states  respectively   the trade stuff is anti growth and harmful to the u s  outlook   said douglas holtz eakin  president of conservative think tank the american action forum and a former director of the congressional budget office   he s an utterly unpredictable political element at this point   added holtz eakin  who was also chief economic policy adviser to senator john mccain s  presidential campaign   trump  who says his policies will boost u s  jobs and business interests  has said he likes low rates  but has also said he would replace yellen when her term expires in  if he wins the presidency    so far there s little indication bloom s uncertainty index is about to spike  it fell to a reading of   in april  just above where it was in november ahead of the fed s well telegraphed rate hike  other readings of uncertainty  like the vix  look similarly benign  voters go to the polls on nov    historically  bloom s index jumps just ahead of tight presidential ballots  as well as during times of other policy uncertainty  such as the u s  debt ceiling debate in   a surge of  points in the index could presage a one percent decline in production and declines in employment and investment of about a half a percent each  based on bloom s models                                                                graphic showing past fed rate moves in election years
