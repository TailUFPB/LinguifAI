valletta  reuters     our donald   or  the other donald   european union leaders meeting in malta found themselves taking sides  between their summit chairman   our donald  tusk  and the new u s  president  donald trump  but despite declarations of unity  eu states are split on how to respond to policies from a man who has reversed staunch postwar u s  support for european integration and suggested others follow britain out of a bloc he has called  a vehicle for germany   tusk  a former polish prime minister  said eu leaders gave him the  our donald  nickname in malta  he presented it as a sign of their support  saying before the summit that trump posed a  threat  to the bloc  alongside russia  china and violent islam   the mood in the room was  our donald  and  the other donald    said one person present at the talks  where tusk also felt confident enough in his support to confirm he wants a second term as president of the european council  his political enemies in the warsaw government publicly disavowed any sense of unanimity behind tusk  however  calling his criticism of trump a  gross abuse  and accusing him of  sowing fear  and  seeking confrontation    others  less publicly  said there was wider disquiet that the eu could turn its back on its transatlantic relationship  such internal arguments pit historic unease  especially in france  over u s  influence against fears of weakening a western front against russia and  increasingly  china  how they play out will help shape trump s hopes  for example  of saving u s  money spent on nato and shifting world trade in americans  favor  they will also flavor the eu s brexit talks with london   where prime minister theresa may sees britain being a bridge between washington and brussels   as well as efforts by some states to tighten cooperation on euro zone economic policies and other areas  notably an independent eu military capability  as a pole well aware it is u s  forces that underpin nato s security guarantees in eastern europe  tusk nuanced his call to europeans to pull together to defend their independent interests against the  superpowers  the united states  russia and china  with an appeal to americans to preserve  the transatlantic bond without which global order and peace cannot survive   but some leaders worry trump s coolness toward nato and the exit of well armed britain will fuel ambitions for europeans to loosen that bond   notably in paris  which has often chafed at  anglo american  influence and where officials say trump shows france has been right to seek  strategic autonomy  for the eu   the french     are as usual saying  it s just the european union now  there s no such thing as the west    said a senior eastern european diplomat  criticizing paris s view    the germans are much more cautious  there is a clear issue to be decided on whether we should seek a common ground to engage with the united states  or turn our backs   as eu leaders prepare to map out a post brexit strategy at a  anniversary summit in rome next month  french president francois hollande criticized trump and eastern european governments he accused of raking in eu subsidies but then breaking ranks and undermining the bloc by seeking special favor from washington  many in the east are especially alarmed by trump s warmer tone toward russia but some back his entry ban on muslims  which echoes their own criticisms of eu refugee policies  german chancellor angela merkel took a less confrontational tone but stressed the need for  multilateralism    a prod to trump not to try and circumvent the eu by talking only to national leaders  and to europeans to speak with a single voice  whether  the other donald  gets that message is another matter  given a seemingly hazy grasp on who is who in brussels  the tycoon turned president told an interviewer last month he had spoken to  the head of the european union  and named his interlocutor as jean claude juncker  the eu chief executive   in fact  however  he had spoken to  our donald   tusk    sometimes i have an impression that the new administration does not know the eu in detail   juncker said drily on friday   but  in europe  details matter
