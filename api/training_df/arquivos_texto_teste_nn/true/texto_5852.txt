people fleeing the syrian civil war   chancellor angela merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and  does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion   her spokesman said  she expressed her concerns to trump during a phone call and reminded him that the geneva conventions require the international community to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds  the spokesman added  merkel s sentiments were echoed in paris and london   terrorism knows no nationality  discrimination is no response   said french foreign

   there was no immediate reaction to the curbs from islamic state  although in the past it has used u s  monitoring of muslim foreigners to stoke muslim anger against washington  the tehran
