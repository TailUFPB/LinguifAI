washington  reuters    the shocking shooting deaths of five dallas police officers have magnified the challenge that hillary clinton faces as she tries to reassure both voters jittery about social unrest and activists angry about law enforcement abuses that she is on their side  for clinton  the likely democratic presidential nominee  the political concerns going forward are two fold  she can t afford to alienate black and progressive voters she needs to show up in large numbers in the november election by taking too strong a stand against the protests like those recently in louisiana and minnesota that resulted in hundreds of arrests   at the same time  clinton can t allow more moderate voters worried about the violent images on their tv screens to gravitate to her republican rival  donald trump  who has attempted to use the tragedy in dallas to argue that he is the better law and order candidate   clinton herself recognizes the fine line she is trying to navigate  in remarks friday following the dallas sniper attack that left five officers dead  she acknowledged she was sending a mixed message in advocating for reform to curb police misconduct while at the same time praising the honor and bravery of police officers   i know that  just by saying all these things together  i may upset some people   clinton said in philadelphia  polling by reuters ipsos has revealed sharp differences in how trump and clinton s supporters view the police when it comes to african american suspects  just  percent of trump voters believe that black people are treated worse than whites compared to  percent of clinton voters  according to a poll conducted between may  and june    african americans were also almost twice as likely as whites to describe the police as  too violent   according to reuters polling  the slain dallas gunman  micah johnson  shot a dozen dallas officers because he wanted to  kill white people   authorities said  prior to the attack  clinton had tried to demonstrate her solidarity with the black lives matter movement after black men were killed by police in a suburb of st  paul  minnesota and baton rouge  louisiana   white people  need to start listening  she said   to the legitimate cries that are coming from our african american fellow citizens   clinton s words were seized upon on sunday by retired lieutenant general michael flynn  a top contender to be trump s vice presidential pick  flynn  the former head of the defense intelligence agency  called clinton s comments  irresponsible  in an interview with abc news because she  talked about white people being to blame   trump argued on twitter sunday that the united states is a  divided nation  due in part to the leadership of clinton and president barack obama  reports had him now strongly considering flynn as a running mate in part because of americans  growing concerns over public safety   but clinton has also had problems with black activists  two black lives matter advocates crashed a fundraiser in february  complaining about clinton s past comments about youth gangs  and in april  protesters sparred with her husband bill clinton  the former president  over the  bill he signed into law that put non violent offenders in prison for longer terms  clinton has spoken at length about criminal justice reform and scaling back gun rights  but still is viewed by many progressives  who have increasing sway in the party  as too centrist  democrats  for example  are expected to formally call for the abolition of the death penalty for the first time at the party s nominating convention later this month   while clinton has been critical about racial bias in the application of capital punishment  she has come short of saying it should be done away with  trump has argued the death penalty should be automatic for anyone found guilty of murdering a police officer  steve schale  a democratic strategist in florida  said he believes clinton can find a message that can appease both moderates and liberals on the issue of police violence    she can talk to the types of voters who strongly support their local law enforcement  but who also understand there are very troubling stories coming out of certain communities and real issues that need to be addressed   he said   clinton may be able to utilize vice president joe biden  well liked by law enforcement  as a surrogate to reach out to police groups  clinton and biden were scheduled to campaign together friday  but the event was canceled in the wake of the dallas incident   however  biden  as a u s  senator  was an advocate of the  crime bill that s now the object of scorn among black activists  underscoring the thorny politics of the issue within the party   trump continues to enjoy the same kind of advantage among white voters that mitt romney  the  republican nominee  held  the most recent reuters tracking poll shows trump leading clinton among white likely voters by two points  while trump trails clinton among all likely voters by  points   that makes african american turnout particularly critical for clinton  in   romney won almost  percent of the white vote but still lost handily to obama  who drove minorities to the polls in high numbers
