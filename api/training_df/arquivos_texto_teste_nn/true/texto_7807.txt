 new york  reuters    after a brutal week for republican presidential nominee donald trump  democrat hillary clinton maintained a substantial projected advantage in the race to win the electoral college and claim the u s  presidency  according to the latest results from the reuters ipsos states of the nation project released on saturday   if the election were held this week  the project estimates that clinton s odds of securing the  electoral college votes needed to win the presidency at more than  percent  and by a margin of  electoral college votes  it is the second week in a row that the project has estimated her odds so high    states of the nation check out the state by state breakdown and run your own scenarios based on voter turnout the results mirror other electoral college projections  some of which estimate clinton s chance of winning at around  percent   for the trump campaign there are a handful of states the republican candidate must win if he is to cobble together enough states to win the white house   among them is florida  but numerous recent visits to the sunshine state by trump and his vice presidential running mate mike pence did little to dent clinton s advantage in the contest for the state s  electoral college votes  she leads by  percentage points  about the same lead she enjoyed last week   still  the race tightened in ohio  another important state for trump  both ohio and nevada were leaning toward clinton last week but are now toss ups   however  clinton s support grew in north carolina and colorado  both of which moved from toss ups to leaning clinton   in the last week  the trump campaign struggled to respond to allegations from several women that trump had groped them or made unwanted sexual advances over several decades  trump said the reports were lies and part of a media conspiracy to defeat him   all of the allegations came after the washington post disclosed a video from  of trump describing how he tried to seduce a married woman and bragged in vulgar terms how his celebrity allowed him to kiss and grope women without permission   the accusations overshadowed what might otherwise have been a difficult week for clinton  her campaign manager s email account was apparently hacked and thousands of his emails were released by wikileaks  u s  officials say the russian government sanctioned the electronic break in   the emails have been trickling out for two weeks  included in the hacked emails were undisputed comments that clinton made to banks and big business in a  speech  in those comments  clinton said she supports open trade and open borders  and takes a conciliatory approach to wall street  both positions she later backed away from   since that release  waves of other emails have been released  among which were some that suggested clinton had inappropriately received questions in advance of a debate with bernie sanders during the democratic primaries   without trump s own woes  the clinton emails may well have become the central issue in the campaign  yet with just over three weeks to go until the nov   election  trump does not have much time to turn the race around   according to the project  trump trails by double digits among women and all minority groups  among black voters he trails by nearly  points  to a large extent his support is almost entirely dependent on white voters  and while trump s support among white men is strong  among white women his lead is negligible
