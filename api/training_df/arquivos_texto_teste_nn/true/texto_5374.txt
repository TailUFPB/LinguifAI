washington salt lake city  utah  reuters    when republican congressman jason chaffetz of utah introduced legislation last month to transfer about  million acres of federally held public land to state control  he was bombarded by thousands of angry phone calls  letters and social media posts urging him to back off  the pressure came not only from liberal environmentalists   but also from gun toting  often conservative outdoors enthusiasts who are central to chaffetz  political base  both camps fear that transferring federal lands to state control could open them up to drilling and coal mining rather than recreation and preservation   i hear you   chaffetz wrote in a post on his instagram account announcing the withdrawal of the bill   i am a proud gun owner  hunter and love our public lands   chaffetz s office did not respond to requests for comment on his reversal  outdoor sporting groups   long associated with conservatism because of their support for guns rights and small government   are now collaborating with the environmental left to fight u s  president donald trump s push to open more public lands to energy development  such areas include national forests  parks and native american tribal territories and account for about one fifth of the united states  recent funding data from the foundation center database  which aggregates information from tax filings  shows groups such as the backcountry hunters and anglers and the outdoor alliance have accepted grants from big environmental and liberal foundations  including the turner foundation and the william and flora hewlett foundation  the hewlett foundation gave    in  to backcountry  a conservation group created in   the money accounted for more than two thirds of its foundation grants that year  and backcountry told reuters it is an annual gift with no conditions  hewlett said it supports backcountry because of its  critical work to preserve america s outdoor heritage of hunting and fishing and protect wild places   the turner foundation gave an unrestricted donation of    to the outdoor alliance in   the group s only foundation grant that year   conservation is a nonpartisan issue  and it is a shame it is being politicized   said judy adler  president of the turner foundation  the environmental policy alliance  a pro development organization  has said environmentalists finance sportsmens  groups as a way to provide conservative cover for a liberal agenda   turning the outdoors groups into  green decoys   the alliance  which says it aims to  uncover the funding and hidden agendas  of environmentalists  did not respond to requests for comment  highlighting the odd bedfellows nature of such collaborative lobbying  the backcountry hunters and anglers counts the president s son  donald trump jr   as a lifetime member   officials at the trump organization  where donald trump jr  is an executive  did not respond to requests for comment  a trump administration official declined to comment  trump has made previous statements opposing the transfer of federal land to states  but has strongly supported more energy development in such areas  the outdoor recreation industry is concentrated heavily in conservative western states and generates more than   billion annually  according to the outdoor industry association  which represents hundreds of companies and organized the pressure campaign against chaffetz  that figure would make the outdoors industry about  times bigger than the coal industry   for a graphic comparing the outdoor industry s economic output to other sectors  see  tmsnrt rs  the cause of protecting public lands is among precious few issues that bind u s  conservatives and liberals  outdoors companies such as patagonia and north face are building lobbying strength quickly in response to rising threats to federal lands  said jessica wahl  government affairs manager for the outdoor industry association   we are a bipartisan industry   wahl said   we are stronger when talking with a unified voice   in one example of that clout  more than  companies this week   including patagonia  rei  north face  kuhl  and others   wrote an open letter to utah s republican governor gary herbert saying they will try to force an annual outdoor retailers  convention out of the state unless he protects public lands  patagonia had earlier announced it would boycott the convention   which brings utah about   million each year   because herbert had opposed a move by former democratic president barack obama to protect   million acres near the iconic bears ears buttes  tawney  of backcountry hunters and anglers  said he supports partnerships with environmental groups to advocate for wilderness conservation  but he dismisses assertions that the outdoor enthusiast organizations have become pawns of the environmental left   everything we do is about hunting and fishing   he said    some traditional environmental lobbying organizations such as the sierra club say they are happy to let outdoor sports advocates be the public face of the conservation movement  the arguments of sportsmen tend to resonate better with business friendly republicans and their constituents in rural communities  he said    they speak from more of an economic voice   said matt kirby  who directs the sierra club s public lands policy work for western states   elsewhere  local outdoor industry companies have had success engaging with the u s  bureau of land management  blm  to have more input on local oil and gas leasing decisions   ashley korenblat   owner of utah based mountain biking outfitter western spirit cycling and a member of the outdoor industry association   was instrumental in shaping the moab master leasing plan  which preserves bike trails near moab  utah while allowing some oil and gas drilling  many hunters  fishermen and campers may not think of themselves as conservationists  korenblat said  but  when you can no longer get to the river where you fish   when the trail you ve been riding has been replaced by a  foot gravel road to a well   suddenly you really care    some of the most passionate conservation advocates are in utah  where two thirds of the state is federally protected   i m just disgusted   said grant bench  a fly fishing guide who works with sundance mountain resort   do we see oil pumps in yellowstone next   last winter  bench said  he took donald trump jr  fishing on the provo river  bench told him he wants future generations of his family to enjoy the same pristine wilderness that currently sustains bench s livelihood  trump jr  agreed that preserving public lands is important  said bench  who hopes trump s son will carry that message to his father   reuters could not reach donald trump jr  for comment  bench provided a photograph of himself with trump jr  standing outside in waders  waterproof pants used by fly fishermen to walk through streams  the conservation battles have made bench start to question his traditionally conservative politics    i m leaning further left every day that this stuff goes on   he said  for a graphic on the u s  outdoor economy s impact
