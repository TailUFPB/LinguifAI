washington  reuters    the senate s top republican broke with president elect donald trump on monday over whether russian hacking during the u s  election merited closer scrutiny  a fissure between trump and his party that appeared to grow as lawmakers pressed for a special investigation into the matter  the divide raised the possibility of enduring clashes between trump and republicans during his presidency over how to handle russian president vladimir putin  a leader long viewed by many in the party as a calculating  untrustworthy foe but whom trump has repeatedly praised for his leadership   the russians are not our friends   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told a news conference  calls on sunday by two leading republican foreign policy voices  senators john mccain and lindsey graham  to investigate russia s hacking were buoyed on monday by mcconnell  who said russia s involvement needed further investigation   any foreign breach of our cyber security measures is disturbing  and i strongly condemn any such efforts   mcconnell said   this simply cannot be a partisan issue   mcconnell said it  defies belief  that republicans would be reluctant to investigate russian actions  mcconnell s remarks contrasted with those of trump and his staff  who scoffed at reports that the cia had concluded the hacks and leaks of democratic emails were carried out with the goal of helping trump defeat democrat hillary clinton  trump said the conclusion was  ridiculous   some lawmakers have called for a special committee to investigate the hacking  but mcconnell did not back that idea  saying he has confidence in the senate intelligence and armed services committees  cory gardner  a republican  said the russian hacking reflected the need for a permanent committee dedicated to cyber security  it was not clear how the house of representatives would respond to the hacking and calls for investigations  house committees have not announced plans for hearings  and republican house speaker paul ryan issued a statement criticizing russia but blasting what he termed  exploiting the work of our intelligence committee for partisan purposes   though congressional republicans support a probe of russia s involvement in the election  they have shied away from agreeing with the cia s assessment that the hacks were deliberately carried out to undermine clinton   it s obvious that the russians hacked into our campaigns   mccain said monday in an interview with reuters   but there is no information that they were intending to affect the outcome of the election  and that s why we need a congressional investigation   separately on monday  one republican and nine democratic electors led by the daughter of the house democratic leader  nancy pelosi  wrote to james clapper  the u s  director of national intelligence  requesting a briefing on the hacking reports before the electoral college formally decides the election on dec    john podesta  chairman of clinton s presidential campaign  said in a statement that the campaign supported the electors  letter  which raises  very grave issues involving our national security   clapper s office did not respond to a request for comment about the letter    charles schumer  who will be the senate democratic leader next year  said he welcomed mcconnell s support for  a deep and thorough bipartisan investigation  with access to all relevant intelligence  trump and his staff have repeatedly dismissed the reports as  ridiculous   blaming them on democrats unhappy that trump won   can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and we tried to play the russia cia card   trump said on twitter on monday   it would be called conspiracy theory   a second tweet said   unless you catch  hackers  in the act  it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking  why wasn t this brought up before election   white house press secretary josh earnest on monday pointed to a public statement from the intelligence community in early october that concluded the hacking had been authorized by  russia s senior most officials  and was aimed at sowing discord in the u s  election   that statement stopped short of alleging that russia wanted to help trump  but earnest suggested on monday that may have been the intent   you didn t need a security clearance to figure out who benefited from malicious russian cyber activity   earnest said    the president elect didn t call it into question  he called on russia to hack his opponent  he called on russia to hack secretary clinton
