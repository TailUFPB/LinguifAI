washington  reuters    the top republican at the u s  securities and exchange commission on tuesday took the first step toward scaling back the controversial  conflict minerals  rule  which requires companies to trace whether their products contain minerals from a war torn part of africa  in his first major action since becoming acting sec chair earlier this month  michael piwowar announced he has directed agency staff to reconsider how companies should comply with the rule and whether  additional relief  from its requirements is necessary   piwowar s action comes just one day after president donald trump signed an executive order that aims to slash government regulations  the white house has said the order does not apply to independent agencies like the sec  however  independent agencies often try to voluntarily follow the spirit of such orders  the conflict minerals rule requires manufacturers  from apple inc to general electric co  to tell investors if their products contain certain minerals from the war torn democratic republic of the congo  it is one of several sec disclosure rules required by the  dodd frank law that republicans and business groups have long sought to repeal  saying they force companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions  another disclosure rule hated by many companies that was also in dodd frank is the  resource extraction  rule  which forces oil and gas companies to disclose payments to foreign governments   republicans in the u s  house of representatives are slated to vote on a measure to repeal the resource extraction rule on wednesday  in that case  republicans are seeking to repeal it under  the congressional review act  which allows congress to stop recently adopted regulations through a simple majority vote  the conflict minerals rule cannot be repealed through the congressional review act because the law can only be applied to rules adopted since the end of may  however  sec staff can issue interpretive guidance to scale back its requirements or  in a more aggressive move  staff can choose not to enforce it  piwowar said the sec will solicit comments from the public on whether sec staff should update its guidance on compliance  the dodd frank law also contains language which would let trump order the sec to temporarily suspend the conflict minerals rule for two years if it might harm national security  piwowar did not ask the president to take such a step  however  he did raise some national security concerns posed by the rule  and said it has done nothing to help the humanitarian crisis in africa
