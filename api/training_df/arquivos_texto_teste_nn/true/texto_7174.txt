trump spokesman jason miller defended sessions against allegations of racism  saying   when senator sessions was u s  attorney he filed a number of desegregation lawsuits in alabama  and he also voted in favor of the  year extension of the civil rights act    so we feel very confident that senator sessions has the background and the support to receive confirmation   sessions  office did not respond to a request for comment on his nomination or criticism  sessions was a federal prosecutor in  when he became only the second nominee in  years to be denied confirmation as a federal judge  this came after allegations that he had made racist remarks  including testimony that he had called an african american prosecutor  boy   an allegation sessions denied  sessions said he was not a racist  but he said at his hearing that groups such as the national association for the advancement of colored people and the american civil liberties union could be considered  un american   he also acknowledged he

racial profiling or unlawful use of force  his justice department opened investigations of  police departments around the country for patterns of civil rights violations and sessions  as attorney

good relationship working with sessions  especially on policies that allow police to keep assets seized from criminals    the door  to sessions  has been open and we expect it to remain open   pasco

immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of trump s promise to build a wall on the border with mexico  as a senator  sessions opposed obama s nomination of loretta lynch as attorney general on the grounds that she would carry out an obama immigration policy that shielded many undocumented immigrants from deportation  sessions also has questioned the  amendment  which guarantees citizenship to everyone born in the united states  and opposes plans to admit more immigrants from war torn middle eastern countries  as attorney general  sessions would be able to turn more to state governments to

committee since march and was named vice chairman of the transition s executive committee last week  sessions defended trump in october when a leaked video showed him bragging about groping women
