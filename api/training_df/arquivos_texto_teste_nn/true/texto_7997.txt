six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers through temporary unemployment insurance  he has proposed paying for it by cracking down on fraud in the unemployment insurance program and through other changes to the system  trump has proposed increasing spending on the u s  military and infrastructure but says he would reduce spending on other categories by  percent each year  however  the social security and medicare programs for the elderly would be exempt from cuts  some economists questioned whether trump s ideas for reducing spending would be enough to make up for major tax cuts  particularly since many republicans believe medicare and social security must be revamped to control government outlays  trump launched his presidential campaign with his vow to build a wall on the u s  mexican border and has said he would insist that the united states  southern neighbor pay for it  he has promised to triple the number of immigration enforcement officers  hire more border patrol

proposed a ban on immigration from countries where vetting would be difficult  initially  he proposed a temporary ban on all muslims from entering the united states  critics  including some of trump s

might not be feasible      trump has promised a  dismantling  of the  dodd frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis  but has given few details      the republican party s platform calls for reinstating glass steagall  the  era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit taking institutions  trump s former campaign manager  paul manafort  said in july that his campaign backed this change  republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most despised pieces of the dodd frank law  and many in their ranks oppose a return to glass steagall      trump has offered few details about his plans to combat islamic state but has said he would  knock the hell out of  the militant group  he says he is keeping the details of strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy  trump has said if he wins  he would give u s  generals  days after he takes office on jan     to propose their own plans      trump has said

whether the country has paid up before providing defense    nato leaders say the sanctions against russia are key to persuading it to change that country s behavior in ukraine  where it has backed ethnic russian separatists  and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism      trump has made criticism of china s trade practices a central campaign theme  he has vowed to formally label china a currency manipulator  impose tariffs on chinese imports and bring unfair trade cases as punishment for what he believes are improper subsidies      trump has called for

include china  trump has said he is concerned it could try to enter it through the  back door   tpp supporters  including obama  have said china hoped to reach its own deal that would make it the leader in asian trade  they have said the pact would enable the united states to take a leadership role in the region instead of china
