fairfield  conn   reuters    u s  republican donald trump on saturday repeated his attack on president barack obama that he helped  found  islamic state and railed against media reports that his campaign is failing  at a campaign rally in connecticut  a state where he has a long shot of being victorious   speaking for more than an hour in a sweltering room  trump spent a significant portion of his speech complaining about the media     he again threatened to revoke the press credentials of the new york times  the credentials allow reporters access to press only areas of his campaign events  he has already banned other outlets  including the washington post   on saturday  the new york newspaper published an article detailing failed efforts to make trump focus his campaign on the general election   these are the most dishonest people   trump said   maybe we ll start thinking about taking their press credentials away from them        trump visiting connecticut  a heavily democratic state  raised eyebrows among many republicans   it s asinine that he would be in connecticut holding a public rally less than  days before the election   said republican strategist matt mackowiak   you don t see hillary publicly campaigning in idaho and mississippi  i have to think this proves the candidate is running the campaign  which explains why it s such a disaster of biblical proportions   at several points the crowd chanted  lock her up   a frequent campaign rally chant in reference to trump s democratic rival hillary clinton   trump told the crowd that normally he responds by saying he intends instead to defeat her in the nov   election  but this time added   you know what  you have a point   trump also dropped his recent efforts to say he was not being serious when he said obama was the  founder  of the islamic state militant group     it s the opinion of myself and a lot of people that he was the founder   trump told the crowd  democrats and republicans alike have criticized trump s assertion as patently false      trump took a detour from attacking clinton s economic record to discuss the  scandal involving white house intern monica lewinsky and former president bill clinton  whom republicans attempted to impeach    remember when he said  he did not have sex with that woman  and a couple of weeks later  oh you got me   trump said  to cheers  he then made reference to a blue dress that became a symbol in the investigation   i m so glad they kept that dress  so glad they kept that dress  because it shows what the hell they are
