washington  reuters    two senior u s  senators said on wednesday they want to amend a law allowing lawsuits against saudi arabia over the sept   attacks to narrow the scope of possible lawsuits  lindsey graham and john mccain  two of the republican party s congressional foreign policy leaders  said they would introduce an amendment to the law so that a government could be sued only if it  knowingly  engages with a terrorist organization   all we re saying to any ally of the united states  is   you can t be sued in the united states for an act of terrorism unless you knowingly were involved  and the same applies to us in your country   graham said in a senate speech  in september  the senate and house of representatives overwhelmingly rejected president barack obama s veto of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act  known as jasta  making it u s  law  however  lawmakers said almost as soon as they did so that  they wanted the scope of the legislation narrowed to ease concerns about its potential effect on americans abroad  which was one reason obama vetoed the measure  the law grants an exception to the legal principle of sovereign immunity in cases of terrorism on u s  soil  clearing the way for lawsuits seeking damages from the saudi government  riyadh denies longstanding suspicions that it backed the hijackers who attacked the united states in   however  it was not immediately clear whether graham and mccain s proposal would go anywhere  a group of sept   families  who lobbied intensely for the bill and have strong support in congress  immediately objected to their suggestion because it would weaken the law
