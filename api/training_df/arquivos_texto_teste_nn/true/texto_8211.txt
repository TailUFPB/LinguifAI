washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives passed legislation on friday that would allow the families of victims of the sept   attacks to sue saudi arabia s government for damages  despite the white house s threat to veto the measure  the u s  senate in may unanimously passed the  justice against sponsors of terrorism act   known as jasta  the bill s passage in the house by voice vote  two days before the  anniversary of the attacks that killed about   people  was greeted with cheers and applause in the chamber   we can no longer allow those who injure and kill americans to hide behind legal loopholes  denying justice to the victims of terrorism   said republican representative bob goodlatte  the chairman of the house judiciary committee  fifteen of the  sept   hijackers who crashed airliners in new york  outside washington and in pennsylvania were saudi nationals  the saudi government  which strongly denies responsibility  has lobbied against the bill  opponents of the measure said it could strain relations with saudi arabia and lead to retaliatory laws that would allow foreign nationals to sue americans for alleged involvement in terrorist attacks  the white house on friday reiterated that president barack obama would veto the bill  but some members of congress have become increasingly restive about relations with saudi arabia  long an important player in u s  middle east policy  on thursday  four senators introduced a resolution seeking to block a    billion arms sale to the kingdom  after  house members signed a letter in august asking obama to delay the sale  if obama carries out the veto threat and the required two thirds of both the republican majority house and senate still support the bill  it would be the first time since obama s presidency began in  that congress had overridden a veto  the house passed the measure by voice vote  without objections or recorded individual votes  that could make it easier for obama s fellow democrats to uphold his veto later without officially changing their positions  jasta would remove sovereign immunity  preventing lawsuits against governments  for countries found to be involved in terrorist attacks on u s  soil  it also would allow survivors  and relatives of those killed in them to seek damages from other countries  in this case  it would allow suits to proceed in federal court in new york as lawyers try to prove that the saudis were involved in the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon  backers say passage is long overdue  they argue that if saudi arabia  or any other government  is innocent of involvement in attacks  they have nothing to fear from the legislation   if they ve done nothing wrong  they have nothing to worry about   said democratic senator chuck schumer of new york  a vocal advocate for the measure  previous versions of the bill had stalled in congress because they provided fewer protections for countries against lawsuits  lawmakers had been under intense pressure from the sept   families to pass jasta before the  anniversary of the attacks on sunday  a member of the french parliament  pierre lellouche  said he would consider retaliatory legislation in france  and would anticipate it elsewhere  if the final version of jasta does not include waivers for countries that are u s  allies and actively involved in fighting terrorism   it may trigger similar acts all over the place  and then you enter into a  state of jungle  where everybody sues everybody   lellouche  who runs a parliamentary committee on international law  told reporters on a conference call on friday
