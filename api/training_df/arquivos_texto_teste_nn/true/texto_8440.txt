washington  reuters    the federal bureau of investigation said on tuesday it had turned over to the u s  congress a number of documents related to its probe into hillary clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  the democratic presidential nominee has for over a year been dogged by questions about her use of a private email account while she was the nation s top diplomat  republicans have repeatedly hammered clinton over the issue  helping to drive opinion poll results showing that many u s  voters doubt her trustworthiness  the fbi said it had provided  relevant materials  to congressional committees looking into the matter   the material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without fbi concurrence   the agency said in a statement  the clinton campaign criticized the delivery of the documents   this is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by republicans for the purposes of further second guessing the career professionals at the fbi   clinton spokesman brian fallon said in a statement    we believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the justice department  they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves  rather than allow republicans to mischaracterize them through selective  partisan leaks   a spokeswoman for the house of representatives oversight and government reform committee said in an email that staff for the panel was reviewing the information classified as  secret    there are no further details at this time   the aide said  senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley  a republican  said in a statement that an initial review of the material showed most of it was marked unclassified  and urged the fbi to make as much of it public as possible  fbi director james comey told congress last month that clinton s handling of classified information while using  private email servers was  extremely careless   but he said he would not recommend criminal charges be brought against her  comey s statement lifted a cloud of uncertainty from clinton s white house campaign  but his strong criticism of her judgment ignited a new attack on her by republicans  including donald trump  her republican opponent in the nov   election  the oversight committee  chaired by republican representative jason chaffetz  had asked the fbi for the complete investigative file from its review of clinton s use of a private email server  the fbi has also provided documents from its investigation to the house judiciary committee  an aide said  chaffetz and judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte  also a republican  last month urged federal prosecutors to investigate whether clinton had committed perjury  they said some fbi findings about her email servers were at odds with her previous testimony to congress about the matter  for example  her statement she had not sent or received information designated as classified  but the fbi  in a letter sent to the committee on tuesday  said the fact that the agency had uncovered three instances in which clinton had received emails containing   c   markings  which denote  confidential  information  was  not clear evidence of knowledge or intent  to mishandle such material  the letter  which accompanied the fbi s investigative documents  noted relevant emails had been forwarded to clinton by staff  lacked  header and footer markings  indicating the presence of classified information  and only one email was later determined by the state department to contain classified information  clinton s fellow democrats were scornful that republicans were refusing to let the matter drop   the fbi already determined unanimously that there is insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing   said representative elijah cummings  the top democrat on the oversight committee   republicans are now investigating the investigator in a desperate attempt to resuscitate this issue  keep it in the headlines  and distract from donald trump s sagging poll numbers
