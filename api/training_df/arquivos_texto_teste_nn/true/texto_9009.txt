global health officials are racing to better understand the zika virus behind a major outbreak that began in brazil last year and has spread to many countries in the americas   the following are some questions and answers about the virus and current outbreak  how do people become infected  zika is transmitted to people through the bite of infected female mosquitoes  primarily the aedes aegypti mosquito  the same type that spreads dengue  chikungunya and yellow fever  the pan american health organization  paho  said aedes mosquitoes are found in all countries in the americas except canada and continental chile  and the virus will likely reach all countries and territories of the region where aedes mosquitoes are found  how do you treat zika  there is no treatment or vaccine for zika infection  companies and scientists are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine for zika  but the world health organization  who  had said it would take at least  months to start large scale clinical trials of potential preventative shots  how dangerous is it  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention concluded that infection with the zika virus in pregnant women is a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other severe brain abnormalities in babies  the cdc said now that the causal relationship has been established  several important questions must still be answered with studies that could take years  according to the world health organization  there is strong scientific consensus that zika can cause the birth defect microcephaly in babies  a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems  in addition  the agency said it could cause guillain barre syndrome  a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis  conclusive proof of the damage caused by zika may take months or years  brazil reports the number of confirmed cases of microcephaly at   through may  as doctors and brazilian health officials find that some suspected cases of microcephaly are not the disorder  suspected ones under investigation declined to    colombia confirmed two cases of microcephaly linked to zika  brazil registered   likely cases of the zika virus from february until april   current research in brazil indicates the greatest microcephaly risk is associated with infection during the first trimester of pregnancy  but health officials have warned an impact could be seen in later weeks  recent studies have shown evidence of zika in amniotic fluid  placenta and fetal brain tissue  what are the symptoms of zika infection      people infected with zika may have a mild fever  skin rash  conjunctivitis  muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for two to seven days  but as many as  percent of people infected never develop symptoms  the symptoms are similar to those of dengue or chikungunya  which are transmitted by the same type of mosquito  how can zika be contained  efforts to control the spread of the virus focus on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and taking precautions against mosquito bites such as using insect repellent and mosquito nets  u s  and international health officials have advised pregnant women to avoid travel to latin american and caribbean countries where they may be exposed to zika  cases of sexual transmission have also been reported  prompting health officials to advise use of condoms  or abstaining from sex  to prevent infection between partners  how widespread is the outbreak  active zika outbreaks have been reported in at least  countries or territories  most of them in the americas  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   brazil has been the country most affected    usa gov   africa     cape verde

papua new guinea  samoa  and tonga   what is the history of the zika virus  the zika virus is found in tropical locales with large mosquito populations  outbreaks of zika have been recorded in africa  the americas  southern asia and the western pacific  the virus was first identified in uganda in  in rhesus monkeys and was first identified in people in  in uganda and tanzania  according to the who   can zika be transmitted through sexual contact  the world health organization  who  said sexual transmission is  relatively common  and has advised pregnant women not to travel to areas with ongoing outbreaks of zika virus  it also  advised women living in areas where the virus is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant  the u s  cdc is investigating about a dozen cases of possible sexual transmission  all cases involve possible transmission of the virus from men to their sex partners  the who has also identified zika cases in argentina  chile  france  italy and new zealand as likely caused by sexual transmission   british health officials reported zika was found in a man s semen two months after he was infected  suggesting the virus may linger in semen long after infection symptoms fade  the paho said zika can be transmitted through blood  but this is an infrequent transmission mechanism  there is no evidence zika can be transmitted to babies through breast milk  what other complications are associated with zika  zika has also been associated with other neurological disorders  including serious brain and spinal cord infections  the long term health consequences of zika infection are unclear  other uncertainties surround the incubation period of the virus and how zika interacts with other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes  such as dengue
