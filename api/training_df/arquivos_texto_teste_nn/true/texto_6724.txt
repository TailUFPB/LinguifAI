washington  reuters    the overseers of the u s  intelligence community have not embraced a cia assessment that russian cyber attacks were aimed at helping republican president elect donald trump win the  election  three american officials said on monday  while the office of the director of national intelligence  odni  does not dispute the cia s analysis of russian hacking operations  it has not endorsed their assessment because of a lack of conclusive evidence that moscow intended to boost trump over democratic opponent hillary clinton  said the officials  who declined to be named  the position of the odni  which oversees the  agency strong u s  intelligence community  could give trump fresh ammunition to dispute the cia assessment  which he rejected as  ridiculous  in weekend remarks  and press his assertion that no evidence implicates russia in the cyber attacks  trump s rejection of the cia s judgment marks the latest in a string of disputes over russia s international conduct that have erupted between the president elect and the intelligence community he will soon command  an odni spokesman declined to comment on the issue   odni is not arguing that the agency  cia  is wrong  only that they can t prove intent   said one of the three u s  officials   of course they can t  absent agents in on the decision making in moscow   the federal bureau of investigation  whose evidentiary standards require it to make cases that can stand up in court  declined to accept the cia s analysis   a deductive assessment of the available intelligence   for the same reason  the three officials said  the odni  headed by james clapper  was established after the sept      attacks on the recommendation of the commission that investigated the attacks  the commission  which identified major intelligence failures  recommended the office s creation to improve coordination among u s  intelligence agencies  in october  the u s  government formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against american political organizations ahead of the nov   presidential election  democratic president barack obama has said he warned russian president vladimir putin about consequences for the attacks  reports of the assessment by the cia  which has not publicly disclosed its findings  have prompted congressional leaders to call for an investigation  obama last week ordered intelligence agencies to review the cyber attacks and foreign intervention in the presidential election and to deliver a report before he turns power over to trump on jan    the cia assessed after the election that the attacks on political organizations were aimed at swaying the vote for trump because the targeting of republican organizations diminished toward the end of the summer and focused on democratic groups  a senior u s  official told reuters on friday  moreover  only materials filched from democratic groups   such as emails stolen from john podesta  the clinton campaign chairman   were made public via wikileaks  the anti secrecy organization  and other outlets  u s  officials said  the cia conclusion was a  judgment based on the fact that russian entities hacked both democrats and republicans and only the democratic information was leaked   one of the three officials said on monday    it was  a thin reed upon which to base an analytical judgment   the official added  republican senator john mccain said on monday there was  no information  that russian hacking of american political organizations was aimed at swaying the outcome of the election   it s obvious that the russians hacked into our campaigns   mccain said   but there is no information that they were intending to affect the outcome of our election and that s why we need a congressional investigation   he told reuters  mccain questioned an assertion made on sunday by republican national committee chairman reince priebus  tapped by trump to be his white house chief of staff  that there were no hacks of computers belonging to republican organizations   actually  because mr  priebus said that doesn t mean it s true   said mccain   we need a thorough investigation of it  whether both  democratic and republican organizations  were hacked into  what the russian intentions were  we cannot draw a conclusion yet  that s why we need a thorough investigation   in an angry letter sent to odni chief clapper on monday  house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes said he was  dismayed  that the top u s  intelligence official had not informed the panel of the cia s analysis and the difference between its judgment and the fbi s assessment  noting that clapper in november testified that intelligence agencies lacked strong evidence linking russian cyber attacks to the wikileaks disclosures  nunes asked that clapper  together with cia and fbi counterparts  brief the panel by friday on the latest intelligence assessment of russian hacking during the election campaign
