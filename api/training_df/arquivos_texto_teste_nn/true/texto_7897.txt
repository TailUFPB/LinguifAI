washington  reuters    democratic presidential hopeful hillary clinton struggled with how to secure the endorsement of labor unions while announcing her opposition to the keystone xl oil pipeline  a project they supported but environmentalists opposed  according to leaked emails published by wikileaks on friday  before announcing in september  that she opposed transcanada corp s proposal to build a pipeline from canada to the united states  her campaign sought to  soften the blow  to labor unions by offering an energy infrastructure plan that would create jobs  according to the emails   the internal campaign emails from august  reveal the difficulty clinton had in appeasing both unions and environmentalists as she fought for her party s nomination ahead of the nov   election  wikileaks published the clinton emails just hours after the u s  government accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organizations      in the emails  clinton advisers discussed how to frame the candidate s  energy infrastructure  plan  which would call for replacing old pipelines  repairing rail tracks and improving the electric grid in a way that would appeal to labor unions  who had yet to endorse her at that stage   could we mention that     as we transition hrc wants to create more careers within the new energy economy  careers is their buzz word   wrote nikki budzinski  labor outreach director for hillary for america  clinton had long avoided taking a firm position on keystone  which had been pending for seven years  as she sought her party s nomination last year  as secretary of state  clinton said in  she was inclined to approve it   rival senator bernie sanders had been a staunch opponent of the pipeline  president barack obama did not reject the pipeline until november   labor unions have pushed for approval of the pipeline  saying it would create thousands of construction jobs while environmentalists opposed it because it would increase greenhouse gas emissions from canada s oil sands  the emails show that north america s building trades  representing builders and construction workers  contacted the campaign after hearing that obama would announce his denial of the pipeline in late august and that clinton would say she  encouraged  him to make the decision      we are so close to getting bldg  sic  trades  and if we do this right  it will be ok even though they won t like it   wrote amanda renteria  the campaign s national political adviser  the building trades union endorsed clinton in november and the laborers  international union of north america endorsed clinton in december   clinton s struggle to please both green and labor groups is likely to emerge as a key challenge if she is to win the presidency  a decision over another pipeline  the dakota access  has sparked major protests from native american and environmental groups  the obama administration temporarily halted construction  frustrating unions   these types of decisions made by this administration get dumped in the presidential race and it s kind of unfair   sean mcgarvey  president of north america s building trades unions  told reuters in an interview last month    we don t like all of clinton s energy policies but we think it s reasonable
