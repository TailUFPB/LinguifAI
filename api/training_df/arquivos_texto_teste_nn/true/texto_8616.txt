philadelphia  reuters    when hillary clinton first ran for president in  she was badly stung by a backhanded compliment from rival barack obama  who called her  likable enough  before going on to win the democratic nomination and the white house  eight years later  with her party s nomination to succeed obama firmly in hand  the question of her likability  trustworthiness and honesty still hangs over her bid to become america s first woman president  this time in a nov   election against republican donald trump  the democratic national convention in philadelphia this week is  in part  an effort to reintroduce her to american voters  more than half of whom view her unfavorably  according to reuters ipsos polling  the criticisms have dogged her for years  she can appear stiff in front of crowds  struggling to show off the compassion her supporters say she shares in private and leaving some voters with the impression she is not giving straight answers to tough questions  clinton recognizes the problem  aides say   she knows that she has work to do to earn people s trust   said jennifer palmieri  clinton s communications director   she also realizes there aren t some magic words you can say to earn that trust overnight   speaker after speaker at the convention took the stage on monday and tuesday to offer testimonials on her behalf  including her husband  former president bill clinton  who filled his prime time speech on tuesday with anecdotes and private moments shared by america s best known political couple  gay basketball player jason collins told of the support she offered when he went public with his homosexuality  a grandmother described how her daughter s battle with drug addiction inspired clinton to address the drug crisis  a parade of others offered behind the scenes glimpses of the former first lady  u s  senator and secretary of state  describing how she drove through a blizzard to attend a funeral  planned birthday parties and visited survivors of the sept      attacks   clinton s personal image  which has fluctuated during her  years in the public eye  slumped after a divisive democratic primary  a lingering controversy over her use of a private email system while serving as the top u s  diplomat  and repeated republican attacks on  crooked hillary   reuters ipsos polling showed  percent of americans had an unfavorable view of clinton  trump is even less popular  with  percent holding an unfavorable view  many americans think both candidates struggle with the truth  some  percent of americans believe she is not  honest and truthful   while  percent think the same of trump  according to the poll  republican strategist john feehery said it was too late to rehabilitate clinton s image   you only get one decade to make a first impression   he said   instead  a  better strategy would be to focus on tearing down trump  given that his negatives surpass her own  feehery added  clinton s campaign appears to be trying just that  running an ad in which trump can be seen in newsclips  as children watch  swearing  condemning mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers  and mocking a disabled journalist  clinton    has been a lightning rod for conservative attacks for more than two decades and republicans serenaded speakers at their convention in cleveland last week with chants of  lock her up  and signs touting  hillary for prison    for many democrats who back clinton  the poor polling numbers are the result of those relentless attacks   along with a strong dose of sexism toward a woman seeking power   if you have somebody who is out there pounding you and pounding you and pounding you  eventually it s going to take a toll   richard trumka  head of the afl cio labor federation  said   i ve said this and i ve said it publicly  hillary clinton has to do a  work to get a c    for democrats  this week affords perhaps their best chance before the election to fortify her against inevitable attacks by trump that could further dent her image  praise came from invitees ranging from party superstars  first lady michelle obama  to unknowns  former white house interns      in one video broadcast to delegates  clinton embraces and comforts an  year old girl who fears her parents will be deported  in another  shown before the appearance of the mothers of the movement   mothers who lost children to gun violence or in police involved incidents   she encourages them in a private meeting to band together and speak out   a  minute meeting turned into two hours because she listened to us  nobody else listened to us   said sybrina fulton  mother of trayvon martin  a  year old whose fatal shooting death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in  launched a series of protests around the country  actress eva longoria said it was time for democrats to rally to clinton s defense   she s had a  year smear campaign run against her  it s understandable americans are confused about what is true and what is not   she told a women s delegate caucus on tuesday
