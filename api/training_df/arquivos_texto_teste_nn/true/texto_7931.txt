ottawa  reuters    canada  fearful of talk by the u s  presidential candidates to  reopen the north american free trade agreement  could use the opportunity to push for a better deal on worker mobility  dispute resolutions and other issues  canadian negotiators of the original pact said  republican donald trump calls nafta the worst trade deal signed by the united states and democrat hillary clinton has signaled a change of position on the  pact she supported when it became law under her husband  former president bill clinton  the agreement between the united states  canada and mexico is often used for political grist in u s  election campaigns but altering it is a major concern for export oriented canada  in   barack obama campaigned on renegotiating the treaty with tougher labor and environmental standards  a pledge that fell to the wayside when he became president in january   but the idea has taken hold more strongly in  and mexico has said it is ready to update the treaty  canada has said nafta is in the best interest of all three countries  if canada were forced to renegotiate  one issue it could target is the pact s investor state dispute settlement provision  the united states wanted it included in the original deal to protect u s  investments in mexico  it has since been used by american companies to sue canadian federal and provincial governments  transcanada corp is using the provision to seek billions from the u s  government for rejecting the keystone xl pipeline  that would probably be an area of mutual concern for canada and the united states given those unintended consequences  said derek burney  canada s former u s  ambassador  who was involved in the original negotiations  labor mobility  a concern for canadian technology companies  could be improved by updating the list of professions that allows workers to relocate between countries   we fell short in terms of what we wanted to achieve on labor mobility in the nafta   said john weekes  canada s chief negotiator  who added canada should also push for improved access to the u s  government procurement market  reopening nafta could give the canadian government cover to phase out a domestic supply management system for the politically powerful dairy industry that has come under international criticism  negotiators said   i d be secretly delighted if they came hard at us on supply management   said burney   given the dairy industry and its weight in the united states  it s not easy to dismiss   the system controls dairy prices and production  which critics say drives up consumers prices  the industry says it allows farmers to get stable prices  and noted canada has preserved the system while negotiating several trade agreements  still  former negotiators warned canada would not be working from a position of strength as it sought concessions   ignoring everything else  yes  there could be an opportunity there   said michael hart  who advised on the original negotiations   but in the real world  i d be very cautious   while clinton has said she would rework the trade pact  trump s threat to withdraw is a bigger concern in canada   if we re in a situation where people are threatening they re going to walk out of trade agreements unless they can be renegotiated  then i think we re in a situation where it would be very difficult   said weekes
