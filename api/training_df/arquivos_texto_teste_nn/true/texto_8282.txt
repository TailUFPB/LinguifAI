new york  reuters    new jersey governor christie said on friday the state would begin taxing income earned by people who work in new jersey but live in pennsylvania  ending a long standing arrangement with the neighboring state  pulling out of the nearly  year old  reciprocity  agreement would allow new jersey to raise more revenue starting jan    christie  a close ally of republican presidential nominee donald trump  said in a statement that he was forced to act because the democrat controlled legislature created a   million budget hole in june by relying on public employee health insurance cuts they have not yet made  if lawmakers come back next week and cut health costs  christie could consider  revising  his termination of the reciprocal tax pact   i will not raise state taxes  cut property tax relief  reduce aid to education or our hospitals  or reduce the state s record pension payment to cover for this blunder by the legislature   christie said   jeff sheridan  press secretary to pennsylvania governor tom wolf  said christie  erred significantly in his decision to unnecessarily punish   pennsylvanians and cost the commonwealth   million annually   he said wolf  a democrat  was hopeful christie would change his mind  however  christie seems committed to making pennsylvania  suffer the consequences of his failure to enact a responsible budget in a bipartisan way   sheridan said  pennsylvanians pay a flat   percent income tax rate with no personal exemptions  new jerseyans pay higher rates the more they make  with progressive rates increasing from   percent to   percent  the reciprocal agreement is advantageous for high income pennsylvania residents who work in new jersey  because they pay their state s lower tax rate  it is also good for low income new jerseyans who work across the border because of new jersey s progressive tax system  new jersey senate president steve sweeney said in a statement that ending the scheme is  the wrong decision for our state  and that more than   new jersey residents will pay almost    per year in additional income tax    the burden falls completely on working families in new jersey  especially those in south jersey who work in philadelphia  and will have a very real impact on their quality of life   he said
