washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on thursday imposed some limits on the kind of fraud claims that can be brought against federal contractors in a case involving a suit against one of america s largest hospital operators over a woman s death at one of its facilities  but the   ruling was not the broad victory for business sought by the company  universal health services  and other healthcare providers fearful of suits under the u s  false claims act  which lets individuals make claims that the federal government has been defrauded  the justices threw out a  appeals court ruling that had allowed the parents of yarushka rivera to sue universal health services under the false claims act  but sent the case back to a lower court  meaning the suit could potentially still proceed  rivera suffered a fatal seizure in  at age  a mental health facility owned by the company in lawrence  massachusetts  the lawsuit said the facility provided  gravely inadequate treatment  and used  unsupervised and unqualified personnel   the ruling represented a partial victory for the business community because it rejected the lower court s expansive view of a company s liability under the false claims act   roy englert  king of prussia  pennsylvania based universal health services  lawyer  said he was pleased the justices threw out the appeals court ruling and set a  new rigorous standard  for determining if the claims can move forward  rivera s parents  julio escobar and carmen correa  accused the company of defrauding the government because it was getting federal medicaid funding to provide treatment to low income people and did not comply with personnel regulations at the lawrence facility  the ruling  accepts the basic notion that fraudsters can t provide shoddy services to the government and expect payment without incurring significant liability   said david frederick  the lawyer for rivera s family  businesses had hoped the justices would put more limits  or disallow completely  lawsuits based on a federal contractor s failure to meet certain legal or regulatory requirements not specifically outlined in a government contract   the court instead said such lawsuits can be filed as long as they are relevant to the government s decision to make the payment to the company  justice clarence thomas  writing for the court  said the parents  may well have adequately pleaded a violation  of the fraud law  but added that the false claims act  is not a means of imposing treble damages and other penalties for insignificant regulatory or contractual violations   the obama administration had backed the parents
