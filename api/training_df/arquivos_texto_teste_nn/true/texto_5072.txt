san francisco  reuters    the state of hawaii said it will ask a federal court on wednesday for an emergency halt to president donald trump s new executive order restricting travel from six muslim majority countries  becoming the first state to challenge the ban in court  in a court filing on tuesday  hawaii said it would seek a temporary restraining order against the new travel ban  hawaii s suit against the original executive order was put on hold   the trump administration this week issued the new executive order that supplanted an earlier  more sweeping one which had been challenged in court by several states in addition to hawaii  the new order is much more narrowly tailored than the first one issued in january  it keeps a  day ban on travel to the united states by citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen but excludes iraq  and applies the restriction only to new visa applicants    to be sure  the new executive order covers fewer people than the old one   neal katyal  one of the lead attorneys for hawaii  said in an interview with cnn  he said the new travel ban still  suffers from the same constitutional and statutory defects    we are confident that the president s actions are lawful to protect the national security of our country   the justice department said in a statement  in a joint filing  hawaii and the u s  government asked for oral arguments in the case to be held march   a day before the new travel order is set to take effect  separately  in a case brought by washington state against the first trump travel order  the justice department on tuesday said it would voluntarily dismiss its own appeal of a seattle federal court ruling that had suspended the order  washington state did not oppose the administration s request to end its appeal  the filing said  immigration advocates said the new ban still discriminates against muslims and fails to address some of their concerns with the previous directive  legal experts said the new ban would be harder to challenge because it affects fewer people living in the united states and allows more exemptions to protect them  washington state attorney general bob ferguson on monday said his office was evaluating whether it would challenge the new order and would likely decide this week  the  u s  circuit court of appeals last month had blocked trump s first order  saying washington state would likely be able to prove that it violated constitutional protections  that appeals court ruling has not been withdrawn and its legal reasoning can still be cited as precedent in future cases  washington attorney general spokesman peter lavallee said on tuesday
