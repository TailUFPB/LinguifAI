san francisco  reuters    a u s  senator and civil groups critical of surveillance practices on friday called on the government to release a  order by a secret court directing yahoo to scan all its users  incoming email  saying it appeared to involve new interpretations of at least two important legal issues  their concerns center on the nature of the technical assistance the court required yahoo to provide and the scope of the search that legal experts said appeared to cover the silicon valley internet company s entire network  yahoo installed a custom software program to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts at the behest of u s  intelligence officials with an order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court  a secret tribunal  reuters reported on tuesday  they were looking for messages containing a single piece of digital content  three former employees and a fourth person apprised of the events told reuters  intelligence officials told reuters that all yahoo had to do was modify existing systems for stopping child pornography from being sent through its email or filtering spam messages  but the pornography filters are aimed only at video and still images and cannot search text  as the yahoo program did  the spam filters  meanwhile  are viewable by many employees who curate them  and there is no confusion about where they sit in the software stack and how they operate  the court ordered search yahoo conducted  on the other hand  was done by a module attached to the linux kernel   in other words  it was deeply buried near the core of the email server operating system  far below where mail sorting was handled  according to three former yahoo employees  they said that made it hard to detect and also made it hard to figure out what the program was doing   how much companies can be forced to do to comply with government orders for searching data is being debated in the courts  companies have successfully argued that changes that would degrade users  experience or force them to write new code  essentially a form of speech  would violate basic rights  most famously  apple refused to write code that would unlock an iphone belonging to a gunman in last year s mass shooting in san bernardino  california  the fbi later dropped its demand  in the case of yahoo  company security staff discovered a software program that was scanning email but ended an investigation when they found it had been approved by chief executive officer marissa mayer  the sources said   lawmakers are concerned about the request and whether information about it is being properly disclosed to the public   recent reports of a mass email scanning program have alleged that federal law is being interpreted in ways that many americans would find surprising and troubling   said democratic senator ron wyden of oregon  a member of the intelligence committee and frequent critic of government surveillance programs     the usa freedom act requires the executive branch to declassify foreign intelligence surveillance court opinions that involve novel interpretations of laws or the constitution   wyden said   intelligence officials said the yahoo order resembled other requests for monitoring online communications of suspected terrorists  the program is far different from the bulk collection of emails and telephone records that was disclosed by fugitive national security agency contractor edward snowden  they said  stressing the target was a digital  signature  associated with a single entity s suspected terrorist activity  but legal experts question whether the order might have stretched the concept of a  facility  used by a foreign power from its traditional definition  involving a single phone number or an email account  to include a large company s entire communication network   if the facility means all of yahoo s network  i don t see how that s consistent with the fourth amendment   which bars unreasonable searches  said greg nojeim  senior counsel at the center for democracy   technology
