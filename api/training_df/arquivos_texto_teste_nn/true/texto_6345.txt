brussels  reuters    barack obama s envoy to brussels warned donald trump against the  lunacy  of backing an eu break up  saying brexit campaigner nigel farage may have given the incoming u s  president a false impression that more countries might follow britain out of the bloc  anthony gardner  a banker who has run u s  relations with the european union for three years  made the frank comments on friday in a final news conference a week before trump has ordered all obama appointees to quit  gardner condemned the move as an unprecedented  guillotine exit  that had disrupted public servants  lives  referring to trump s welcome for the british vote to leave the eu and the apparent influence of farage in the trump camp  gardner said   for us to be the cheerleaders of brexit and to be encouraging brexit mark   mark   is the height of folly   gardner said farage  an eu lawmaker and trump ally  had written to him recently requesting a meeting  the u s  envoy said farage s views were the  polar opposite  of his own and he thought farage had misled trump s transition team on the state of the eu  describing calls to eu institutions from trump s aides in recent weeks  gardner said   that was the one question that was asked   basically   what s the next country to leave    which is kind of suggesting that the place is about to fall apart    it s just reflective of the general perception  a misperception  a perception that nigel farage is presumably disseminating in washington and it s a caricature   he said it would be  fundamentally flawed  for the united states to ignore the eu as  dysfunctional  and instead focus on key allies like britain and germany   we should not depart from  years of foreign policy with regard to the eu   he said   we should not become the cheerleaders for brexit  particularly if brexit appears more likely to be a hard  disorderly unmanaged brexit    a hard brexit or a fragmentation of the european market would be very bad news for american business   he added    they ve understood it     and we need to make the case   gardner urged europeans and the incoming administration not to break ranks on sanctions against russia over ukraine   trump says he wants better relations with moscow after he takes office next friday  and he urged u s  diplomats to speak frankly to the new leadership  even if that carried risks to their careers  he spoke of his  respect  for britain s eu ambassador  who resigned this month in a sign of behind the scenes arguments in london over brexit  ivan rogers  he said  had  paid the price  for telling political leaders things they did not want to hear   it s critically important   gardner said   that while being loyal to the new team     people speak truth to power
