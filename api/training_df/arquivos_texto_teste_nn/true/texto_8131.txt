washington  reuters    a u s congressional intelligence committee on thursday issued a scathing report accusing former national security agency contractor edward snowden of leaking information that  caused tremendous damage  to u s  national security  lying about his background and feuding with co workers  in a report endorsed by both its republican and democratic leaders  the house intelligence committee said snowden was  not a whistleblower  as he has claimed   most of the material he stole from the nsa was not about invasions of privacy  but revealed intelligence and defense programs of great interest to america s foreign adversaries  it said  the committee said that while the  full scope  of damage caused by snowden s disclosures remains unknown  a review of materials he allegedly compromised  makes clear that he handed over secrets that protect american troops overseas and secrets that provide vital defenses against terrorists and nation states       the committee released only a four page summary of what it said was a  page investigative report that remains top secret  but the summary contained strong words about snowden s actions and background  the report contains previously unreported allegations about snowden and his possible motives for taking government secrets  it alleges that snowden  who took refuge in moscow after fleeing to hong kong   was and remains a serial exaggerator and fabricator   it says his official employment records show that while he claimed to have left u s  army basic training because of broken legs  in fact he  washed out because of shin splits   the report says snowden claimed to have obtained a high school graduation equivalent  but in fact never did  it also says he claimed to have worked as a  senior advisor  for the cia when in fact he was an entry level computer technician  while the report says snowden  stole   million sensitive documents   other sources who have examined materials he turned over to media outlets say that the total is between   and   documents   some u s  officials involved in snowden related investigations acknowledge that the u s  government does not know how many documents snowden downloaded  and that the   million figure is an estimate      the report also disputes snowden s motives for taking and leaking classified information  saying he got into a  workplace spat  with nsa managers in june  over how to manage computer updates  it says a contracting officer reprimanded him for failing to follow proper grievance procedures  and he began downloading classified information two weeks later  however  in   reuters quoted u s  officials and other sources familiar with the matter as saying that snowden began downloading such data in april   almost a year earlier than had previously been reported at the time  the issuance of the house committee report coincided with the release of  snowden   a movie directed by oliver stone that portrays him as a whistleblower and hero  on wednesday  prominent human rights advocates urged president barack obama to pardon snowden before leaving office in january  u s  officials have said obama is not considering a pardon for snowden  who is facing u s  criminal charges for providing classified information to unauthorized persons  ben wizner  an attorney with the american civil liberties union who represents snowden  dismissed the house committee report as lacking substance   wizner said the report s release a day before the snowden film opens  is evidence that people in the intelligence community are taking us seriously  that they are concerned that oliver stone s movie will help solidify snowden s image as a true patriot  which he is
