washington  reuters    the republican led u s  congress had a rough start to its first session of the donald trump era on tuesday when a public outcry that included a dressing down from the president elect prompted the house of representatives to backtrack on its plans to defang an ethics watchdog  it was supposed to have been a ceremonious beginning in which lawmakers set plans to enact trump s agenda of cutting taxes  repealing obamacare and rolling back financial and environmental regulations  with trump set to be sworn in as president on jan    republicans will control both the white house and congress for the first time since    the moment was overshadowed  however  by a an uproar over a surprise move by republicans in the house of representatives in a closed door meeting late on monday to weaken the independent office of congressional ethics  which is in charge of investigating ethics accusations against lawmakers  trump  who campaigned on a pledge to  drain the swamp  and bring ethics reform to washington  was not pleased by the timing   with all that congress has to work on  do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog  as unfair as it may be  their number one act and priority   he said on twitter on tuesday   focus on tax reform  healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance   the ethics office was created in  following several corruption scandals  some lawmakers have charged in recent years that it has been too quick to investigate complaints from outside partisan groups  lawmakers wanted to have greater control of the watchdog  and inserted changes into a broader rules package  set to pass when the house convened on tuesday  even before trump s tweet  many house republicans  including top leaders  had opposed the measure and worried about its ramifications  trump s tweet prompted an emergency meeting and a quick change of course by republicans   it was taken out by unanimous consent     and the house ethics committee will now examine those issues   said ashlee strong  a spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan   as expected  ryan was re elected speaker on a vote of    he was first elected speaker in october  after predecessor john boehner retired following repeated revolts by house conservatives  the speaker election was part of the ceremony involved in the first meeting of the  congress  as the  members of the house of representatives and a third of the  member senate were sworn in  ryan  who kept his distance from trump during his campaign only to embrace him after his nov   victory  said republicans understood from the  election that americans were dissatisfied with washington   we hear you  we will do right by you and we will deliver   ryan said  trump has made clear he wants to move swiftly to enact proposals he outlined during the campaign such as simplifying the tax code and slashing corporate tax rates  he also promised to make good on a republican pledge to repeal and replace democratic president barack obama s  signature affordable care act   a law better known as obamacare   people must remember that obamacare just doesn t work  and it is not affordable   trump said on twitter on tuesday  adding   it is lousy healthcare   in the first step of a process that could take years  republican senator mike enzi introduced a resolution on tuesday to provide for repeal of the law  house republicans also took a step to clear the decks later for obamacare repeal by approving a procedural rule making it harder for democrats to impede progress on such legislation  but republicans face a dilemma on a replacement program to provide health insurance to people who do not have a plan at work or cannot afford private coverage  the white house says the law has expanded coverage for  million americans  including an estimated   million people who buy insurance on exchanges  many who receive tax credits to make it affordable   if republicans repeal the affordable care act they ll be hastening the demise of medicare that millions of seniors rely upon for their basic healthcare needs   white house spokesman josh earnest said at a news briefing  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell did not address obamacare in remarks on the senate floor on tuesday  he has said his top priorities for the new congress were dealing with the  massive overregulation  he said had been a brake on the u s  economy and making changes in the tax code to stop companies from moving jobs out of the country  republicans might use upcoming spending bills funding government agencies to try to kill some environmental and banking regulations  trump also is expected to try to use his executive powers toward that end  leading democrats warned of a fierce battle over obamacare and said they planned to mobilize grassroots support for it  obama is scheduled to meet on wednesday with congressional democrats to discuss strategies for fending off the republican attacks on obamacare  but senator charles schumer  in his first floor speech as the top democrat in the senate  said he was ready to work on some issues with trump   if the president elect proposes legislation that achieves that   on issues like infrastructure  trade  and closing the carried interest loophole  for instance   we will work in good faith to perfect and  potentially  enact it   schumer said   when he doesn t  we will resist   house democratic leader nancy pelosi told a packed house chamber that democrats would work with trump  wherever we can   including reforming taxes and trade deals  pelosi also warned that democrats would  stand our ground  and fight trump and republicans if they attempt to weaken environmental regulations or civil rights protections
