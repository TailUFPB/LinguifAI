washington  reuters    the clinton foundation on multiple occasions during hillary clinton s tenure as secretary of state asked senior u s  government officials to vet her husband s contacts with potentially controversial international figures  according to emails released by the state department  the emails  reviewed by reuters  were part of a batch of nearly  messages recently released by the state department after requests from the conservative group citizens united  a group that has long been critical of the clintons  the exchanges show a top foreign policy adviser to the foundation sought guidance from the state department on former president bill clinton s interactions with people including syrian president bashar al assad  russian government officials and business leaders  and gulnara karimova  the socialite daughter of uzbekistan s late president  the emails offer a glimpse of the intricate relationship between a private charity with a broad global mission and the state department under the leadership of a secretary who is married to a former president  former government officials reached by reuters said there was nothing inappropriate in the interactions of the foundation with the state department over the potential meetings  some of which did not occur  the latest batch of emails likely represents only a partial view of all the exchanges between the state department and the foundation  it is unclear how frequently the foundation sought advice from the state department on meetings involving bill clinton  in one instance  the emails show amitabh desai  a foreign policy adviser to the foundation and to bill clinton  raised the possibility in  of a meeting between bill clinton and syrian president assad  at the time  assad wanted better ties with the west   would this be concerning for state   desai wrote in an email alerting hillary clinton aide jake sullivan to the possible meeting   the syrians expressed a keen interest in facilitating this   desai said in an email a few days later  the syria visit was proposed to be tacked onto a forum bill clinton was invited to attend in israel in november   according to the emails  the meeting never happened  according to martin indyk  a former u s  ambassador to israel who helped  to organize the trip  the state department sometimes communicates with charities  such as about circumstances that might involve the safety of americans or highly sensitive diplomatic situations  but it typically does not vet their contacts with foreign leaders to this extent  state department spokesman elizabeth trudeau said officials occasionally provide talking points and briefings to ex presidents  much of bill clinton s communications with the state department stemmed from an ethics agreement that was put in place when hillary clinton became secretary of state in   the agreement was aimed at avoiding conflicts of interests stemming from contributions to the foundation and bill clinton s paid speeches and consulting  trudeau said these were  voluntary steps  taken to avoid  even the appearance of a conflict of interest   angel urena  press secretary for bill clinton  said the requests for state department input on potential meetings  talking points and other information  was done in order to inform the administration of president clinton s interactions with foreign governments and dignitaries  so that the administration could in turn offer advice or voice any concerns   urena said bill clinton had sought advice on his activities since he left office in   the clinton foundation referred questions to urena  hillary clinton s presidential campaign declined to comment  clinton s campaign to win the nov   presidential election has been dogged by criticism of the bill  hillary   chelsea clinton foundation  a global philanthropic organization  the foundation has said it will stop accepting at least some foreign and corporate donations if hillary clinton becomes president and that bill clinton would resign from the foundation s board  in one previously unreported email exchange  desai wrote to the state department in may  informing officials that bill clinton would travel to monaco to raise money for the foundation at an event where he might cross paths with the elder daughter of the uzbekistan president  gulnara karimova  a businesswoman and pop star  was described in a  cable from a u s  embassy official as the  single most hated person in uzbekistan  because of her flamboyant lifestyle in an authoritarian country  she has since come under investigation in an international bribery scandal  ahead of the event in monaco  desai wrote that the organizers had invited karimova to be one of the event s sponsors  apparently without our approval   the uzbekistan president s daughter  will be listed in the program and will see  bill clinton    he said   would  the u s  government  have concerns  if so  we can go back to organizer and ask them to return her sponsorship and disinvite her  however i assume that would ruffle some feathers   desai said  the emails released to citizens united don t contain a reply to desai s inquiry  however  a collection of photos from the monaco event posted on the internet show karimova attended it  they do not show any pictures of her with bill clinton
