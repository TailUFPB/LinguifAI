washington  reuters    when donald trump and hillary clinton face off in their first presidential debate together on monday  they will have their best chance yet to win over the roughly  million americans who have yet to decide who to vote for  in some ways  this group looks like a typical trump supporter  they are mainly white  without college degrees  older  and frustrated by the status quo  but while trump s supporters are mostly men  america s uncommitted voters are mostly women  according to reuters ipsos polling  with polls showing a close fight between trump and hillary  this is a group that could decide the election   katie packer  a republican strategist who served as a top aide to mitt romney in  said polls show that many undecided women have been put off by trump s inflammatory rhetoric  while others see clinton  the first female presidential candidate from a major u s  party  as dishonest   these are the same women who don t trust hillary and think she s phony   she said   but trump is scary to them       roughly  percent of america s likely voters are still on the fence  compared to just  percent at the same time in the  election  underscoring the unpopularity of both trump and clinton   some  percent of them think the country is on the  wrong track   which puts them more in line with trump supporters than clinton backers  they are also similar in age to many trump backers  some  percent are at least  years old  and  percent never earned a college degree  compared with  percent for trump supporters and  percent for clinton supporters  gender wise  they track more closely with clinton s base  some  percent are women  trump s base is made up of about  percent women  compared with  percent for clinton  the most recent reuters ipsos poll found clinton leading trump by  percentage points in a two way race  the democratic nominee has mostly led trump in the poll this year  but the gap between the two candidates has narrowed with six weeks left before the nov   election   with neither candidate a clear favorite on issues like creating jobs or keeping the nation safe  nearly a third of uncommitted voters said they may be more likely to vote for a third party candidate than for either clinton or trump   one of the most important issues in this election is just making sure that our country has a future both through education and jobs   said undecided voter erika szotek    of hanover park  illinois  who voted for romney in   she said she thought trump s  flamboyancy is going to get the country into a lot of trouble with other countries   but she isn t sold on clinton either   there are some things i just don t trust about her    women have been a lingering problem for trump  whose unfiltered speaking style and fiery rhetoric on immigration and security have put many off  he has also gotten into trouble for some remarks he has made about women  he was widely criticized for saying fox news host megyn kelly had  blood coming out of her wherever   a comment many interpreted as referring to her menstruating  although he insisted that was not what he meant   he has also called television personality rosie o donnell a  fat pig  and made fun of former presidential rival and ex hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina s face  saying   would anyone vote for that   clinton s campaign has seized on the vulnerability  this week it launched an ad titled  mirrors  that shows images of girls looking in mirrors while recordings of trump comment on women s weight and breast size  calling them  slob    pig   and  fat     but clinton has her own troubles  multiple polls show that her use of a private email server without approval while secretary of state has deepened voters  mistrust of her even though she has since acknowledged it was a mistake  trump frequently calls her  crooked hillary   fbi director james comey recommended in july that no criminal charges be brought against clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state  but he called her use of the server  extremely careless       ruth hammett    of kingsland  georgia  said she would be looking to the debates for guidance on which candidate to support  she is leaning toward clinton but wants to hear both candidates address national security      i m very scared  most so for my kids and my grandkids   hammett said   i m scared to death
