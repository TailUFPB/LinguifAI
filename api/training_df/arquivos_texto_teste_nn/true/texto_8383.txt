washington  reuters    immigration advocates on thursday mounted a long shot effort to revive part of u s  president barack obama s plan to shield millions of immigrants from deportation by filing a lawsuit challenging the national scope of a court order that blocked it  with favorable court rulings  the lawyers filing the lawsuit say it has the long term potential to unravel decisions that blocked obama s november  plan nationwide  the white house program  if it had been fully implemented  could have allowed up to four million people with no legal immigration status to obtain work authorization  the lawsuit was filed in federal court in new york on behalf of martin batalla vidal    an immigrant from mexico who has lived in the united states since he was seven and has benefited from the program   he initially received a three year work authorization  which has now been revoked due to a texas judge s ruling in february  that blocked obama s plan  texas and  other states had challenged it  vidal would still be eligible for a two year work authorization under an earlier program  which has not been challenged and was not covered by the injunction  vidal s lawyers at the national immigration law center say that if he wins  the ruling could have broad implications because it could help to eventually reinstate obama s program for up to  percent of potential applicants in parts of the country not covered by the texas ruling   the texas judge s ruling was upheld on appeal  on june   the supreme court deadlocked   on the case  leaving the appeals court decision in place   the court is currently one justice short following the death of justice antonin scalia in february  the supreme court is currently considering whether to rehear the case once it has a full complement of justices
