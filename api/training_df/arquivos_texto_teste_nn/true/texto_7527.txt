washington  reuters    hillary clinton has one of the strongest resumes of anyone ever to run for u s  president  with stints as first lady  senator and secretary of state  but she is also a polarizing figure and a washington insider with decades of political baggage  should democrat clinton    defeat republican donald trump    in tuesday s election  she would become the first woman elected u s  president  having already been the only first lady to win elected office and the first woman nominated for president by a major u s  party  clinton fell short in her first presidential bid in   losing her party s nomination to barack obama  her time on the american political scene has come during an era of intense partisanship and gaping divisions in u s  society  americans hold dramatically differing views of clinton  clinton s admirers consider her a tough  capable and sometimes inspirational leader who has endured unrelenting efforts by political enemies to chop her down  her detractors consider her an unscrupulous and power hungry opportunist  clinton entered the  race as her party s odds on favorite  but was an establishment figure  the ultimate insider with decades of political baggage  at a time when voters seemed enamored with outsiders  she staved off an unexpectedly stiff challenge from u s  senator bernie sanders  who describes himself as a democratic socialist  to claim the democratic nomination in july  for decades clinton has battled conservatives and republican adversaries and weathered controversies including her husband bill clinton s infidelity  a failed republican effort to remove him from office  investigations into past business dealings and her use of a private email server as secretary of state  she famously complained in  during her husband s presidency about a  vast right wing conspiracy   many democrats back her for championing women s rights at home and abroad  social justice and access to healthcare  but opinion polls show a majority of u s  voters do not trust her   against trump  she portrayed her candidacy as a bulwark against a unique threat that she said the real estate developer posed to american democracy  as president obama s secretary of state from  to   she grappled with civil wars in syria and libya  iran s nuclear program  china s growing clout  russian assertiveness  ending the iraq war  winding down the afghanistan war  and an unsuccessful bid to settle the israeli palestinian conflict  clinton was already running for president when  during a testy  hour congressional hearing in october   she deflected republican criticism of her handling of a  attack by militants in benghazi  libya in which the u s  ambassador died  that hearing and another in january  while she was still secretary of state focused on allegations of state department security lapses related to the attack  a mistrust of rivals and the media has long prompted clinton to keep her guard up   the truth is  through all these years of public service  the  service  part has always come easier to me than the  public  part   clinton said in accepting the  democratic nomination   i get it that some people just don t know what to make of me   at the same convention  obama cited her years of experience and said   there has never been a man or woman  not me  not bill   nobody more qualified than hillary clinton to serve as president of the united states   republicans have accused clinton of breaking the law while corresponding through a private email server as secretary of state  in july  fbi director james comey called clinton  extremely careless  in her handling of classified information by email  but obama s justice department accepted his recommendation not to bring criminal charges   if i had to do it over again  i would  obviously  do it differently   clinton said during a sept   debate with trump  referring to her use of the private server as a  mistake  for which she took responsibility  the controversy flared again on oct   when comey told u s  lawmakers the fbi was investigating a new trove of emails as part of its probe  but said their significance was unclear  trump seized on the probe into clinton s email  deriding her as  crooked hillary   saying he would seek to put her behind bars if elected and encouraging his supporters to chant  lock her up   clinton portrayed trump as a racist hate monger  a sexist and a tax dodger enamored with russian president vladimir putin and unfit to serve as president and commander in chief   such a nasty woman   trump retorted during their oct   debate when she suggested he would try to get out of paying the higher taxes she advocates for the wealthy  born in chicago on oct      hillary rodham clinton was  the

clinton during the campaign of a sexual affair  hillary clinton appeared on tv with her husband and referred to singer tammy wynette s song   stand by your man    you know  i m not sitting here  some little woman standing by my man like tammy wynette   she said  adding that she loved and respected her husband   and you know  if that s not enough for people  then heck  don t vote for him   she

murdered to cover up what he  knew about whitewater     in   the independent counsel investigation concluded there was insufficient evidence to show the clintons had been involved in any criminal behavior related to whitewater  in december   the republican led house of representatives voted to impeach a president for only the second time in u s  history  charging bill clinton with  high crimes and misdemeanors  for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his relationship with lewinsky  the republican led senate acquitted clinton in february   hillary clinton called
