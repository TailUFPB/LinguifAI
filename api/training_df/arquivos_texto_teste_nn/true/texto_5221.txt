washington  reuters    the national security agency risks a brain drain of hackers and cyber spies due to a tumultuous reorganization and worries about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and president donald trump  according to current and former nsa officials and cybersecurity industry sources  half a dozen cybersecurity executives told reuters they had witnessed a marked increase in the number of u s  intelligence officers and government contractors seeking employment in the private sector since trump took office on jan     one of the executives  who would speak only on condition of anonymity  said he was stunned by the caliber of the would be recruits  they are coming from a variety of government intelligence and law enforcement agencies  multiple executives said  and their interest stems in part from concerns about the direction of u s intelligence agencies under trump    retaining and recruiting talented technical personnel has become a top national security priority in recent years as russia  china  iran and other nation states and criminal groups have sharpened their cyber offensive abilities  nsa and other intelligence agencies have long struggled to deter some of their best employees from leaving for higher paying jobs in silicon valley and elsewhere  the problem is especially acute at nsa  current and former officials said  due to a reorganization known as  that began last year and aims to merge the agency s electronic eavesdropping and domestic cyber security operations  the two year overhaul includes expanding parts of nsa that deal with business management and human resources and putting them on par with research and engineering  the aim is to  ensure that we re using all of our resources to maximum effect to accomplish our mission   nsa director mike rogers said  the changes include new management structures that have left some career employees uncertain about their missions and  prospects  former employees say the reorganization has failed to address widespread concerns that the agency is falling behind in exploiting private sector technological breakthroughs  a former top nsa official said he had been told by three current officials that budget problems meant there was too little money for promotions  that is especially important for younger employees  who sometimes need two jobs to make ends meet in the expensive washington d c  area  the official said   morale is as low as i ve ever seen it   said another former senior nsa official  who maintains close contact with current employees  asked about the risk of losing talent from nsa and other agencies  white house spokesman michael anton said trump had sought to reassure the intelligence community by visiting the cia headquarters on his first full day in office  anton also pointed to the military spending increase in trump s budget proposal released on monday   it will likely take more than a visit to the cia to patch up relations with the intelligence community  the current and former officials said  trump has attacked findings from intelligence agencies that russia hacked emails belonging to democratic party operatives during the  presidential campaign to help him win  though he did eventually accept the findings   in january  trump accused intelligence agencies of leaking  false information and said it was reminiscent of tactics used in nazi germany  the breadth of any exodus from the nsa and other intelligence agencies is difficult to quantify  the nsa has  seen a steady rise  in the attrition rate among its roughly   employees since   and it now sits at a  little less than six percent   according to an nsa spokesman  nsa director michael rogers said last year that the attrition rate was   percent in   suggesting a sharp jump in departures since then  several senior nsa officials who have left or plan to leave  including deputy director richard ledgett and the head of cyber defense  curtis dukes  have said their departures were unrelated to trump or the reorganization  some turnover is normal with any new administration  government and industry officials noted  and a stronger economy has also improved pay and prospects in the private sector    during this time the economy has been recovering from the recession  unemployment rates have been falling and the demand for highly skilled technical talent has been increasing   an nsa spokesman said  when asked to comment on the reports of employee departures  in a statement  kathy hutson  nsa s chief of human resources  said the agency continues  to attract amazing talent necessary to conduct the security mission the nation needs   some nsa veterans attribute the morale issues and staff departures to the leadership style of rogers  who took over the spy agency in  with the task of dousing an international furor caused by leaks from former contractor edward snowden  concern about rogers reached an apex last october  when former defense secretary ash carter and former director of national intelligence james clapper recommended to then president barack obama that rogers be removed   the nsa did not respond to a request for comment on the recommendation last fall that rogers be replaced   rogers is now expected to retain his job at nsa for at least another year  according to former officials  rogers acknowledged concerns about potential morale problems last month  telling a congressional committee that trump s broadsides against the intelligence community could create  a situation where our workforce decides to walk    trump s criticism of the intelligence community has exacerbated the stress caused by the reorganization at the nsa  said susan hennessey  a former nsa lawyer now with brookings institution   the  tone coming from the white house makes an already difficult situation worse  by eroding the sense of common purpose and service   she said   a wave of departures of career personnel  hennessey added    would represent an incalculable loss to national security
