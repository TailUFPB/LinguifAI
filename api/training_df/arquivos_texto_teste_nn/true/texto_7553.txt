washington  reuters    long frustrated backers of statehood for the district of columbia are pinning their hopes on a first ever referendum on tuesday in a long shot bid to become the  u s  state  invoking the colonial era demand of  no taxation without representation   supporters say becoming a state would end washingtonians  status as second class citizens because they lack representation in congress  but opponents dismiss the referendum as a  fool s errand   destined to fail because of partisan political hurdles and the need to amend the u s  constitution  a procedure accomplished only  times since   the district of columbia was carved out to serve as the nation s capital  but it is not a state  its   residents have no voting representative in the senate or house of representatives although they pay federal taxes  though they do have a delegate in the house    a  yes  vote could help pressure the new congress and president   either democrat hillary clinton or republican donald trump   to admit the district of columbia as a new state  though even advocates admit that is unlikely anytime soon  a  yes  vote would simply be an expression of public support for statehood  a non binding measure without any legal force   statehood s the only way that we can have the same rights and responsibilities as all the other citizens of the united states   district of columbia council chairman phil mendelson said  the overwhelmingly democratic capital city was fed up with republican lawmakers espousing the rights of states and cities to self governance and then interfering with local issues such as abortion and marijuana legalization  mendelson said   that s so antithetical to democratic principles  but that doesn t seem to bother some of these folks   he said  the referendum seeks to upend the constitution s provision giving congress legislative control over the district of columbia  voters will cast a single  yes  or  no  vote on the referendum s four parts  admission as a state  its boundaries  approval of a constitution  and guarantees of a representative form of government  the new state would embrace the current  square mile   square km  district except for a core of federal property around the white house  capitol and monument rich national mall   the district council approved the referendum unanimously  and a washington post poll in november  showed  percent of residents backed statehood  the democratic party s national platform also supports the idea   if you re not part of a state  large parts of the constitution don t apply to you   said statehood advocate ann loikow  mayor muriel bowser and other statehood backers took the vote s design from the successful bid in the  by tennessee  then a federal territory  to become a state through a referendum and petition to congress  supporters and skeptics say that even if the referendum passes it would face a dead end in congress  where republicans would oppose statehood since it would add democratic senators and a representative to congress  besides the political obstacles  roger pilon  a constitutional scholar at the libertarian cato institute  called the statehood quest a  fool s errand  because of constitutional obstacles  for the district to become a state  congress would have to propose an amendment to the constitution  which would then have to win a two thirds majority vote in both the senate and the house   even if an amendment could win approval in both houses of congress  it would face another big hurdle  approval by the legislatures of at least three fourths of the  states  washingtonians have tried to achieve statehood before  but never by an up or down referendum  congress ignored a statehood petition that included a constitution voters ratified in the   the house of representatives rejected a statehood bill in   and it failed to reach a senate vote  a constitutional amendment for voting rights in congress fizzled in the
