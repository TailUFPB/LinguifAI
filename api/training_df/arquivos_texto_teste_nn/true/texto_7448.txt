washington  reuters    donald trump was right  countless others were wrong  the pundits and pollsters who said the former reality tv star could not win the u s  presidency  the republicans who shunned him  the business leaders who denounced him and the democrats who dismissed him failed to fully understand the depth of his support   in a stunning victory over democrat hillary clinton  trump stuck to a plan that worked to perfection in the republican primary  a campaign built around his blunt talking celebrity persona  his command of social media  and his anti establishment message of change   ours was not a campaign  but an incredible and great movement   trump said in his victory speech on wednesday   it was a movement driven by discontent  the reuters ipsos election day poll found that most americans who came to the polls were clearly angry with the direction of the country  six out of  people said they felt the country is on the wrong track  some  percent said  more and more i don t identify with what america has become  and  percent said  america needs a strong leader to take the country back  from the wealthy  those who felt the country was on the wrong track were three times as likely to vote for trump as clinton   in a bitter and divisive campaign  trump cleared a series of obstacles that would doom any other candidate  an audio tape in which he talked of groping women  a refusal to release his tax returns  violence at his rallies  his mockery of a disabled  reporter  and his attacks on the heritage of a federal judge and the muslim family of a u s  soldier    he was an imperfect candidate with a near perfect message   said ford o connell  a republican strategist who has long backed trump   i don t think a lot of people understood that   in a year when voters in the united states and abroad showed their antipathy toward the political establishment  the globalized economy  and corporate welfare  trump guessed correctly he could ride that wave of discontent to the white house   he exploited a growing divide in the country between whites and minorities  urbanites and rural residents  the college educated and the working class  trump beat clinton among white men without a college degree by  points and white women without a degree by  points  according to the reuters ipsos polling   he also benefited from an opponent with her own flaws  clinton was continually dragged down by questions over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and the activities of her family foundation  while her corporate friendly background left some democrats skeptical and unenthusiastic  that appeared to cost her support among women  young voters and minorities   three groups that are critical for democrats to win big  clinton won each of these groups  but by smaller margins than president barack obama held when he defeated republican candidate mitt romney in   some  percent of women supported clinton  the first woman nominee of a major party  while  percent supported trump   among women between the ages of  and   about  percent supported clinton  while  percent supported trump  in    percent of young women supported obama  while  percent supported romney  white voters  especially men in rural areas  flocked to trump in record numbers  trump appealed to voters unhappy with the hollowing out of the country s manufacturing sector and fearful of the country s changing demographics  campaigning on a harsh anti immigration message    trump won  percent of the white vote  while clinton won just  percent  he dominated to an even greater degree in rural areas  where he beat clinton by  points  trump promised big things  that he would bring jobs back and punish outsourcing corporations  that he would restore the country to some unspecified early time of prosperity and security   even as unemployment tumbled below  percent  specifics were never trump s strength  instead  he used an  us versus them  message to build voter enthusiasm in places where most republican candidates never ventured  rural areas with voters who felt ignored by washington  matt borges  the chairman of the ohio republican party  said trump  unlike romney  made voters feel like they mattered  before trump  he said   we weren t listening to what voters actually care about   trump thumbed his nose at the extensive get out the vote operation and data rich organization that are seen as essential to a modern winning campaign   his campaign relied instead on more unofficial networks of rabid supporters to get the word out  his advisers argued that he would bring scores of neglected white voters back into the political process  including blue collar democrats in places such as pennsylvania  until trump  republicans had not won pennsylvania since   craig robinson  a veteran of iowa republican politics  said pundits underestimated how trump s strength in the primaries would carry over to the general election    in an election where the conventional wisdom was proven wrong time and time again  they convinced themselves that conventional wisdom would prevail in the general election   robinson said   the voters saw through it
