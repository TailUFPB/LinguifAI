washington  reuters    republican lawmakers in u s  congress on wednesday rejected two democratic amendments to provide nearly   billion in funding for bipartisan legislation intended to combat america s opioid epidemic  aides said  the rejection  which came during a meeting of u s  house of representatives and senate negotiators on the measure  could undermine democratic support for final legislation that could come up for a vote in the house of representatives as early as friday  the house and senate each passed its own versions of the legislation in the last few months  house and senate democratic lawmakers are now withholding their support for the final version of the bill  according to two democratic aides  democratic opposition could prove to be an obstacle  especially in the senate  where lawmakers need  votes to move legislation forward   two amendments  from house and senate democrats  would have provided   million up front to finance program grants for states  aides said the programs otherwise require completion of a lengthy appropriations process that could stall in a congressional session shortened by this year s election campaign  republican aides were not immediately available for comment  but house republicans are separately considering a health spending measure that would provide more than   million to address opioid abuse  house democratic caucus chairman xavier becerra said on wednesday it was only the latest instance in which legislation with bipartisan backing fell short on funding   it s becoming a bit of a joke to say we re concerned and want to do something  when the only thing we ll do is shell of what it actually takes   he said
