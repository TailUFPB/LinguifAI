washington  reuters    president donald trump has launched a charm offensive of the type not seen before in his brief and chaotic tenure  forcefully rallying behind legislation to repeal the obamacare healthcare law while trying to placate the bill s opponents  in doing so  the often blustery trump faces a test of credibility for the voters that catapulted him into office  how does a celebrity outsider  the ceo president  cut deals in washington  does the new york businessman live up to the image of dealmaker in chief  interviews with more than a dozen white house and congressional aides  members of congress and conservative activists offer a glimpse into his attempts at conducting the most formidable  high stakes negotiation of his presidency  they show a more circumspect trump than many see publicly  while they acknowledge he can make his points with a blunt and combustible style  he appears to be doing more listening than talking  they said  trying to appease both supporters and critics by signaling flexibility over legislation that faces criticism on multiple fronts   democrats and some influential republicans say it would rip health insurance away from millions of americans and increase costs for many others  including voters who helped elect trump   a problem that could haunt his fellow republicans in  congressional elections  conservatives say it does not go far enough in gutting the affordable care act  president barack obama s signature healthcare reform passed by democrats in   republicans have long sought to dismantle the law  which they see as government overreach  trump has called obamacare a  disaster  and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge  the political stakes are immense for an eight week old  presidency marked by instability  infighting  battles with the media  questions over temperament and a stubborn investigation into ties between his campaign and russian intelligence   a lot of times you have politicians who gather in a room to pontificate  that s not why he has gathered people in the room   a senior white house official said of trump s negotiation style this week   he s gathered people in to hear their opinions  i think that s lost a little bit because he does speak so forcefully  he definitely does let them say their piece  and he listens   the president has reached out to influential conservatives such as u s  senator ted cruz and groups such as the heritage foundation and americans for prosperity  which have expressed skepticism about the bill   he was gregarious  reasonable  he listened  it was a not a lecture   said tim phillips  president of afp  a group backed by billionaires charles and david koch and part of a small group of conservative leaders who met with trump in the oval office on wednesday night   he said   this is a negotiation  let s figure out ways to make this proposal better    phillips said of trump   trump has indicated he will only go so far to make conservatives happy  insisting the core elements of the bill must remain intact if it has any chance to pass the house of representatives and then the senate  both controlled by republicans  one sticking point involves the use of tax credits to help consumers purchase health insurance  which trump favors   he s made it clear this is the vehicle to finally undo the damage of obamacare and repeal and replace it   said another senior white house official   and if it can be improved in this process  he has encouraged that   trump is operating with a razor thin margin for success  a defection by  or so republicans in the house could sink the bill s prospects  there is already discontent among some in the senate  where republicans hold an even slimmer edge  democrats and groups such as aarp  which advocates for older americans  and the american medical association have come out strongly against the bill   conservatives in the house and advocacy groups opposed to the bill would like to slow the process and rework its fundamentals  they argue the legislation retains basic facets of obamacare  including federal assistance to purchase health insurance and penalties if coverage lapses   house speaker paul ryan is hoping to pass the legislation within two weeks so the house can move on to other priorities  that leaves little time for wholesale alterations  representative kevin brady  chairman of the house ways and means committee  said he expected the bill would largely remain in its current form   i know lots of people have good ideas  that s terrific  and those will fit in future bills   the white house has tried to persuade conservatives that the house bill is just the first step in a three step process  and will soon be joined by a companion bill that would embrace some of their policy priorities  regulations put in place by secretary of health and human services tom price will also address their concerns  aides said   the challenge for trump is whether he can convince enough wary conservatives to back the first step of the plan without being able to guarantee the other phases will come to pass  it could leave them on the record voting for a bill they do not feel adequately dismantles obamacare  some conservatives may also not see the point of sticking their necks out backing a bill that may die in the senate   this is a futile effort   said rachel bovard  a policy analyst for the heritage foundation  which opposes the bill  the white house is aggressively making the case that the house bill is the best chance to do away with obamacare  moving too far rightward to placate conservatives could stir up opposition from moderate republicans and lead to a bill that stokes a powerful backlash among millions of americans who would lose health insurance   including many republicans  many democrats are already planning to run campaigns on the issue  the white house was busy this week trying to reassure moderate republicans as well  vice president mike pence is holding meetings in congress  including with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican aide said  trump s budget director  mick mulvaney  a former house member  has invited conservative lawmakers to dinner at the white house next tuesday   trump plans to leverage the power of his office in another way  making trips to kentucky and tennessee in coming days to sell the house bill to the american public   earlier this week  trump welcomed about  republican house members  many of whom said they had never been in the white house before   a contrast in style from obama  who was often criticized for not attempting to engage more fully with congress  in the east room  trump told them to come back every week   grover norquist  a longtime conservative tax advocate  praised trump s strategy  saying   he is making people feel loved and appreciated and part of the team
