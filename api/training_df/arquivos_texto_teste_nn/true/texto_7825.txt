washington  reuters    the death of thailand s king bhumibol adulyadej on thursday  adds a new layer of uncertainty to u s  president barack obama s faltering  pivot  to asia less than a month before the nov   u s  presidential elections  the king was important in cementing the long standing alliance between the united states and thailand after world war two  in a reign that spanned the vietnam war and development of the association of southeast asian nations  asean   which washington still considers vital to maintaining its influence in the region  king bhumibol s death coincides with faltering momentum in   obama s signature policy of rebalancing the u s  diplomatic and security focus to the asia pacific region in the face of china s rapid rise  the main economic pillar of the rebalance  the  nation  trans pacific partnership trade deal  is languishing in the u s  congress with no guarantee that obama will be able to push it through before leaving the presidency to hillary clinton or donald trump  both of whom say they oppose the deal  clinton  as secretary of state under fellow democrat obama from    was one of the architects of the policy but republican trump has questioned the extent to which he would maintain the u s  security commitment to east asia  obama s efforts to boost security ties with southeast asia have come in response to china s pursuit of territorial claims in the south china sea  a vital strategic waterway  however  a torrent of anti american rhetoric from new philippines president rodrigo duterte has cast doubt on the u s   military relationship with manila just months after washington reached an agreement on rotating access to bases in the country  other southeast asian countries  such as indonesia and malaysia  are focused on internal political issues and are avoiding playing any leadership role in asean  while even traditionally reliable regional ally australia is treading carefully to avoid jeopardizing its economic ties with beijing  thailand was already occupying a back seat in regional affairs following a  military coup seen as a means to maintain stability during the king s long illness  thailand is expected to turn further inward during a prolonged mourning period and potentially politically fragile royal succession  king bhumibol s son  crown prince maha vajiralongkorn  who is expected to become thailand s new king  lacks the strong connection to the united states of his father  who was born in cambridge  massachusetts  obama offered condolences to the thai people and the king s family  calling king bhumibol  a tireless champion of his country s development   obama s former top asia adviser  evan medeiros  now at the eurasia group  said the mourning process would likely slow a return to democratic government and prince vajiralongkorn was a source of  profound uncertainty     he s such an unknown  unpredictable figure   he said  u s  state department spokesman mark toner said the united states and thailand had been close friends for two centuries   our friendship and our partnership have weathered many challenges   we expect it to continue to grow stronger   toner told a regular news briefing  while the united states backed a return to democracy  toner said it would be  premature    to lay our expectations for the near term  as thailand mourned  while washington condemned the  coup  it has kept  security ties with bangkok  particularly through annual military exercises called cobra gold   the fact that we have been able to remain closely tethered and stayed largely on track with cobra gold and other cooperative efforts  notwithstanding the military takeover     is testament to the strong roots we have put down and the work that we re doing   the senior u s  diplomat for asia  assistant secretary of state daniel russel  said on wednesday  murray hiebert of washington s center for strategic and international studies think tank  said much had changed since obama announced his pivot policy in    the king s death adds to uncertainty in southeast asia  a region in considerable flux already  this makes the u s  rebalance to asia more difficult because the situation in so many countries is that of  wait and see     when the pivot started  you had thailand engaged  a new leader in malaysia who wanted to engage  you had aquino coming in the philippines and very forward leaning internationally and very open to the u s   you had an internationalist president in indonesia  it was a rather different dynamic   king bhumibol s death means washington finds itself having to rely even more on former foe vietnam for any kind of strategic ballast in the region   the vietnamese are providing the dynamism when it comes to strategic thinking   u s  ambassador to vietnam ted osius said in washington on tuesday    indonesia is very internally focused right now     thailand is very internally focused  and malaysia has a rolling political crisis   he continued   i don t know exactly what direction the philippines is headed  singapore has a lot of strategic thinkers but it s a city state  i don t think you can really count on laos  cambodia and myanmar to provide the strategic engine for asean   there appears little prospect for now  however  that vietnam would be willing to open its doors further to the u s  military should the deal with the philippines run into problems  given past animosities and concerns about china   i do not expect the vietnamese calculation to be   oh  the philippines is doing whatever it s doing  let s race full steam ahead with the united states   no  that s not about to happen   osius said    the vietnamese have been very measured in the pace at which they have expanded the security relationship   hiebert said asian countries remain keen on the u s  pivot  given their worries about china  but the pace was likely to flag further  presenting a tougher task to revive the initiative once obama leaves power   i wouldn t declare the pivot dead     i think there s still quite a bit of interest in the u s   but some of the sort of dynamism that we saw earlier about building the region is a little bit diminished right now   he said
