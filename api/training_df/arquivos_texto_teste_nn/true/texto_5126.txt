washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump accused predecessor barack obama on saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the  election campaign  but offered no evidence for an allegation which an obama spokesman said was  simply false   trump made the accusation in a series of early morning tweets just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaign s ties to russia   how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy    trump wrote in one tweet   i d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october  just prior to election   the remarkable tussle between the current and former presidents just  days since the handover of power is the latest twist in a controversy over ties between trump associates and russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency  u s  intelligence agencies concluded last year that russia hacked and leaked democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in trump s favor  the kremlin has denied the allegations  trump has accused officials in obama s administration of trying to discredit him with questions about russia contacts  obama spokesman kevin lewis said it had been a  cardinal rule  of the obama administration that no white house official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the department of justice   neither president obama nor any white house official ever ordered surveillance on any u s  citizen  any suggestion otherwise is simply false   lewis said in a statement  the statement did not address the possibility that a wiretap of the trump campaign could have been ordered by justice department officials  trump said the alleged wiretapping took place in his trump tower office and apartment building in new york  but there was  nothing found   the white house did not respond to a request to elaborate on trump s accusations  trump was spending the weekend at his florida seaside resort  mar a lago  he was scheduled to meet with attorney general jeff sessions and homeland security secretary john kelly before a dinner with officials also including adviser steve bannon and white house counsel don mcgahn  the white house said  amid a political storm  sessions on thursday announced he would stay out of any probe into alleged russian meddling in the  presidential election after it emerged he met last year with russia s ambassador  although he maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meeting  a trump spokeswoman said the president spent part of saturday  having meetings  making phone calls and hitting balls  at his golf course in west palm beach  his supporters  meanwhile  staged small rallies in at least  of the country s  states  most of which passed off peacefully  but there were clashes in the famously left leaning city of berkeley  california  where protesters from both sides hit each other over the head with wooden sticks  trump s tweets caught his aides by surprise  with one saying it was unclear what the president was referring to  members of congress said trump s accusations require investigation or explanation  senator ben sasse  a republican  described the allegations as serious and said the public deserved more information  he said in a statement it was possible that trump had been illegally tapped  but  if so  the president should explain what sort of tap it was and how he knew about it  u s  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  called trump s assertion a  spectacularly reckless allegation    if there is something bad or sick going on  it is the willingness of the nation s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them   schiff said in a statement  former obama adviser ben rhodes strongly denied trump s allegations   no president can order a wiretap  those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you   rhodes wrote on twitter  trump s administration has come under pressure from federal bureau of investigation and congressional investigations into contacts between some members of his campaign team and russian officials during his campaign   republican senator lindsey graham said he had no knowledge of any wiretapping but was  very worried  about the suggestion obama had acted illegally and would also be concerned  if in fact the obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about trump campaign activity   several other republicans again urged an investigation into a series of intelligence related leaks  obama imposed sanctions on russia and ordered russian diplomats to leave the united states in december over the country s involvement in hacking political parties in the nov   u s  presidential election  under u s  law  a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an  agent of a foreign power  in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of trump tower  several conservative news outlets and commentators have made allegations in recent days about trump being wiretapped during the campaign  without offering any evidence  trump s first national security adviser  michael flynn  resigned in february after revelations that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office    flynn had promised vice president mike pence he had not discussed u s  sanctions with the russians  but transcripts of intercepted communications  described by u s  officials  showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the russian ambassador
