washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court ruled on tuesday that a former police detective can sue a new jersey city claiming he was demoted as punishment after getting a campaign sign for his bedridden mother supporting the mayor s rival in a  local election  the court  in its   ruling  found that jeffrey heffernan  a now former member of paterson s police force  was not in fact exercising his rights to freedom of association under the u s  constitution s first amendment because he picked up the sign for his mother and not himself  but the justices decided he could sue the city for violating those rights because the boss who demoted him believed  albeit mistakenly  that heffernan supported the mayor s opponent   we conclude that     the government s reason for demoting heffernan is what counts here   justice stephen breyer wrote for the court   when an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the first amendment protects  the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action     even if  as here  the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee s behavior   the high court reversed a  ruling by the philadelphia based  u s  circuit court of appeals dismissing heffernan s lawsuit on the grounds that a first amendment retaliation claim cannot be based on an employer s perception of a worker s actions  the day before heffernan was demoted  an aide to jose torres  paterson s mayor at the time who was running for re election  saw heffernan getting a large campaign sign backing another mayoral candidate  heffernan said he got the sign while off duty as a favor for his mother after her previous sign had been stolen from her front yard  and that the sign did not reflect his personal preference in the mayoral election  the next day  the police department demoted him from detective and transferred him to the traffic division s walking squad  a move he saw as political retaliation  justice clarence thomas wrote the dissenting opinion  arguing that heffernan should not be able to sue regardless of whether his demotion was misguided or wrong because he had not been exercising his constitutional rights
