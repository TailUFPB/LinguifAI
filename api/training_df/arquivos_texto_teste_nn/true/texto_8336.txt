washington  reuters    u s  president barack obama shortened the prison sentences of  convicts serving time for drug related offenses in his second round of clemency grants this month  the white house said on tuesday  obama has now granted a total of  commutations during his presidency  more than the number granted by the  previous presidents combined  as he seeks to reform the criminal justice system  it said   for some of the convicts  the commutations mean they will serve only half of their original prison sentences  for instance  sly stallone aikens of south carolina  serving a sentence of  months for using and carrying a gun during a drug trafficking crime  will now serve only  months  more than one third of the  convicts had been serving life sentences      obama has made reducing the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses a priority  it is one of the rare issues where the president gets support from republican lawmakers  he launched the clemency program in   inviting thousands of drug offenders and others to seek early release  it was the most ambitious such program in  years  but it has struggled under a flood of thousands of unprocessed cases  the white house counsel  neil eggleston  said he expects obama will continue to grant commutations through the end of his presidency  which ends on jan    but only legislation passed by congress can  achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively   eggleston said
