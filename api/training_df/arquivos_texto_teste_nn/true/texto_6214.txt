washington  reuters    he is ready for some quiet time  plans to do some writing and intends to give his successor space to govern  at least on most issues  president barack obama gave some insight into his vision for life after the white house during a final news conference on wednesday in which he praised the role of a free press and shared personal reflections on how his daughters had dealt with the results of the  election  obama and his family will leave for palm springs  california  on friday after the inauguration of republican donald trump as the  president of the united states   i want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much   said obama    who wants to write a book during his first year out of office and spend time with his family  obama  a democrat who made history in  when he was elected america s first black president  has said repeatedly he appreciated the example set by his predecessor  republican george w  bush  who steadfastly refrained from weighing in publicly with his views after leaving the oval office  but obama made clear there were some issues on which he would not hesitate to speak out   issues  where i think our core values may be at stake   like new obstacles to voting   institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press  and any push to deport undocumented people who were brought to america as children  in   obama said his administration would allow people brought to the united states illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work   one of the executive actions on immigration that trump has pledged to undo   the notion that we would just arbitrarily or because of politics punish those kids  when they didn t do anything wrong themselves  i think would be something that would merit me speaking out   obama said  the obamas will live in washington  where sasha    is finishing high school  malia    has been accepted to harvard university but is taking a  gap year  break before starting this autumn  the president and his wife  michelle obama  campaigned hard for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton last year  the first lady  in particular  made an impassioned case for clinton  her husband s first secretary of state  after a leaked recording showed trump talking openly about groping women  obama said his daughters did not  mope  or feel cynical after the loss   they were disappointed  they paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it s consistent with what we ve tried to teach them in our household   obama said   but what we ve also tried to teach them is resilience  and we ve tried to teach them hope  and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world   similarly  obama has sought to reassure his staff and others about the election results  in keeping with his cool headed  dispassionate style   and so this is not just a matter of  no drama obama   this is what i really believe   obama said   but at my core  i think we re going to be ok
