 washington  reuters    when the bosses of some of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies headed to washington in january to meet u s  president donald trump  it had all the makings of a potentially hostile meeting   just weeks before  trump had sent drug stock prices plummeting after accusing the companies of  getting away with murder  by charging too much for medicines   but the trump who greeted chief executives of johnson   johnson  jnj n   novartis  novn s   merck  mrk n   eli lilly  lly n   celgene  celg o  and amgen  amgn o  on jan   was a surprisingly genial host who even gave them a personal tour of the oval office  according to several participants in the breakfast    there is no question that it was better than it could have been or we thought it could be   said one industry insider familiar with the meeting   trump did not repeat his public attacks on the industry  instead  he focused on  outdated  regulations that drive costs up for drugmakers  according to participants interviewed by reuters  the ceos left with trump s word that he would streamline regulations and reform the high u s  corporate tax rate   since taking office on jan    trump has held at least nine meetings with groups of business leaders  including automakers  airlines  retailers and health insurers  on wednesday  he was hosting lunch for a group of new york real estate developers and private equity ceos  during which possible private public partnerships on infrastructure would be discussed  according to a person briefed on the meeting  in early morning or late night tweets and in speeches  trump has lambasted many of these companies for cost over runs  or high prices  or foreign manufacturing  often knocking down their share prices   but reuters interviews with nearly a dozen executives and lobbyists who have taken part in these meetings or have been briefed on them reveal a trump who is very different from his uncompromising and demanding  realdonaldtrump twitter handle   when he meets the nation s top chief executives in person  he is a mix of charm and cajoling  this trump is flexible and inquisitive  a schmoozer who remembers birthdays and often lavishes praise on their companies  said the people  who spoke on condition of anonymity so they could freely discuss private meetings   this private side of trump sheds light on why many ceos have expressed confidence that the republican president is good for business  despite his share denting public attacks  as recently as tuesday  trump tweeted he was working on a system to increase competition in the health industry and lower drug pricing  sending pharma shares lower   in the white house meetings  trump focuses much of his talk on cutting regulations  the sources said  underscoring one of his administration s key priorities   getting rid of rules imposed by his predecessor barack obama  he typically asks which regulations are holding businesses back from adding new jobs and promises to resolve the issues  executives say    he said one thing for the cameras and the door shuts and then it s like kumbaya   said one person who was briefed on a meeting between trump and a group of ceos    he likes to be seen as engaging and buddy buddy with other big important business leaders   said this person   a former businessman  trump runs his closed door meetings with ceos as if they were a corporate board meeting  attendees said  in contrast to his doctrinaire tweets  he likes to seek input from everyone at the table  and compared to former presidents barack obama and george w  bush  conversations are less scripted   trump s approach to these meetings is  one of listening and not lecturing   said a senior white house official who has participated in industry meetings   i ve seen a president who is listening and asking questions to get to how he can create a thriving economy   the official said   an amgen spokeswoman said trump made it clear that he wanted to work with the company on u s  job creation and biotech innovation  representatives of the other drugmakers declined to comment   because so little is known about how trump interacts privately with ceos  trade groups and company officials have begun to swap tips on how to approach their meetings with him    there is this undercurrent of information sharing about what to expect  what to do   said one trade group official who prepared ceos for a recent meeting with trump  he said he has gotten a flurry of calls from other industries next in line for a white house visit   at the end of most meetings  trump leads ceos into the oval office  showing off paintings  sculptures and the furniture  as well as the rug and curtains he has picked out  he also points out a bust of martin luther king jr   which he inherited from obama  then he takes a group photo behind the desk    he becomes tour guide and brings them over to the oval office   the same official said   he s very proud of the oval office    the white house official said trump recognized the  awe  of the oval office   chief executives of detroit s top three automakers   general motors co  gm n   ford motor co  f n  and fiat chrysler automobiles nv  fcha mi    were pleasantly surprised when they went to the white house for a breakfast with trump on jan     since his election  trump has frequently attacked the car companies for building in mexico and warned u s  firms would no longer be able to move u s  jobs abroad  without consequences    when trump entered the roosevelt room  he greeted gm ceo mary barra with a playful tap on the shoulder as he gently prodded her to add jobs in the united states and later pulled out her chair before the meeting started  a review of the video transcripts of the first part of the meeting shows   he greeted ford ceo mark fields with a  happy birthday  it s his birthday ladies and gentlemen   trump said it was a  great honor  to see fiat chrysler ceo sergio marchionne   trump did not specifically ask them to build plants in the united states   as he had tweeted he would before the meeting   but instead listened to their complaints about regulations and indicated a willingness to help them  people briefed on the meeting said   ford declined to comment and referred to fields  comments to dealers in january that trump had asked for a list of regulations that automakers wanted cut or kept   gm ceo mary barra said in a speech last week that trump  really listened  to the automakers  while marchionne told reporters at the geneva auto show on tuesday that trump was  quite willing to make our lives easier  in terms of compliance and taxes in order to encourage u s  job creation   trump has been complimentary of his high profile guests   and at times playful   after denise morrison  chief executive of campbell soup  cpb n   introduced herself in one of those meetings  trump quickly responded   good soup    at another  after target corp  tgt n  ceo brian cornell spoke  trump responded by pronouncing the name of the company as  tar jay   a common joke to make the retailer sound more fancy
