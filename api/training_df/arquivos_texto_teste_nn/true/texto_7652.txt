washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on friday agreed for the first time to rule on transgender rights in a case in which a virginia public school district is fighting to prevent a female born transgender high school student from using the boys  bathroom  the justices agreed to hear the gloucester county school board s appeal of a lower court s april  ruling that transgender students are protected under u s  laws barring sex based discrimination  the case involves a  year old transgender student named gavin grimm  who identifies as male and sued in  to win the right to use the school s boys  bathroom  the case  to be argued and decided before the end of june  will be one of the biggest of the court s term   i never thought that my restroom use would ever turn into any kind of national debate  the only thing i ever asked for was the right to be treated like everyone else   grimm said in a statement  the court s decision to take the case means grimm will not be able to use the boys  bathroom before graduating from high school next year  said josh block  his lawyer at the american civil liberties union   these sorts of discriminatory policies stigmatize and isolate transgender students like gavin just because of who they are   block added  the school board s chairman  troy anderson  welcomed the court s decision to hear the case  saying the board s policy  carefully balances the interests of all students and parents    conservative groups have backed the school board  saying the fight is about student privacy rights   in light of the right to bodily privacy  federal law should not be twisted to require that a male be given access to the girls  facilities  or a female to the boys  facilities   said gary mccaleb  a lawyer with the alliance defending freedom  a conservative christian legal group  at the heart of the case is the question of whether transgender people are covered by a ban on gender discrimination in education under federal law  president barack obama s administration concluded that they are  but there is a legal fight over whether judges are required to defer to the government s view  the justices could side step a major ruling by focusing their decision on whether the administration followed the correct procedure when it gave public notice about that legal conclusion  the court remains one justice short following the february death of antonin scalia  which left it with four conservatives and four liberals  that raises the possibility of a   ruling that would leave in place the decision favoring grimm by the richmond based  u s  circuit court of appeals  a   ruling would set no nationwide legal precedent  the court until now had generally steered clear of taking  potentially divisive cases while it remained shorthanded  the supreme court has not directly ruled on transgender rights before  but in  the court did rule in favor of a male born transgender prison inmate identifying as a woman who was held with male prisoners and said she was beaten and raped by another inmate  whether to allow transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their birth gender has become the latest flashpoint in the long u s  battle over lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender rights  in a major gay rights ruling in   the supreme court legalized same sex marriage nationwide  the transgender fight heated up after north carolina passed a republican backed law in march that required people to use bathrooms that corresponded to their gender at birth in government buildings and public schools  the north carolina law  being challenged in court  also blocked local measures protecting lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people from discrimination   the obama administration in may issued nationwide guidance telling public schools that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice  that guidance infuriated many conservatives and prompted a republican led legal effort to fight it  twenty three states sued to block the guidance  a u s  district court judge on aug   issued a nationwide injunction sought by texas and other states preventing the administration from enforcing the guidance  in the virginia case  the supreme court in july voted   to temporarily block the appeals court decision from going into effect while the litigation continued  a move that prevented grimm from using the boys  bathroom when the new school year began in september  grimm began attending school as a boy in september   with the school s permission  grimm used the boys  bathroom for about seven weeks without incident  but after complaints from parents  the county school board adopted a new policy in december  that required students to use the bathroom that corresponded with their gender at birth  since then  grimm has had to use a separate bathroom   as a result of hormone therapy  grimm has facial hair and a deep voice  grimm has also had chest reconstruction surgery but not sex reassignment surgery
