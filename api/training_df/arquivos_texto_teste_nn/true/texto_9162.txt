washington  reuters    the obama administration is not pursuing the use of an executive order to shutter the guantanamo bay military prison after officials concluded that it would not be a viable strategy  sources familiar with the deliberations said  the conclusion  reached by administration officials  narrows the already slim chances that president barack obama can fulfill his pledge to close the  notorious offshore prison before leaving office in january  the white house has said repeatedly that obama has not ruled out any options on the guantanamo center  which has been used to house terrorism suspects since it was set up in  following the sept   attacks on new york and washington  obama is eager to fulfill his  campaign pledge to close the prison and could still choose to use his commander in chief powers  but the option is not being actively pursued  the sources said  without executive action  the chances of closing the prison would hinge on convincing a resistant congress to overturn a long standing ban on bringing possibly dozens of remaining prisoners to maximum security prisons in the united states   white house lawyers and other officials studied the option of overriding the ban but did not develop a strong legal position or an effective political sales pitch in an election year  a source familiar with the discussions said    it was just deemed too difficult to get through all of the hurdles that they would need to get through  and the level of support they were likely to receive on it was thought to be too low to generate such controversy  particularly at a sensitive  time  in an election cycle   the source said  republicans in congress are opposed to bringing guantanamo detainees to u s  prisons and have expressed opposition to transfers to other countries over concern that released prisoners will return to militant activities  they have vowed to challenge any potential obama executive action in court  at its peak  the prison at the u s  naval base in cuba housed nearly  prisoners  becoming a symbol of the excesses of the  war on terror  and synonymous with criticism of detention without trial and accusations of torture  obama has called it a recruitment tool for terrorists  the number of guantanamo detainees has fallen to  now  the lowest since it was opened   the administration is focusing on getting the number of detainees at the prison down to such a low number  perhaps   that the cost of keeping it open could prove unpalatable to congress  republican lawmakers remain unswayed  the guantanamo prison and associated military commissions cost   million in fiscal year   that works out to more than    million a year for each of the  remaining prisoners  thirty of the remaining detainees at guantanamo have been approved for transfer to foreign countries and the state department says it will move all of them out this summer  those who would be left include  being prosecuted in military commissions  and other detainees deemed too dangerous to release or transfer   the administration s goal is to work with congress to find a solution to close guantanamo   said myles caggins  a spokesman for the white house national security council  he said the government had made  substantial progress   moving prisoners to foreign countries and was working to identify more countries for additional transfers  reviews to determine whether certain prisoners need to remain detained to prevent a threat to u s  security had been accelerated and would be completed in the coming months  he said  obama  who issued an order to shut the prison within a year on his first day in office  released his latest plan to close it to congress in february  but it has not gained traction  the white house has not publicly ruled out the executive order option in part to keep pressure on the pentagon to move prisoners who have been cleared for release to other countries  one of the sources said   if congress     would finally say no to the president s plan and the executive order option wasn t on the table  there was a concern that the wheels could grind to a halt   said the source familiar with discussions at the white house  gregory craig  who served as obama s first white house counsel  said that without an executive order  obama would likely need the cooperation of congress to shut down the prison   i think the odds are probably challenging   craig said
