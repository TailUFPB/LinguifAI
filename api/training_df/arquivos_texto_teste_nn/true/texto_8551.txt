washington  reuters    u s  republican donald trump s presidential campaign appealed to capitol hill for support on monday as his attacks on the muslim parents of a decorated american soldier killed in iraq drew sharp rebukes from fellow party members  trump s criticism of khizr khan and ghazala khan  who took the stage at last week s democratic convention  sparked growing concern and dismay from republican lawmakers responding to the latest trump outburst to blindside his party colleagues  republican senator john mccain  a former prisoner of war and the most prominent veteran in congress  along with the commander of the veterans of foreign wars  joined the chorus of condemnation  reflecting the highly regarded place the military and its veterans hold with many in the united states  trump s dispute with the khans has dominated the white house campaign in recent days and underlined the uneasy alliance between many leading republicans and the party s freewheeling  unorthodox nominee for the nov   election  rob wasinger  a onetime congressional candidate who has been working for the trump camp on congressional outreach  sent an email to senior senate aides saying   we want to get several member statements out today on this  and would really appreciate your help   a similar appeal was made to republicans in the house of representatives  according to a senior aide  attached to the appeal were talking points lawmakers could use to try to tamp down the controversy growing since last week s appearance at the democratic convention by the khans  the parents of u s  army captain humayun khan  who was killed by a bomb in iraq  years ago  hope hicks  a spokeswoman for trump  said that the campaign was grateful to have support in congress and that republicans are working to keep democratic nominee hillary clinton from winning the presidency  wasinger refused to comment when contacted by telephone  the appeal did not generate any help for trump  a senior senate republican aide  who asked not to be identified  said republican senators were pleased with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s statement on sunday calling captain khan  an american hero  and noting  a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to american values   at the same time  the aide said the controversy would probably not cause republican senators to withdraw their endorsements of trump  in a convention speech delivered with his wife at his side  khizr khan showcased his son s military service and criticized trump s call for a temporary ban on muslims from entering the united states  holding up a copy of the u s  constitution and suggesting trump read it  since then  trump has complained he was  viciously  attacked by the couple and suggested ghazala khan might not have been  allowed  to speak  implying her silence reflected restrictions placed on women by some traditional muslims   mccain  the  republican presidential candidate and current chairman of the senate armed services committee  issued a lengthy statement sharply criticizing trump s comments   while our party has bestowed upon him the nomination  it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us   said mccain  a prisoner of war for five years during the vietnam war  his counterpart on the house armed services committee  representative mac thornberry of texas  echoed mccain  saying in a statement he was  dismayed at the attacks khizr and ghazala khan have endured after they spoke about their son s service and sacrifice   the head of the   million member veterans of foreign wars also said trump s attack on the khans went too far  trump and clinton spoke to the group s national convention last week   election year or not  the vfw will not tolerate anyone berating a gold star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression   said brian duffy  the national commander of the country s oldest and largest war veterans organization  referring to families who have lost relatives in wars  president barack obama did not mention trump by name  but said military families who had lost loved ones in service should be honored for their sacrifice   no one has given more for our freedom and our security than our gold star families   obama said at the disabled american veterans national convention in atlanta   our gold star families have made a sacrifice that most of us cannot even begin to imagine  they represent the very best of our country   in the talking points sent to lawmakers  the trump campaign said he had been asked about the khans  comments during the convention and wished them well  the talking points also noted that trump  wants to end radical islamic terror  so that our soldiers like mr  khan s son will be safe   the list also says trump had not directly compared his sacrifices to the khans  trump said over the weekend he had also made sacrifices in his life by working hard  creating jobs and being successful  the khans bristled at that suggestion and  in numerous television appearances over the weekend  said trump was ignorant about islam and about their family s sacrifice    trump s off the cuff insults and controversial proposals such as the muslim ban and a plan to keep illegal immigrants out by building a wall along the mexican border  have made many in the party establishment reluctant backers of his white house bid  on monday  during a town hall event in columbus  ohio  trump told supporters he thought the november election might be  rigged   later that day  he said former democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders  made a deal with the devil  when he agreed to back clinton   she s the devil   trump said  referring to clinton  in his statement  mccain recalled how humayun khan died  saying that when a suicide bomber aimed his vehicle toward a building housing hundreds of u s  soldiers  the captain told his subordinates to stay away  then ran toward it  mccain thanked the khans for coming to america  saying  your son was the best of america  and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation   and he will never be forgotten    in a remarks to television networks on monday  khizr khan said trump lacked the empathy to be a leader and chided him for throwing the first salvo in their exchange  trump has tried to shift focus from the khans   this story is not about mr  khan  who is all over the place doing interviews  but rather radical islamic terrorism and the u s  get smart   trump said monday on twitter  ghazala khan wrote an opinion piece in the washington post on sunday saying she had remained silent during her husband s remarks to cope with making her grief public during the convention  on sunday  democratic rival clinton said trump had scapegoated the parents  in addition to senate majority leader mcconnell  house speaker paul ryan issued a statement supporting the family   trump drew similar opprobrium a year ago when he said mccain  who as a naval aviator was shot down and taken prisoner during the vietnam war  was not a hero because he had been captured  in an open letter   gold star families said trump cheapened their sacrifice and called for an apology   this goes beyond politics  it is about a sense of decency   it said   that kind decency you mock as  political correctness
