washington  reuters    a chief proponent of republican tax reform in congress urged the business community on thursday to avoid a battle over coveted tax breaks next year if companies hope to achieve reforms that lower tax rates to boost economic growth and productivity   there s incredible pressure in washington not to change a thing  for everyone to keep every special provision there is   said representative kevin brady  chairman of the u s  house of representatives tax committee   that tax code is dragging our economy down  wasting billions of dollars in compliance costs and hurting salaries and jobs and growth   brady was speaking to reporters after a speech on tax reform at the conservative heritage foundation think tank  where he promoted his own plan to lower the corporate income tax rate from  percent to  percent and repatriate an estimated    trillion in u s  corporate profits stashed overseas  the house plan  released in june  closely parallels the latest tax reform proposals from president elect donald trump  and the two sides are working to hammer out an agreement on tax reform legislation that could move forward early next year  the republican plan would pay for tax cuts by eliminating hundreds of tax breaks  including one that allows businesses to deduct net interest costs on debt  a policy heavily favored by wall street investors  in addition to a sharply lower tax rate  it would provide businesses with other advantages  including the ability to immediately write off the cost of capital investments  the plan would also end taxation on revenues from exports and impose a new tax on imports  brady says the approach would result in more buoyant economic growth and a vastly simpler tax code    while some would like to have fights over individual provisions in the tax code  the debate we re looking for in america is whether americans want something this fair and this simple and this understandable and are willing to make the trade offs   he told his heritage foundation audience   the ability to buy those new buildings  equipment  software  technology and items that not just grow the economy but grow productivity and wages for workers   we think that s awfully important    brady said the staff of his ways and means committee has begun writing tax reform provisions for next year but added that the panel will also accept feedback from the business community and other taxpayers through the end of
