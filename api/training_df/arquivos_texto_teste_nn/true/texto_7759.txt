tokyo taipei  reuters    women in the asia pacific region expressed dismay on thursday about the u s  presidential campaign s focus on the emotional topic of sexual harassment  saying it shows both democracy and the rights of women in america have some way to go  in a fiery final debate on wednesday night in las vegas  republican nominee donald trump accused democrat rival hillary clinton s campaign of orchestrating a series of accusations by women who said the businessman had made unwanted sexual advances   clinton  who would be america s first female president  said the women came forward after trump said he had never made unwanted advances on women  his denial came after a  video surfaced earlier this month in which he was recorded bragging about groping women against their will  hsiao bi khim  a lawmaker from taiwan s ruling democratic progressive party  said she found it  rather incredible  trump had survived politically in the face of the allegations  if a candidate in taiwan was caught on tape making similar remarks   i don t think such a person would survive a presidential campaign   she said  taiwan in january elected its first woman president  tsai ing wen  and on gender equality at least  appears more advanced politically than the united states  she said   not only have we elected a woman president  but we have a higher percentage of women who are independently involved in politics and in leadership positions   hsiao said  japan s former minister for gender equality  kuniko inoguchi  said the rest of the world has been dismayed to see the u s  campaign devolve into  a downgraded debate on women s issues  and it wouldn t be happening if clinton were a man running for president   so when the glass ceiling breaks  there are a lot of injuries that a woman must bear   inoguchi said  mari miura  a sophia university political science professor specializing in women s issues  said japanese politicians have also sparked outrage for comments demeaning women in the past   we hear such comments constantly from japanese conservative men   she said   there are so many incidents that people get used to it and it s easier to let it go   a study commissioned by japan s ministry of health  labour and welfare  published in march  found   percent of women had experienced some form of sexual harassment  and  percent of those said they had experienced unwanted touching  south korea  which in  elected its first woman president  park geun hye  has slowly become more accepting of women politicians  said park young sun  a female senior member of the democratic party of korea  which has a majority in parliament  park young sun said that when she first entered parliament  in   female lawmakers were considered  decorative items on display    they were given positions within the parties like flowers being placed decoratively here and there  now it s better    nurul izzah  a malaysian member of parliament and daughter of jailed opposition leader anwar ibrahim  said the u s  campaign debate was  a tragedy for women everywhere   nurul said  there is a lot of condescension  prejudice  in malaysian politics  but  political attacks are not really focused on gender specific issues   a senior female member of indonesian president joko widodo s government said what trump has been accused of doing with women  would make him definitely unelectable in indonesia    what shocks me is that many americans still accept him and make excuses for him   she said sexual assault is not part of indonesia s political culture   and even if there are instances  it is not tolerated  and it doesn t sit well with either men or women    eve teasing  india  where sexual harassment and groping on public transport is known as  eve teasing   went through its own soul searching over the issue after the death of a young woman who was gang raped on a moving bus in new delhi in    in our climate  a donald trump like figure would have to apologize publicly   said maya mirchandani  foreign affairs editor at ndtv  a leading news channel  when she started in tv news in the   young female reporters were called  soundbite soldiers   she said   print journalists alleged that we used our bodies to stop politicians and get them to talk to us   today  indian law sets clear guidelines for companies to ensure harassment in the workplace is dealt with  she said  even australia  known for its colorful language and no holds barred political culture  has been shocked by the u s  presidential campaign  said ged kearney  female president of the australian council of trade unions  the closest australia has come to anything similar recently was a  ditch the witch  campaign adopted by supporters of the conservative opposition against former prime minister julia gillard  australia s first prime minister  when she argued for a carbon tax during her time in power from  to    personally  i think donald trump would definitely be unelectable in australia   kearney said   i don t think there is any place in australia for that level of misogyny and cheapening of politics
