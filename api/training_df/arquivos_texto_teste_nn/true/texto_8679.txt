cleveland  reuters    ted cruz was recounting to an audience how he had outlasted most of his  rivals for the republican presidential nomination when a plane carrying the man who had won it all  donald trump  flew overhead  interrupting him mid speech   all right  that was pretty well orchestrated   said cruz  a republican u s  senator from texas who waged a bitter campaign against trump  hours later cruz would take his revenge  refusing to endorse trump and urging republicans to vote their conscience during a prime time speech on the floor of the republican national convention in cleveland  he left the podium to a chorus of boos  and his wife was escorted off the floor as the convention erupted in rancor  susan hutchison  chair of the washington state delegation  said she confronted cruz after his speech and called him a  traitor to the party   so much for party unity  over three days in cleveland this week  republican leaders sought to sell a story of unity  they repeatedly said the party was getting ever closer to rallying behind trump  who is running on the slogan  make america great again   and whose candidacy has divided many and exposed deep discontent among  republicans with their leaders   but in a few minutes on wednesday night that show of unity was blown apart in spectacular fashion  cruz s non committal speech infuriated trump supporters among the thousands of delegates cramming the floor of the quicken loans arena in cleveland  but their angry jeers triggered recriminations from other delegates     they talk about unity and then they act like that  that is not going to get us to unify   said manette merrill  a cruz delegate from washington state   trump will get the opportunity to rally the party when he formally accepts its nomination on thursday night in a speech expected to be watched by millions of americans  including undecided and independent voters  one of trump s key goals going into this week s convention was to unite the party after a roughly  month primary season that was marked by personal attacks on candidates  sometimes violent rallies  and deep disagreement over what it means to be a republican  in public and in private the trump campaign tried to win over skeptics who feel the new york businessman and celebrity tv star does not represent the party s values  it took a harder stance against opponents  for example shutting down a desperate last minute bid on the convention floor early in the week to stop his nomination    it s like a slow crawl   former republican national committee chairman michael steele said of the unity drive as he made the rounds at the convention   you re kind of doing it  you re kind of looking around to see if anyone else is doing it   he told reuters   but almost from the start there were blatant signs of party disunity   ohio governor john kasich  who lost to trump in the nomination fight and disagrees with trump on a host of issues  declined to attend the convention held in his own state  instead  he greeted his supporters at the rock and roll hall of fame close to the convention arena to the blaring tune of the who s  baba o riley  with lyrics like   i don t need to fight to prove i m right   trump campaign manager paul manafort told reporters that kasich was  embarrassing his state  by refusing to get on the trump train  his remarks were a reminder of the sort of insults that many republicans had hoped would disappear after a brutal primary season that was characterized by trump s often personal attacks on his opponents  the pleas for unity were frequent in cleveland  led by house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the top elected republican  who has been slow in warming to trump   what do you say that we unify this party at this crucial moment when unity is everything   ryan asked thousands of convention attendees on tuesday night  it was the biggest applause line of his speech   delegates cheered  clapped and waved signs  but u s  senator mike lee of utah  one of the  never trump  holdouts  is still not convinced    federalism and separation of powers   if he focuses on that  he brings along a lot of conservatives like me who haven t been sold yet   lee told reuters   he needs to make that a distinct part of his message   trump and his surrogates have offered scant policy details so far at the convention  nor have they been able to put to rest questions about whether they are capable of mounting a sophisticated presidential campaign to take on his democratic rival hillary clinton  the convention has been overshadowed  for example  by controversy surrounding his wife melania s convention speech   which included lines uttered by first lady michelle obama at the democratic convention in    and the campaign s initial reluctance to admit the plagiarism  some republicans thought it was an unnecessary distraction at a time when the party should be focused on selling itself and its new leader to americans   others said that if trump was really serious about uniting the party he would reach out to his vanquished foes on the campaign trail  including cruz and kasich    ken cope  a texas delegate who had backed cruz for president but will vote for trump  said the new york businessman needs to  swallow his pride  and stress the contributions his  defeated rivals made to the primary process instead of belittling them   he s a prideful man and he s proud of what he is but we re in a general election campaign and it s going to take all of us pulling on the rope if we re going to pull the ship to the final line   cope said  still others said trump needed to be more disciplined  trump supporter john whitmer  a delegate from wichita  kansas  said trump made a mistake by going on fox news on monday night to rail against kasich as speakers were lauding his candidacy at the televised convention   you just stepped on your best act   whitmer said   i get that you want to talk about kasich  but everybody needed to be watching what was going on there   after wednesday night  the best hope for the republican party to come together may rest on clinton  who was frequently vilified at the cleveland convention this week  she will be formally nominated as the democratic presidential nominee at her party s convention in philadelphia next week  when asked if the party was unified  former speaker of the house of representatives and close trump adviser  newt gingrich  replied   no  but we will be by the end of philadelphia    trump will get us to  percent unity  she ll get us the rest of the way
