washington  reuters    democratic attorneys general in at least five u s  states have vowed to fight president elect donald trump in the courts if he rolls back obama era regulations or adopts policies they view as infringing upon civil liberties  with republicans controlling the white house and both chambers of congress  the democratic party looks set to rely more heavily on top law officials in states they run to help keep a check on trump s exercise of power  any efforts by a trump administration to weaken consumer protection or climate change policies  for example  could lead to conflict between the states and the federal government  attorney general offices in maryland  virginia  washington  massachusetts  and new york told reuters  in some instances  that could see them asking a federal judge to block federal action nationwide    i view my role as being on the first line of defense against a trump administration if it chooses to act in an unconstitutional fashion   said bob ferguson  the democratic attorney general of washington state  when george w  bush was president  democratic states forced his administration to take the first step toward regulating carbon emissions for the first time   michael kelly  a spokesman for virginia s attorney general  mark herring  said that if a trump administration  crosses the line and pursues actions that are illegal or violate the constitution  attorney general herring will be ready to stand up and defend the rights of virginians        the trump transition team did not respond to a request seeking comment  attorneys general are the top legal officials in the  states and are typically elected  after this year s elections   will be democrats  in addition to the attorney general for the district of columbia   acting on behalf of their states  they generally have legal standing to bring lawsuits challenging federal regulations or executive actions  including those that may infringe upon civil rights   the president elect has made a number of promises that  if implemented  would violate the constitution or massachusetts law   massachusetts attorney general maura healey said in a statement   if the incoming administration chooses to try to act in ways that are unconstitutional  my office will take action to protect the rights and liberties of our residents and our state   she said  a dozen attorney general offices contacted by reuters declined to discuss potential legal strategies before trump takes office  democratic states that sue might initially get a sympathetic hearing  as many federal courts are staffed with judges appointed by president barack obama during his eight years in office   but challengers face one major obstacle  a supreme court likely soon to regain its conservative majority once trump makes an appointment to fill a vacant seat  the court is currently divided   between conservatives and liberals  republican controlled texas  which took a leading role in challenging obama s executive actions  provides a model for the democratic attorneys general   climate change is likely to be area of friction between trump  who has vowed to roll back regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases  and democratic states  which have supported such efforts at the federal level or enacted their own measures  the top target for trump is obama s clean power plan  which seeks to limit carbon emissions from power plants  amy spitalnick  a spokeswoman for new york attorney general eric schneiderman said his office  will continue to fight to protect new yorkers  public health  property  and environment  and to lead the coalition of states defending the clean power plan   immigration policy is another potential flashpoint  trump has said he will rescind an obama executive order giving deportation relief to up to  million people and end federal funding for cities like new york and los angeles that give sanctuary to undocumented immigrants      a federal court blocked the obama executive order in february  after texas and  other republican states challenged it  the supreme court split   on the issue in june  leaving the lower court s ruling in place  on consumer protection  states can both challenge any trump efforts to loosen regulations and ramp up their own enforcement efforts  said doug gansler  a democrat who served as maryland s attorney general from  to    if the federal government abdicates that responsibility  the more aggressive and progressive state attorneys general will fill that vacuum   he said
