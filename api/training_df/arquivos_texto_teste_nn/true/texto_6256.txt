washington  reuters    senate democrats are gearing up for a potentially ugly fight over donald trump s u s  supreme court pick  with some liberal activists urging them to do everything possible to block any nominee from the republican president elect  democrats are still seething over the republican led senate s decision last year to refuse to consider outgoing president barack obama s nomination of appeals court judge merrick garland for a lifetime post on the court  the action had little precedent in u s  history and prompted some democrats to accuse republicans of stealing a supreme court seat  trump last week vowed to announce his appointment within about two weeks of taking office on friday  he said he would pick from among  candidates suggested by conservative legal groups to fill the lingering vacancy caused by the death of conservative justice antonin scalia last feb    scalia s replacement could tilt the ideological leaning of the court for years to come  restoring the long standing conservative majority that disappeared with scalia s death just at a time when it appeared liberals would get an upper hand on the bench  liberal groups are gearing up for a battle  with the people for the american way calling the judges on trump s list of candidates  very extreme     we re hearing from senate democrats and parallel concern among outside groups that this is going to be a major fight   said marge baker  the group s executive vice president   we ll be arguing that democrats use every means at their disposal to defeat the nominee  this is going to be  all hands on deck   using all means at our disposal   senate democratic leader chuck schumer has said it is hard for him to imagine trump picking a nominee who democrats could support  and said he would  absolutely  fight to keep the seat vacant rather than let the senate confirm a trump nominee deemed to be outside the mainstream   we are not going to make it easy for them to pick a supreme court justice   schumer told msnbc on jan    adding that if the republicans  don t appoint someone who s really good  we re going to oppose them tooth and nail   senate democrats may be in a position to hold up trump s selection indefinitely  senate rules require  votes in the  seat chamber to overcome a procedural hurdle called a filibuster on supreme court nominees  there are  republican senators  assuming all  back trump s nominee  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell either would need to lure eight democrats to his side or change the rules and ban the filibuster for supreme court nominations  republicans  then in the minority  complained that their rights had been trampled when senate democrats in  voted to eliminate the filibuster for executive branch and judicial nominees beyond the supreme court  baker said liberals cannot hold their fire for fear that republicans will use this so called nuclear option  adding   at some point you don t game this out  you say   this is a fight    other liberal groups urged a more conciliatory approach   we re not predisposed to opposition here   said kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  any nominee will be evaluated  clarke said  adding that the group is girding for a nominee who is hostile to civil rights  trump s nominee could influence the court on a wide range of issues including abortion  the death penalty  religious rights  presidential powers  gay and transgender rights  federal regulations and others  political considerations also hang over the confirmation fight  democrats and the two independents aligned with them in the senate will be defending  seats in the  elections  while republicans defend only eight  many of those democratic seats are in republican leaning states trump won in the nov   election  including west virginia  missouri  north dakota  indiana  montana  michigan and ohio  republicans likely will target these and other democrats in hopes of coaxing them into backing trump s nominee  that means democratic senators such as west virginia s joe manchin  indiana s joe donnelly and missouri s claire mccaskill could face extra pressure not to block trump s supreme court nominee  the liberal groups are facing off with well funded conservative adversaries  the judicial crisis network  for instance  has said it will spend at least   million on advertising and grassroots efforts to pressure senate democrats to back trump s nominee   carrie severino  the group s chief counsel  said it would be hypocritical for democrats to block a vote after arguing the constitution required the senate to act on garland   a lot of them  democrats  spent the last nine months saying there is a constitutional duty to have a vote  i d find it shocking if they would not carry out what they think their duty is   severino said  nan aron  president of the liberal alliance for justice  said the high level of interest the vacancy has generated among activists  lawyers  students and others makes up for the deep pockets of the other side   i don t think we ll need   million given the outcry expressed already   aron said
