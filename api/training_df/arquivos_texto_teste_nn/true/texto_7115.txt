london  reuters    britain on tuesday dismissed u s  president elect donald trump s unprecedented expression of support for brexit campaigner nigel farage to be made british ambassador to washington  saying pointedly that there is no vacancy for the job  trump  who after his election victory met farage before any eu leaders  said on twitter that  many people  would like to see the former metals trader turned politician as britain s ambassador   many people would like to see  nigelfarage represent great britain as their ambassador to the united states  he would do a great job   trump said  prime minister theresa may  who congratulated trump on his victory  was swift to reject such an undiplomatic proposal  with a spokesman saying britain already had an excellent ambassador to washington and that london would appoint its own envoys   we have first rate ambassador in washington   foreign secretary boris johnson  who campaigned for brexit  told the british parliament   there is no vacancy for that position   it is highly unusual in the modern era for leaders to publicly suggest to foreign nations whom they would like to see as ambassador  though during strained relations they sometimes reject or expel envoys  trump s suggestion provoked anger  support and even hilarity in britain  with one lawmaker  conservative simon burns  joking  that perhaps britain should suggest hillary clinton as its preferred choice as ambassador to london  but the apparent public suggestion about who to appoint as ambassador by the man who will lead britain s most powerful ally puts prime minister may in a difficult position just as she tries to build ties with washington ahead of leaving the eu  london is trying to gauge whether trump would support a special trade deal with britain as it negotiates a divorce from the eu  britain also places great store on what it calls its  special relationship  with the united states  farage  who spent decades campaigning for britain to leave the european union and helped force former prime minister david cameron to call the june referendum that brought the brexit vote  spoke at a trump rally during the u s  campaign and visited the president elect after his victory  as leader of the uk independence party  ukip  and one of the key figures of the successful brexit campaign  farage has repeatedly angered eu leaders by predicting the collapse of the eu  which he says is run by an out of touch elite of  idiots   farage said trump s suggestion that he serve as ambassador had come  like a bolt from the blue  but trump understood loyalty in a way that those in the  cesspit  of career politics did not    i am in a good position with the president elect s support to help  the world has changed and it s time that downing street did too   farage said in an article written for the breitbart news website   i would do anything to help our national interest and to help cement ties with the incoming anglophile administration   farage said  a photograph of trump greeting farage in front of a gilded elevator shortly after the u s  election caused consternation in eu capitals  many of whom view trump with a mixture of fear and puzzlement  his suggestion of farage also provoked anger among some british lawmakers   many people think you should mind your own business and talk about pussy grabbing less  but hey  life is a constant disappointment   jess phillips  a lawmaker for the opposition labour party  said on twitter in a reference to trump s previous vulgar comments about groping women   accused by his critics of being a racist and a bigot  farage peppers his speeches with jokes and the odd expletive while railing against what he calls the doomed european superstate and immigration into britain  he is a member of the european parliament but has failed in his efforts to win election to the british parliament  farage said trump would be a great president after  the political revolution  that brought brexit in britain and trump to power in the united states   in the united kingdom the people have spoken but the players at the top have  i am afraid  stayed the same   farage    said    those who supported remain now hold senior positions  worst still  those who were openly abusive about trump now pretend to be his friend   said farage   farage has urged may to build ties with trump  who provoked criticism in britain with his call for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  queen elizabeth might invite trump for a state visit to britain next year  farage made light of allegations of sexual assault against trump during the u s  campaign by encouraging him to  come and schmooze  may but adding  don t touch her for goodness sake   when u s  president barack obama said before the referendum that britain would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal  farage said it was disgraceful to intervene in the sovereign affairs of britain   in a radio interview after the u s  election  farage described the u s  president as   that obama creature   a loathsome individual who couldn t stand our country   the way ambassadors are chosen in the united states and europe differ significantly  it is common practice for the united states to appoint celebrities or campaign donors as envoys  for example when richard nixon appointed shirley temple as his envoy to ghana in   european states mostly appoint career diplomats or officials with long experience as ambassadors  kim darroch  the current british ambassador in washington  did not reply to emails from reuters requesting comment on trump s remarks  his email bounced back with an out of office reply saying that the ambassador was traveling
