west palm beach  fla  washington  reuters    donald trump on wednesday named south carolina governor nikki haley  a former critic with little foreign policy experience  as the next u s  ambassador to the united nations at a time of uncertainty over america s international role under his presidency  haley  one of two women chosen so far for a job in trump s cabinet  is  a proven dealmaker  and we look to be making plenty of deals  she will be a great leader representing us on the world stage   the republican president elect said in a statement  trump on wednesday also picked wealthy republican donor and school choice advocate betsy devos to lead the education department  haley  the  year old daughter of indian immigrants  represents what some republicans hope could be the new face of their party  a younger  more diverse generation of leaders       haley took trump strongly to task during the presidential campaign over his harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration and for not speaking forcefully enough against white supremacists  trump has chosen mostly male conservatives so far for senior positions as he shapes his administration following his victory over democrat hillary clinton in the nov   election  trump takes over from democratic president barack obama on jan     also on wednesday  a spokesman for former republican presidential candidate ben carson said trump had not offered the retired neurosurgeon the post of housing and urban development secretary  disputing a wall street journal report  which the newspaper later corrected   trump did not make an offer   carson spokesman armstrong williams told reuters   he asked him to consider hud  nothing has been offered and no decision has been made   carson told fox news on wednesday night   we are considering which is the way that i can be most effective  so that information should come out in the next few days  we will make a public announcement     the wall street journal  citing two people familiar with the deliberations  also reported that trump was expected to pick billionaire investor wilbur ross as commerce secretary  in a video message released ahead of the u s  thanksgiving holiday on thursday  trump said he hoped it would be a time for americans  to begin to heal our divisions  following a  long and bruising political campaign    emotions are raw and tensions just don t heal overnight   trump said   now begins a great national campaign to rebuild our country and to restore the full promise of america for all of our people   the choice of haley may be aimed at countering criticism of trump s divisive comments about immigrants and minorities  as well as accusations of sexism during his election campaign  haley led a successful effort last year to remove the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the south carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in charleston  the flag was carried by pro slavery confederate forces during the civil war and is viewed by many as a racist emblem   haley said she had accepted trump s offer and would remain governor pending her confirmation to the cabinet level post by the u s  senate   when the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation  and to our nation s standing in the world  that is a calling that is important to heed   she said in a statement  haley s job may include reassuring allies worried about some of trump s campaign promises  including building a wall along the u s  mexican border to curb illegal immigration and reviewing trade agreements  and his suggestion that he would push nato partners to pay more for their own defense  he has antagonized china  another major power at the united nations  with his talk on trade and territorial disputes in the south china sea       the new york real estate magnate  who has never held public office  gave few clues about his world view during an extensive interview with the new york times on tuesday      asked what he sees as america s role in the world  trump replied   that s such a big question   when pressed further  he described the iraq war as a mistake  urged better relations with russia and called for an end to  that craziness that s going on in syria   the united states  which along with russia is one of the five permanent veto powers on the  member u n  security council  is also the largest funder of the united nations  paying more than a quarter of its   billion peace keeping budget and  percent of the regular budget    trump picked conservatives to lead his national security and law enforcement teams last week  suggesting he plans to make good on his campaign promises to take a hard line on islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration but a relative moderate  former republican presidential nominee mitt romney  is among the candidates under consideration to head the state department  haley would succeed obama s u n  envoy  samantha power  a foreign policy expert before she took the job  in contrast  haley  a state lawmaker before becoming governor  has little experience in international relations  she was a robust critic of trump during the early stages of the republican presidential nominating race  including condemning him for not disavowing the support of the ku klux klan and one of the white supremacist group s former leaders  david duke  in a rebuttal to obama s state of the union address in january  haley called for tolerance on immigration and civility in politics  in what some saw as a rebuke of trump    during anxious times  it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices   she said   we must resist that temptation   she supported trump rivals marco rubio and ted cruz  both u s  senators  in the republican race before saying last month she would vote for trump despite reservations about his character  haley also criticized trump last winter for not releasing his tax returns  prompting him to hit back on twitter   the people of south carolina are embarrassed of nikki haley   devos  trump s education pick  is a billionaire former chair of the michigan republican party  who has long pushed for a larger role for private education  trump said she would  break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back   her appointment is also subject to senate confirmation      as chair of the american federation for children advocacy group  devos has advocated for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools  the national education association  the country s largest teachers union  condemned devos  nomination   she has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize  de professionalize and impose cookie cutter solutions to public education   said nea president lily eskelsen garcia
