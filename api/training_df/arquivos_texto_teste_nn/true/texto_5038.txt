washington  reuters    the u s  senate foreign relations committee voted   on thursday to approve president donald trump s nominee as ambassador to israel  david friedman  an outspoken bankruptcy lawyer aligned with the israeli right  the vote was largely along party lines  a contrast with  strong bipartisan support for past ambassadors to israel  democratic senator robert menendez joined all  committee republicans in backing friedman  despite concerns about his temperament  friedman  who has no diplomatic experience  is a long time friend of trump who has worked for the new york businessman as a bankruptcy lawyer   in addition to investing in settlements on land claimed by the palestinians  friedman favors moving the u s  embassy to jerusalem  the relocation is strongly opposed by many u s  allies because both israel and the palestinians claim the city as their capital  trump s selection of friedman reflects his shift in policy toward israel after years of friction between former president barack obama and israeli leader benjamin netanyahu  unlike obama  trump has wavered on the u s  commitment to a two state solution  long a bedrock of washington s middle east policy  and backed the embassy s relocation  friedman is also known for using inflammatory language against those with whom he has political disagreements  democrats said his approach could risk security   the region is incredibly volatile  the last thing we need in this position is someone who has a penchant for over the top  hyperbolic  and even false statements   democratic senator tim kaine said  friedman has called obama an anti semite  and dismissed the liberal leaning pro israel group j street as  far worse than kapos   a reference to jews who worked for the nazis in world war two concentration camps  j street and the reform jewish movement are among groups opposing friedman s nomination  friedman was heckled during his contentious february confirmation hearing  he said then that he regretted the use of such language  senator ben cardin  the committee s ranking democrat  said friedman also was problematic because he does not explicitly back a two state solution for middle east peace  friedman will next be considered by the full senate  where trump s fellow republicans control a slim majority  he is expected to be confirmed despite continued democratic opposition  republican senator bob corker  the foreign relations committee chairman  praised friedman as an  impassioned advocate  for strong u s  israeli ties   he understands the complexity of issues at stake for the united states and the necessity to support a democratic ally in an important and unstable part of the world   corker said
