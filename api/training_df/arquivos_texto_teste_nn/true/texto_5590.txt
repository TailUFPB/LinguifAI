new york  reuters    when former reality television contestant summer zervos accused donald trump of sexual misconduct last fall  she pursued her claims solely in the court of public opinion  since the allegations dated too far back to allow a lawsuit  but last month  she found a fresh approach to fight the former host of  the apprentice   who has vehemently denied her allegations that he groped her in   by professing his innocence  the man who is now president of the united states had effectively called her a liar  servos alleges in a defamation lawsuit  the suit copied a rare legal tactic employed most notably by several women who have accused the actor and comedian bill cosby of sexual assault  using his denials as the basis for a defamation claim  it is not uncommon for high profile allegations against celebrities to prompt defamation lawsuits  but they are usually filed by the star against the accuser  in   however  joseph cammarata  the attorney for cosby accuser tamara green  realized he could adapt that strategy for his own purposes after cosby s lawyer issued a statement calling the allegations  fantastical   like many other cosby accusers  green was unable to sue for assault because the alleged incident occurred decades ago   a direct claim for the assault is not available  so i came up with the idea that a defamation claim would be the appropriate vehicle to use to address the underlying harm   said cammarata  whose lawsuit now includes seven cosby accusers as plaintiffs  all told   cosby accusers filed four defamation lawsuits in three states  in simple terms  the argument is that trump and cosby have effectively branded the women as liars by denying the incidents occurred  but the women face a difficult challenge in making their cases  experts say   merely saying   i didn t do it   is traditionally not seen in defamation law as calling your accuser a liar  even though logically that s what it means   said rod smolla  dean of the delaware law school and a first amendment scholar    but if you go beyond that   if you go from   i didn t do it   to   she s a liar   now you have arguably made a statement of fact  that could be subject to liability  he added  trump s status as president does not shield him from civil liability for actions he took prior to assuming office  in a statement on tuesday  the attorney defending trump in the zervos lawsuit  marc kasowitz  said he and trump s personal lawyer would soon file a response to the lawsuit   president trump continues to deny any allegation of wrongdoing raised in said complaint   he said  cosby    who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from approximately  women  has also denied any wrongdoing  the cosby and trump plaintiffs are taking on a tough double burden  experts said  first  the only way to show the denials by both men are untrue is to prove the incidents took place as described   the burden is going to be on her to show that trump is actually saying something that s false   clay calvert  a first amendment expert at the university of florida  said of zervos  in addition  the women must show trump and crosby crossed the line into defamation by deliberately making false statements that seriously harmed the accusers  reputations  in defamation cases  courts typically examine statements to determine whether they were factual or opinion  as expressing an opinion is generally protected by the first amendment  making that distinction can be challenging  in the cosby cases  for instance  judges have split on whether the lawsuits should proceed  even coming to opposite conclusions regarding the same statement from his attorney  u s  district judge mark mastroianni in massachusetts rejected cosby s attempts to have two cases  including green s lawsuit  thrown out  in his rulings  the judge found that a november  statement from cosby s lawyer calling the allegations  unsubstantiated  fantastical stories  could be reasonably seen as factual  and therefore potentially defamatory  by contrast  a pittsburgh federal judge  arthur schwab  tossed a similar case against cosby  finding that the same statement was  pure opinion  and thus protected  unlike cosby  who has been fairly circumspect in his public statements  trump has aggressively attacked his accusers  calling the claims   percent fabricated and made up   his rhetoric could make him more vulnerable to a defamation claim  experts said  trump has said he never met zervos at a hotel  despite her allegation that he groped her at a hotel in beverly hills  california  that type of specific fact based assertion can also make it easier to show defamation if it can be proven false  according to eugene volokh  a law professor at the university of california in los angeles   so much depends on the particular statement and the particular context surrounding that statement   he said
