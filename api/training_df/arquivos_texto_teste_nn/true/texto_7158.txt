new york  reuters    u s  president elect donald trump picked three conservative loyalists to lead his national security and law enforcement teams on friday  underscoring his campaign promise to take a hard line confronting islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration  trump picked u s  senator jeff sessions for attorney general  rewarding a staunch supporter whose tough and sometimes inflammatory statements on immigration have reflected his own  the choice was applauded by the top republican in the senate but drew sharp criticism from civil rights activists  retired army lieutenant general mike flynn  who has championed trump s promises to take a more aggressive approach to terrorism  was chosen as his national security adviser   trump named representative mike pompeo  a vocal critic of the obama administration s security policy  as director of the central intelligence agency  the three choices  announced by trump s transition team  come as the republican president elect works to fill key positions in his administration  which will take over from democratic president barack obama on jan    the picks could heighten concerns abroad that the trump administration might carry out campaign promises of banning muslims from entering the united states or imposing more severe restrictions on migrants from countries or regions with high levels of militant islamist activity  such as iraq and syria   sessions and pompeo seem likely to be confirmed by the senate despite heavy resistance from democrats  republicans will control a majority  with at least  seats in the  seat chamber  when congress reconvenes in january  flynn s post does not need senate confirmation    one of the earliest republican lawmakers to support trump s white house candidacy  sessions opposes any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and was an enthusiastic backer of trump s campaign promise to build a wall on the border with mexico  he has also argued for curbs on legal immigration on the grounds that it drives down wages for u s  workers  a former alabama attorney general and u s  attorney  sessions    has been in the senate for  years  allegations that he made racist remarks led the senate to deny his confirmation as a federal judge in   the chamber s top democrat  chuck schumer  said he would want sessions to answer   tough questions  about his civil rights positions  the attorney general acts as the country s chief law enforcement officer and head of the justice department  civil rights groups slammed sessions as a poor choice to head a department charged with protecting voting rights and running immigration courts   how can we trust someone in that role who has demonstrated he thinks all forms of immigration are bad for america   said beth werlin  head of the american immigration council   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he strongly supported sessions for attorney general  calling him  principled  forthright  and hardworking   sessions has been one of trump s most enthusiastic backers on capitol hill and the president elect has hired several of sessions  staffers  including policy chief stephen miller and rick dearborn  who has a top job managing the transition  also on friday  the first set of transition  landing teams  were starting work at the departments of state  justice  defense and the national security council to begin hashing out the details of shifting to a new administration   flynn  one of trump s closest advisers  was fired from the defense intelligence agency in   a move he has attributed to his outspoken views about fighting islamist militancy  other officials who worked with flynn cited his lack of management skills and leadership style as reasons for his firing  an army intelligence veteran of three decades  flynn was assistant director of national intelligence under obama  he views the  invasion of iraq as a strategic blunder and has refused to condemn trump s support for the renewed use of waterboarding  this is an interrogation technique that simulates drowning  is widely considered torture and was banned by obama  pompeo    a third term republican congressman and former u s  army officer who founded an aerospace company  was a surprise pick to lead the cia  a member of the house intelligence committee  pompeo has called for a revival and expansion of a now defunct domestic spying program to include  financial and lifestyle information  as well as phone records  he has said that edward snowden  a former government contractor who uncovered the spying program and who now lives in russia  should get the death penalty if he is ever tried and convicted  pompeo has been one of the most aggressive critics of the obama administration s handling of a  attack on u s  diplomatic facilities in benghazi  libya  that killed the u s  ambassador and three other americans   nevertheless  democrats who have worked with him joined republicans in describing pompeo as knowledgeable and hard working   while we have had our share of strong differences   principally on the politicization of the tragedy in benghazi   i know that he is someone who is willing to listen and engage    representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the intelligence committee  said on friday   trump met on friday with former arkansas governor mike huckabee  a possible pick to head the department of homeland security  and u s  senator tom cotton of arkansas  a possible candidate for defense secretary  trump is considering retired general david petraeus  who resigned as cia chief in  after an extra marital affair  is being considered for the post of defense secretary  the wall street journal said  trump was expected to spend the weekend in bedminster  new jersey  the home of the trump national golf club  on saturday he was scheduled to meet with mitt romney  the  republican presidential nominee  romney was one of the fiercest republican critics of trump during his unorthodox election campaign but is now under possible consideration for secretary of state  admiral mike rogers  director of the national security agency  is the leading candidate to serve as trump s director of national intelligence  the wall street journal reported
