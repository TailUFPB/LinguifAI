washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump on thursday tried to quell the furor over his call for russia to find hillary clinton s deleted emails  saying he was being sarcastic  in moscow  meanwhile  a kremlin spokesman pointedly told washington to solve its own email problems  trump on wednesday invited russia to dig up tens of thousands of  missing  emails from clinton s time at the u s  state department  prompting democrats to accuse him of urging foreigners to spy on americans  later  he dismissed concerns raised by clinton campaign manager robby mook that his comments raised national security concerns   you have to be kidding  his client  his person  deleted   e mails illegally  you look at that  and when i m being sarcastic with something      trump said in a fox news interview broadcast on thursday  asked if he was indeed being sarcastic  trump snapped   of course i m being sarcastic  they don t even know  frankly  if it s russia  they have no idea if it s russia  if it s china  if it s somebody else  who knows who it is   but you have    clinton  emails deleted  and the real problem is what was said on those emails from the democratic national committee   he said  referring to hacked emails released last weekend by wikileaks  the dnc emails showed party leaders favoring clinton over her rival in the campaign for the nomination  u s  senator bernie sanders of vermont  the committee is supposed to be neutral  trump s explanation echoed those of his campaign advisers and other supporters  who immediately tried to pass his comments off as tongue in cheek and not serious  but the exhortation for a u s  adversary to use cyber intrusions against an american political candidate drew criticism from intelligence experts and other public figures  including some republicans  trump made the remark at a news conference in miami that allowed him to steal some of the limelight from the democratic national convention in philadelphia  where clinton on thursday will accept her party s presidential nomination for the nov   election   russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   trump  the republican presidential nominee  told reporters  he later said on twitter that if anyone had clinton s emails   perhaps they should share them with the fbi   the republican presidential nominee was referring to a private email system clinton kept in her home in chappaqua  new york  while secretary of state from  to   she handed over thousands of emails in  to u s  officials probing that system  but did not release about   deleted emails she said were personal and not work related  cyber security experts and u s  officials have said there was evidence that russia engineered the release of the sensitive democratic party emails to influence the election  but the kremlin beat back those insinuations again on thursday  saying they were driven by anti russian sentiment   it is so absurd it borders on total stupidity   said kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov   the americans needs to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it s all about   although some democrats have wondered aloud whether trump committed a crime in his remarks directed at russia  the prospect of any prosecution is considered nil because of the strong guarantee of speech rights in the united states  charging trump for his comments about russia would  turn campaign fluff into a crime  and would be laughable  said daniel richman  a columbia university law professor and former u s   prosecutor
