new york  reuters    hawaii grandmother teresa shook wanted to share her outrage with other women the night after donald trump was elected president  but she had few options in her remote island community  so she went on facebook and in a popular political group wrote the first thing that came to mind  i think we should march  four weeks later  organizers credit shook s quiet plea with igniting what could be the largest demonstration in the nation s capital related to a presidential election  more than   people from across the country have signed up to march in washington on jan    the day after trump s inauguration in support of women s rights  sister protests are planned in london and frankfurt and online interest has grown to hundreds of thousands   i didn t have a plan or a thought about what would happen    shook told reuters by phone from the island of maui   i just kept saying  i think we should march   after a bruising election campaign marked by trump s comments on women  organizers say his presidency could threaten access to women s healthcare  erode protection against sexual violence and roll back aid to struggling mothers   i was in such shock and disbelief that this type of sentiment could win   said shook  a retired lawyer from indiana with four grandchildren   we had to let people know that is not who were are   shook first floated the idea of a women s march in a private facebook group  pantsuit nation  which became a widely popular discussion page for supporters of trump s rival  hillary clinton  after getting a response to her post from a single woman in the chatroom  shook said she created a private facebook event page for the march and invited a few dozen online friends to join before going to sleep  overnight  a link to shook s event page was posted in pantsuit nation and possibly sent to similar groups   when i woke  up it had gone ballistic   shook said   more than   people are now  interested  in the event on facebook  including many of those who said they would participate  women from across the united states contacted shook and began to guide the effort      supporters say they were galvanized by trump s insults against high profile women  as well as by fresh fears the u s  supreme court ruling roe v  wade legalizing abortion could be at risk when trump appoints the next supreme court justice  and they were outraged when a  video surfaced in which he bragged about kissing women without permission and grabbing their genitals  trump apologized for the comments  but the remarks opened wounds for assault victims  and they were followed by several women who accused him of sexually assaulting or harassing them  trump denied the allegations    going through the whole election cycle was traumatizing for so many women   said one of the early organizers  fontaine pearson   i think it politicized or woke up a lot of them   while support for the march grew quickly  it also drew criticism for lacking diversity  nearly all of the initial organizers were white  the name  which started as the  million women march   was bashed on social media for mirroring the title of a march in philadelphia  years ago to empower black communities   in response  the name was changed to the  women s march on washington  and several veteran protest organizers working on behalf of minority groups were enlisted as national co chairs  they included tamika mallory  who led a criminal justice reform march from new york to washington last year    women of color needed to be included   mallory said  bernice king  whose father martin luther king jr  famously delivered his  i have a dream  speech in a march on washington a half century ago  encouraged women s march organizers in a phone call last week  the organizers said  the march s mission was also expanded to include concerns about racism  xenophobia  and the targeting of muslims and gay people  the alt right movement  which includes white supremacists and anti semites  has been emboldened by trump winning the white house  the southern poverty law center reported a sharp spike in hate crimes following trump s victory      the route  security and speaker lineup  as well as permitting by the national park service have yet to be finalized  said march spokeswoman breanne butler  but that has not deterred many who plan to attend  hotels in the washington area have received calls from many prospective marchers  said solomon keene  president of the hotel association of washington  dc   it s just about showing up   said gretchen kryss    a trainee psychologist who is driving to the rally from cleveland with her fianc√© and a group of friends  the only other similar demonstration in recent memory was at the first inauguration of george w  bush in   but the several thousand who turned up were focusing on the contested election  not the new president  this time  the focus appears to be trump himself  said mark peterson  chair of the department of public policy at the university of california  los angeles    peterson  a washington native who is an expert on politics and political campaigns  said logistical challenges  including heightened security during presidential inaugurations  could hamper the women s march  but the level of anger voiced by many women over trump s comments  including calling a former miss universe  miss piggy  and saying women should face punishment for abortions  could drive the demonstration to success  he said   my hope for this march is that for people who are scared  who are marginalized in america  will feel safer and know they have allies   said lisa fetterman  a  year old san francisco resident flying to washington to march with her husband
