berlin  reuters    in the week before u s  vice president mike pence visited brussels and pledged america s  steadfast and enduring  commitment to the european union  white house chief strategist steve bannon met with a german diplomat and delivered a different message  according to people familiar with the talks  bannon  these people said  signalled to germany s ambassador to washington that he viewed the eu as a flawed construct and favoured conducting relations with europe on a bilateral basis  three people who were briefed on the meeting spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter  the german government and the ambassador  peter wittig  declined to comment  citing the confidentiality of the talks  a white house official who checked with bannon in response to a reuters query confirmed the meeting had taken place but said the account provided to reuters was inaccurate   they only spoke for about three minutes and it was just a quick hello   the official said  the sources described a longer meeting in which bannon took the time to spell out his world view  they said his message was similar to the one he delivered to a vatican conference back in  when he was running the right wing website breitbart news  in those remarks  delivered via skype  bannon spoke favourably about european populist movements and described a yearning for nationalism by people who  don t believe in this kind of pan european union   western europe  he said at the time  was built on a foundation of  strong nationalist movements   adding   i think it s what can see us forward   the encounter unsettled people in the german government  in part because some officials had been holding out hope that bannon might temper his views once in government and offer a more nuanced message on europe in private  one source briefed on the meeting said it had confirmed the view that germany and its european partners must prepare for a policy of  hostility towards the eu    a second source expressed concern  based on his contacts with the administration  that there was no appreciation for the eu s role in ensuring peace and prosperity in post war europe   there appears to be no understanding in the white house that an unravelling of the eu would have grave consequences   the source said  the white house said there was no transcript of the conversation  the sources who had been briefed on it described it as polite and stressed there was no evidence trump was prepared to go beyond his rhetorical attacks on the eu   he has repeatedly praised britain s decision to leave   and take concrete steps to destabilise the bloc  but anxiety over the white house stance led french foreign minister jean marc ayrault and wolfgang ischinger  chairman of the munich security conference  to issue unusual calls last week for pence to affirm during his visit to europe that the u s  was not aiming to break up the eu  pence obliged on monday in brussels  pledging strong ties between the united states and the eu  and making clear his message was shared by the president   president trump and i look forward to working together with you and the european union to deepen our political and economic partnership   he said  but the message did not end the concerns in european capitals   we are worried and we should be worried   thomas matussek  senior adviser at flint global and a former german ambassador to the britain and the united nations  told reuters   no one knows anything at the moment about what sort of decisions will be coming out of washington  but it is clear that the man on top and the people closest to him feel that it s the nation state that creates identity and not what they see as an amorphous group of countries like the eu   with elections looming in the netherlands  france and germany this year  european officials said they hoped pence  secretary of defense jim mattis and secretary of state rex tillerson could convince trump to work constructively with the eu  the worst case scenario from europe s point of view was described by ischinger in an article published last week  entitled  how europe should deal with trump   he said that if the u s  administration actively supported right wing populists in the looming election campaigns it would trigger a  major transatlantic crisis
