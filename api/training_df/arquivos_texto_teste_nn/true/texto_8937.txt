new york  reuters    supporters of u s  presidential candidate donald trump are more likely to describe african americans as  criminal    unintelligent    lazy  and  violent  than voters who backed some republican rivals in the primaries or who support democratic contender hillary clinton  according to a reuters ipsos opinion poll  ahead of the nov   election to replace barack obama  the first black u s  president  the poll also showed significant numbers of americans in both the republican and democratic parties view blacks more negatively than whites  harbor anxiety about living in diverse neighborhoods and are concerned that affirmative action policies discriminate against whites  republicans in the survey expressed these concerns to a greater degree than democrats  with trump supporters presenting the most critical views of blacks  the poll  conducted between march and june  interviewed   americans and included  questions on attitudes about race  it sought responses from voters who support trump  the presumptive republican nominee  clinton  the presumptive democratic nominee  and her rival u s  senator bernie sanders  it also surveyed supporters of u s  senator ted cruz and ohio governor john kasich  the last two republican candidates to drop out of the race   mr  trump is an egalitarian who believes in supporting and protecting all people equally   said stephen miller  trump s senior policy adviser  when asked about the poll   this is a stark contrast to hillary clinton  whose policies have been a disaster for african american and hispanic citizens   a spokesman for hillary clinton declined to comment on the poll   graphic on racial attitudes of presidential candidates  supporters tmsnrt rs   nearly half of trump s supporters described african americans as more  violent  than whites  the same proportion described african americans as more  criminal  than whites  while  percent described them as more  lazy  than whites  in smaller  but still significant  numbers  clinton backers also viewed blacks more critically than whites with regard to certain personality traits  nearly one third of clinton supporters described blacks as more  violent  and  criminal  than whites  and one quarter described them as more  lazy  than whites  clinton is relying heavily on black voters to help her win the white house  and her victory over sanders in the early state nominating contests was due in part to her overwhelming lead among african americans  when asked about where they wanted to live   percent of trump supporters said   i prefer to live in a community with people who come from diverse cultures   compared with  percent of cruz supporters   percent of kasich supporters and  percent of clinton supporters  trump s supporters were more likely to be critical of affirmative action policies that favor minorities in school admissions or in hiring  some  percent of trump supporters said they  strongly agree  that  social policies  such as affirmative action  discriminate unfairly against white people   compared with  percent of cruz supporters   percent of kasich supporters and  percent of clinton supporters  to be sure  not all trump supporters expressed negative attitudes about blacks  no more than  percent of his supporters rated blacks negatively  relative to whites  on any of the six character traits in the poll  yet when their answers to the poll questions were compared with responses from supporters of other candidates  trump supporters were always more critical of blacks on personality traits  analysis of the results showed   the trend was consistent in the data  even when the results were filtered to include only white respondents to remove any impact that a different racial mix between clinton and trump supporters might play in the poll  the trump supporters  views on affirmative action and neighborhood diversity do not necessarily reflect racial bias alone  said michael traugott  a polling expert and professor emeritus at the university of michigan  who is not publicly supporting either trump or clinton  rather  the results could also suggest anxieties about economic insecurity and social standing   trump  whose supporters are mostly white  has promised to return manufacturing jobs to the united states  crack down on illegal immigration and pull out of global trade deals that he says have hurt american workers    the support for trump is indicative of the support for the type of policies he is advocating   said lawrence brown  a professor at morgan state university in baltimore who writes about racism and has supported sanders  obama said in may that u s  race relations have improved over the last three decades but that significant work still needs to be done   the issue of race has assumed great political prominence over the past two years  amid countrywide protests over police treatment of african americans  economic disparity between blacks and whites  and court challenges to affirmative action and voting rights  the reuters ipsos poll asked people to grade whites and blacks on a series of personal traits  the results were then analyzed to compare how each respondent rated whites with how they rated blacks  in nearly every case  trump supporters were more likely to rate whites higher than blacks when their responses were compared with responses from clinton supporters   for example   percent of trump supporters placed whites closer to the top level of  intelligence  than they did blacks  compared with  percent of clinton supporters who did the same  about  percent of trump supporters placed whites higher on the  hardworking  scale than blacks  while  percent of clinton supporters did the same  and  percent of trump supporters placed whites as more  well mannered  than blacks  compared with  percent of clinton supporters  the online poll  which surveyed people over the age of  across the united states  was conducted during two periods in the  election cycle  the first ran three weeks in march and april  while cruz and kasich were still competing with trump for the republican nomination  the second polling period covered nearly four weeks in may and june  after kasich and cruz had dropped out
