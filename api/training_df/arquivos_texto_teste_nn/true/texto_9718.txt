washington  reuters    it s a u s  taxpayer s dream  make the internal revenue service go away  and the largest conservative group in congress is endorsing just that  the republican study committee  which counts over two thirds of house of representatives republicans as its members  called recently for  the complete elimination of the irs   the committee s support for this idea  once confined to the fringes of conservative ideology  suggests it is more widely accepted on capitol hill than ever  but many in washington  including some republicans  have trouble taking it seriously  calls to abolish the irs have not been well thought through  republican representative charles boustany said in an interview   before we start making blanket statements about abolishing the irs  i think it s important to focus on what the tax code for the  century should look like   said boustany  who does not belong to the  member study committee  in an election year of dramatic rhetoric that is often short on details  the committee s proposal  released april  and echoing language from a march budget plan  is brief  as part of a wider appeal for federal tax reform  the committee says simply   this proposal takes the bold step of calling for the complete elimination of the irs  tax collection and enforcement activities would be moved to a new  smaller and more accountable department at the treasury   no further specifics were offered for how to replace an agency that is already part of the treasury  collected    trillion in revenue in  and processed  million tax returns  texas representative bill flores  chairman of the study committee  was not available for comment  his spokeswoman caitlin carroll said the irs closure proposal should be seen as part of a larger push for comprehensive tax reform  matthew gardner  head of the institute on taxation and economic policy  a tax research group  said most tax reform plans would still need a tax collector with enforcement powers   it s hard to imagine a situation in which we wouldn t need a sophisticated tax collection and enforcement capacity   he said   we are in an election year  and bashing the irs is particularly attractive in an election year   said steven rosenthal  senior fellow at the tax policy center think tank    from a global perspective  the irs does a good job  he said  noting that u s  income tax compliance is about  percent  one of the highest levels in the world  still  in the united states  antipathy for the irs is widespread and long standing  one of republican presidential candidate ted cruz s biggest applause lines on the campaign trail is   imagine abolishing the irs   asked recently about cruz s line and calls to close the agency  irs commissioner john koskinen said   if you want to call it something other than the irs and that makes you feel better  that s ok with me  but ultimately you got to have somebody somewhere who collects the information  audits it and makes sure it s accurate and valid and collects the funding   cruz s tax plan  unveiled in november  would create a flat  percent individual income tax and junk the present tax brackets  high income households would benefit the most under his plan  according to the tax policy center  a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution  some democrats scoff at the irs closure proposal   if there are problems at the irs     we can straighten it out   said democratic representative elijah cummings  he added that republicans should be wary of advocating an idea that  sounds trumpish   donald trump  the anti establishment front runner for the republican presidential nomination  has not called for abolition of the irs   congress has cut the irs  budget  percent in real terms since   in mid april  the house approved several irs bashing bills  including one to prevent it from making new hires until the treasury certifies no agency employees are seriously delinquent on taxes themselves  that bill and another one that would prevent the irs from spending user fees it collects without congressional approval have been placed on the senate calendar by republican leader mitch mcconnell  this means they can be brought up for debate and a vote  although no action has been set on either proposal   the irs has long been a congressional punching bag  but republicans have been hitting it harder since the irs several years ago applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups  applications for tax exempt status between  and    republican representative rob woodall of georgia has introduced a bill every year since he entered congress in  to eliminate income taxes and abolish the irs  support for woodall s bill has grown to  co sponsors  including the heads of the house tax and budget committees  but it has never advanced  nor has a similar bill in the senate  it was unclear how house speaker paul ryan would treat the study committee s proposal in drafting a party policy agenda ahead of the republican convention in cleveland in july   the speaker welcomes input from the rsc and all members of our conference   said ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong  ryan has sidestepped calls for abolishing the irs in the past  while frequently criticizing the agency
