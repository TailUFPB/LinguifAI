washington  reuters    donald trump s nominee to head the cia sought on thursday to repair damage from the president elect s feud with u s  intelligence agencies  saying he accepted their findings on russian hacking  would not comply if ordered to renew use of harsh interrogation techniques and would always  have their backs   mike pompeo s testimony at his senate confirmation hearing appeared aimed at reassuring staff at the agency he has been picked to lead  even at the risk of contradicting or distancing himself from some of trump s strongest criticism of the intelligence community  diverging from trump s stated aim of seeking closer ties with russia  pompeo accused the russian leadership of  aggressive action  in meddling in the november u s  elections  of  asserting itself aggressively  by occupying part of ukraine and of doing  doing nearly nothing  to destroy islamic state  pompeo  a republican member of the house of representatives and a former u s  army officer  insisted that if necessary he would be ready to stand up to trump  who takes office on jan    and would shield cia operatives against any effort to politicize its work   you have my commitment that every day  i will not only speak truth to power  but i will demand that the men and the women  of the cia      follow my instruction to do that each and every day   he said  for weeks  the republican president elect questioned the intelligence agencies  conclusion that russia used hacking and other tactics to try to tilt the election in his favor   an unprecedented breach between an incoming u s  leader and the intelligence operatives he will soon command  trump said on wednesday that russia was behind the hacking but that other countries were hacking the united states as well  asked about the hacking  pompeo said he was very clear about what he called an  aggressive action  ordered by the russian leadership  and accepted the u s  intelligence report on the matter   i ve seen nothing to cast any doubt on the findings in the report   he said  trump this week also furiously denounced intelligence officials for what he said were leaks to the media by intelligence agencies of a dossier that makes unverified  salacious allegations about his contacts in russia  by contrast  pompeo voiced strong support for the agency   saying he has seen central intelligence agency staff  walk through fire   he said he understood it would be a problem  if folks were afraid there would be political retribution  and promised  to have their backs at every single moment  you have my word i will do that   pompeo also signaled he would stand firm if necessary against trump on the issue of enhanced interrogation techniques for terrorism suspects  such techniques  which were introduced under president george w  bush after the sept     attacks on the united states  are widely regarded as torture and their use has been banned by congress  trump said during the election campaign the united states should bring back tactics such as waterboarding  which simulates drowning  although since the election he has said he has heard arguments against such methods  asked about the issue  pompeo said that he would  absolutely not  restart enhanced interrogation techniques by the cia if asked by the president elect  he noted it would take a change in the law for the cia to use interrogation techniques that go beyond those permitted by the army  adding he could not imagine that trump would order the cia to use illegal methods  pompeo  a conservative lawmaker from kansas who is on the house intelligence committee  emphasized that he would be a neutral assessor of challenges and threats  in opening remarks he said he understood that if confirmed his role would switch from policymaker to provider of information  noting that the cia does not make policy on any country  he added   it is a policy decision as to what to do with russia  but it will be essential that the agency provide policymakers with accurate intelligence and clear eyed analysis of russian activities   equally  he said that he would drop the opposition he has had as a lawmaker to the  nuclear deal between iran and major powers  he said the cia must be  rigorously fair and objective  in assessing the deal  but he called the iranians  professionals at cheating  and said he would work to improve u s  capability to detect violations of tehran s commitment to curb its nuclear activities  he called iran an  emboldened  disruptive player in the middle east  fuelling tensions  with sunni muslim allies of the united states   pompeo listed it among the challenges facing the united states along with what he called a  resilient  islamic state and the fallout from syria s long civil war  pompeo also named north korea  which he said had  dangerously accelerated its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities   he said china was creating  real tensions  with its activities in the south china sea and in cyberspace as it flexed its muscles and expanded its military and economic reach
