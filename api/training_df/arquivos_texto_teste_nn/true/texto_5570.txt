washington  reuters    president donald trump is planning to issue a directive targeting a controversial dodd frank rule that requires companies to disclose whether their products contain  conflict minerals  from a war torn part of africa  according to sources familiar with the administration s thinking  reuters could not learn precisely when the directive would be issued or what the final version would say  however  a leaked draft that has been floating around washington and was seen by reuters on wednesday calls for the rule to be temporarily suspended for two years   reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the document  the sources spoke on tuesday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the plan  the  dodd frank law explicitly gives the president authority to order the u s  securities and exchange commission  sec  to temporarily suspend or revise the rule for two years if it is in the national security interest of the united states  the conflict minerals rule was endorsed by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten mined from the democratic republic of congo in the hope that such disclosures would curb funding to armed groups     business groups opposed to the measure have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain  in the leaked draft memo seen by reuters  the secretary of state and secretary of the treasury were asked to propose a plan for addressing human rights violations and the funding of armed groups in the democratic republic of congo and report back within  days  the memo also lays out a justification for suspending the rule  saying that while it has helped discourage some american companies from purchasing materials in the region  it has also led to  some job loss    it also cited  sec estimates about the costs imposed on companies  which entailed upfront costs of   billion to   billion  and   million per year thereafter  carly oboth  a policy adviser at human rights group global witness  said in a statement on wednesday that she was deeply concerned about trump s planned executive action   this law helps stop u s  companies funding conflict and human rights abuses in the democratic republic of congo and surrounding countries   she said   suspending it will benefit secretive and corrupt business practices  responsible business practices are starting to spread in eastern congo  this action could reverse that progress   a white house executive order last week took aim more broadly at the dodd frank rules that were put into place after the   financial crisis  that order did not single out a  particular rule  but called on the treasury secretary to consult with other regulators  including the sec  and come back with a report outlining possible regulatory changes and legislation   the conflict minerals rule is one of several disclosure regulations in dodd frank that are unrelated to the financial crisis  another dodd frank sec disclosure rule that required oil  gas and mining companies to disclose payments to foreign governments was repealed by the republican controlled congress last week  in   a u s  appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the business roundtable  the u s  chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers sued the sec over it  the court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free  the rest of the rule was left intact and companies are  required to conduct due diligence and report the details of those inquiries in public reports filed with the sec  the sec cannot repeal the rule without a law passed by congress  it can  however  use its broad exemptive powers to scale back some of the requirements or stop enforcing the rule entirely  last week  acting sec chair michael piwowar took steps toward doing that by announcing that he had asked sec staff to reconsider how companies should comply with it and whether  additional relief  was warranted  house financial services chairman jeb hensarling  meanwhile  is planning to reintroduce his financial choice act bill  which contains a provision to repeal the conflict minerals rule
