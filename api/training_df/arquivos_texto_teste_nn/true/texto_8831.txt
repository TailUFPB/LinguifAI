 reuters    the u s  senate on thursday approved legislation that would for the first time require food to carry labels listing genetically modified ingredients  which labeling supporters say could create loopholes for some u s  crops  the senate voted   for the bill that would display gmo contents with words  pictures or a bar code that can be scanned with smartphones  the u s  agriculture department  usda  would decide which ingredients would be considered genetically modified  the measure now goes to the house of representatives  where it is expected to pass  drawing praise from farmers  the bill sponsored by republican senator pat roberts of kansas and democrat senator debbie stabenow of michigan is the latest attempt to introduce a national standard that would override state laws  including vermont s that some say is more stringent  and comes amid growing calls from consumers for greater transparency   this bipartisan bill ensures that consumers and families throughout the united states will have access  for the first time ever  to information about their food through a mandatory  nationwide label for food products with gmos   stabenow said in a statement  a nationwide standard is favored by the food industry  which says state by state differences could inflate costs for labeling and distribution  but mandatory gmo labeling of any kind would still be seen as a loss for big food  which has spent millions lobbying against it  farmers lobbied against the vermont law  worrying that labeling stigmatizes gmo crops and could hurt demand for food containing those ingredients  but have applauded this law      critics like senator bernie sanders  an independent from vermont  say the bill s vague language and allowance for electronic labels for scanning could limit its scope and create confusion   when parents go to the store and purchase food  they have the right to know what is in the food their kids are going to be eating   sanders said on the floor of the senate ahead of the vote  he said at a news conference this week that major food manufacturers have already begun labeling products with gmo ingredients to meet the new law in his home state  another opponent of the bill  democratic senator jeff merkley of oregon  said it would institute weak federal requirements making it virtually impossible for consumers to access information about gmos  food ingredients like beet sugar and soybean oil  which can be derived from genetically engineered crops but contain next to no genetic material by the time they are processed  may not fall under the law s definition of a bioengineered food  critics say  gmo corn may also be excluded thanks to ambiguous language  some said  the u s  food and drug administration  fda  raised concerns about the involvement of the usda in a list of worries sent in a june  memo to the senate agriculture committee  in a letter to stabenow last week  the usda s general counsel tried to quell those worries  saying it would include commercially grown gmo corn  soybeans  sugar and canola crops  the vast majority of corn  soybeans and sugar crops in the united states are produced from genetically engineered seeds  the domestic sugar market has been strained by rising demand for non gmo ingredients like cane sugar  the united states is the world s largest market for foods made with genetically altered ingredients  many popular processed foods are made with soybeans  corn and other biotech crops whose genetic traits have been manipulated  often to make them resistant to insects and pesticides   it s fair to say that it s not the ideal bill  but it is certainly the bill that can pass  which is the most important right now   said american soybean association s  asa  director of policy communications patrick delaney  the association was part of the coalition for safe and affordable food  which lobbied for what labeling supporters termed the deny americans the right to know  or dark act  that would have made labeling voluntary  it was blocked by the senate in march
