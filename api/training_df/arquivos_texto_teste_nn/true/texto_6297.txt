london  reuters    u s  secretary of state john kerry said on monday it was  inappropriate  for donald trump to brand german chancellor angela merkel s refugee policy  a catastrophic mistake    i thought frankly it was inappropriate for a president elect of the united states to be stepping into the politics of other countries in a quite direct manner   kerry told cnn s christiane amanpour during a one day visit to london in the last week of the obama administration   he will have to speak to that  as of friday  he is responsible for that relationship   trump  who will be sworn in as president on friday  had said in a joint interview with bild newspaper and the times of london that he respected merkel  but criticized her stance on refugees  which allowed a wave of more than  million refugees into germany  merkel faces a tough re election battle in september   i think we have to be very careful about suggesting that one s strongest leaders in europe  and most important players with respect to where we are heading  made one mistake or another  i don t think it s appropriate for us to be commenting on that   kerry said  he rejected trump s description of merkel s refugee policy as  catastrophic    i think she was extremely courageous  i don t think it amounts to that characterization   kerry said   it has had some problems  but everybody has had some problems with this challenge of how to respond as a big nation  a great nation  as the west  where our values  our principles are important with respect to caring for people who are in distress   he added  the united states has admitted far fewer syrian refugees than some allies  such as germany  trump has said violent militants could enter the country posing as refugees     the cnn interview came a day after kerry attended a one day conference of  nations in paris on israeli palestinian peace  the conference reaffirmed that only a two state solution could resolve the conflict and warned against unilateral steps by either side that could prejudge negotiations  trump has said resolving the conflict will be a priority of his administration and suggested that his son in law jared kushner could help broker a peace deal between the israelis and palestinians  kerry  who tried for nine months to forge an agreement between the two sides  welcomed trump s efforts but pushed back at a suggestion that the obama administration was to blame for the failure to clinch a deal   no  no  the leaders of the two countries involved     have failed to come to the table to reach an agreement  you can lead a horse to water  you can t make it drink  and we did a lot of leading to a lot of water
