 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration has instructed the environmental protection agency to remove the climate change page from its website  two agency employees told reuters  the latest move by the newly minted leadership to erase ex president barack obama s climate change initiatives   the employees were notified by epa officials on tuesday that the administration had instructed epa s communications team to remove the website s climate change page  which contains links to scientific global warming research  as well as detailed data on emissions  the page could go down as early as wednesday  the sources said   don t miss  dow hits   as post election rally roars back to life insight  how russia sold its oil jewel   without saying who bought it opinion  trump probably can t require pipelines to use u s  steel  if the website goes dark  years of work we have done on climate change will disappear   one of the epa staffers told reuters  who added some employees were scrambling to save some of the information housed on the website  or convince the trump administration to preserve parts of it   the sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media   a trump administration official did not immediately respond to a request for comment   the order comes as trump s administration has moved to curb the flow of information from several government agencies who oversee environmental issues since last week  in actions that appeared designed to tighten control and discourage dissenting views   the moves have reinforced concerns that trump  a climate change doubter  could seek to sideline scientific research showing that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming  as well as the career staffers at the agencies that conduct much of this research   myron ebell  who helped guide the epa s transition after trump was elected in november until he was sworn in last week  said the move was not surprising    my guess is the web pages will be taken down  but the links and information will be available   he said   the page includes links to the epa s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions  which contains emissions data from individual industrial facilities as well as the multiagency climate change indicators report  which describes trends related to the causes and effects of climate change   the trump administration s recently appointed team to guide the post obama transition has drawn heavily from the energy industry lobby and pro drilling think tanks  according to a list of the newly introduced  member team   trump appointed oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  a longtime foe of the epa who has led  lawsuits against it  as the agency s administrator  the senate environment committee held a tense seven hour confirmation hearing for pruitt last week  no vote on his nomination has been scheduled yet
