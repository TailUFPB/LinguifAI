washington  reuters    u s  marine corps commandant general robert neller  like much of the pentagon top brass  is pretty happy about president elect donald trump s campaign pledge to rebuild america s military after years of congressionally imposed spending caps  but ask neller about trump s main proposal to increase the number of marine infantry battalions from  today to   and he pauses   that s a lot   neller told reuters in an interview  neller  like many of his pentagon colleagues  thinks america s military needs to shift quickly to prepare for more sophisticated adversaries than the insurgents the united states has been fighting in iraq  syria and afghanistan  that will require more troops  including in the infantry  but neller wants more cyber  intelligence and avionics specialists  as well as additional jets  amphibious ships and other weaponry that can better prepare the marine corps for a potential conflict with another country  islamic extremists are certainly lethal  neller says  but are not nearly as capable as even the russia backed separatists that ukraine is fighting  whose arsenal includes drones  radar and accurate artillery  for example   if you think the next war s going to be like this  counter insurgency battle   then ok fine  i don t think it is  i don t   neller said    it s going to be much more difficult  it s going to be much more complicated  it s going to be much more sophisticated   at the reagan national defense forum in california  neller said his wish list for the marine corps included speeding up purchases of higher end items  including lockheed martin corp s stealth supersonic f  aircraft and the joint light tactical vehicle  jltv  made by oshkosh corp  trump s campaign proposal for the marine corps was based on a heritage foundation study that determined that  active duty battalions would be necessary to wage two wars at once   having this ability deters other competitors from trying to take advantage of the u s  being  tied down  in a conflict in one region   wrote the heritage foundation s dakota wood  to that end  trump has also pledged to build an active army of around    up from about   today and build a navy approaching  surface ships and submarines  up from just over  ships today  he pledged to give the air force at least   fighter aircraft  about  more than today  air force secretary deborah lee james  speaking at the same defense forum  welcomed the possibility of more aircraft and  like neller  expressed interest in accelerating the acquisition of f  aircraft   additional aircraft would certainly allow us to be able to do different jobs across the word simultaneously   james said  also noting the need for a new bomber   but james also spoke of other high end capabilities  including in space  and warned about the need for congress to fund nuclear modernization  which some estimates say will cost about   trillion over the next three decades  chief of naval operations admiral john richardson said the u s  arms industry is ready and capable of boosting production of new ships to meet trump s campaign pledge  shifting the current target of  ships upwards would be  remarkably easy   as long as there is funding to pay the bill   if it s resourced  it s a matter of working closely with the industrial base  and they definitely are ready to do that   he told reuters  adding the only limiting factor would be hiring and training workers to build the new ships  republicans  who will control both houses of congress and the white house after trump is sworn in on jan    see good prospects for raising military spending levels and scrapping a  law that imposed mandatory cost caps on defense spending  still  it s unclear how trump will fund all of his planned programs  which beyond the military spending spree includes paying for a major u s  domestic infrastructure program  for neller and other pentagon chiefs  investing to prepare for more advanced threats is a priority  regardless of whether trump makes good on his pledges   the only thing we re not going to do is stay the same  we re not  can t  i d be derelict in my duties   neller said
