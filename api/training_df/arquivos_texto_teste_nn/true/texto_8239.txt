washington  reuters    members of the republican majority in the u s  house of representatives will discuss next week whether the nation s top tax collector  john koskinen  should be impeached over conservative charges he stonewalled a congressional investigation  house leaders said wednesday  democrats decried the move as a politically motivated embarrassment that would in any case be stopped in the senate  even some republicans said they did not think koskinen s activities justified impeachment from his post as internal revenue service  irs  commissioner  conservative republicans in the house have said koskinen failed to comply with a congressional investigation into whether the irs applied extra scrutiny to applications for tax exempt status by conservative groups between  and   house speaker paul ryan and other leading house republicans have shown little interest in pursuing impeachment  but ryan indicated wednesday that he expected floor action because conservatives had filed a privileged resolution  which can bypass regular procedures and take precedence on the house floor   this is something that we re going to have a planning conference on next week   ryan told a regular press conference   this is something where congress is going to work its will   the senate s democratic leader  harry reid  called the process a  waste  put that in big capital letters  and said it could be blocked in the senate by that chamber s majority leader  republican  mitch mcconnell  a spokesman for mcconnell declined to say what action mcconnell might take if the house does vote for koskinen s impeachment   i know koskinen very well   another senior senate republican  finance chairman orrin hatch told reuters   yeah  he s made mistakes but he hasn t made mistakes that justify an impeachment   koskinen became irs commissioner in december   after the controversy already had exploded over the way the agency had handled the applications for tax exempt status  members of the house freedom caucus  the chamber s most conservative bloc  have said koskinen should be pushed out because of his role in the aftermath of the scandal  they noted that he was commissioner when backup tapes were destroyed containing emails from former irs official lois lerner  who had headed the irs  tax exempt division  democrats have noted that the justice department brought no criminal charges against lerner and say the case against koskinen shows little more than agency mismanagement and misstatements
