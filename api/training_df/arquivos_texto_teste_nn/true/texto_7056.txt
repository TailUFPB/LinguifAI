washington  reuters    wisconsin s election board agreed on friday to conduct a statewide recount of votes cast in the presidential race  as requested by a green party candidate seeking similar reviews in two other states where donald trump scored narrow wins  the recount process  including an examination by hand of the nearly  million ballots tabulated in wisconsin  is expected to begin late next week after green party candidate jill stein s campaign has paid the required fee  the elections commission said  the state faces a dec   federal deadline to complete the recount  which may require canvassers in wisconsin s  counties to work evenings and weekends to finish the job in time  according to the commission  the recount fee has yet to be determined  the agency said in a statement on its website  stein said in a facebook message on friday that the sum was expected to run to about    million  she said she has raised at least   million from donors since launching her drive on wednesday for recounts in wisconsin  michigan and pennsylvania   three battleground states where republican trump edged out democratic nominee hillary clinton by relatively thin margins  stein has said her goal is to raise   million to cover all fees and legal costs  her effort may have given a ray of hope to dispirited clinton supporters  but the chance of overturning the overall result of the nov   election is considered very slim  even if all three states go along with the recount  the green party candidate  who garnered little more than  percent of the nationwide popular vote herself  said on friday that she was seeking to verify the integrity of the u s  voting system  not to undo trump s victory  while there was no evidence of tampering or voting errors in the election  only a thorough review of results from the three states at issue will reassure americans  stein said   this was a hack riddled election   she told cnn  pointing to various cyber attacks on political organizations and individual email accounts before election day and media reports citing concerns raised by computer security specialists  experts urged extra scrutiny of the three states  stein said  because their voting systems were seen as vulnerable  they also cited  unexplained high numbers of undervotes   the close finish between the two nominees and  discrepancies between pre election polling and the official result   she said  according to stein  the wisconsin commission confirmed receipt of her recount petition at   p m  local time  just over an hour before the deadline for filing  the filing deadline is monday in pennsylvania and wednesday in michigan  the wisconsin board said stein was joined in her petition by another third party candidate  rocky roque de la fuente  although trump won narrowly in wisconsin  michigan and pennsylvania  the margins make it highly unlikely any recounts would end up giving clinton a win in all three states  which would be needed for the overall election result to change  trump beat clinton in pennsylvania by   votes  in michigan by   votes and in wisconsin by   votes  the presidential race is decided by the electoral college  based on a tally of wins from the state by state contests  rather than by the popular national vote  the electoral college results are expected to be finalized on dec    trump surpassed the  electoral votes needed to win  although clinton will have won the national popular vote by more than  million ballots once final tallies are in  a representative for trump s transition team on thursday had no comment on stein s effort  and clinton has not commented on stein s effort
