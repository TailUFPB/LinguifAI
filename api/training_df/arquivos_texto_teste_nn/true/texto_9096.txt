new york  reuters    philadelphia mayor jim kenney scored a victory that had eluded more than  u s  public officials who took on the powerful u s  soda industry when the city council voted on thursday to slap a tax on sweetened drinks   after a bitter  months long battle  the city council voted   to approve a   cent per ounce tax on sugary and diet drinks beginning in january  the council already approved the plan in a preliminary vote last week  and the outcome had not been expected to change   the city of brotherly love became the biggest u s  city to have such a tax  much smaller berkeley  california  was the first  similar efforts  including several spearheaded by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg  were defeated after intense lobbying from organizations like the american beverage association  which opposes the philadelphia move and represents coca cola co and pepsico inc   following thursday s vote  the aba said it would take legal action to stop the tax   the philadelphia vote marked a major victory for health advocates who say sugary drinks cause obesity and diabetes  but experts noted those concerns were not the focus for kenney and other backers of the tax as they took on critics complaining that  nanny state  public health measures intrude on residents  personal lives  instead  kenney rewrote the soda tax advocate s playbook  he played up the benefits of the cash injection from the tax for the city s depleted coffers  in the first year  the tax is projected to raise   million  and he pledged to spend funds on public programs such as universal pre kindergarten   if you want to tax something and people know where the money s going to go  then it s easier for them to get behind it   kenney said in an interview  he noted that focusing on revenue  rather than health  was largely responsible for the measure s passage   the strategic shift could lend momentum to movements in san francisco  neighboring oakland  california  and boulder  colorado  residents of those cities will vote in november on similar taxes  which could deal further blows to a u s  soft drink industry already hit by declining soda consumption  u s  soda consumption fell for the  straight year in   according to euromonitor data   bloomberg made public health a centerpiece of his tenure as new york city mayor between  and   he moved to limit smoking in parks and restaurants  ban transfats and require calorie counts posted in some restaurants  on soda  he pushed for a tax  then a ban on soda purchases with food stamps  and finally a much lampooned limit on the size of sugary drinks  his efforts were ultimately rejected  with critics decrying the moves toward a  nanny state    the strategy worked in britain  where a new soft drinks levy was announced in march after officials emphasized the country s obesity crisis  saying it cost the economy billions of pounds annually and was a huge burden on the state funded health system   that approach never worked in philadelphia  michael nutter  the previous mayor  twice tried to pass a soda tax as a health initiative and as a way to plug a budget shortfall  he was unable to push it through the city council   twice before it was used in philadelphia and it was not successful  it was used in new york and it was not effective   said kenney  adding that while the health benefits of a tax are not  less important   they are less tangible   kenney  who became mayor in january  had made a campaign pledge to provide universal pre kindergarten  and he kept that issue as his focus  a spokeswoman said complex state laws on taxation made enacting a citywide soda tax the best option to raise revenue for that signature proposal  bloomberg personally contributed funding to support philadelphia s pro tax campaigners   opponents of philadelphia s soda tax argued that the measure will disproportionately hurt the poor and prompt philadelphians to travel to nearby suburbs to buy soda   a spokesman for no philly grocery tax  a local aba funded group  said it would sue the city to stop it from imposing the  unconstitutional  tax  but was still analyzing all its legal options  in a statement  it called the tax  regressive and discriminatory    kenney said the city was prepared to defend the tax in any litigation from the beverage industry    it s the precedent that they were so staunchly fighting  and that s their problem now   kenney said   you re going to see the beginnings of a kind of domino effect relative to this specific effort    in colorado  boulder hopes to use soda tax revenue on health programs  and san francisco and oakland officials would recommend but not require funds raised to go toward obesity and diabetes prevention   when berkeley passed its soda tax in   industry groups dismissed the measure as a fluke given the city s largely white population and reputation as a hotbed for liberal measures  but philadelphia is the fifth largest u s  city  with   million people   no one can trivialize it as they can trivialize berkeley   said larry tramutola  a california political strategist who worked on the berkeley campaign and is currently leading the san francisco and oakland efforts
