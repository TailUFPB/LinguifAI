washington  reuters    the u s  justice department filed an appeal late saturday to restore president donald trump s immigration order barring citizens from seven mainly muslim countries and temporarily banning refugees  even as travelers raced to enter the country while the ban was lifted  the government moved to reverse a federal judge s friday order that lifted the travel ban and warned the decision posed an immediate harm to the public  thwarted enforcement of an executive order and  second guesses the president s national security judgment about the quantum of risk posed by the admission of certain classes of  non citizens  and the best means of minimizing that risk    friday s ruling prompted trump to denounce the  so called  judge in a series of tweets on saturday    the appeal now goes to a three judge panel which can act at anytime to uphold the order or suspend it pending a full appeal  a justice department spokesman declined to comment beyond the filing  a ruling could come at any time  seattle u s  district judge james robart s decision barred the administration from enforcing the sweeping order that also indefinitely barred syrian refugee admissions and prompted large protests across the united states   trump  whose personal attack on robart  decrying his opinion as  ridiculous   went too far for some who said the president was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the white house and congress  said he was confident the government would prevail   we ll win  for the safety of the country  we ll win   he told reporters in florida  robart s ruling came in a case brought by the state attorney general of washington state and was backed by major state employers amazon com inc and expedia inc   the lawsuit is one of several now filed against the trump executive order around the united states  but it was the first case leading to a broad decision that applies nationwide  the justice department appeal criticized robart s legal reasoning  saying it violates the separation of powers and steps on the president s authority as commander chief  the appeal said the state of washington lacked standing to challenge the order and denied that the order  favors christians at the expense of muslims   congress gave the president  the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class  of visitor  the justice department wrote   courts are particularly ill equipped to second guess the president s prospective judgment about future risks   the appeal said  calling the decision  vastly overbroad   washington state lawyers worked around the clock last weekend against the backdrop of turbulent scenes at u s  airports  where immigrants were detained by federal officials unprepared to implement the president s directive  a spokesman for washington state attorney general bob ferguson didn t immediately comment early sunday  the u s  state department and department of homeland security said they were complying with robart s order and many visitors are expected to start arriving on sunday  while the government said it expects to begin admitting refugees again on monday  a decision to reinstate trump s order could again cause havoc at u s  airports because some visitors are in transit  as was the case when the order took effect on jan    as the ban lifted friday  refugees and thousands of travelers from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by the  executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the united states  the panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes three judges appointed by former republican president george w  bush and two former democratic presidents  jimmy carter and barack obama  u s  immigration advocacy groups including the american civil liberties union on saturday in a joint statement urged those with now valid visas from the seven nations  to consider rebooking travel to the united states immediately  because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold  a u s  state department email reviewed by reuters said the department is working to begin admitting refugees including syrians as soon as monday  trump s jan   order had barred admission of citizens from seven majority muslim nations for  days  suspended all refugee admissions for  days and indefinitely barred syrian refugees   it is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary  which the u s  constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and congress  reached by email saturday  robart declined comment on trump s tweets  democratic u s  senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement saturday that trump s  hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing  it is dangerous  he seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis   in an interview with abc scheduled to air sunday  vice president mike pence said he did not think that trump s criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers  the court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to trump s push to clamp down on immigration  the sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would be immigrants back to airports  with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the united states will remain open  in erbil  the capital of the kurdish region of northern iraq  fuad sharef and his family prepared to fly on saturday to istanbul and then new york before starting a new life in nashville  tennessee  virtually all refugees also were barred by trump s order  upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the united states
