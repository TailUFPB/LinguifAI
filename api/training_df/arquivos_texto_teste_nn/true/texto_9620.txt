new york  reuters    the chairman of the u s  house of representatives  natural resources committee said on monday legislation to address puerto rico s growing debt and humanitarian crisis will be introduced for discussion on wednesday  with a committee vote a week later  earlier attempts at introducing a bill out of the committee failed to gain enough attention or understanding among lawmakers  prompting its chairman  rep  rob bishop  a utah republican  to delay and rework the bill  the basic premise of installing an independent oversight board to lead the restructuring of the u s  commonwealth s credit and work with the local government to develop an economic reform plan remains in place   what we are seeing in puerto rico is if you push it off  the situation gets worse  the debt gets worse  the humanitarian crisis gets worse  if you don t want a bailout and you put it off long enough  you probably will be forced into a position of being in a bailout and i m not going to vote for that   bishop said  puerto rico has already defaulted on some of its debt and faces an overall bill of   billion it cannot pay  a staggering  percent poverty rate and increased migration of citizens to the u s  mainland drains economic activity  bishop said the changes to the bill were relatively small and that the u s  treasury has been  marvelous  to work with in developing the plan   obviously the relationship between the obama administration and this congress has not been warm and fuzzy  so this is unusual in the amount of help they have given us   bishop said  adding   at the same time i want it finished  i want them to actually sign off and in some of the small areas  i think they have been dragging their feet   u s  treasury secretary jack lew visited a puerto rican school and hospital on monday where teachers  nurses and doctors described and showed dire conditions due to the lack of funding  lew later told reporters he had not seen the latest language in the draft bill  but that the treasury has provided technical advice  he said it was up to the committee to decide when to release the legislation   i hope congress does not  as it sometimes does  try to find that last possible moment and miss it   lew said  puerto rico defaulted on may  for a third time on some of its debt  missing a roughly   million payment owed by the government development bank  the island s main fiscal agent  however  some of the gdb s major creditors are forgoing lawsuits for at least a month after reaching a tentative restructuring deal with the bank   if we don t get a bill passed  then lawsuits are going to be coming fast and furiously   bishop said  the may  default and the nearly   billion july  debt payments have spurred congressional activity   the goal being that everyone eventually gets paid  and who is first in the line is maybe not as important as the fact that at the end of the day everyone has the chance to be treated fairly and will get their investment back   bishop said  lew  in his remarks  added that the bill will have to take into account many stakeholders  not just bondholders   the interests of retirees on the island have to be balanced  not treated necessarily equally  but balanced   lew said  adding that television advertisements calling the legislation a bailout  crossed the line and are deceptive   puerto rico s government has said it has not asked for a taxpayer led bailout  nor has one been offered  while the legislation will include bankruptcy language  it is not a stealthy way around a prohibition for puerto rico to use the u s  bankruptcy code to restructure its debt  bishop said   we are putting this language in the code that deals specifically with the territories  so everything we do has got to have that firewall between that which will have an impact on the states versus what is there in the territory
