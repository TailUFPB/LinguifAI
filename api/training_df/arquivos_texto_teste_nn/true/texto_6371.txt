washington  reuters    vice president joe biden on thursday criticized president elect donald trump for comparing the u s  intelligence establishment to nazi germany and said it was damaging to the united states  standing in the world to denigrate agencies that protect the nation  trump  a republican who takes office on jan    on wednesday said leaks from intelligence agencies led some u s  media outlets to report unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in russia  and said such leaks were reminiscent of nazi germany   it is really very damaging  in my view  to our standing in the world for a president to take one of the crown jewels of our national defense and denigrate it   biden  a democrat  told reporters at the white house  referring to intelligence agencies   it plays into  particularly now  the russian narrative that america doesn t know what it s doing   trump tweeted on thursday that u s  spy chief james clapper had called him to  denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated    clapper  however  said in a statement on wednesday night that in the call with trump he emphasized that the report was not produced by u s  intelligence agencies and that they had not judged whether the information was reliable  he did not say the document was false  capper said he expressed his dismay over media leaks  the director of national intelligence added that he did not believe the leaks came from u s  intelligence agencies  at the white house  biden praised the quality of u s  intelligence and said it was not surprising that someone who had never worked in government would not understand how consequential intelligence reports are  trump has never held elected office   the one thing you never want to invoke is nazi germany  no matter what the circumstances   biden said   even if you re trying to make a point that may  and i m not suggesting it did  may be relevant  it just  it is an overwhelming diversion   groups fighting anti semitism have also objected to trump s reference to nazi germany   the president elect s use of nazi germany to make a political analogy is not only an inappropriate comparison on the merits  but it also coarsens our discourse and diminishes the horror of the holocaust   jonathan greenblatt  chief executive of the anti defamation league  said in a statement on wednesday  biden said he hoped trump would realize the importance of intelligence briefings at the white house   it s an extremely valuable tool     i think he ll come to understand that  and if he doesn t  it would be a tragedy for the interests of the country   biden said  biden said he liked his successor  vice president elect mike pence  and had briefed him on the job  he said he thought pence s views of russia and its president  vladimir putin  were more informed than trump s   i never know what he means   biden said of trump   but i do think that mike is significantly more informed about russian conduct  potential intentions and putin s behavior than     the president elect is  based on what the president elect says   the vice president  who considered running for the  democratic presidential nomination  said he did not think his party was experiencing a crisis after its losses in the u s  elections  trump defeated secretary of state hillary clinton in the presidential race  and democrats did not succeed in their efforts to regain control of the u s  senate and significantly erode republican control of the u s  house of representatives   i don t think they re in a crisis  i think the party has to just remember who the hell they are   said biden
