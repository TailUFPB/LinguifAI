 reuters    republican donald trump campaigned on a promise to shake up washington and as president the brash real estate mogul will be in a position to dramatically change how the united states handles immigration  trade and a range of other policies  yet many of his more ambitious proposals will require cooperation from congress after he takes office on jan    while he will may enjoy a post election honeymoon with congressional republicans  a long lasting romance is far from guaranteed  given his uneasy relationship with congressional leaders and some basic ideological differences he has with republican orthodoxy  following is an overview of trump s top policy plans  in his campaign  trump argued that international trade agreements had hurt u s  workers and the country s competitiveness  he has promised to  get tough  on china and withdraw from the  nation trans pacific partnership  or tpp  which is still not finalized  as president  trump does have some power to raise tariffs on countries such as china   president barack obama s administration has suspended its efforts to win congressional approval for tpp  saying its fate was up to trump and republican lawmakers  trump has also said he would renegotiate or scrap the north american free trade agreement  the  free trade deal with mexico and canada  both canada and mexico have indicated they are willing to discuss the agreement with trump  canada has indicated it would consider a free trade agreement that excludes mexico  economists have warned that such moves would damage the economy by forcing consumers to pay dramatically higher prices on everything from refrigerators to t shirts  u s  exports  such as airplanes and soybeans  would likely suffer as well       trump has promised to build a wall along the mexican border  deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been  compromised by terrorism    since his election  he has said parts could be a fence instead of a wall  and he would act to deport up to  million immigrants in the country illegally who have criminal records  it was unclear where his figure comes from  think tank migration policy institute estimated in a  report there were   unauthorized immigrants with criminal records     those policies would not come cheap  trump has estimated the wall would cost   billion to   billion  other estimates have run much higher  politico estimated it would cost at least   billion to deport all of those in the country illegally and complete a border wall  while many congressional republicans support those policies  they might blanch at the cost  trump has said he would force mexico to pay for the wall  but he has no power to force another country to spend money on something it does not want   trump also promised to withhold federal funds from  sanctuary cities  such as new york and los angeles that shield people who are in the country illegally      more broadly  trump could shift the broader debate over immigration  empowering skeptics like republican senator jeff sessions of alabama who want to reduce overall immigration levels and reduce the number of skilled guest workers  that would be a blow to business groups and hispanic advocates who have sought to relax immigration laws  trump has promised to repeal president barack obama s signature affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  and replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally  he would need congress to act  and republicans could have difficulty getting the  votes needed to advance a repeal effort through the  member senate  republicans could face a public backlash if they repeal a law that has provided healthcare to millions of americans who previously had no healthcare  after the election trump said he would consider retaining parts of obamacare  including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age  on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with existing conditions  trump has vowed to make deep tax cuts  while also promising to protect popular health and retirement programs that account for more than a third of u s  government spending  that combination of policies would massively increase the national debt  according to the nonpartisan center for a responsible budget  he has also proposed increasing spending on the military and infrastructure  but has said he would reduce spending on categories other than health and retirement by  percent each year  on taxes  he would get plenty of help from republicans in congress  who have been laying the groundwork for a tax code overhaul that would lower rates and close loopholes  but they will encounter fierce resistance from homeowners  businesses and other interest groups that benefit from current tax breaks  trump s promise to protect entitlement programs such as social security and medicare will rile fiscal conservatives  who worry they will swamp the federal budget in the decades to come  but those programs are popular with the american public  trump has promised a  dismantling  of the  dodd frank financial reform law enacted following the financial crisis  but has given few details  both trump and the republican party have called for reinstating glass steagall  the  era law that forced the separation of investment banks from deposit taking institutions  republican lawmakers have so far been unable to undo many of their most despised pieces of the dodd frank law  and many in their ranks oppose a return to glass steagall  trump appears to be leaning toward weakening the law in a manner similar to what was proposed in a bill known as the choice act this summer by jeb hensarling  the republican chairman of the u s  house financial services committee       trump has offered few details about his plans to fight islamic state but has said he would  knock the hell out of  the militant group  he says he is keeping the details of his strategy a secret so as not to disclose them to the enemy  trump said that if he won  he would give u s  generals  days after taking office on jan   to propose their own plans  trump has said he opposes accepting refugees fleeing violence in syria  and instead has said he would create  safe zones  there  which he says would be funded by gulf states  obama has said a safe zone in syria would require a large u s  military commitment  something that could prove to be unpopular with americans weary of lengthy wars in iraq and afghanistan  trump has said he would have a  very  very good  relationship with russia   trump has said could work with russia to combat islamic state  he also said he would look into recognizing crimea  seized from ukraine in   as russian territory and lifting sanctions on russia imposed by western nations for what they called an illegal land grab  trump has criticized the north atlantic treaty organization  saying some u s  allies have not met their defense commitments  in july  he said if russia attacked a nato member  he would consider whether the country has paid up before providing defense  nato leaders say the sanctions against russia are key to persuading it to change that country s behavior in ukraine  where it has backed ethnic russian separatists  and that the alliance has long been focused on fighting international terrorism  with one vacancy on the supreme court and several more possible in the coming four years  trump will have a chance to put a conservative stamp on the courts for decades to come  his list of potential nominees has won praise from conservative activists and republicans in the u s  senate  who will be eager to help him in that area  trump has called global warming a hoax and said he wants to cancel the  paris agreement among almost  nations that entered into force on nov    instead  he says he will push ahead and develop cheap coal  shale and oil   trump s advisers are considering ways to bypass a theoretical four year procedure for leaving the accord  according to a source on his transition team
