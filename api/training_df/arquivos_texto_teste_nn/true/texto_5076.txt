washington  reuters    the chairman of the u s  house of representatives intelligence committee said on tuesday he had seen no evidence to support president donald trump s allegation he was wiretapped by then president barack obama during the  presidential campaign  republican representative devin nunes said if trump s assertion were true  the leaders of congress and chairmen of its two intelligence committees  known collectively as the  gang of eight   should have been briefed   i have not seen that evidence   nunes told a news conference   i think the bigger question that needs to be answered is whether or not mr  trump or any of his associates were in fact targeted by any of the intelligence agencies or law enforcement authorities   trump made the accusation in tweets on saturday  providing no evidence  an obama spokesman denied it  trump has since pressed the house and senate intelligence committees to expand probes into allegations that russia meddled in the u s  election to look into his charge   we are supposed to be kept up to speed on any pertinent counterintelligence investigation   nunes said   if trump or any other political campaign  or anybody associated with trump  was under some type of investigation  that clearly should have risen to the gang of eight level   adam schiff  the top committee democrat  also said it did not appear that the group had been appropriately briefed  schiff said it was  a scandal  that trump had levied that accusation against obama  he said the intelligence panel would address the issue and deal with it quickly  nunes said his committee planned public hearings as part of its russia probe  beginning with one on march  at which federal bureau of investigation director james comey and admiral mike rogers  director of the national security agency  were called to testify  former director of national intelligence james clapper  former central intelligence agency director john brennan and former acting attorney general sally yates were also invited   nunes said the panel would not issue subpoenas for that hearing   but if we have to  we will subpoena all information that is pertinent to this investigation if people either     don t want to appear or if the appropriate agencies do not provide the information we ask for    schiff addressed speculation that the issue was too partisan for congress to conduct a credible investigation   to be honest  we don t know yet  i can t say for certain that will be possible   he said at news briefing several hours after nunes
