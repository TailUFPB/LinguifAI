new york washington  reuters    u s  health insurers are making their case to republican lawmakers over how americans sign up for individual insurance and pushing for other changes to shape the replacement of former president barack obama s national healthcare law   the health insurers  including independence blue cross and molina healthcare inc  are also recommending ways to put more control over insurance in the hands of states as the federal oversight of obamacare is dismantled  they emphasize that it is crucial to keep government subsidies for low income people  these changes  described by executives  high level officials in the health insurance sector and lawmakers in nearly a dozen interviews with reuters  include pushing for more strict enforcement of eligibility for these plans   because republicans are just starting to work with the new trump administration and the debate is fluid  it is not clear ultimately what changes will take hold  but some of these ideas have started to surface in early republican legislation  such as a co sponsored bill from maine senator susan collins that would keep subsidies   the moves underscore that private insurers are quietly working on how to benefit under the trump administration  which is focusing on deregulation in healthcare  energy and manufacturing  and they show that insurers want to save aspects of obamacare individual plans  but cut down on the risk to their own bottom lines and any hikes in premiums that threaten the viability of this insurance market  this market for individual insurance covers about  million people and is small compared to the employer based system that covers more than  million americans and the government paid programs for over  million people   but it is one that insurers have described as having growth potential  while obamacare cut the uninsured rate to  percent  there are still millions of uninsured americans  the largest u s  insurer unitedhealth group inc told investors recently that it sees opportunities in new state based markets and is talking to policymakers   many investors believe that the republican deregulation push with trump will benefit insurers   clearly they support the private insurers and the role that they are going to play in any sort of new market   said jeff jonas  a portfolio manager at gamco investors in rye  new york  which he said owns the publicly traded insurers  president donald trump campaigned on a promise to repeal obama s national healthcare law on his first day in office  he and republicans have not presented an agreed upon replacement plan  but key issues they are expected to address include the law s requirements for individuals to have insurance  insurers  main  ask  takes into account replacement plans under discussion in congress  and largely assumes that government funds will continue to subsidize health benefits  at least for the next two to three years   daniel hilferty  ceo of independence blue cross in pennsylvania  told reuters that he advocated tightening the rules around signing up for insurance outside of the open enrollment period  and tight control of which third parties are allowed to pay premiums for patients   independence is part of a nationwide network of blue cross blue shield licensees such as anthem inc and has enrolled more than   consumers in individual plans   hilferty s requests  echoed by other people in the industry who did not want to be named  are similar to demands the industry made of obama  enrollment outside of the regular period   and third party groups that keep poorer  sicker patients in the private market by paying their premiums   has helped lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for insurers and pushed three of the nation s largest players out of the obamacare market  in addition  independence is also asking for a bigger role in signing up new customers who want to buy individual plans  insurers sell plans both on the exchanges and off the exchanges  but subsidized plans are currently mostly sold on the government run healthcare gov and on state run websites in a dozen states   it would be really helpful if we in the industry played a more significant role in the actual enrollment process   hilferty said  trump signed an executive order on friday directing the federal government to scale back regulations  taxes and penalties related to the law  but the directive did not change the priorities outlined to reuters by the insurers and industry sources  they said    insurers have built their list of top priorities assuming in part that republicans will try to overturn the existing individual mandate  which requires americans to pay a fee if they do not have insurance  a replacement plan would need to include some type of bonus to entice healthy people to get insurance   that  they say  would be a step towards a good mix of sick and healthy people that will keep the plans profitable  ideas include creating high risk pools to keep the very sick in a separate market and offering low prices to the young and healthy      without a punishment for not buying insurance that is like the individual mandate  the market can t survive  according to dr  j  mario molina  chief executive officer of molina healthcare inc  a company that provides medicaid for the poor and individual insurance plans on the exchanges    it probably needs to be a combination of both an incentive and a penalty   molina said   insurers also want to keep the cost sharing subsidies that have made healthcare costs affordable for millions of people as well as the premium subsidies that help to reduce the monthly cost for people with low incomes  those subsidies are part of a court case filed last year that is on hold    if it s free or close to free  you are more likely to sign up in the absence of the mandate   said dan mendelson  ceo of  avalere health  a research group and consultant that advises health insurers and is part of inovalon holdings  insurers also want continued premium subsidies  skewed to keep up enrollment of younger people    i think if you don t have the subsidies  then the whole thing falls apart   said  molina
