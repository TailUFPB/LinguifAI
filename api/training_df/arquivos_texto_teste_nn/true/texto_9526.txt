new york wellington  reuters    erik duhaime is a passive stock market investor  but he isn t afraid to short donald trump or go long on hillary clinton  the  year old from cambridge  massachusetts  trades on predictit  an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on  yes  or  no  predictions about whether an event will occur  that includes who will win the u s  presidential election in november   this is probably one of the ways i restrain myself from being active in the stock market   said duhaime  a phd student at massachusetts institute of technology sloan school of management  who checks the site a few times a week for fun  predictit  which was launched in   now has more than   traders registered  up from   at the end of   and has received shout outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike  users must be u s  residents and registered voters  predictit says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research  one of the main reasons the u s  commodity futures trading commission allows it to operate legally  according to a letter issued by the regulator in   it is jointly run by victoria university in wellington  new zealand  and a washington based political consulting firm aristotle international inc   unlike mainstream financial markets  bets are not big  the cftc caps each participant s position at   per market  and the average deposit when people sign up is just    the regulator hasn t been as friendly to such betting sites in the past  in   the cftc filed a civil complaint against the now defunct intrade for violating a ban on off exchange options trading  the ireland based market also allowed people to wager money on  yes  or  no  questions  but it wasn t tied to an academic institution and didn t have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded   predictions markets like predictit and a similar venue run by the university of iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters  predictit is bigger than the iowa electronic markets  which has only about   active traders with access to its political markets   polling is very expensive   said david rothschild  an economist at microsoft research who runs a predictions market aggregator called predictwise  which draws heavily from predictit   it s a slow process  it s not very flexible   knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on predictit   predictions markets translate this and other information into probability   said rajiv sethi  professor of economics at barnard college   the basic intuition is that it s a  wisdom of crowds  effect       for example  trump s chances of securing the republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed  a trump share shot from  cents in early february when he lost to rival ted cruz in the iowa primary to  cents a month later when trump dominated on super tuesday  they then lost half their value by early april as cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in wisconsin  with cruz and another rival  john kasich  now out of the race  trump had risen to  cents by monday  for graphic showing trump s ascendancy on predictit during primary season  see tmsnrt rs  for november s election  though  trump is trailing on predictit with  cents against clinton s  cents   while predictit s precision has yet to be closely examined by academics  other predictions markets such as the iowa electronic markets  have proven to be just as accurate as polls  experts who have studied them said  predictit markets go beyond topics related to u s  elections  users also put the probability of a north korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only  cents  and a british exit from the european union by  at just  cents  the idea for predictit was first thought up in the mid  by lew evans  professor of economics at the university of victoria  it took until   for the market  called  ipredict  in new zealand  to get up and running   early on  it focused primarily on new zealand politics  and research showed ipredict out performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of new zealand s last three general elections  however  new anti money laundering laws in new zealand put an end to ipredict last year after the cost of verifying users  identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through ipredict s shoe string budget    predictit attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies  in mid april  about  predictit traders gathered at a bar in new york to watch the state s primary results roll in   i think it s a good source of collective wisdom   said brian hegarty  who was at the event  hegarty  who worked for kasich s campaign  reads political news  but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience  that didn t always translate to a bet in favor of kasich  he said he put money on republican candidate marco rubio to win the minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the florida senator express confidence about rubio s chances  it turned out to be one of the few states rubio won before dropping out in mid march  duhaime  the mit student  said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out    for me  trump was one of those people   he said   i shorted trump way back in july  and it hasn t been fun watching    after trump s win in indiana in early may  duhaime was down nearly     about a third of the money he put into predictit    i still think it was a one in a hundred thing   duhaime  who doesn t identify as a democrat but is a fan of president barack obama  said of the trump phenomenon   obviously i m bummed  but i m sort of more concerned for other reasons    this version of the story corrects the spelling of lew evans
