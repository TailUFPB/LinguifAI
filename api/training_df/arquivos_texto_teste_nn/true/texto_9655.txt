washington  reuters    the top elected republican  paul ryan  said on thursday he was not ready to endorse donald trump  a sign of the challenges the party s presumptive presidential nominee faces rallying the republican establishment behind his white house bid  ryan  the speaker of the u s  house of representatives  said conservatives wanted to know if trump shares their values   i hope to support our nominee  i hope to support his candidacy fully   ryan said on cnn   at this point  i m just not there right now   trump  who has built a huge following with an anti establishment message  shot back at ryan in a statement   i am not ready to support speaker ryan s agenda  perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people   he said  the republican national committee  under pressure to unify the party or face an electoral rout in the nov   election  said  ryan and trump were expected to meet soon  it added that  only a united republican party will be able to beat hillary clinton    we respect speaker ryan s opinion and believe that since the primary ended early we will have time to unify  we anticipate the two meeting soon to begin to help unite the party   said rnc spokeswoman lindsay walters  trump s last remaining rivals in the republican race  u s  senator ted cruz and ohio governor john kasich  dropped out this week  clearing the new york billionaire s path to be picked as the presidential nominee  he will likely face clinton  the democratic front runner  in the nov   general election  many republicans have grappled this week with whether to support trump  who has deviated from the party line on trade and upset the party establishment with offensive comments about women and immigrants  trump on thursday announced a new campaign finance chairman in response to questions about his readiness for a general election race  trump  speaking to thousands at a rally in charleston  west virginia  on thursday night  sharpened his criticism of clinton  the kind of tactic that some republican strategists believe will help unify the party  he blasted clinton for saying recently she would impose clean energy policies that would put coal miners out of business  he put on a hard hat presented to him by the state s coal miners  association and made a shoveling motion   and for those miners  get ready  you re going to be working your asses off   he said  in a sign some republicans are rallying around trump  nebraska governor pete ricketts  whose family has helped bankroll the anti trump group our principles  is set to endorse trump on friday when the candidate visits omaha  former texas governor rick perry  who ran unsuccessfully for the  nomination  told cnn he now supported trump as well  ryan criticized trump in december for proposing to temporarily ban all muslims from entering the united states and knocked him in march for failing to denounce white supremacist groups during a television interview  the house speaker  who was the running mate of republican  presidential nominee mitt romney  a harsh trump critic  said he hoped the party would be unified by this summer but that the pressure was on trump to do that   he won fair and square   ryan said of trump  acknowledging his own policy differences with the new york billionaire businessman  he added   if we don t unify all wings of the party  we re not going to win this election   ryan repeatedly denied interest in running for president this year despite attempts to draft him by some in his party  he has been putting together a policy plan for house republicans to campaign on  which he says will be released before the convention in july  trump on thursday began shifting focus from the bruising primary campaign to the general election  he has largely used his own money for his primary fight but plans to follow the more typical path of raising money from outside sources for the general election to succeed democratic president barack obama  he named his campaign finance chief on thursday   steven mnuchin  a former goldman sachs partner who is chief executive of private investment firm dune capital management and with whom trump worked in a business capacity in the past  mnuchin has a long history of political donations  including to clinton  since   mnuchin has given about    to democrats  compared with about    to republicans  republicans have questioned trump s loyalty to the party because he also donated to democratic candidates in the past  u s  representative renee ellmers  a republican from north carolina who has endorsed trump  told reuters the campaign would begin raising money for the party   they are going to start understanding and realizing that in order to grow this operation  they will need to grow funds  not only for him and for the campaign to beat hillary clinton  but  for the republican party itself   ellmers said   historically  political parties have depended on their nominees to raise money in order to fund their other operations  including working to elect members of the house of representatives and senate  one key worry for republicans has been that their candidates for congress and other elective positions could suffer with the divisive figure of trump at the top of the ticket   ron bonjean  a republican strategist  said ryan gave lawmakers in his party cover to steer clear of trump in their re election campaigns   he is positioning the republican conference and giving republicans a message they can hold onto   bonjean said
