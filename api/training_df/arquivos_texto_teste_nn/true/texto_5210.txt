 reuters    in formulating a new executive order limiting travel to the united states  president donald trump has promised to make the directive harder to fight successfully in court than the one he issued in january   one way the administration will likely try to do that  legal experts say  is to shape the order more narrowly to undercut the opportunity for states and other opponents to sue by showing courts they have  standing   or the ability to argue the president s order causes them harm  but legal experts said a new order  which a white house source said was expected this week  was unlikely to fully eliminate the ability of challengers to pursue legal actions   more than two dozen lawsuits were filed in u s  courts against the initial travel ban  which temporarily barred travelers from iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  in one case  which ultimately got the order temporarily suspended  the state of washington claimed standing in part because the ban affected washington residents living and working legally in the united states as permanent residents known as green card holders   by excluding legal permanent residents from a new order  something the administration has said is likely  the president would make it harder for opponents to challenge the ban  larry klayman  founder of the conservative advocacy group freedom watch  said that with a narrower order  legal standing could be a real problem for potential challengers   if you re not a citizen  or if you re not a permanent resident  you have no constitutional rights   klayman said  trump has said travel limitations are necessary to protect the united states from attacks by islamist militants  americans were deeply divided over the measure  which had some support but was condemned by prominent u s  companies and allies  the initial order caused chaos at airports  as people   including green card holders initially  were temporarily blocked from entering the united states   some of those people  and several states  challenged the order  the  u s  circuit court of appeals  ruling in the washington case  said the ban likely violated the state s due process rights and suspended it   the  circuit also ruled that washington had legal standing to challenge the ban  over objections from the department of justice   stephen legomsky  former chief counsel for u s  citizenship and immigration services under president barack obama  said a narrower ban  weakens the arguments for standing but doesn t entirely eliminate them   legomsky noted that   in general the constitution does not apply to people outside the united states  but that is not iron clad    a u s  citizen whose spouse was barred from visiting by the order  for instance  could argue that he or she had standing to challenge it  or a state university might argue that the order negatively affected it   in its ruling  the  circuit said washington state had standing because it was harmed by trump s order  specifically noting that faculty at the state s universities from those seven countries would be prohibited from traveling for research or academic collaboration    the universities  reputations depend on the success of their professors  research   the court wrote  the one thing legal experts on all sides of the issue agree on is that the new order will be challenged in courts    no matter what they do there will be litigation   said stephen yale loehr  he said he thinks it likely challengers will be able to establish standing  leaving the courts to decide whether the ban is legal  at that point  yale loehr says  the wording of the new order will become crucial   if they limit the executive order to people who have never been to the u s  before  they might win on the merits eventually   he said
