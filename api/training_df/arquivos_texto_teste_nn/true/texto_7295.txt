washington  reuters    president elect donald trump on sunday picked reince priebus  a washington insider who heads the republican national committee  as white house chief of staff  signaling a willingness to work with congress to advance his agenda when he takes office in january  but while giving the influential post to the low key  priebus  trump handed another senior white house job to rabble rousing conservative media figure stephen bannon  his campaign chairman who helped engineer his surprise victory on tuesday over democrat hillary clinton  priebus is a friend of u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  who distanced himself from trump during the campaign but embodies the republican establishment in washington and will play a critical role in shepherding trump s agenda in congress  both priebus and ryan are from wisconsin  but bannon  former head of the right wing breitbart news website  has been fiercely critical of ryan  trump s statement announcing the appointments said bannon and priebus would be  working as equal partners to transform the federal government   with bannon serving as chief strategist and senior counselor to the president  the white house chief of staff serves as a gatekeeper and agenda setter for the president  but trump s statement mentioned bannon s job first   i am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country   trump said in a statement   steve and reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory  now i will have them both with me in the white house   before joining trump s team  bannon spearheaded breitbart s shift into a forum for the  alt right   a loose online confederation of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semitics  bannon s hiring by trump s campaign this year signaled the businessman s dedication to operating outside the norms of washington  under bannon s leadership  the breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about clinton as well as republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides   critics have accused bannon of harboring anti semitic and white nationalist sentiments  in a  court filing during divorce proceedings  bannon s former wife accused him of making anti semitic comments on at least three occasions   as head of breitbart  he repeatedly attacked the republican party establishment including ryan  alienating many veteran republicans  bannon showed his willingness to engage in brutal political tactics when he instigated the appearance before a presidential debate of three women who said they had been sexually abused by his democratic rival s husband  former president bill clinton  trump  who will succeed democratic president barack obama on jan    has been contemplating the candidates for top jobs in the white house and in various cabinet positions since tuesday s victory  priebus  appointment could anger some hardline trump supporters who were counting on trump to keep his campaign promise to  drain the swamp  of business as usual washington insiders  priebus is a longtime wisconsin political operative who was credited with marshaling party resources for trump s white house bid  the republican national committee stepped in and ran most of the party s get out the vote effort this year in the absence of such an operation by the trump campaign  while some republicans fled from trump during the campaign  priebus was unwavering in his backing for the new york real estate developer  priebus frequently traveled with trump on the campaign trail and was seen as a positive force who helped rein in the unpredictable trump in the closing weeks  trump made his high regard for priebus known on election night when he pulled him to the microphone to take a bow for his campaign efforts  trump and his advisers already have hedged on some of his major campaign promises  including on immigration  healthcare and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate clinton  trump  in an interview that aired on sunday  backed away from his promise to build a wall on the u s  mexican border  saying some areas could instead be  fencing   trump  whose pledge to force mexico to pay for a border wall was a centerpiece of his white house  said in  certain areas  he would accept fencing instead of a brick and mortar wall  according to his interview with the cbs program   minutes    but certain areas  a wall is more appropriate  i m very good at this  it s called construction  there could be some fencing   he said  in the   minutes  interview  trump said americans alarmed by his election had nothing to fear   don t be afraid  we are going to bring our country back  but certainly  don t be afraid   he said  demonstrators in major u s  cities took to the streets on sunday for a fifth straight day to protest against trump  trump said in the interview that once he takes office  he would remove immigrants with criminal records who are in the country illegally  during the campaign  trump said he would deport the estimated  million immigrants in the country illegally  most of whom are hispanic  ryan on sunday backed away from trump s promise during the campaign of a  deportation force  to round up and deport immigrants in the country illegally   we are not planning on erecting a deportation force  donald trump s not planning on that   ryan told cnn s  state of the union  program   i think we should put people s minds at ease  that is not what our focus is  that is not what we re focused on  we re focused on securing the border
