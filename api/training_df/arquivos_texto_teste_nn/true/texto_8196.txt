  this version of the sep   story corrects the condition to hypothyroidism in paragraph   by amanda becker new york  reuters    hillary clinton is suffering from pneumonia  the democratic presidential candidate s personal doctor said on sunday after she fell ill at a sept   memorial  an episode that renewed focus on her health less than two months before the election  clinton canceled a trip she was scheduled to take to  california on monday for fundraising and other campaign events  an aide said  declining to provide further details about her schedule for the week   clinton    was diagnosed on friday but her condition only came to light several hours after a video on social media appeared to show her swaying and her knees buckling before being helped into a motorcade as she left the memorial early sunday    clinton had a medical examination when she got back to her home in chappaqua  new york  according to a campaign aide  her doctor  lisa bardack  said in a statement that she has been experiencing a cough related to allergies and that an examination on friday showed it was pneumonia   she was put on antibiotics and advised to rest and modify her schedule  while at this morning s event  she became overheated and dehydrated  i have just examined her and she is now re hydrated and recovering nicely   bardack said  clinton s pneumonia diagnosis comes at a crucial time in the white house race against republican rival donald trump  who refrained from commenting on her health on sunday  the first of three presidential debates is on sept   and the election is on nov    democratic national committee head donna brazile said she was encouraged that clinton  already is feeling better  and  looked  forward to seeing her back out on the campaign trail and continuing on the path to victory   several clinton allies said the incident underscored the candidate s resilience   after being diagnosed with pneumonia  hillary clinton ran a two hour national security meeting  gave a press conference  and spent an hour and a half in the heat at a september  event   said peter daou  who worked for clinton in the past and now has a communications firm   it was an impressive feat of physical strength that undermined weeks of health conspiracies   clinton abruptly departed the high profile  televised event at ground zero and was taken to her daughter chelsea s home in manhattan  she emerged around two hours later on a warm and muggy morning  wearing sunglasses and telling reporters that she was  feeling great   the video that showed her swaying and buckling with aides holding her up came from an unverified twitter account under the name zdenek gazda  who did not respond to a request for comment      the clinton campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the authenticity of the video  political strategists said the campaign should confront the health issue head on to tamp down any concerns  particularly as republican rival donald trump and some of his high profile supporters have repeatedly argued that she lacked the  stamina  to battle adversaries abroad  bud jackson  a virginia based democratic strategist  said the statement from the doctor was a good start  he said the incident should encourage more transparency from the campaign about her health   i think they did the right thing  they had her examined and put out a statement  it means less speculation   he said  as the solemn ceremony began at the site of the world trade center that was attacked by two hijacked airliners  years ago  there was patchy sunlight  with temperatures at about  degrees fahrenheit    celsius   but the high humidity early into the ceremony caused it to feel much hotter in the crowd at times   clinton wore a high collared shirt and a dark pant suit and donned sunglasses for the morning event   clinton s pneumonia diagnosis follows a wave of conservative conspiracy theories that circulated in recent weeks suggesting that clinton s coughing was a sign of deeper problems  clinton s speech at a campaign rally earlier this month in cleveland was interrupted by a coughing spell  during the speech  she quipped   every time i think about trump i get allergic   she then resumed her speech  dr  amesh adalja  an infectious disease expert and senior associate at the upmc center for health security in pittsburgh who is not treating clinton  said coughing is a cardinal symptom of pneumonia   recovery from pneumonia  the  leading cause of death in the united states  can be variable  he said  adding it takes a week for most patients to get better  adults above the age of  are at heightened risk  past presidential candidates have released much more detailed information about their health than either trump    or clinton  for example  john mccain  the failed  republican presidential nominee  allowed reporters to see   pages of medical records after concerns were raised about a cancer scare  clinton has been in the news before for serious health issues  in december   she suffered a concussion and shortly afterward developed a blood clot  in a letter released by her doctor in july   clinton was described as being in  excellent health  and  fit to serve  in the white house  it noted that her current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies  the diagnosis and illness on sunday come after some tough days for clinton  as national polls showed her lead over trump diminishing  a reuters ipsos poll of likely voters showed an  point lead for clinton had vanished by the last week of august   on saturday  clinton came under fire from republicans and on social media for saying friday night that  half  of trump s supporters belonged in a  basket of deplorables   she later said she regretted using the word  half         trump has also been under pressure to release detailed information on his health and medical history  instead  in december  trump s doctor wrote in a short letter that was made public that his blood pressure and laboratory results  were astonishingly excellent  and that he would be  the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency
