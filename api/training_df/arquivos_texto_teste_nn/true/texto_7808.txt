charlotte  n c   reuters    republican presidential nominee donald trump s campaign rallies have turned into eruptions of barely contained emotions from his impassioned followers  who urge him to fight on despite a series of gut punches that have put his chances of winning in doubt  with the nov   election now only weeks away and polls turning against him  trump is spending precious time in campaign speeches defending himself from accusations from several women who say he made unwanted sexual advances toward them  what he would do if elected is covered  but much of his speeches are spent belittling his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  he also accuses the u s  news media of a plot to bring him down  and charges that the women who have made the accusations against him might be doing it for a taste of fame  opinion polls show a gloomy picture for trump  a week after a video surfaced of him bragging in lewd terms about groping women  the latest reuters ipsos poll on friday showed clinton up  with  percent to trump s  percent  and the crowds have gotten more protective of their hero  one woman at a rally in cincinnati  ohio  on thursday wore a homemade t shirt that said  trump can grab my   with an arrow pointing to her crotch  on friday in greensboro  north carolina  a man wearing a  gays for trump  shirt punched a protester who held up an upside down american flag  both were ejected  trump s message has gotten through to his supporters in a big way about clinton  who trump calls a criminal for her handling of classified information as secretary of state   she would be the most dishonest and corrupt ever elected to high office   he said  a crowd of young voters had a ready response when he brought up clinton at an event in columbus  ohio  on thursday   lock her up   they chanted  mimicking the lines voiced by older voters at other events  trump could only smile and shake his head    so young and so jaded already   he said  the new york businessman feeds off the energy generated by crowds that pack his rallies by the thousands  but he is easily distracted  lurching from topic to topic based on whatever happens to sprint to mind  on wednesday in lakeland  florida  trump jumped from bashing the news media as  the most dishonest people you ll ever see   to tout his performance at a debate in st  louis on sunday    which i won big league    to clinton s stroll across the stage in front of him at that event   and the papers said i invaded her space   he said   believe me  the last space i want to invade is hers   there are moments of levity  a woman who recovered from a brief fainting spell in the heat of lakeland was pointed out by trump   that woman was out cold and now she is recovered   a little ding to the head   he said  approvingly  trump can form an attack line against clinton out of pretty much anything that springs to mind  venting about chinese trade practices before a raucous crowd of perhaps   in cincinnati on thursday night  trump  suddenly imagined how china might treat clinton given her bout of pneumonia a month ago  which had caused her to nearly collapse at an event in new york   if she goes down in tiananmen square  they ll just leave her   he said   they re tough people   trump s crowds sometimes get agitated  many of his supporters are upset at the news media  whipped into a frenzy by both trump and former new york mayor rudy giuliani  who in cincinnati introduced trump by condemning  the insanity of the media  the insanity of the way they cover him   upon entering the arena  trump s traveling press corps was booed by thousands of people who chanted  tell the truth   trump boosters near the media work area repeatedly cursed and taunted reporters   when are you all going to be ashamed of yourselves   one man shouted   lower than congress   that s what your approval rating is
