washington  reuters    when jeb hensarling  the republican chair of the u s  house financial services committee  released legislation this summer to weaken the major financial law known as dodd frank  many said it was a prÃªt a porter plan that his party s nominee  donald trump  could easily adopt  now that trump is president elect  he appears to be doing just that   language about financial services posted on the trump transition website  www greatagain gov  echoes the tone of hensarling s bill  known as the choice act   it calls dodd frank  passed in the wake of the   financial crisis and recession  as  a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies  and promises to dismantle and replace it with  new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation   hensarling s legislation  which his committee approved in september  also takes a replacement approach  the texas republican had unveiled his proposal in trump s hometown of new york in june  and then met with the businessman later in the day  at the same time  hensarling was mentioned as a possible treasury secretary by trump s team  he has said he is  not pursuing a cabinet position    the choice act accurately reflects the priorities that president trump has placed on the dodd frank problem   said j w  verret  an associate professor at the george mason university antonin scalia law school and financial regulation expert  verret regularly meets with and briefs members of congress and the securities and exchange commission on financial regulation  i think it is a great blueprint for everything that he has promised   said verret  a former republican congressional staffer   the hensarling blueprint would primarily allow banks to choose between complying with dodd frank or meeting tougher capital requirements   primarily to maintain a ratio of tangible equity to leverage exposure of  percent   it would also reorganize the consumer financial protection bureau  throw out the volcker rule restricting banks from making speculative investments and eliminate the authority of the financial stability oversight council to designate non banks as  systemically important    it also differs from the dodd frank legislation in the way it treats insolvent banks  hensarling says his approach will prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to bail out failed institutions   alongside obamacare  dodd frank is considered one of democratic president barack obama s signature domestic policies  the most senior democrat on the senate banking committee  sherrod brown  has been a vocal defender of it  as has liberal firebrand senator elizabeth warren  that means a dodd frank revamp could stall in one chamber of congress  senate rules allow a single member to block a bill from proceeding to a vote  trump said last may that he would dismantle dodd frank  primarily because the law makes it hard for banks to loan money   but few have called for total demolition of it  with bank industry sources privately saying they would like to see an easing of dodd frank rules   trump campaign adviser anthony scaramucci  a wall street financier  said this week that the administration will review the law and  the worst anti business parts of it will be gutted   verret said he believes some components of the choice act will appeal to the populist anger felt by tea party members and trump supporters toward big banks  one such provision  he said  would place limits on how central banks can lend to financial institutions in times of crisis  an in effort to prevent future bailouts  this kind of reform  he added  appeals  to both populists and free market thinkers at the same time
