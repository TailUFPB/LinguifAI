reno  nev  manchester  n h   reuters    democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton accused donald trump on thursday of fuelling america s  radical fringe  with racist rhetoric  even as her republican rival sought to soften his image with an appeal to minorities  clinton needs to retain support from black and latino voters to win the nov   election  the same coalition that helped propel democrat barack obama to the white house in   trump  whose support comes mainly from whites  is unlikely to be victorious unless he can cut into that support   donald trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia   clinton said in a scathing speech in nevada   he s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over one of america s two major political parties    this is a moment of reckoning for every republican dismayed that the party of lincoln has become the party of trump   clinton said  referring to abraham lincoln  the first republican president  who issued the emancipation proclamation and championed the  amendment to the u s  constitution during the civil war that led to the abolition of slavery in    trump  who trails clinton in national opinion polls  has polled poorly with minorities and has been criticized for his proposals on immigration  which include deporting millions of undocumented foreigners  building a wall along the mexican border  and suspending muslim immigration to shore up national security  he described some mexican immigrants as  criminals and rapists  in a  speech launching his candidacy and more recently questioned the impartiality of an american born judge of mexican heritage  on thursday  the new york real estate mogul turned politician criticized clinton before her speech  saying she and her party had let black americans down with failed economic policies and were falsely labeling republicans as bigoted    when democratic policies fail  they are left with only this one tired argument  you re racist  you re racist  you re racist   trump told a crowd in manchester  new hampshire   it s a tired  disgusted argument and is so totally predictable   at a mississippi rally on wednesday  trump called clinton a  bigot who sees people of color only as votes  not as human beings   he argued on thursday that clinton s opposition to charter schools and vouchers locked minority students in failing jobs  that her tax policies would hurt black owned businesses and that she would allow immigrants to take jobs from minorities  trump said the clinton attacks were not only an assault on him  but on all his supporters   people  he said  who want strong borders and security   to hillary clinton  and to her donors and advisers  pushing her to spread smears and her lies about decent people  i have three words     shame on you   a reuters ipsos states of the nation poll for the week beginning aug   found clinton beating trump among hispanic voters by  percentage points  and by  percentage points among black voters      trump has tried recently to broaden his appeal to them  hinting at a softening of his hardline position on immigration  in comments broadcast on fox news on wednesday night  trump said he would be willing to work with immigrants who have abided by u s  laws while living in the country  backing away from his insistence during the primaries that he would try to deport all  million illegal immigrants   trump also met with black and latino republican leaders at his headquarters in new york city on thursday morning    trump s efforts were unlikely to draw out minorities in his favor but could reassure some moderate republicans worried about his views on race  said bernard fraga  a political science professor at indiana university   i don t think these efforts will do a lot to help him in minority communities   fraga said   an association of  latino organizations sent a letter on thursday calling on him to  cease  his rhetoric and meet with their leadership to discuss ways he could improve his outreach to hispanics    as we have expressed numerous times  your rhetoric of relentless attacks against our community is an issue of serious concern and has had a significant impact  fuelling an alarming trend in our nation   the letter reads   clinton released a video on thursday ahead of her nevada speech tying trump to white supremacist groups  the video shows a ku klux klan member praising trump and plays a recording of former leader klan leader david duke calling on white people to vote for trump   the video also shows newly appointed trump campaign chairman steve bannon  who ran the website breitbart com  which has been accused of stoking online racists       bannon told the magazine mother jones during the republican national convention last month that the website was  the platform for the alt right   a brand of u s  political conservatism associated with white nationalism  trump s campaign called for the clinton campaign to withdraw the video    this type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale   mark burns  an african american pastor who supports trump  said in a statement   i call on hillary clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world
