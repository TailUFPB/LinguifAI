moscow  reuters    russia told the united states on thursday to get to the bottom of a hacking scandal involving democratic party emails itself and rejected what donald trump said was a sarcastic suggestion that moscow should dig up hillary clinton s  missing  emails    trump  the republican party s presidential candidate  angered democrats on wednesday by inviting russia to unearth tens of thousands of emails from rival clinton s tenure as u s  secretary of state  he spoke out after president barack obama said it was possible russia might try to influence the nov   u s  presidential election after a leak of democratic national committee emails that experts blamed on russian hackers   suggestions of russian involvement have riled the kremlin  which has categorically denied this and accused u s  politicians of seeking to play on cold war style american fears of moscow by fabricating stories for electoral purposes  president vladimir putin has tried to avoid giving the impression of favoring any u s  candidate  while hailing the populist trump as being  very talented   russian state tv coverage has tended to tilt towards trump over clinton     on thursday  kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said accusations of a russian hand in hacking democratic party emails bordered on  total stupidity  and were motivated by anti russian sentiment  he rejected trump s apparently sarcastic suggestion for russia to dig up clinton s emails point blank   as regards these  email  batches  that is not our headache  we never poke our noses into others  affairs and we really don t like it when people try to poke their nose into ours   he said    the americans need to get to the bottom of what these emails are themselves and find out what it s all about   trump  who has repeatedly said he would strive for better u s  relations with russia if he won the presidency  also raised eyebrows by saying he would consider recognizing ukraine s crimea as part of russia  which annexed the region in   peskov said the kremlin was unmoved by that comment  and it would not change what he says has been its neutral stance on u s  presidential candidates   we know perfectly well that candidates in the heat of a pre election struggle say one thing  but that later  when under the weight of responsibility  their rhetoric becomes more balanced   in response to trump s remarks on crimea  ukraine s u n  ambassador volodymyr yelchenko said on thursday   mr  trump is not the president of the united states  at least not yet    secondly  there are the well known decisions of the united nations      i m pretty sure that any u s  government will pay full respect to those decisions   he told reporters    in march   the  member united nations general assembly adopted a resolution declaring invalid crimea s moscow backed referendum seceding from ukraine   analysts say the kremlin would welcome a trump victory in november because the wealthy new york businessman has repeatedly praised putin  spoken of wanting to get along with russia  and has said he would consider an alliance with moscow against islamic state  trump s suggestion that he might abandon nato s pledge to automatically defend all member states is also likely to have gone down well in moscow  where the western military alliance is cast as an outdated cold war relic
