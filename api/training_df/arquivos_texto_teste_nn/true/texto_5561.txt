beijing washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump has broken the ice with chinese president xi jinping in a letter that said he looked forward to working with him to develop relations  although the pair haven t spoken directly since trump took office  the letter thanked xi for his congratulatory note on trump s inauguration and wished the chinese people a prosperous lunar new year of the rooster  the white house said in a statement on wednesday   president trump stated that he looks forward to working with president xi to develop a constructive relationship that benefits both the united states and china   it said  china said on thursday it attached great importance to china u s  ties    we highly appreciate president trump s holiday greetings to president xi jinping and the chinese people   chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said at a daily press briefing   asked whether it was a snub that trump had held calls with many other world leaders as president  but not xi  lu said   this kind of remark is meaningless   he reiterated that china and the u s  had maintained  close communication  since trump took office and that cooperation was the  only correct choice    china is willing to work with the united states in adhering to the principles of non confrontation  mutual respect and mutual benefit to promote cooperation  control disputes  and on a healthy and stable foundation  promote greater development in china u s  ties   lu said   trump and xi have yet to speak directly since trump took office on jan    although they did talk soon after trump won the u s  presidential election in november  diplomatic sources in beijing say china has been nervous about xi being left humiliated in the event a call with trump goes wrong and the details are leaked to the u s  media  last week  u s  ties with staunch ally australia became strained after the washington post published details about an acrimonious phone call between trump and prime minister malcolm turnbull    that is the last thing china wants   a source familiar with china s thinking on relations with the united states told reuters   it would be incredibly embarrassing for president xi and for chinese people  who value the concept of face   a senior non u s  western diplomat said china was unlikely to be in a rush to set up such a call   these things need to happen in a very controlled environment for china  and china can t guarantee that with the unpredictable trump   the diplomat said   trump also seems too distracted with other issues at the moment to give too much attention to china   there are a number of contentious areas where china fears trump could go off script  the diplomat said  pointing in particular to the issue of self ruled taiwan  as well as trade  trump upset china in december by taking a phone call from taiwan president tsai ing wen  china considers taiwan a wayward province with no right to formal diplomatic relations with any other country  trump has also threatened to slap tariffs on chinese imports  accusing beijing of devaluing its yuan currency and stealing u s  jobs  in his senate confirmation hearing  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said china should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the disputed south china sea  the white house also vowed to defend  international territories  in the strategic waterway  china has repeatedly said it has smooth contacts with the trump team  the foreign ministry in beijing said last week the two countries were remaining  in close touch   that contact has been led by china s top diplomat  state councillor yang jiechi  who outranks the foreign minister  yang told michael flynn  trump s national security advisor  last week that china hopes it can work with the united states to manage and control disputes and sensitive problems   the source familiar with china s thinking said trump s administration was  very clear  about china s position on taiwan  trump has yet to mention taiwan since he took office  chinese state media has wondered whether trump has a china policy at all  on thursday  the widely read global times tabloid  published by the ruling communist party s official people s daily  noted that trump had not immediately confronted china as had been expected because he had realized upsetting beijing would backfire badly   he has probably realized that real tough action against china would result in a complex chain reaction  even beyond his control   the paper said in an editorial  wang yiwei  a professor of international relations at beijing s elite renmin university  said the letter suggested the new u s  administration wanted to signal the importance it attached to the u s  china relationship without risking being confronted on specific issues   trump has sent many messages that makes the world confused  like on the south china sea and  one china  policy  so if he makes a phone call president xi will ask  what do you mean     wang said   he wants to avoid this so he just sends a letter for the first step
