washington  reuters    bowing to pressure from fellow republicans  donald trump said on tuesday he would no longer talk about a mexican american judge after u s  house speaker paul ryan denounced the presidential candidate s criticism of the jurist as textbook racism  but trump refused entreaties from party leaders to disavow his charge that u s  district judge gonzalo curiel was showing bias because of his mexican heritage and should recuse himself from a lawsuit alleging fraud at trump s defunct trump university real estate training school  trump said in a statement that his previous remarks about curiel had been misconstrued   i do not feel that one s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial  but  based on the rulings that i have received in the trump university civil case  i feel justified in questioning whether i am receiving a fair trial   the presumptive republican nominee said  trump added that he did not plan to comment further on the matter  trump had been suggesting that curiel s heritage was influencing the judge s opinion about the case because of trump s campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration  trump has pledged to seal the u s  mexico border with a wall  and has said mexico is sending rapists and drug dealers to the united states  ryan  the country s top elected republican  blasted trump s comments  which have threatened to disrupt republicans  already rocky efforts to unite behind the candidate   i regret those comments that he made  claiming a person can t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment  i think that should be absolutely disavowed   ryan told reporters  the controversy over trump s attacks on the judge has set back his efforts to try to unify the republican party behind him ahead of the nov   general election when he will face off against presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton  speaking to supporters at the golf club he owns in the hilly suburbs of new york later on tuesday  trump laid out his vision for the meaning of his campaign slogan  america first   talking about its implications for trade  energy  financial regulation and tax policies  breaking with his usual practice of speaking off the cuff  trump read from a teleprompter and left without taking questions from reporters  ryan  who endorsed trump last week after initial misgivings  said he still supported his candidacy  saying trump would be preferable to clinton  behind the scenes  trump has been pressured from friends and family to back down  fearful of the damage that may be done to his prospects in the general election  a source close to the trump campaign said  new jersey governor chris christie  a potential trump vice presidential running mate  was spotted at trump tower in new york before trump s statement was issued  christie earlier in the day defended trump as  not a racist    some of his friends and family have talked to him and asked him to drop it and so far he won t do it   the source said  speaking before trump s statement was issued   everybody is mystified about why he would keep doing it   ryan s emphatic rejection of trump s comments showed anxiety among party leaders about their ability to hang on to control of the u s  congress in november if voters trounce trump and also punish candidates for other offices on the republican ticket  ryan s counterpart in the senate  mitch mcconnell  said trump should stop attacking minority groups   my advice to our nominee is to start talking about the issues that the american people care about  and to start doing it now   the senate republican leader told reporters   in addition to that  it s time to quit attacking various people that you competed with or various minority groups in the country and get on message   senator mark kirk  an illinois republican who said back in march he would support whoever turned out to be the republican nominee  said on tuesday he could not support trump because he did not have the  temperament necessary  for the white house  kirk condemned trump s comments on curiel as  dead wrong  and  un american   kirk is seeking re election in november  during the republican primary campaigns  in which trump vanquished  opponents with a stream of insults to rivals and inflammatory comments about muslims  immigrants and women  establishment republicans squirmed over the prospect of the former reality television host becoming their standard bearer  but many  seeing no alternative  have reconciled themselves to a trump run for the white house  trump s continuing practice of making explosive remarks about racial  religious and gender issues is making republicans  including those who have embraced him  uncomfortable  with greater scrutiny of trump now that he is set to formally win the republican presidential nomination at the party s july convention in cleveland  there are concerns about the party s ability to maintain control of the house of representatives and senate   trump s continuing missteps  punctuated by his outrageous and indefensible comments about judge curiel  make that goal much more difficult to achieve   said lanhee chen  a senior adviser to former presidential candidate marco rubio and a senior fellow at the conservative hoover institution
