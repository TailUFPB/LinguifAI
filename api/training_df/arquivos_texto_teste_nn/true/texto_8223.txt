white plains  n y   reuters    u s  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton slammed republican rival donald trump on thursday for talking about things he learned in classified intelligence briefings and for praising russia s vladimir putin as a better leader than president barack obama  speaking to reporters the day after a new york security forum featuring separate appearances by the two candidates  clinton also criticized the businessman for saying u s  generals had been  reduced to rubble  by obama s policies  at the televised forum on wednesday night  trump said he was  shocked  by information he got during the briefing   what i did learn is that our leadership  barack obama  did not follow what our experts     said to do   trump said  clinton  who was secretary of state during obama s first term  said trump s comments on the briefing were  totally inappropriate and undisciplined    i would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing i received   clinton said before boarding her campaign plane  as nominees for the nov   presidential election  she and trump are entitled to receive intelligence briefings  clinton said trump s praise of putin as a better leader than obama was  not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country  as well as to our commander in chief  it is scary    it suggests he will let putin do whatever putin wants to do and then make excuses for him   clinton said  trump fired back at clinton  saying her comments were an effort to make up for a poor performance during the security forum   hillary clinton is always complaining about what s wrong   he said during a campaign stop in cleveland  where he visited a charter school and proposed federal spending on  school choice  programs    i just watched her on the tarmac  she tried to make up for her horrible performance last night   trump said  the intensifying political combat came as clinton s lead in opinion polls has slipped in recent days  the current average of polls by website realclearpolitics puts her at   percent support  compared with trump s   percent  obama also hit back at trump for criticizing his foreign policy record  saying the republican nominee was unfit to follow him into the oval office and the public should press trump on his  outright wacky ideas   the televised  commander in chief  forum on wednesday  attended by military veterans  was the first time trump and clinton had squared off on the same stage since accepting their parties  white house nominations in july  although they did not appear at the same time  the forum offered a prelude to how clinton and trump will deal with questions of national security in their three upcoming presidential debates later in september and in october  clinton has said her experience in government as secretary of state and a u s  senator makes her uniquely qualified for the white house  and that trump s series of controversial comments make him temperamentally unfit for the office  some of trump s foreign policy positions  such as his proposal to fight terrorism by imposing a temporary ban on muslims entering the country  have alarmed not just democrats but many in his own party s leadership   trump  who has never held elected office  has criticized clinton s judgment for backing the  iraq war and her support for the u s  intervention in libya in   the republican candidate was widely criticized recently when he called her a  co founder   along with obama  of the islamic state militant group  clinton  who voted in favor of the  iraq war as a senator but has since said she regrets doing so  said she would convene a meeting of bipartisan security experts on friday to discuss the fight against islamic state   what you didn t hear from donald trump last night was any plan to take on isis   clinton told reporters  using an acronym for the group   that s not only dangerous  it should be disqualifying   trump and clinton supporters went on the offensive on social media wednesday night and thursday morning  defending their candidates  performances during the forum  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway spoke with trump supporters in congress on thursday morning  and trump spoke with the group by phone to thank them for their support  some supporters shrugged off his comments about putin   i think he is being very smart in how he addresses putin and you know  maybe he s playing with putin s ego   said representative marsha blackburn of tennessee  mike pence  trump s vice presidential running mate  told cnn it was  inarguable  that putin had been a stronger leader of russia than obama had been in the united states  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the top elected republican official  who has frequently broken with trump  took a sharply different view   putin is an aggressor that does not share our interests  vladimir putin is violating the sovereignty of neighboring countries   ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference      republican national committee chairman reince priebus told reporters at the cleveland rally that trump was not endorsing putin with his praise   he doesn t agree with his style of government  he wasn t saying that   he said  clinton said republicans holding or seeking office across the country should be pressed on whether they agree with trump s comments  including his views on putin and u s  generals that surfaced during the forum   republicans are just in a terrible dilemma trying to support a totally unqualified nominee  i have no sympathy for them  it s their nominee   she said
