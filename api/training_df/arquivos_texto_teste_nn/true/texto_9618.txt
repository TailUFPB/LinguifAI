gop leaders have unleashed a stunning level of vitriol against their party s most successful presidential candidate   house speaker paul ryan  r wis    emphatically declared last week that he was not ready to endorse donald trump  his party s presumptive presidential nominee  this move was unprecedented in modern american history  trump s response was that ryan may need to be replaced as head of the republican national convention   ryan s rebuke reminds americans that trump is deeply unpopular  particularly among a significant number of powerful republicans  former gop presidential nominee mitt romney belittled the gop s new leader as a moral cretin unfit to be the standard bearer  former president george w  bush and his father  president george h w  bush  both say they are not attending the gop convention in cleveland   such attacks  however  are nothing new   political elders have lambasted their party s leading presidential contenders throughout u s  history  the big difference now is that this battle is playing out in public  in the past  attacks were largely in party backrooms  behind closed doors   to be sure  some serious breaks have been acted out in public  with dire results  president theodore roosevelt  for example  realized in  that his progressive agenda was being abandoned by his chosen successor  william howard taft  tr challenged taft in the republican primaries   we stand at armageddon   roosevelt thundered at the convention   and we battle for the lord    when taft prevailed  roosevelt bolted the party  he ran as a third party candidate in  on a progressive party ticket  ultimately  the democratic nominee  woodrow wilson  won   in most other cases  however  the internecine bloodletting took place in private  preserving the appearance of party unity and making it easier to heal any rifts   the  republican nominee thomas dewey ignored former president herbert hoover at an important state funeral that october and drew the national leader s ire   dewey has no inner reservoir of knowledge on which to draw for his thinking   hoover sneered to a friend   a man couldn t wear a mustache like that without having it affect his mind    hoover  though  sought to keep his beliefs private  former presidents have kept mum even when they see a nominee as a threat to their legacy  in   for example  former president dwight d  eisenhower didn t have much regard for senator barry goldwater  the conservative firebrand had repudiated eisenhower s presidency as a  dime store new deal   nonetheless  eisenhower gave only halting support to the party s anti goldwater forces  despite eisenhower s contempt  the arizonan became the republican nominee  only to lose in a landslide to president lyndon b  johnson   four years earlier  the democratic power brokers were not as reticent  they viewed senator john f  kennedy  their party s leading candidate in   as too conservative and inexperienced  they disliked the campaign role of joseph kennedy  jfk s father  and his controversial past  in addition  party leaders worried that jfk could not win national office because he was a catholic   during the primaries  truman  the titular head of the party  told a tv news conference that a nominee should have  the greatest possible maturity and experience     a clear dig at jfk s relative youth  the former president beseeched his party to hold a brokered convention and find a way to avoid nominating kennedy  eventually  however  truman endorsed kennedy in the general election  reasoning that gop nominee richard m  nixon was worse  adlai stevenson  the democratic nominee in  and   also refused to back kennedy during the primary  even kennedy s promise to name stevenson as secretary of state could not persuade him   still  most of the party elders  scathing criticism against jfk was confined to backroom conversations  senate majority leader lyndon b  johnson  who also wanted the nomination  privately mocked kennedy as  a scrawny little fellow with rickets   johnson urged eisenhower to oppose kennedy during the primary contest  calling him  a  nobody  and  a dangerous man    but johnson s efforts to stop kennedy were not aired before the country in real time  in fact   demonstrated how the democratic elders were able to prevent serious rifts from destroying their party s chances  after securing the nomination  jfk offered   and lbj accepted   the second slot on the ticket   the resentment of party elders toward party nominees was often rooted in a sense that the candidate was repudiating a mentor s record  in the  gop presidential race  for example  eisenhower resented vice president nixon s implication that he would offer more robust leadership  close to election day  ike was asked to name an instance when nixon s advice influenced a presidential decision   if you give me a week   eisenhower replied   i might think of one    in the reverse situation  vice president al gore sought to distance himself from president bill clinton during the  presidential campaign  gore declared in his announcement that he would provide  moral leadership  and defend the american family   not so subtle knocks against clinton s sexual relationship with a white house intern  monica lewinsky  the bitterness between the two men festered and gore never asked clinton to campaign with him  after gore lost to george w  bush  clinton upbraided his former vice president for running a lame  visionless campaign   the current spectacle   in which former senator bob dole will likely be the only past republican presidential nominee to come to the convention and endorse the party s standard bearer   is partly a function of trump s scorched earth multi media campaign  his attacks have been leveled personally  in real time  via twitter and cable news  wounds are deeper  and could be harder to heal   trump s presidential primary campaign is the apotheosis of the anti washington mood that has gripped presidential politics since jimmy carter s  white house run  one reason trump vanquished his foes was because he ran against the gop s leadership as out of touch and inept   this played out even as party elders have less power to shape national tickets   and outsiders more ability to tear down anything that smacks of washington politics as usual   republican on republican hits on trump and his main rival  ted cruz  have contributed to the fraying of the gop  the anti trump former presidents  as well as current and former party chairmen and congressional leaders  have much at stake  they are fighting for  as they see it  their legacies  their party s future  their professional identities   and their own power   in recent decades  party elders have been clinging to an increasingly tenuous position  think former majority leader eric cantor  who lost a primary election  as sarah palin recently noted  or former house speaker john boehner  who was unable to control his party s tea party wing  boehner is still so incensed that he called senator ted cruz  r tex    lucifer in the flesh   as we are seeing now with ryan  trump s ferocious public attacks could yet come back to haunt him  unlike so many past presidential primaries  this rift might prove irreparable
