harrisburg  pa   reuters    democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton took her newly energized white house bid on the road on friday for a tour of crucial  rust belt  states pennsylvania and ohio  but the campaign s focus was clouded by a newly disclosed cyber attack  reuters on friday reported that the computer network used by clinton s campaign  which is based in brooklyn  had been hacked as part of a broad cyber attack on democratic political organizations  citing people familiar with the matter  the campaign said a data program maintained by the democratic national committee and used by the campaign and other entities was accessed as part of a cyber attack on the dnc  the clinton campaign said outside experts had found no evidence that its internal systems had been compromised   on thursday  reuters reported that the party s fundraising committee for candidates for the u s  house of representatives had also been breached  the second such incident after last weekend s leak of dnc emails  revelations from the dnc emails gave the democratic convention a rocky start  threatening a bid to reunify the party after a bitter primary campaign  even so  a reuters ipsos poll released on friday showed clinton leading republican rival donald trump by  percentage points  nearly  percent of likely voters favor clinton   percent favor trump  and  percent picked  other   according to the new july   online poll of   likely voters  which overlapped with the democratic national convention in philadelphia  after a speech thursday night in which she became the first woman to accept a major party s presidential nomination  clinton launched a three day bus tour of ohio and pennsylvania  which like other rust belt states have been hit by the decline in u s  manufacturing   clinton and her vice presidential running mate  u s  senator tim kaine of virginia  on friday attended a rally at philadelphia s temple university  toured a factory in hatfield and ended the day in harrisburg  they will continue onto ohio on saturday and sunday   clinton is likely to face a tough challenge in such states from trump  a new york businessman who is trying to win white working class voters with rhetoric blasting free trade and illegal immigration  clinton and kaine are using the rust belt tour to highlight manufacturing successes and discuss how they plan to boost wages for the middle class  in the process they aim to contrast their vision for the country with the one offered by trump   if you re looking for a kind of pessimistic  downbeat vision of america  we re not your folks   clinton said in hatfield   we do not buy into that dark  divisive  image that was presented at the republican convention last week   opinion polls show a potentially tight race in ohio and pennsylvania  both of which president barack obama won in the  election   the differences are stark   kaine said in harrisburg  clinton and trump are essentially tied in ohio  where the republicans held their convention last week  according to an average of polls by realclearpolitics  clinton has a lead of   percentage points in pennsylvania  the website s average of recent polls showed  ohio and to a lesser extent pennsylvania are among a handful of competitive states traditionally viewed as decisive in presidential elections  because they do not lean heavily democratic or republican  in her speech on thursday  clinton    a former first lady and u s  senator  promised to make the united states a country that works for everyone if she is elected   we are clear eyed about what our country is up against  but we are not afraid   she said  clinton portrayed trump as a threat to the country  saying   a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons     trump    sent out a flurry of comments on twitter on friday morning lambasting media coverage of the speech as  a joke   calling the address  very long and very boring  and accusing clinton of wanting to shut down  coal mines  steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing    he campaigned in another swing state  colorado  on friday and was scheduled to visit ohio next week   the u s  television audience for clinton s acceptance speech was smaller than the viewership of trump s address a week earlier  according to ratings data released on friday  an estimated   million people watched clinton across  broadcast and cable networks  nielsen data showed  trump drew   million viewers in his july  address at the republican national convention      economic issues will be crucial as the white house campaign enters its final three month stretch  the u s  economy grew by only   percent in the second quarter  far less than expected  the commerce department said on friday   during the rust belt trip  clinton will detail her pledge to raise wages and create jobs by unveiling a major infrastructure package within the first  days of her presidency  and encouraging companies to invest in workers     the start of the democratic convention was overshadowed by the resignation of dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz  who quit over leaked emails showing party officials favored clinton over her primary rival bernie sanders  a u s  senator of vermont  cyber security experts and u s  officials said on monday there was evidence that russia engineered the release of the  emails in order to influence the election  the kremlin has denied the accusations  yet another hack came to light on thursday  when four people familiar with the matter told reuters that the federal bureau of investigation is investigating a cyber attack against the democratic congressional campaign committee  which raises money for democrats running for the u s  house of representatives  the dccc confirmed on friday that it had been the target of a cyber security incident
