 reuters    low gas prices and president barack obama s high approval ratings are key factors that favor democrat hillary clinton winning the white house in next week s election  according to a model from moody s analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine u s  presidential contests  clinton is forecast to pick up  electoral college votes against  for republican donald trump  moody s analytics predicted on tuesday in the final update of its model before election day on nov    that would match obama s margin of victory over republican challenger mitt romney in   the reuters ipsos states of the nation project also predicts a clinton win  with a  percent probability of her winning at least  electoral votes  a candidate needs to win at least  electoral votes to be elected president  the moody s analytics model is based on a combination of state level economic conditions and political history  and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since republican ronald reagan unseated democrat jimmy carter in   rather than focus on the individual candidates in a race  the model instead centers on whether current economic and political conditions favor the incumbent party in the white house  this year those factors point to clinton becoming the  u s  president  the economic factors moody s measures include the two year percentage changes in real personal income per household  as well as house and gasoline prices   among the political factors weighed  moody s said the most important is the share of the vote in any one state that went to the incumbent party in the previous election  it also takes into account voter fatigue and the incumbent president s approval ratings  this year  with obama enjoying some of his highest job approval ratings since his first year in office in  and gasoline prices holding steady at well below average levels  the model suggests the democrats will win their third straight presidential election  moody s said  that would mark the first time since the  election of republican george h w  bush that one party has won three consecutive presidential contests  moody s warns  however  that its model does not take into account any individual characteristics of specific candidates   given the unusual nature of the  election cycle to date  it is very possible that voters will react to changing economic and political conditions differently than they have in past election cycles  placing some risk in the model outcome  particularly state by state projections   moody s analytics economist dan white wrote in the report
