washington  reuters    u s  environmental protection agency chief gina mccarthy on friday finalized a determination that the landmark fuel efficiency rules instituted by president barack obama should be locked in through   a bid to maintain a key part of his administration s climate legacy  major u s  and foreign automakers have appealed to president elect donald trump  who has been critical of obama s climate policies  to review the rules requiring them to nearly double fleet wide fuel efficiency by   saying they impose significant costs and are out of step with consumer preferences   as part of a  regulation  epa had to decide by april  whether to modify the   model year vehicle emission rules requiring average fleet wide efficiency of more than  miles per gallon  in november  the agency moved up the timetable for proposing that automakers can meet the  standards  mccarthy said in a statement her determination  a legally binding decision to maintain the fuel efficiency rules  rests on an extensive technical record   mccarthy said in her determination the rules are  feasible  practical and appropriate  and in  the best interests of the auto industry    she told automakers the epa could consider adopting new rules  to provide additional incentives for very clean technologies or flexibilities that could assist manufacturers with longer term planning      in   obama announced agreement with major automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to   miles per gallon  this  the administration said  would save motorists    trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles  but cost the auto industry about   billion over  years   in july  epa said because americans were buying fewer cars and more suvs and trucks  it now estimated the fleet will average   mpg to   mpg in    gloria bergquist  a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers  a trade association representing general motors co  ford motor co  toyota motor corp   volkswagen ag  vowgp de  and others  criticized the decision   our fundamental priority remains striking the right balance to continue fuel economy gains and carbon reduction without compromising consumer affordability and vital auto sector jobs   she said  automakers hope to work with regulators and california  bergquist said   to see whether we can find a prudent compromise path forward that avoids an unnecessary and counterproductive regulatory collision   environmental groups praised the decision  ken kimmell  president of the union of concerned scientists  said the standards were working    automakers have the technologies to continue their progress in a cost effective way  it will keep us on track to reduce oil use by   million barrels a day  cut global warming emissions and keep american made vehicles competitive in a rapidly changing global market   he said  legal experts have said it will be more difficult for the trump administration and congress to undo the determination than to unwind other regulatory actions issued by the obama administration during its final months in office  the  determination is not a new regulation  so the epa  under trump  would likely have to go through an extensive process before withdrawing the determination  and could face lawsuits from environmental groups if they took that step  sierra club executive director michael brune said in a statement  a new administration is no reason to shift progress to reverse
