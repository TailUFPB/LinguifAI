washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump backed the use of tax credits to help people purchase health insurance in a speech to congress on tuesday  the first time he signaled support for a key component of house republican proposals to replace obamacare  republicans  who control the white house and congress  are united in their opposition to former democratic president barack obama s signature  healthcare law  but have so far failed to agree on the details of how to replace it   we should help americans purchase their own coverage  through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts   trump said   but it must be the plan they want  not the plan forced on them by our government   democrats are ardently opposed to tampering with obamacare  which provided coverage to millions of previously uninsured people  a draft republican replacement for obamacare would include an age based monthly tax credit that americans who do not get health insurance through their employer could use to buy coverage and take from job to job   some republicans have voiced resistance to that plan   the president s comments were also a nod to health insurers   whom trump met with on monday   who say tax credits are necessary to keep people in the market   the fact that he used the word tax credits is a signal to congressional republican ranks  that he supports their proposals  said tom miller  a resident fellow in health policy at the american enterprise institute think tank   trump also said americans should be able to buy insurance across state lines  a proposal favored by health insurers because it would enable them to offer plans in states with fewer regulatory hurdles   trump said state governors should be given resources and flexibility on medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor  and ensure that  no one is left out   that appeared to be an attempt to ease concerns from the more than  governors who expanded medicaid coverage under obamacare   but trump offered few details on how he would reconcile house republican plans to unwind the expansion of medicaid with promises to maintain coverage for those who gained health insurance under obamacare   he also reaffirmed that those with pre existing conditions should have access to coverage but did not say how that would be accomplished
