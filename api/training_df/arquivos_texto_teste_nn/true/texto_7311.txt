washington new york  reuters    president elect donald trump began laying the groundwork on friday to take office on jan      gathering the most loyal advisers from his insurgent campaign and three of his children to plot his transition strategy  trump put vice president elect mike pence in charge of his white house transition team  while demoting his former transition chief  tarnished new jersey governor chris christie  to one of the six vice chair posts   daughter ivanka and sons eric and donald jr  and son in law jared kushner accounted for a fourth of the  member executive committee  which was filled with politicians and advisers who stuck with trump during his rollercoaster first run for public office   aides huddled in the real estate mogul s trump tower in new york city to begin prioritizing policy changes and considering cabinet picks and other candidates for the   positions he will need to fill shortly after he takes the reins of the white house  a member of the trump transition team told reuters there were more than  people now involved in developing  white papers  on what regulations to roll back after jan    some environmental measures and a rule requiring retirement advisers to act in their clients  interests could be among the first on the chopping block  an industry lobbying source said  trump promised during his campaign to cut taxes  clamp down on immigration and repeal president barack obama s signature affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare   but in interviews with the wall street journal and cbs   minutes  on friday  he said he was open to keeping some provisions of obamacare  james woolsey  a former cia director who has advised trump on foreign policy  said several of trump s campaign promises were  advocacy of a general direction  that may require compromise   including his signature pledge to build a wall on the border with mexico  woolsey told cnn that border security could be achieved with a combination of fence and wall   i don t think we ought to fall on our sword about the difference between a wall and fence  maybe this will be cheaper because it s mainly fence  but it s a good fence  i wouldn t have any problem with that myself   he said  trump  a billionaire real estate magnate  also moved on friday to extricate himself from his sprawling business empire  which will be overseen by his three grown children on the transition team   his company said it was vetting new business structures for the transfer of control to the three and the arrangement would not violate conflict of interest laws  but government ethics experts said the move would fall short of blind trust standards and was unlikely to prevent potential conflicts of interest  trump said that pence   who has strong ties to republican leaders in congress   will build on work done by christie and has the mission of assembling  the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in washington    christie  once viewed as a top candidate for attorney general  is dealing with political fallout from the  bridgegate  lane closure scandal  former new york mayor rudy giuliani is now the leading contender for the top law enforcement job  according to two sources familiar with the discussions    trump s campaign spent relatively little time on transition planning during the campaign  and even his republican supporters had been bracing for a loss to democratic rival hillary clinton in tuesday s election   i was on romney s transition team  and it was a well oiled machine months before the election  now there s a scramble   said one republican source  referring to the party s  presidential nominee  mitt romney  since tuesday  dozens of possible cabinet appointees have been floated  from grassroots conservative heroes like sarah palin to seasoned washington hands like david malpass  during his campaign  many establishment republicans condemned trump s racially inflammatory rhetoric as well as his attacks on trade deals and the nato alliance  which could take many traditional names out of the running  but outgoing republican senator kelly ayotte   who had distanced herself from trump at points in her unsuccessful reelection campaign in new hampshire   was being floated as a potential defense secretary on friday  the washington post reported  trump s relatively small cadre of steadfast supporters is expected to play a prominent role in his administration  campaign sources say alabama senator jeff sessions could serve as defense secretary  former house speaker newt gingrich might be named as secretary of state and retired general michael flynn could serve as national security adviser   those three  along with giuliani and retired neurosurgeon ben carson  were named as vice chairs of the transition team  republican national committee chairman reince priebus is a strong candidate for white house chief of staff  according to sources close to the campaign  trump campaign ceo steve bannon  a conservative provocateur  is also being considered for the job  as trump mulled his team  demonstrators hit the streets in major cities for the third straight night to denounce his election and the inflammatory campaign rhetoric on immigrants  muslims and women  thousands marched through miami  atlanta  philadelphia  new york and san francisco as night fell  trump appears to be leaning toward seasoned republicans for many economic positions  david malpass  a former treasury and state department official  and paul atkins  a former securities and exchange commission official  are guiding the transition team on economic issues   this is one area where the most republican orthodoxy will come out   said brandon barford  a former republican congressional staffer  the trump transition website  www greatagain gov  picked up on the tone of legislation aimed at weakening dodd frank financial regulations that was released this summer by republican chair of the house financial services committee  jeb hensarling  trump s victory is forcing president barack obama to scale back his ambitions for his final months in office  obama  who is set to meet with key allies from europe and asia next week during his final foreign trip  is giving up on a last ditch attempt to seek congressional approval for the trans pacific partnership trade deal before leaving office  japanese prime minister shinzo abe  a tpp partner  is slated to meet with trump next week in new york  and the president elect also fielded calls from german chancellor angela merkel and french president francois hollande on friday  but eu commission president jean claude juncker had a blunter reaction to the trump transition   i think we will waste two years before mr  trump tours the world he does not know   juncker said on friday
