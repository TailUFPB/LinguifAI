san francisco  reuters    five years ago  oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt  now president donald trump s nominee for administrator of the environmental protection agency  sat in the front row as the u s  supreme court debated the contentious affordable care act  he was part of a coalition of republican attorneys general fighting president barack obama s health law   better known as obamacare   based on a core party principle  that states  rights trump federal powers  and that programs like obamacare represent a radical overreach by the federal government  now  as trump looks to undo obama s legacy and begin constructing his own  pruitt and other administration republicans are showing little interest in protecting states  rights  instead  they are embracing sweeping new environmental  healthcare and immigration policies that are to be imposed on all states   at the same time democrats  who over the last half century have zealously defended sacrosanct federal laws   such as the civil rights act of  that tackled segregation   against arguments that states should be allowed to chart their own way  are now making plans to employ some of those very states  rights positions to fend off trump administration policies they disagree with   if  epa nominee pruitt  is going to argue states can go their own way  then certainly we should be allowed to make the exact same argument   hawaii attorney general douglas chin  a democrat who opposes pruitt s nomination  told reuters  pruitt s office did not return repeated requests for comment  sprawling flip flop the two parties  switching of sides is evident across a range of issues  including so called sanctuary cities  the environment and healthcare  sanctuary cities   an unofficial description of places where local law enforcement refuses to report undocumented immigrants to federal authorities   could be an early test  as trump moves to beef up federal immigration policies  trump threatened to cut federal funds for such cities on wednesday  as part of an executive order clamping down on immigration    lawyers planning to challenge that action told reuters they will base part of their legal argument on one successful approach pruitt and his fellow attorneys general took against obamacare in the supreme court in    in that case  the court held that federal authorities could not take away a state s medicaid funding for refusing to expand the program  although they won that part of the case  pruitt and his group failed to stop the national rollout of obamacare  immigration advocates hope the logic employed by the supreme court in that case will protect sanctuary cities against threatened funding cuts  however  ken cuccinelli  the former republican attorney general of virginia who launched the legal challenge to obamacare  told reuters he doubts courts will apply that ruling to protect sanctuary cities   still  cuccinelli said the new political dynamic will expose republican politicians who ran for office on a states  rights platform because it fit their policy agenda  rather than because they were true believers        we may find out  which  folks were doing it for legal reasons and purely political reasons   he said  another early battle highlighting the reversal of positions on states  versus federal rights is likely to be the environment  california  as its governor made clear in a speech on tuesday  will fight any attempts to rein in the state s sweeping environmental laws  which go far beyond federal mandates  during his confirmation hearings  pruitt  on the other hand  refused to commit to keeping a decades old federal waiver that allows california to set stricter emissions standards   the debate over how power should be shared between states and the federal government goes back to the founding of the united states  when federalists led by john adams and alexander hamilton argued for a strong central government  while thomas jefferson s democratic republican party saw states  rights as a necessary check against tyranny  jefferson s faction eventually morphed into the democratic party  which backed states  rights to allow slavery leading up to the civil war of    the democrats moved toward greater reliance on federal powers in the  century  as they fought battles over civil rights and regulating industry  since then  the two parties have been fairly consistent in their stances  though on some issues they have occasionally swapped positions      tension between states  rights and federal power played out time and again during obama s presidency  with states  rights supporters achieving a mixed record   republican led states challenged obama s clean power plan as an example of federal overreach  in a case that is continuing  republican state attorneys general  including pruitt  successfully blocked an obama executive order allowing work permits for millions of undocumented immigrants  known as expanded daca      the fifth u s  circuit court of appeals ultimately struck down the expanded daca policy  and an evenly divided u s  supreme court let that ruling stand last year      harold koh  a yale law school professor and a former adviser to trump s presidential challenger hillary clinton  said that even though he disagreed with the court s reasoning in that case  it could now be used to at least slow down new trump executive orders on immigration and beyond       the argument against daca could come back to haunt them   koh said      embracing states  rights could also end up haunting progressive groups during the next democratic administration  whenever that might be  said julia wilson  chief executive of legal aid organization onejustice       that is exactly what s under conversation right now in the community   she said
