washington  reuters    u s  supreme court justices on monday struggled over how to determine when states have unlawfully considered race in drawing legislative districts as they weighed cases in which republicans in virginia and north carolina were accused of trying to dilute the clout of black voters  based on two hours of oral arguments in the cases before the eight justices  it appeared that the voters who challenged virginia s plan may win but the north carolina case s outcome was less clear  conservative justice anthony kennedy  who sided with the court s liberals in a ruling last year involving alabama legislative districts  could again be pivotal  race can be considered in redrawing boundaries of voting districts only in certain instances  such as when states are seeking to comply with the federal voting rights act  that law protects minority voters and was enacted to address a history of racial discrimination in voting  especially in southern states  in both cases before the justices  voters accused republicans of packing black voters  who tend to back democratic candidates  into certain districts to diminish their voting power and make surrounding districts more white and more likely to support republicans  in   the supreme court ruled   to throw out a lower court s decision upholding a republican backed state legislature redistricting plan in alabama that crammed black voters into certain districts in a way critics claimed lessened their influence at the polls  the supreme court has never said redistricting cannot be based on nakedly partisan aims like maximizing one party s election chances  justice stephen breyer  who wrote the ruling in the alabama case  acknowledged the difficulties in assessing when race has been taken into account appropriately in drawing voting districts   no one  i think  has a good answer to that question  there is just slightly better  slightly worse   breyer said  fellow liberal justice sonia sotomayor said that  it s real easy  for states to say mere politics motivated their decisions  even though there s a lot of direct evidence that it really was race   conservative justices  often skeptical about considering  race in any context  expressed sympathy for the problems states face in trying to avoid lawsuits while also complying with the voting law   maybe there s no way around it  but isn t this just an invitation for litigation in every one of these instances    justice samuel alito asked  north carolina appealed a february federal court ruling  that found that republicans who redrew u s  house of representatives districts after the  census took race too much into consideration  virginia voters who challenged the way  state house of delegates boundaries were drawn by republicans after the  census appealed an october  federal district court ruling upholding the districts  rulings in both cases are due by the end of june
