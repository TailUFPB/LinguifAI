new york san francisco  reuters    the new  more narrowly tailored temporary travel ban president donald trump signed on monday will be more difficult to challenge successfully in court  legal experts said  they said that since his order no longer covers legal residents or existing visa holders  and makes waivers possible for some business  diplomatic and other travelers  challengers are likely to have a harder time finding people in the united states who can legally claim they have been harmed  and thus have so called  standing  to sue   trump s first executive order signed on jan   banned travelers from seven muslim majority nations   iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen   for  days and halted refugee admission for four months  barring syrian refugees indefinitely  its hasty implementation caused chaos and protests at airports  the order was hit with more than two dozen lawsuits  many that claimed it discriminated against muslims  the new ban  which goes into effect on march   removes iraq and adds categories of people who would be exempt from the order  the trump administration said the executive order is necessary for national security reasons  it also lists groups of people that could be eligible for waivers  including travelers who have previously been admitted to the united states for work or school  those seeking to visit or live with a close relative and who would face hardship if denied entry  infants  young children and adoptees or people in need of medical care  employees of the u s  government and international organizations among others       all the exceptions make the new order  a lot harder to attack   said andrew greenfield  an immigration attorney with fragomen law firm in washington d c   trump had promised to make the new directive harder to fight in court and many of the changes were expected   they dotted their  i s  and crossed their  t s  in trying to anticipate what litigation might result   said stephen yale loehr  a cornell law school professor who specializes in immigration  he said opponents might still be able to find plaintiffs   a u s  citizen could potentially sue if the government denies a waiver to their foreign spouse for an arbitrary reason  for example  in a legal challenge to the original order  the state of washington was successful in preventing it from being carried out  a federal judge in seattle and then an appeals court in san francisco ruled that washington could claim standing  in part because the order adversely affected legal permanent residents  known as green card holders  in the state  more than  businesses  including many of the best known tech companies  filed briefs in court that argued their employees were harmed  bob ferguson  the attorney general for washington state said on monday that he will likely decide on the next litigation steps this week after consulting with state universities and businesses about potential harms   we need to do our homework and be thoughtful about this   ferguson said  the u s  department of justice  in a filing in seattle federal court on monday  said the new order applies  only to those who are overseas and without a visa    foreign nationals outside the country who do not have a u s  visa do not have the same protections under the u s  constitution as people already here  legal experts said   rosemary jenks  the director of government relations at numbersusa  a conservative group that favors less immigration overall  said that the new order would leave the state of washington having to argue on behalf of unidentified foreign nationals who have not been screened  vetted or processed yet by u s  authorities   that would be a pretty big stretch   jenks said  and unlike the old order  the new one lays out with more detail why the specific countries were selected  she said    attorneys challenging the ban  including the american civil liberties union said there were still questions about whether or not the ban is justified by national security reasons and the revisions do not address concerns that the order discriminates based on religion   adam lauridsen  a keker   van nest attorney in san francisco representing students challenging trump s first order  noted the revised directive still targets muslim majority countries   stephen legomsky  chief counsel at u s  citizenship and immigration services in the previous obama administration      pointed to statements by trump about wanting a muslim ban   that evidence is baked in  you can t change the past   said legomsky  he said  however  that does not mean the inevitable legal challenges will ultimately be successful in the likelihood that they reach the u s  supreme court   it s not a slam dunk
