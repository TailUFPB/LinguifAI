washington  reuters    scott pruitt  donald trump s pick to head the u s  environmental protection agency  has fought president barack obama s measures to curb climate change at every turn as attorney general of oklahoma  now he is hoping to take apart obama s environmental legacy from the inside out  a task that could prove tougher than it sounds  legal experts and former epa officials said pruitt could score some early easy wins in january  killing regulations the obama administration rushed through during his final months in office  such as the agency s rule to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry  that is because a little used law called the congressional review act allows congress to erase such  midnight  rules with a simple majority vote  something that should come easily in the republican controlled congress  but regulations that have been on the books for longer  most of those obama ushered through during his two four year terms  will be more difficult to reverse  experts on both sides of the political divide said  for these regulations  which include the clean power plan that requires states to cut carbon output  along with vehicle emissions standards  pruitt will have just a handful of options  none of them easy  and nearly all of them triggering drawn out legal battles against well funded environmental groups and attorneys general from democratic party controlled states  the outcomes of these battles will have broad impacts on american industry  air and water quality  and the country s role in global climate change  which an overwhelming majority of scientists say is causing sea level rise  increased droughts  and more frequent violent storms  republican trump campaigned on a promise to slash regulation to free up drilling and coal mining  something he said was possible without compromising air and water quality  he vowed that within his first  days in office he would rescind obama s clean power plan  eliminate  unwarranted restrictions  on hydraulic fracturing oil drilling technology  cut  outdated  regulations  and pull the country out of a global pact to curb warming of the planet  trump s transition team named pruitt as his pick to lead the epa on thursday  cheering industry and enraging green groups   both sides citing the  year old lawyer s repeated lawsuits against the agency he now seems destined to lead  pruitt did not respond to requests for comment  one of the first categories of established epa regulation that pruitt may target are those that are already being challenged in court  the clean power plan and the waters of the united states act  which expands the number of waterways that are federally protected  as state prosecutor in oil  and gas producing oklahoma  pruitt joined coordinated legal efforts by states to block these rules  calling them examples of federal overreach  as head of the epa  pruitt will likely try to take the simple step of halting the epa s defense of these regulations  jody freeman  a law professor at harvard university  said such a move could create complications for the epa  however  as it may be required legally to explain and support the change in direction  and even if the epa was able to withdraw its defense for the rules  other interested parties  including state governments and businesses  could intervene to defend them   raising the specter of a lengthy court battle  new york attorney general eric schneiderman said he is  leading a coalition of states that is already aggressively fighting back against efforts to reverse the progress this country has made in combating climate change over the past eight years   california governor jerry brown s top aide nancy mcfadden said california will  stand our ground  against attempts to gut epa rules  another option pruitt could take would be to challenge the very basis upon which obama s epa created many of its climate change focused regulations  its finding that carbon dioxide endangers public health  successfully overturning the so called  endangerment finding  would remove the foundation upon which most of the administration s clean air regulations were based  experts said  but doing so would be hard given the volumes of scientific research that support it  and the requirement to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous  the effort would likely also trigger lawsuits  the dc circuit court of appeals  which hears all cases challenging federal clean air rules  has been supportive of the scientific evidence for manmade climate change   i do think that the new administration will have to expend substantial effort for a rule that rolls back or repeals the endangerment finding to withstand legal challenges   said megan berge  a lawyer for baker botts who represents power companies  david doniger  a lawyer for the natural resources defense council  said he believed  there is no chance you could get either the dc circuit  or supreme court  to find that  and other pollutants don t endanger public welfare and health    bob perciasepe  former deputy epa administrator under obama  said challenging the endangerment finding would have to be done through the administrative procedures act  which outlines a long process of gathering and considering public feedback  pruitt could also try to undo the existing regulations using the same steps obama s epa used for adopting them  legal experts and former government officials said  but that is a months long process of proposal  public engagement and public comment that would lead to heated debate and potential litigation   perhaps easiest would be to slash staff and reduce the agency s funding  making it powerless to enforce its own rules  in this case  as with the others  pruitt seems likely to be taken to court   i stand ready to use the full power of my office to compel their enforcement by the agency   said new york s schneiderman  susan dudley  a top regulatory official under president george w  bush  who also attempted to shrink epa regulation  said campaign promises to gut the government bureaucracy can be tough to fulfill     none of those initiatives has succeeded at accomplishing more than minor changes at the margin   she said
