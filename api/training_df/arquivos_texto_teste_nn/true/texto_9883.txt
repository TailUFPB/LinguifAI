washington  reuters    president barack obama s bid to save his plan to spare millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permits ran into trouble on monday at the u s  supreme court in a case testing the limits of presidential power  the court  with four conservative justices and four liberals  seemed divided along ideological lines during  minutes of arguments in the case brought by  states led by texas that sued to block obama s unilateral  executive action that bypassed congress  liberal justices voiced support for obama s action  the  conservatives sounded skeptical  a   decision would be a grim defeat for obama because it would uphold lower court rulings that threw out his action last year and doom his quest to revamp a u s  immigration policy he calls broken  more than a thousand people in favor of obama s action staged a raucous demonstration outside the white marble courthouse on a sunny spring day  with cheery mariachi music from a red and black clad band filling the air  a smaller group of obama critics staged their own rally  in order to win  obama would need the support of one of the court s conservatives  most likely chief justice john roberts or anthony kennedy  but they both at times hit the obama administration s lawyer  u s  solicitor general donald verrilli  with tough questions  kennedy expressed concern that obama had exceeded its authority by having the executive branch set immigration policy rather than carry out laws passed by congress   it s as if the president is setting the policy and the congress is executing it  that s just upside down   kennedy said  a ruling is due by the end of june  obama s plan was tailored to let roughly  million people   those who have lived illegally in the united states at least since   have no criminal record and have children who are u s  citizens or lawful permanent residents   get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits  obama said the program  called deferred action for parents of americans and lawful permanent residents  dapa   was aimed at preventing families from being torn apart  the case comes during a heated presidential campaign in which the status of the roughly  million immigrants in the united states illegally  most of them from mexico and other latin american nations  has been a central theme  immigration is also a global concern  with europe now struggling with a flood of immigrants fleeing violence in syria  iraq and elsewhere  the republican governed states that filed suit asserted that the democratic president overstepped his authority provided in the constitution while his administration said he merely provided guidance on how to enforce deportation laws  a   ruling is possible because there are only eight justices following february s death of conservative antonin scalia  one possible compromise outcome would be that the court could uphold obama s plan in part while leaving some legal questions unresolved  including whether the government can provide work permits to eligible applicants  obama would also win if the justices decide the states had no legitimate grounds to sue  texas said it had  standing  to sue because it would be hurt by the additional costs it would incur by providing driver s licenses to those given legal status  liberal justice ruth bader ginsburg noted the  basic problem  that the government lacks the resources to deport everyone in the country illegally  meaning it must set priorities   there are these people who are here to stay  no matter what   ginsburg said   liberal justice sonia sotomayor criticized texas  argument about the economic harm caused by obama s action  saying millions of immigrants  are here in the shadows  and will affect the economy  whether we want  them  to or not   verrilli said the federal government has regularly launched programs aimed at giving large groups of immigrants temporary legal status as part of its role establishing enforcement priorities due to limited resources  asked by roberts if the government has the power to allow all immigrants who are in the country illegally to stay  verrilli said   definitely not   shortly before the plan was to take effect  a federal judge in texas blocked it after the states filed suit  the new orleans based  u s  circuit court of appeals upheld that decision in november  obama s executive action arose from frustration within the white house and the immigrant community about a lack of action in politically polarized washington to address the status of people living in the united states illegally  he took the action after house of representatives republicans killed bipartisan legislation  called the biggest overhaul of u s  immigration laws in decades and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants  that was passed by the senate in   obama  stifled by republican lawmakers on many of his major legislative initiatives  has drawn republican ire with his use of executive action to get around congress on immigration policy and other matters including gun control and healthcare
