concord  n c  winterville  n c   reuters    hillary clinton s supporters nervously eyed opinion polls showing the democrat with a tenuous lead over republican rival donald trump on thursday as the white house candidates raced through vital battleground states in a late search for votes  the race for the oval office has tightened significantly in the past week  as several swing states that trump must win  shifted from favoring clinton to toss ups  according to the reuters ipsos states of the nation project  the project  a survey of about   people every week in all  states plus washington  d c   found the two candidates were now tied in florida and north carolina and that clinton s lead in michigan had narrowed so much the state was too close to call  ohio remained a dead heat  with pennsylvania now tilting to clinton  a reuters ipsos national daily tracking poll found on wednesday that clinton was leading trump by  percentage points  the same advantage she held before fbi director james comey sent a letter to congress last week saying the agency had found a new cache of emails potentially related to its probe of clinton emails  other polls have shown a far closer race  fueling democratic worries about the state of the race just five days before tuesday s election  clinton s national lead over trump eroded to  percentage points among likely voters in a new york times cbs news poll on thursday  down from  points just two weeks ago  an average of polls compiled by the realclearpolitics website also showed her lead at   percentage points on thursday  well down from the solid advantage she had until late last month   i m worried that trump may win   said nancy dubs    a retiree in pittsburgh  who said she was voting for clinton   i think it s maybe time to have a female president   for clinton supporters  it has been a quick shift from confidence to anxiety   i think all of us are a little bit nervous   said rajnandini pillai  a professor at california state university at san marcos  who plans to back clinton   it seemed pretty much in the bag a couple weeks ago   nevertheless  some polls showed clinton recovering slightly from her slide in the past week  she has maintained her comfortable edge in the reuters ipsos poll and inched back into a  point lead over trump in the latest washington post abc news tracking poll  which had shown clinton falling slightly behind trump earlier this week  president barack obama  on the third day of a multi state campaign trek for clinton  adopted a sense of urgency before a raucous crowd at florida international university   you have the chance to shape history   obama said   there are times where history is     moveable  where you can make things better or worse  this is one of those moments   the tightening white house race has rattled financial markets as investors weigh a possible trump victory  investors have generally seen clinton as the candidate who would maintain the status quo  while there is more market uncertainty over what a trump presidency might mean in terms of economic policy  free trade and geopolitics  global equity prices drifted lower on thursday as worries about the election weighed on investor sentiment  with the white house race decided on the electoral college system of tallying wins on a state by state basis  clinton and trump are focused on a handful of battleground states  trump began the day in florida before heading to north carolina for two rallies  clinton was in north carolina for two rallies  florida and north carolina are both must win states for trump as he tries to piece together the  electoral votes needed to capture the white house  clinton  who has comfortable leads in big states such as california and new york  could more easily reach  votes without winning either florida or north carolina  in florida  trump pressed his argument that the controversy over clinton s use of a private server for her email when she was u s  secretary of state from  to  was part of a pattern of corruption that made her unfit for the white house  comey concluded at the end of a year long fbi probe in july that there were no grounds to bring any charges  his brief letter advising congress last friday about the agency reviewing newly discovered emails said they might or might not be significant  but the news was seized on by trump and other republicans  republicans in congress have already vowed to lead investigations of clinton s email practices and her family charitable foundation   she is likely to be under investigation for many  many years  also likely to conclude in a criminal trial   trump said in jacksonville   at a later rally in concord  north carolina  he said that  the political leadership  at the justice department was trying to protect clinton  trump s wife  melania  tried to bolster his standing with women during her first campaign trail appearance  in a philadelphia suburb   we must win on nov   and we must come together as americans  we must treat each other with respect and kindness even when we disagree   she said in berwyn  pennsylvania  trump  a new york businessman who has never previously run for political office  has called for a ban on muslims entering the country  launched his campaign by calling illegal immigrants from mexico rapists and was captured in a  video that surfaced last month boasting of groping women and making other unwanted advances  at a campaign rally in winterville  north carolina  a community where more than a third of the population is african american  clinton asked the crowd to imagine life under a trump presidency   he has spent this campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters   she said   i just don t believe we re at our best when we stoke fear about each other
