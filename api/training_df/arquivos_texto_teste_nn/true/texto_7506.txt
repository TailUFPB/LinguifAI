 reuters    in addition to picking the next u s  president on tuesday  voters in four states will decide on ballot initiatives related to energy and the environment  the results of the initiatives could offer a gauge of americans  feelings about managing carbon dioxide emissions  regulating solar power  and handling local opposition to hydraulic fracturing  here are descriptions of the various initiatives  washington state voters will decide whether to adopt a measure to create the country s first carbon tax  initiative  would slap a   price tag on a ton of carbon for utilities and refiners in   with the price rising gradually each year until it reaches    the tax would be revenue neutral  money raised would replace old revenue from sales and business taxes  supporters say the tax would bring down emissions without burdening state residents  but the measure has brought together unlikely allies from industry groups who say it would hurt businesses  bottom lines and environmental organizations like the sierra club who say it does not create new revenue to invest in clean energy and mass transit  other groups argue it could hurt lower income communities  florida s electric utilities have sponsored a measure that could affect how the state regulates private use of solar energy  a confusingly worded amendment  would alter the state s constitution to protect the right to own or lease solar equipment  while also ensuring that electricity consumers who do not use solar energy  are not required to subsidize the costs of back up power and electric grid access to those who do   supporters say it enshrines the rights of solar users  but opponents say it is a sneaky way of letting the state block  net metering   in which a solar user can sell unused energy on the grid at market value  floridians for solar choice say the measure would  choke off  the state s nascent rooftop solar industry  colorado voters will vote on a measure that would make it harder to change the state s constitution by requiring broad support across all state districts for signatories to petitions and a higher percentage threshold  to be approved   opponents of hydraulic fracturing  an oil and gas drilling technique they say causes water pollution  claim amendment  would make it harder for local communities to block fracking projects  the amendment was written and funded by oil and gas industry groups but does not directly address the controversial practice  colorado is one of several u s  states that has seen a surge in fracking in recent years  scores of towns across the country  including several in colorado  have tried to ban it  nevada voters will decide whether to open up the state s energy market to competition by giving consumers the option to decide where they buy their power  the measure comes after state regulators last year approved a rate increase for customers with rooftop solar panels  causing solar companies to lay off workers  currently  nevada law allows investor owned utility companies to be monopolies in their service territories  supported by environmentalists as well as electric carmaker tesla  mgm resorts and other companies  the measure would let consumers choose an energy provider and sell the solar electricity they generate themselves  big companies that want to leave the grid can do so by paying hefty penalties to state regulators  if passed  the measure would direct the nevada legislature to pass legislation to create an open  competitive electricity market by mid
