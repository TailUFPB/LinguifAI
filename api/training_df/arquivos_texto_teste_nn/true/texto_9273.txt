washington  reuters    the corporate income tax is a major revenue source for the u s  government  but it has been shrinking for decades and the three main presidential candidates could not differ more dramatically on what to do about it  republican donald trump and democrats hillary clinton and bernie sanders have starkly contrasting plans  some more detailed than others  for taxing corporations  the tax paid by companies on their profits accounted for  percent of the u s  federal tax base in the   last year  it was only  percent  internal revenue service data show   the decline  experts say  has many causes  loopholes that cut corporations  taxes  a lower corporate tax rate  rising overseas profits that are lightly taxed  and a shift away from incorporation toward partnerships and other business structures that pay no corporate tax  despite the dwindling corporate tax base  trump  the republicans  presumptive nominee for the nov   election  wants to ease the burden on companies by slashing the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  in this regard  he shares the same view as most republicans  trump  a real estate developer  has described his proposals as revenue neutral  saying reduced tax rates would be paid for by eliminating some tax breaks and repatriating corporate cash held overseas  however  the tax policy center  a centrist tax research group in washington  said that under trump s plan  corporate income tax revenues would fall    trillion from  to   a cut on that scale would hugely expand the federal budget deficit  unless severe budget cuts or alternative tax hikes were also made  the center said  steven rosenthal  a tax policy center senior fellow  said trump s plan is a standard business focused approach  but  the drafting is incomplete  so we can t tell exactly what he s thinking     a trump campaign spokeswoman pointed to the proposals on the campaign website but declined to comment further  republicans generally support corporate income tax cuts because  they say that would help corporations compete globally  in addition  some question the validity of the tax  which they say is passed on to consumers and investors   taxing businesses is the democrats  version of manna from heaven  someone else supposedly is paying for the government  but all citizens are hurt through lower growth  higher prices  lower wages   said grover norquist  a republican tax activist   taxes should be transparent  it should be clear who is paying them  the corporate income tax is designed to hide the tax burden   said norquist  president of americans for tax reform  a small government group that opposes tax increases  democrats tend to view the corporate income tax as a fair levy on businesses that benefit from the security  services and infrastructure provided by government  corporations have been taxed by washington since   clinton  a former secretary of state and the front runner for the democratic nomination  has not promised a corporate tax cut  like trump  she has called for closing loopholes that corporations use to avoid taxes  but unlike trump  her plan would raise corporate tax revenues by   billion over  years  the tax policy center said  clinton spokesman jesse ferguson said the candidate s proposals  go further to prevent the erosion of the corporate tax base by ensuring corporations pay their fair share   but the clinton campaign has yet to release its full plan  sanders  a u s  senator from vermont challenging clinton for the democratic nomination  would make more drastic changes and boost the corporate tax take by   trillion in the same decade  mostly by raising taxes on overseas profits  according to the tax policy center   virtually all of the revenue raised by senator sanders  corporate tax plan would come from large  multinational corporations that have shifted their profits offshore to avoid taxes   said sanders policy adviser warren gunnels   the question of whether businesses pay their fair share of taxes strikes a chord with americans on the campaign trail  an april gallup poll found  percent of u s  adults said corporations do not pay enough tax     since the mid   income tax receipts from individuals  have held steady at   percent of federal revenues  while payroll taxes  deducted from the paychecks of wage earners  have soared to  percent last year from   percent in the   meanwhile  congress has steadily reduced the corporate tax rate  now  percent  that is down from  percent in   and  percent in   over that period  corporations have also carved out various loopholes that let them avoid paying the full rate   the corporate tax applies only to incorporated businesses  while other business structures have been gaining in popularity  in   the share of u s  business income generated by incorporated companies fell below the share made by partnerships and other kinds of companies that pay no corporate tax   whatever candidates may say on the campaign trail  no changes can occur without agreement by congress  and despite years of talk about the importance of tax reform  neither president barack obama nor lawmakers on capitol hill have been able to agree on a reform agenda that many say is needed to boost the economy and bring sanity to a tax code of byzantine complexity
