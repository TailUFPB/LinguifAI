brussels  reuters    u s  president donald trump sent top u s  officials to europe with a familiar warning from washington that allies must spend more on defense  this time with the ultimatum  or else   but europeans have tried to deflect the threats with the argument that a commitment to security is not just about spending targets  which diplomats said that u s  officials did not challenge  suggesting that the stand off will continue   things look very different if we add up our defense budgets  our development aid budgets and our humanitarian efforts all around the world   european commission president jean claude juncker told the munich security conference last week  by current standards  washington funds about  percent of nato spending  standing beside u s  vice president mike pence on monday at the commission  juncker called for another measure of what counts    we want     a broader understanding that the word  stability  in the world means defense expenditure  human aid and development aid   said juncker the eu s chief executive  adding he was against europeans being  pushed into  the targets  allies who do not meet nato targets to spend  percent of gdp on military budgets set out to show pence and defense secretary jim mattis how europeans are dealing with crises they trace back  in part  to the u s  invasion of iraq in        france has a readiness to deploy that is hard to match  spain was leading nato s new spearhead force last year  italy is in afghanistan   said one senior european nato diplomat   that isn t already reflected by spending targets    while germany says trump has a point about europe s drop in defense spending since the fall of the soviet union  berlin and the european commission also say washington should take note that the eu is the world s biggest aid donor  spending some  billion euros     billion  a year  the united states spends about  percent of its federal budget on foreign aid  or about   billion  but that also includes running diplomatic missions and giving academic grants  according to the u s  state department  the european union says most of its aid goes to the world s poorest countries  germany deserves recognition for the  to  billion euros     to   billion  it is spending to integrate over a million refugees  many of whom were displaced as a result of failed western policy  foreign minister sigmar gabriel said  at a nato summit in wales in   months after russia s annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula  allies agreed to end years of defense cuts that left europeans without vital capabilities  such as refueling airborne fighter bombers  they agreed all allies should reach the target of spending  percent of economic output on defense every year by   although the goal is not legally binding  it aims to reverse a trend that saw defense research spending in the european union fall by a third  or more than  billion euros  since   only the united states  britain  poland  estonia and greece met the target in   although the cuts have stopped and latvia  lithuania and romania are close  nato officials say  nato s  european allies and canada will spend almost  percent more  or some  billion euros  on defense this year and germany s increases account for some  percent of that  there is no european push to change the nato target and nato officials say the  percent target will remain politically useful  if not economically viable   reaching the  percent target could cost nato s european members   billion per year  according to think tank bruegel  u s  governments have been pressing europeans to increase spending on their armed forces for decades  but trump signaled a much tougher approach  suggesting on the campaign trail to make u s  support conditional on meeting nato commitments   he has since given his full support to the north atlantic treaty organization  but complained this month that europeans have  been very unfair to us   for not spending more on defense  pence maintained the pressure at nato on monday  telling allies they had until the end of this year to show  real progress  on spending  pence cited his spending message as one of the successes of his debut europe trip  diplomats said  europeans say the biggest issue is how money is spent   spurred on by britain s decision to leave the european union  germany and france are leading plans to build a so called european defense union that would allow countries to develop and share military assets together  as well as deploying troops  collectively the european union is the world s second biggest military spender  but fears in britain of an eu army  held back collaboration   governments spent in isolation and missed out on savings worth  billion euros a year  according to eu data  trump s ultimatum is also still  hypothetical   pence said    asked what if europeans did not spend more  he said   i don t know what the answer is to   or else   but i know that the patience of the american people will not endure forever           euros
