  this version of the november  story officially corrects paragraph  to read chapel hill  instead of raleigh  the white house initially misidentified obama s location in a transcript of his remarks  by julia harte asheboro  n c   reuters    when bill mcanulty  an elections board chairman in a mostly white north carolina county  agreed in july to open a sunday voting site where black church members could cast ballots after services  the reaction was swift  he was labeled a traitor by his fellow republicans   i became a villain  quite frankly   recalled mcanulty at a state board of elections meeting in september that had been called to resolve disputes over early voting plans   i got accused of being a traitor and everything else by the republican party   mcanulty said  following the blowback from republicans  mcanulty later withdrew his support for the sunday site  in an interview with reuters  he said he ultimately ruled against opening the sunday voting site in randolph county because he had  made a mistake in reading the wishes of the voters   he declined to discuss the episode further  this year s highly charged presidential contest between democrat hillary clinton and republican donald trump has stoked accusations by both parties of political meddling in the scheduling of early voting hours in north carolina  a coveted battleground state with a history of tight elections  in emails  state and county republican officials lobbied  members of at least  county election boards to keep early voting sites open for shorter hours on weekends and in evenings   times that usually see disproportionately high turnout by democratic voters  reuters obtained the emails through a public records request  the officials also urged county election boards to open fewer sites for residents to cast ballots during early voting that began on oct   and ends on saturday  civil rights advocates and democrats launched their own campaigns for expanded early voting hours   the tug of war yielded mixed results  the state did ultimately add nearly   more hours and  more sites to vote early than in   but several counties  opened only one polling site during the first week of early voting  slightly denting turnout across the state  voter turnout dropped by  percent in the counties that had multiple polling sites during the first week of early voting in  but just one site during the first week in    we currently have more early voting locations and hours open than ever were open under democrat control   said north carolina republican party executive director dallas woodhouse  denying his party was trying to suppress the democratic vote  president barack obama praised the expanded early voting opportunities during an election stop in north carolina on wednesday   those who wanted to suppress the vote  they re going to fail   he said at the university of north carolina chapel hill in chapel hill   right now  there are more one stop early vote sites in north carolina than ever before    counties that obama  a democrat  won in  increased their sunday hours this year by  percent  while counties that voted for his republican rival  mitt romney  decreased them by nearly a quarter  the records show  state republican officials say keeping polls open during evenings and weekends  or  off hour  times  drains county resources  in two emails  on aug   and aug    woodhouse urged republicans serving on county election boards to follow the  party line  on curtailing the early voting period    many of our folks are angry and opposed to sunday voting   he wrote   six days of voting in one week is enough  period   keeping polling sites open for the full  day early voting period  may be wasteful and unnecessary   he added   woodhouse s emails were subsequently published by local media  but he was not alone in lobbying to limit voting hours  the reuters review of public records shows  the review counted similar emails from at least four other republican party officials to election boards  each of which is composed of two republicans and one democrat  the same day that woodhouse sent his aug   email  elaine hewitt  a member of the rowan county republican executive committee  sent the county elections board two proposed schedules for early voting  both of which included just one site for the first four days and no sites on sundays    with all of the opportunities to vote by mail  early in person monday   saturday  and on election day  there is no justification for requiring election workers to work on sundays   she wrote   garry terry  the chairman of the republican party for north carolina s first congressional district  sent an email on aug   to elections board members in his region  reminding them to act  in the best interest of the republican party  by opposing sunday voting and restricting early voting to one location  hewitt and terry did not respond to requests for comment  woodhouse defended the actions of the republican officials  telling reuters that republican opposition to sunday voting was not discriminatory but was rather based on the belief that people should not be required to work on sundays  the sunday polling site that mcanulty first supported and then opposed would have been located at the randolph county board of elections office and would have cost around    to operate  according to the office director   if it s not wasteful and it allows more people to vote    the board has historically been for that   margaret megerian  the democratic member of board  told reuters  in contrast with the republicans  email campaign  the democratic push to expand early voting hours has largely taken shape in public forums  in democratic leaning guilford county  the state s third largest  a county board of elections meeting on aug   attracted about  people after word spread that the board was planning to halve the number of early voting sites  from  in   the rev  nelson johnson said in an interview that the proposal by the board s republican chairwoman would  prevent voting especially by people who can t easily take time off  and said it  absolutely  had a racial intent  johnson  who is african american  leads a community center in greensboro  north carolina  board chairwoman kathryn lindley told reuters she believed  a lesser number of sites would cause less confusion about which places were going to be open   and that it was  ludicrous  to think her suggested plan had been discriminatory  the board ultimately agreed to  early voting sites and one day of sunday voting before the november election  johnson said the decision was  a significant triumph   lindley said johnson s group had no influence on the final outcome  guilford s plan also included one restriction that particularly angered democrats  in the first week of early voting in   residents could vote at  sites  this year  that has been reduced to one   mary cranford    a registered republican  was fourth in line on the first day of early voting in guilford  she was able to vote but said she was upset that only one site was open for the first week  she said she voted for clinton this year    i can t believe what s been done to keep some people from voting in this state   she said  just   people voted in the first week of early voting in guilford this year  compared to   in   according to state elections board records  the general counsel for clinton s campaign and other plaintiffs filed a court motion on oct   demanding guilford and four other north carolina counties expand their early voting opportunities  the court denied it  saying that changing the early voting plans  would create logistical difficulties
