washington  reuters    president donald trump said on thursday he wants to ensure the u s  nuclear arsenal is at the  top of the pack   saying the united states has fallen behind in its weapons capacity  in a reuters interview  trump also said china could solve the national security challenge posed by north korea  very easily if they want to   ratcheting up pressure on beijing to exert more influence to rein in pyongyang s increasingly bellicose actions  trump also expressed support for the european union as a governing body  saying  i m totally in favor of it   and for the first time as president expressed a preference for a two state solution to the israeli palestinian conflict  but said he would be satisfied with whatever makes the two sides happy  trump also predicted his efforts to pressure nato allies to pay more for their own defense and ease the burden on the u s  budget would reap dividends   they owe a lot of money   he said  in his first comments about the u s  nuclear arsenal since taking office on jan    trump was asked about a december tweet in which he said the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capacity  until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes   trump said in the interview he would like to see a world with no nuclear weapons but expressed concern that the united states has  fallen behind on nuclear weapon capacity    i am the first one that would like to see     nobody have nukes  but we re never going to fall behind any country even if it s a friendly country  we re never going to fall behind on nuclear power    it would be wonderful  a dream would be that no country would have nukes  but if countries are going to have nukes  we re going to be at the top of the pack   trump said  russia has   warheads and the united states     according to the ploughshares fund  an anti nuclear group   russia and the united states have far more weapons than is necessary to deter nuclear attack by the other or by another nuclear armed country   said daryl kimball  executive director of the independent arms control association non profit group   the new strategic arms limitation treaty  known as new start  between the united states and russia requires that by february     both countries must limit their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons to equal levels for  years  the treaty permits both countries to have no more than  deployed and non deployed land based intercontinental and submarine launched ballistic missile launchers and heavy bombers equipped to carry nuclear weapons  and contains equal limits on other nuclear weapons  analysts have questioned whether trump wants to abrogate new start or would begin deploying other warheads  in the interview  trump called new start  a one sided deal    just another bad deal that the country made  whether it s start  whether it s the iran deal     we re going to start making good deals   he said  the united states is in the midst of a   trillion   year modernization of its aging ballistic missile submarines  bombers and land based missiles  trump also complained that the russian deployment of a ground based cruise missile is in violation of a  treaty that bans land based american and russian intermediate range missiles   to me it s a big deal   said trump  who has held out the possibility of warmer u s  relations with russia  asked if he would raise the issue with putin  trump said he would do so  if and when we meet   he said he had no meetings scheduled as of yet with putin  speaking from behind his desk in the oval office  trump  expressed concern about north korea s ballistic missile tests and said accelerating a missile defense system for u s  allies japan and south korea was among many options available   there s talks of a lot more than that   trump said  when asked about the missile defense system   we ll see what happens  but it s a very dangerous situation  and china can end it very quickly in my opinion   china has made clear that it opposes north korea s nuclear and missile programs and has repeatedly called for denuclearization of the korean peninsula and a return to negotiations between pyongyang and world powers  but efforts to change pyongyang s behavior through sanctions have historically failed  largely because of china s fear that severe measures could trigger a collapse of the north korean state and send refugees streaming across their border  trump s meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe earlier this month in florida was interrupted by a ballistic missile launch by north korea  trump did not completely rule out possibly meeting north korean leader kim jong un at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late   it s very late  we re very angry at what he s done  and frankly this should have been taken care of during the obama administration   he said  according to japanese news reports  the japanese government plans to start debate over the deployment of a u s  missile defense system known as the terminal high altitude area defense  or thaad  and the land based aegis ashore missile defense system to improve its capability to counter north korean ballistic     missiles  the strength of trump s remarks in favor of the eu took some brussels officials by surprise after his support for britain s vote last summer to exit from the eu   i m totally in favor of it   trump said of the eu   i think it s wonderful  if they re happy  i m in favor of it   statements by him and others in his administration have suggested to europeans that he sees little value in the union as such  which trump last month called a  vehicle for germany
