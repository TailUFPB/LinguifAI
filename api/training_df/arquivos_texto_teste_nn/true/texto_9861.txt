washington  reuters    apple inc  aapl o  has been asked by chinese authorities within the last two years to hand over its source code but refused  the company s top lawyer told lawmakers on tuesday in response to u s  law enforcement criticism of its stance on technology security  the congressional testimony highlighted an issue at the heart of a heated disagreement between apple and the fbi over unlocking encrypted data from an iphone linked to last december s san bernardino  california shootings   how much private technology companies should cooperate with governments  law enforcement officials have attempted to portray apple as possibly complicit in handing over information to china s government for business reasons while refusing to cooperate with u s  requests for access to private data in criminal cases   i want to be very clear on this   apple general counsel bruce sewell told tuesday s hearing under oath   we have not provided source code to the chinese government   chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying  asked about the comments  said she did  not understand  details of the situation  she did not elaborate  china s public security ministry did not respond to a request for comment  apple has previously denied the accusation as a  smear  originating from the u s  department of justice s effort to force apple to help unlock the iphone  used by one of the two  san bernardino killers  who were inspired by islamist militants  the claim resurfaced in the hearing called by a house energy and commerce subcommittee to examine potential common ground between law enforcement and the technology sector in the  encryption debate  though more than three hours of testimony yielded little clear agreement  captain charles cohen  commander in the indiana state police  repeated the suggestion that apple has quietly cooperated with beijing  which strictly regulates technology in exchange for access to its market   but when pressed by representative anna eshoo  a california democrat  for the source of that claim  cohen only cited news reports   that takes my breath away   a visibly frustrated eshoo said   that is a huge allegation   the justice department had argued in the san bernardino case that it would be willing to demand apple turn over source code that underlies its products  though at the time it only sought the company s cooperation in writing new software that would disable the passcode protections on the phone  technology and security experts have said that if the u s  government was able to obtain apple s source code with a conventional court order  other governments would demand equal rights to do the same thing  after winning a court order in february  the federal bureau of investigation dropped its case against apple last month when it said it had found a third party entity to help investigators hack into the iphone used by gunman rizwan farook  on tuesday  apple and the fbi were making a second appearance in congress since march to testify over law enforcement access to encrypted devices  a decades old dispute between silicon valley and washington that gained renewed life from the san bernardino case  while that standoff underscored national security concerns posed by advances in technology security  the growing use of strong default encryption on mobile devices and communications by criminal suspects is handicapping investigators  ability to pursue routine cases  law enforcement officials told the hearing  apple and other companies defend the technology as integral to protecting consumers  the fbi relies heavily on the  services and specialized skills that we can only get through the private industry  and that partnership is critical to our success   testified fbi technology official amy hess  separately  the tech advocacy group electronic frontier foundation sued the justice department in san francisco federal court on tuesday  seeking to force the disclosure of any secret orders from the foreign intelligence surveillance court that may have forced companies such as apple or google to decrypt communications    thomas galati  chief of intelligence at the new york police department  said his investigators had been unable to open   apple devices from october  to march   those phones were implicated in  violent crimes  felonies  including  homicides  two rapes  and the shooting of an officer  galati said  the government has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force apple s cooperation in cracking encrypted iphones by announcing plans to continue with an appeal in a new york drug case  the secrecy surrounding the method used on the san bernardino phone has prompted criticism from security researchers who said apple and others should be made aware of the flaw  in accordance with a white house vulnerabilities review process that favors disclosure  but obama administration sources have told reuters the group that helped unlock the device has sole ownership of the method  making it highly unlikely the technique would be disclosed by the government to apple or anyone else   i don t think relying on a third party is a good model    representative diana degette of colorado  the committee s top democrat  said at the hearing
