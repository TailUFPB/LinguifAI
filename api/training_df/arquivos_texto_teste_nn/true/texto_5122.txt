washington  reuters    the former top u s  intelligence official rejected president donald trump s accusation that his predecessor  barack obama  wiretapped him even as the white house on sunday urged congress to investigate trump s allegation  the new york times reported on sunday that fbi director james comey asked the justice department this weekend to reject trump s wiretapping claim because it was false and must be corrected  but the department had not done so  the report cited senior u s  officials  the white house asked congress  controlled by trump s fellow republicans  to examine whether the obama administration abused its investigative authority during the  u s  presidential campaign  as part of an ongoing congressional probe into russia s influence on the election  trump on saturday alleged  without offering supporting evidence  that obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at trump s campaign headquarters in trump tower in new york   there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president elect at the time  or as a candidate or against his campaign   former director of national intelligence james clapper  who left his post at the end of obama s term in office in january  said on nbc s  meet the press   under u s  law  a federal court would have to have found probable cause that the target of the surveillance is an  agent of a foreign power  in order to approve a warrant authorizing electronic surveillance of trump tower  asked whether there was such a court order  clapper said   i can deny it   democrats accused trump of trying to distract from the rising controversy about possible ties to russia  his administration has come under pressure from fbi and congressional investigations into contacts between members of his campaign team and russian officials  attorney general jeff sessions bowed out last week of any probe into alleged russian meddling in the  election after it emerged he met last year with russia s ambassador while serving as a trump campaign advisor  sessions maintained he did nothing wrong by failing to disclose the meetings  white house spokesman sean spicer said trump and administration officials would have no further comment on the issue until congress has completed its probe  potentially heading off attempts to get trump to explain his accusations   reports concerning potentially politically motivated investigations immediately ahead of the  election are very troubling   spicer said in a statement  u s  representative devin nunes  republican head of the house of representatives intelligence committee examining possible links between russia and trump s campaign  said in a statement that any possible surveillance on campaign officials would be part of the probe  trump made the wiretapping accusation in a series of early morning tweets on saturday amid expanding scrutiny of his campaign s ties to russia  an obama spokesman denied the charge  saying it was  a cardinal rule  that no white house official interfered with independent justice department investigations  the white house offered no evidence on sunday to back up trump s accusation and did not say it was true  spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders  appearing on abc s  this week   said trump has  made very clear what he believes  and he s asking that we get down to the bottom of this  let s get the truth here   trump  who is spending the weekend at his florida resort  said in his tweets on saturday that the alleged wiretapping took place in his trump tower office and apartment building in new york  but there was  nothing found   senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york said trump had either made a false accusation  or a judge had found probable cause to authorize a wiretap   either way  the president s in trouble   schumer said on nbc s  meet the press   adding that if trump was spreading misinformation   it shows this president doesn t know how to conduct himself   clapper said  there was no evidence  of collusion between the trump campaign and russia in a january intelligence report concluding russian interference in the  election  but  this could have unfolded or become available in the time since i left government   trump s allegations echo charges made in recent days by several conservative news and commentary outlets  all without offering any evidence  trump should immediately turn over any evidence he has to support his allegation  said u s  senator susan collins  a maine republican who serves on the senate intelligence committee   what we need to deal with is evidence  not just statements   she said on cbs s  face the nation   adding she also had not seen evidence of collaboration  but we are in the very early stages of our investigation   trump fired his first national security adviser  michael flynn  in february after revelations that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador before trump took office  josh earnest  the white house press secretary under obama  said the president did not have the authority to unilaterally order a wiretap of a u s  citizen   the president was not giving marching orders to the fbi about how to conduct its investigation   earnest said on abc s  this week
