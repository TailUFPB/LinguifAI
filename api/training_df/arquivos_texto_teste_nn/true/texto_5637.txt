lyon  france  reuters    donald trump s first two weeks in office have left some european politicians leaders aghast but are drawing cheers from france s far right national front  fn  as its leader marine le pen launches her own bid for power  buoyed by trump s election and britain s shock  brexit  vote to quit the european union  the anti immigration  anti eu fn hopes le pen can ride the same populist wave to victory in this spring s presidential election  since taking office on jan    trump has moved quickly to implement his  america first  vision by pulling out of a pacific trade deal  barring travelers from seven muslim majority countries and confirming his intention to build a wall along the border with mexico  among a flurry of other executive orders  though the travel ban has since been blocked by a judge  his actions have provoked condemnation from some european governments and prompted one eu leader  european council president donald tusk  to say he poses a  threat  to the bloc  alongside russia  china and islamist militants  but they win approving responses from members of the fn  which favors curbing migration  rejecting international trade treaties and introducing  intelligent protectionism  to support  french firms   what surprises me is not what donald trump does  but that people are surprised that a candidate elected on a program actually implements it   said victor birra  a  year old business school student   here  politicians have been elected for  years on manifestos they never implement   said birra  who heads the fn youth section in the city of lyon  where le pen launched her campaign at the weekend   i think it s a good thing that he puts americans first   claire richert  a  year old retired teacher who joined the fn three years ago  agreed   he s taking measures to protect his country against terrorism and that s a good thing   she said  she said a similar ban could help protect france  where islamic state militants have killed more than  people in a series of attacks over the past two years  the fn is not the only group in europe to be embracing trump  austria s far right freedom party and the former leader of the uk independence party  nigel farage  are among his fans  le pen herself was spotted on a visit to the trump tower in new york last month  top fn officials share the rank and file s positive view of the new u s  president   he s been implementing some measures we ve had in our program for a long time  so we won t say we re surprised or opposed to it   said jean messiha  who has been overseeing the drafting of le pen s presidential manifesto   he s doing it the american way and there are some things we wouldn t do here   he said  but he added   each should do as they wish in their own country according to their country s best interest   opinion polls suggest  year old le pen is likely to follow in the footsteps of her father jean marie  who made it through to the run off of the  presidential election but was defeated by jacques chirac  current surveys show she is likely to lose in the second round to independent centrist emmanuel macron  who has surged at the expense of scandal hit conservative candidate francois fillon  but after trump s shock win over hillary clinton in november  le pen supporters believe anything can happen   we were told that it was absolutely impossible for trump to win the election  he was elected   said william penel  a  year old bank employee from marseille   we were told the british would never leave the european union     but the brexit was voted for   why couldn t we do the same
