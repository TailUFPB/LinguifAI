washington  reuters    a leading republican lawmaker warned on tuesday that congress will not be able to lower the u s  corporate tax rate to the  to  percent range sought by president donald trump unless a controversial  border adjustment  proposal remains part of tax reform  the proposal  known as border adjustability  represents a dramatic departure from current u s  policy  it would exempt export revenues from taxation but impose a  percent tax on imports   escalating the war of words over a measure opposed by retailers  oil refiners and automakers  house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady said there would be  severe consequences  for tax reform  u s  competition and trump s job creation goals if special interests succeed in blocking border adjustability   tax rates on businesses would have to increase significantly from the proposed  percent and  percent rates  undercutting our ability to make america competitive again   the texas republican told the u s  chamber of commerce  brady was speaking a day after trump said his administration is trying to get the current  percent corporate tax rate down to between the  percent rate he has proposed and the  percent rate contained in the tax reform blueprint unveiled last june by brady and house speaker paul ryan  analysts say trump could have trouble getting the rate much below  percent without border adjustability  the provision would also go far to pay for lower tax rates by raising more than   trillion in revenues over a decade  according to independent analysts  house republicans have billed the provision as a way to attract foreign investment and keep u s  companies and jobs from moving overseas   this is something that we think is clearly going to get our system re set so that american jobs and american businesses and american companies stay in this country   ryan told reporters  but it has powerful adversaries including billionaire industrialists charles and david koch  who spend heavily to support republican candidates and conservative policies  trump himself poured cold water on the proposal in a recent wall street journal interview  calling it  too complicated  and worrying that it would result in  a bad deal  for america   critics claim the measure would raise consumer prices for goods from apparel and electronics to gasoline  while potentially violating international trade rules   house republicans say the measure would neutralize higher import costs by strengthening the dollar and insist that it would pass muster with trade authorities
