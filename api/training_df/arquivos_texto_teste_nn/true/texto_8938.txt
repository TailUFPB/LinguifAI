monessen  pennsylvania washington  reuters    republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday vowed to force canada and mexico to renegotiate the nafta trade agreement with the united states if elected  as part of an effort to protect and restore american jobs  trump criticized the north american free trade agreement as a u s  job killer  saying he would be willing to scrap the pact if canada and mexico were unwilling to budge  he also tried to link democratic rival hillary clinton to the deal on the eve of a meeting in ottawa of the  three amigos   the leaders of the three nafta signatories  the united states  mexico and canada   in his most detailed speech on trade  the presumptive republican nominee said he would pull the united states out of negotiations for a deal among  pacific rim nations and promised to use executive power to resolve trade disputes with china  trump also pledged to revive the u s  steel and aluminum industry  speaking at an aluminum scrap company in monessen  pennsylvania  nearly  miles   km  south of pittsburgh  the one time american steelmaking capital  trump has identified pennsylvania as a state he believes he can wrest from the democrats in the nov   election  he also campaigned on tuesday in ohio  which like pennsylvania is a rust belt state   democratic president barack obama won both states in  and   but manufacturing job losses have led to voter anxiety in the region   i m going tell our nafta partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers  and i don t mean just a little bit better  i mean a lot better   trump said in pennsylvania  if canada and mexico do not agree to renegotiate the pact  trump said he would notify them under the agreement s terms  that america intends to withdraw from the deal   he tried to tie his democratic rival to the pact  approved in  during the administration of her husband  president bill clinton  as he called nafta one of the  worst legacies  of the clinton years  on msnbc after trump s speech  clinton spokeswoman kristina schake called the wealthy new york businessman the  king of outsourcing   in an apparent reference to trump branded products such as suits and ties made overseas    it was full of hypocrisy and misstatements and outright lies   schake said  trade has been a vulnerability for clinton  who struggled for white  blue collar votes in her democratic primary race against u s  senator bernie sanders  who criticized her for supporting trade deals and said she was too close to wall street    trans pacific partnership trump echoed sanders  criticism on tuesday  saying clinton supported the  nation trans pacific partnership  or tpp  while she was secretary of state and only opposed it once she was running for president  clinton s campaign said she opposed the agreement because it was not strong enough on currency manipulation and other areas         clinton has said she will evaluate each trade deal on its merits but does not believe the tpp is good for u s  workers         sanders now says he will vote for clinton in november  although he has not formally withdrawn from the race  trump said he saw no way to fix the tpp  calling it a  death blow  for american manufacturing  although china is not part of the agreement  trump said beijing might try to enter it  through the back door  later on  later  during a rally in st  clairsville  ohio  trump said the deal was  just a continuing rape of our country   just hours before trump spoke  clinton allies sought to pre empt the planned trade speech by saying trump s policies amounted to empty promises  earlier  afl cio president richard trumka told a trade conference in washington that  trump embodies everything that is wrong with our current trade policy  he has consistently sent american jobs overseas to line his own pockets   the afl cio  which collectively represents more than  million workers  making it the largest u s  labor federation  endorsed clinton this month  both clinton and trump have acknowledged that britain s vote to leave the european union signaled a global economic frustration among working class voters that could reverberate in the u s  election   there is a lot of legitimate anxiety  fear and even anger in many parts of our country because people feel like the economy has failed them   clinton said in denver on tuesday   i think this is going to be one of the defining issues in this election   trump has seized on the historic brexit vote to bolster his argument that voters are rising up against establishment leaders  saying americans would reject the  global elite  and support his presidential candidacy  but trump has broken with republican party orthodoxy in criticizing trade deals  and has threatened to slap tariffs on mexican and chinese imports  his rhetoric has drawn criticism from many economists  who say such practices could spark trade wars  as trump spoke  the u s  chamber of commerce  which is usually in sync with prominent republicans on trade policy  said on twitter   under trump s trade plans  we would see higher prices  fewer jobs  and a weaker economy
