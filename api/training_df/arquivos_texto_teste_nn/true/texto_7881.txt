new york  reuters    wall street stock index futures were little changed throughout sunday s highly contentious presidential debate  indicating that markets continue to view that democrat hillary clinton holds an edge in the nov   election against her republican rival  donald trump  the  minute debate got off to a chilly start when clinton and trump greeted each other without the traditional handshake   it quickly turned into an acrimonious discussion of a  video that emerged on friday in which trump was heard using vulgar language and talking about groping women without consent   investors said there was not enough in terms of policy substance in sunday s debate to change the market s perception of the direction of the race   i don t think it changed people s opinions in the investing community that clinton is more likely to win  as she was before the debate  certainly after friday   said rick meckler  president of investment firm libertyview capital management in jersey city  new jersey  in a video released on friday  trump is heard talking on an open microphone in  about groping women and trying to seduce a married woman  the video was taped only months after trump married his third wife  melania    there is still time to go and more things that could happen  but financial advisors are probably starting to feel they need to think about a clinton win in terms of an investment thesis for    meckler said  he said such a thesis would likely include government intervention in healthcare  particularly medicine prices  and little support for coal as an energy source  s p e mini futures remained in a tight range throughout the debate  slightly higher than at the close on friday   the market declared tonight s debate a draw and has no more clue after debate than before  at least not in watching the s p futures  once again the debate was great theater  but did not give the market any insight   said jj kinahan  chief market strategist at td ameritrade   despite the night s civil ending  it was hard to glean much information  as a good part of the debate was simply a name calling fest   strategists in a recent reuters equity poll mostly viewed an election victory on nov   by clinton as more positive for the stock market through the end of the year  largely because her positions  unlike her opponent s  are well known            steven englander  global head of  currency strategy at citifx in new york  said   both trump and clinton supporters expected that emerging market currencies and u s  equities would go down and the vix  vix would go up if trump were to win and vice versa if clinton wins   he added  trump has been critical of a u s  trade deal with mexico and canada as well as other trade deals  and has promised to build a border wall and make mexico pay for it  the mexican peso rose as much as  percent on sunday and was last trading up   percent versus the greenback  s p  e minis   which were up  points shortly after opening three hours before the debate began  were up   points  or   percent   it s a positive reaction  in stocks   and it s very consistent with what the market has been discounting  which is that clinton will win and that s good news   said hugh johnson  chief investment officer of hugh johnson advisors llc in albany  new york  before the debate   it s also saying the house of representatives will stay in the hands of the republicans   he added  u s  stocks briefly gained ground following a perceived win by clinton in the first presidential debate last month
