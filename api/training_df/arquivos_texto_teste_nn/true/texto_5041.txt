washington  reuters    the disclosure this week of documents describing secret cia hacking tools shows that intensified u s  government efforts to prevent leaks by intelligence agency employees and contractors have largely failed  cyber security professionals and intelligence officials say  if the central intelligence agency disclosures are confirmed to be the work of an intelligence agency contractor  as government investigators currently suspect  it would be at least the third public case in recent years in which special software and human resources programs intended to catch so called insider threats have not  worked  the anti secrecy group wikileaks  which published the cia documents tuesday  said it obtained the archive after it circulated among former u s  government contractors in  an unauthorized manner    part of the problem in combating leaks is that the number of government employees and contractors with access to highly sensitive information has exploded in recent years  due in part to greater information sharing across the government that was mandated in the wake of the sept      attacks   budget constraints that force agencies to rely on contractors rather than permanent staff have also contributed to the problem  intelligence officials say  government estimates of how many people have been granted top secret clearances range from the high hundreds of thousands to more than a million across thousands of public agencies and private companies  government agencies estimate that there is one insider threat for every   to   employees  an intelligence agency contractor said  speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting his employer  the contractor said there is too much sharing of information internally  with many workers having access to material they do not need  recognizing the dangers  former president barack obama signed an executive order creating the national insider threat task force in   following the disclosures of hundreds of thousands of state department cables that were stolen by former army private chelsea manning and provided to wikileaks   the order covered virtually every federal department and agency  including the department of education  the peace corps and other offices not directly involved in national security  the program requires federal employees to monitor co workers for suspicious actions based on behavioral profiling  those who fail to report high risk people or behaviors could face penalties  including criminal charges  insider threat investigations can also be launched when computer network monitoring detects  suspicious user behavior   according to government documents  monitoring of prospective and current government employees has only increased in recent years  under a directive issued in may  by james clapper  the former director of national intelligence  u s  officials evaluating whether employees should continue to have access to classified information can collect publicly available social media posts of those workers  despite the new initiatives and a raft of innovative employee monitoring technologies developed by the nsa and private sector tech companies  insider threats remain  the greatest worry across government and industry   said curtis dukes  the former head of cyber defense at the national security agency who now works at the center for internet security  a non profit organization committed to protecting against cyber threats  tuesday s leaks came at a time when u s  intelligence agencies were already reeling from the discovery that former contractor harold martin had allegedly spent  years stealing secrets from the nsa and three other intelligence agencies before finally being caught last summer  martin worked for booz allen hamilton  the same consulting firm that employed edward snowden  who in  exposed details about u s  spying programs  this week s dump of cia files is especially alarming because the spy agency is considered the  gold standard  for monitoring and tracking insiders  according to larry pfeiffer  chief of staff to then cia director michael hayden  leo taddeo  chief security officer at cryptzone and a former special agent with the federal bureau of investigation s cyber crime division in new york  said the sept   attacks prompted a significant expansion in the number of facilities and government contractors who had access to sensitive information  a  report on the attacks concluded the plot could have been disrupted if not for lapses of communication between the cia and fbi  that finding and others forced a restructuring of how u s  intelligence agencies share information  overcoming resistance by some officials who worried the new arrangement could create new problems   we need for the right people to see the right dots  so they can connect them  but the counter argument is you increase the insider risk and that compromise has a greater impact   taddeo said  chris inglis  former deputy director of the nsa  gave a presentation entitled  how to catch a snowden  to a jam packed room last month at the rsa cyber security conference in san francisco  the talk was so popular that conference organizers had inglis present twice  inglis said companies  as well as governments  need to embrace continuous monitoring of employees and the use of behavioral analytics to spot potential leakers  and to directly involve human resources departments in detection efforts  some companies have been hesitant to adopt such strategies  inglis said  but a raft of breaches in recent years has led to a growing embrace of more aggressive approaches   the unfortunate truth is you re only going to suffer this one in a million times  but that one in a million can kill you   he said
