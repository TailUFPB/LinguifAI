krasnaya polyana  russia  reuters    president vladimir putin on thursday accused american politicians of whipping up hysteria about a mythical russian threat as a ploy to distract voters from their own failings in the run up to the u s  presidential election  putin  addressing an audience of foreign policy experts gathered in southern russia  repeatedly lashed out at the obama administration  saying it did not keep its word on syria  did not honour deals  and had falsely accused moscow of all manner of sins      the u s  government has formally accused russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against democratic party organisations  while democratic candidate hillary clinton has accused republican rival donald trump of being a putin  puppet   putin said he found it hard to believe that anyone seriously thought moscow was capable of influencing the nov   election   hysteria has been whipped up   said putin   he said that was a ruse to cover up for the fact that the u s  political elite had nothing to say about serious issues such as the country s national debt or gun control   it s much simpler to distract people with so called russian hackers  spies  and agents of influence  does anyone really think that russia could influence the american people s choice in any way  is america a banana republic or what  america is a great power   in washington  white house spokesman josh earnest dismissed putin s remarks as predictable and said the united states stood by its hacking allegations    there s nothing that president putin had to say today that i find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the president s confidence in the analysis that s been released by the department of homeland security and the intelligence community   said earnest  russian state tv and some of his past comments have suggested the russian leader favours trump  but putin said he did not back any candidate in the u s  election and was ready to work with any new u s  president and to discuss any issue   asked about trump  whom he once described as  very talented   putin said the republican candidate was deliberately adopting a showy style because he wanted to get his message across and that he represented ordinary voters fed up with the u s  political elite   he has chosen a method to get through to voters  hearts   said putin   he behaves extravagantly of course  we see this  but i think there s a reason for this   putin dismissed suggestions by some politicians in the west that russia is poised to attack another country or intervene elsewhere in the middle east apart from syria     such talk was designed to exaggerate the threat that russia posed  he said  in order for certain countries to secure higher military spending and talk up their own importance  he said russia was not planning to attack anyone  but he made clear russia was in syria for the long haul and intended to clear the city of aleppo of what he called  a nest of terrorists   while trying to minimise civilian casualties
