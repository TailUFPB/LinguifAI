tallahassee  fla   reuters    leonard  roscoe  newton has been in and out of florida s prisons since before he could vote  starting with a youthful conviction for burglary  he s been a free man for six years now with an important exception  he still can t vote   newton  who is african american  is among nearly   million former felons who have been stripped of their right to vote in a state with a history of deciding u s  presidential elections  sometimes by razor thin margins of just a few hundred votes   felons have been disenfranchised in florida since   although they can seek clemency to restore their voting rights  since   however  when republican state leaders toughened the restrictions on felon voting rights  just   ex felons have had that right restored  the lowest annual numbers in nearly two decades  according to state data reviewed by reuters  that compares with more than   in the prior four years under reforms introduced by governor rick scott s predecessor  moderate republican governor charlie crist  the data shows  crist  who was governor from  to   made it much easier to restore ex felons  voting rights   when i tried to be an effective member of the community  i saw that i was voiceless   said newton  whose expectations of getting his rights restored were dashed when the rules changed under a new administration   i m   and i have never voted   the dramatic slowdown has stoked a racially charged debate over whether political bias taints the process of restoring felon voting rights in the largest battleground state in the nov   presidential election   florida s toughened ban means racial minorities are disproportionately excluded from voting because of higher incarceration rates  data shows  black voters tend to favor democrats    republicans oppose the felon vote change because they are concerned about the political implications   said darryl paulson  a conservative republican voting rights expert who sees wide restoration of voting rights as  a huge political advantage for the democratic party   paulson says non violent ex felons should have the right to vote  almost all u s  states deny incarcerated felons the right to vote but many restore those rights after they have completed their sentences  over the last two decades  more than  states have taken action to help people with criminal convictions regain their voting rights  since july  virginia s governor has restored voting rights to   felons  florida is the largest of four remaining states that strip all former felons of voting rights  accounting for nearly half of those barred from voting nationally  along with virginia  the others are kentucky and iowa  in march   two months after he became governor  scott reversed crist s reforms  which had allowed many non violent  felons to automatically get their voting rights reinstated after they had completed their sentences  crist had also simplified the process for felons convicted of more serious crimes to regain their votes   scott  a millionaire former health care executive  put in place new restrictions  requiring ex felons to wait for five to seven years before applying to regain the right to vote  serve on a jury or hold elected office  he said the new rules ensured ex felons had proven they were unlikely to offend  florida has disenfranchised about one in five voting age black voters  according to research collected by the sentencing project  a washington based advocacy group  that compares with about   percent of the state s non black potential voters  data on the hispanic voting age population who can t vote because of the law was unavailable  although hispanics make up   percent of florida s inmates  the rates reflect racial disparities in criminal convictions  florida s current prison population is nearly  percent black  more than any other racial group  although blacks are only  percent of the state s population  ion sancho  supervisor of elections in leon county  which includes the capital city of tallahassee  accused the republican administration of repealing the felon voting reforms  to reduce the number of african americans who had their rights restored because those voters were perceived to be more democratic voting and so therefore were targeted for elimination   sancho is a former democrat who is now unaffiliated with either party  scott and attorney general pam bondi  the republican officials who drove the  policy changes  did not agree to be interviewed by reuters or respond directly to questions on the accusations that the law is intended to influence elections  but bondi has previously denied the policy amounts to racially motivated disenfranchisement   for those who may suggest that these rule changes have anything to do with race  these assertions are completely unfounded  justice has nothing to do with race   bondi wrote in a  newspaper editorial  scott s office  in a statement to reuters  said former felons need to  demonstrate that they can live a life free of crime  show a willingness to request to have their rights restored and show restitution to the victims of their crimes  in order to have their voting rights restored  democrats have seized on the issue as a civil rights concern  regardless of the political impact  said nell toensmann  who chairs the democratic party of st  johns county  a north florida region of about   people dominated by republicans   yes  it does disenfranchise a lot of african americans  but it disenfranchises a lot of white people who would be voting as republicans as well   she said  the reuters ipsos states of the nation polling project shows a tight race in florida  it estimates that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has a  percent chance of winning the state  compared to her republican opponent donald trump s  percent  political scientists say the voting ban can sap votes from both parties  but some research suggests that democrats pay a steeper price  an analysis of voting patterns by race and economic status found that if the ban had not existed during the  presidential election  democrats would have had enough votes to overturn republican george w  bush s  vote victory in florida that won him the white house   in very close elections won by republican candidates  felon disenfranchisement could be decisive   said christopher uggen  a university of minnesota professor who led the study  applying for voting rights can be difficult  ex felons must submit certified court documentation of each felony conviction   documents that can be difficult to secure for those unable to spend time and money tracking down records in courthouses  cases involving serious crimes are heard in person by a clemency board consisting of the governor and florida s cabinet officers  in quarterly meetings in tallahassee  during a sept   meeting in a windowless room in the florida capitol building   petitions to restore voting rights were on the agenda presented to the governor and three state officers in an all day session punctuated by tears and emotional pleas  some petitioners were represented by attorneys  others showed up solo or accompanied by a friend or relative   clemency is an act of mercy  there is no right or guarantee   scott told them  urging applicants to accept culpability  state rules give him the deciding vote   if i deny  it s over   he said  learlean rahming approached the podium in a black and white flowered dress  accompanied by her adult daughter  state records show dozens of criminal charges over two decades that include larceny  drug possession and shoplifting   i accept my responsibility for all of my stupid mistakes of the past   said the  year old woman  who had traveled from miami  adding that she has been out of prison for more than  years  officials were impressed by her turnaround story  until bondi noticed a discrepancy  records showed rahming had voted under a married name after her release   just to see if i could vote   she told the panel  explaining that for many years she had not realized that her rights were taken away  scott moved to deny  rahming left  wiping tears      the board ultimately cleared  residents to get back their civil rights  more than   applications are still pending  crist  the former governor who championed leniency  switched to the democratic party in   in an interview  he questioned whether the policy changes on felons voting cost him a  bid to reclaim the governor s mansion  he lost by about   votes   in the ballpark of the number of people in the state who complete felony sentences in a typical year  florida department of corrections data shows   we will never know for sure   crist said                                                               felons face tougher road to election day    tmsnrt rs
