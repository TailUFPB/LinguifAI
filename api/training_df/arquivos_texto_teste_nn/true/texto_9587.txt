washington san juan  reuters    as the u s  congress drags its feet on a bill to address puerto rico s   billion debt crisis  it could get kicked into high gear by an unlikely source  the supreme court   the highest u s  court is due to rule by the end of june on the validity of a puerto rico law that would allow the u s  territory to restructure the chunk of its debt issued by public agencies  more than   billion  in a bankruptcy like process  the court fight is playing out as the republican led congress grapples with legislation that lawmakers hope will prevent the need for a bailout of the territory of   million u s  citizens  the legislation is expected to put puerto rico s finances under federal oversight through a control board and let the caribbean island cut debt through a bankruptcy like restructuring process  it would preempt the recovery act  the local restructuring law that was thrown out in u s  courts before puerto rico asked the supreme court to reinstate it  puerto rico is not covered by federal bankruptcy laws that u s  cities and public agencies can use  so some u s  lawmakers view legislation as the only way to keep the debt crisis from worsening  but drafting the bill has been laborious  some bondholders  including u s  hedge funds  and republicans are seeking to ensure that creditors get paid as much as possible of what they are owed  congressional democrats  the obama administration and puerto rico itself are trying to prevent austerity that could threaten services on the island  an early draft of the bill by the house of representatives natural resources committee never made it to a vote  and the panel on wednesday delayed unveiling the latest draft  citing the need for  a number of refinements   some republicans oppose inclusion of a  cram down  provision that would let puerto rico impose debt cuts on creditors who do not agree to them  a supreme court decision on puerto rico s law could come as soon as monday  the ruling could change the political dynamics for republicans by resurrecting a law that is viewed as even less palatable to them than the congressional bill  according to congressional sources and experts who follow the debate   many of the creditors lobbying conservatives in congress to oppose the legislation  known as the puerto rico oversight  management and economic stability act  promesa   would prefer to keep debt restructuring talks out of a bankruptcy court  or at least avoid cram down  that is because in the normal course of business they are entitled to full repayment  but in a bankruptcy proceeding they could be legally made to accept discounts   if the supreme court reinstates the recovery act  the congressional legislation might not seem so bad to creditors in comparison  said melissa jacoby  a university of north carolina school of law bankruptcy expert and professor   it might alter the lobbying landscape   jacoby said  puerto rico has already defaulted on some of its debt  most recently the bulk of a   million payment owed by its primary government bank  the recovery act  if revived  would let the island restructure debt at public utilities like power authority prepa and water authority prasa  though the island s legislature could try to expand it to cover other debts  jacoby said  the supreme court s march  oral arguments indicated the justices could uphold the law  such a ruling could prompt creditors and republican lawmakers to embrace the need to pass the promesa bill  the legislation is expected to carry more bondholder protections than the recovery act  requiring an attempt at consensual restructuring talks as a condition for any debt cuts   those very same players who are now blocking our  congressional  legislation will  all of a sudden  encourage the  republican  majority to pass some legislation  if the supreme court revives the recovery act  said a democratic house aide  speaking on condition of anonymity  the island s moment of truth could strike by june   that is the date by which the supreme court is expected to rule and a day before puerto rico faces a    billion debt payment that its governor has said it cannot afford  congress is aiming to pass legislation to address puerto rico s crisis before that payment    steny hoyer  the second ranking house democrat  told reuters the high court s ruling  could have some effect  on promesa s drafting process  depending on what the supreme court says about puerto rican authority to do whatever it needs to do   a source close to major creditors said a ruling reinstating the recovery act could encourage congress to pass legislation for a different reason  creditors would keep litigating different aspects of that law  perpetuating puerto rico s economic uncertainty  parish braden  a spokesman for house national resources committee republicans  said congress ultimately must act regardless of what the supreme court does   the ball is already in congress  court   braden said
