ankara  reuters    many iranians who dreamt of quiet  comfortable lives after a nuclear deal with world powers in  are starting to worry for the first time in decades they might be bombed in their own homes  since taking office last month  u s  president donald trump has pledged to get tough with iran  warning the islamic republic after its ballistic missile test on sunday that it was playing with fire and all u s  options were on the table  analysts say those options could range from diplomacy to military action and some scared iranians are even preparing escape plans  just as they did in the eight year war with iraq when saddam hussein s jets pounded iranian towns and cities   i told my children to have their passports ready     if attacked by israel or america we can flee to turkey by car because airports will be closed   said ghorbanali azhari    a retired teacher in the western city of kermanshah   we have had enough  an eight year war  economic hardship  sanctions     i cannot let my grandchildren live in fear  there will be bloodshed   azhari said  trump plans to impose sanctions on several iranian entities following its missile test  while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as iran s destabilizing behavior  people familiar with the matter said on thursday  iran s most powerful authority  supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei  has continued to denounce the united states  suggesting the antagonism between the two countries since the  revolution will not abate because of the nuclear deal    i thought iran s political and economic isolation was  over     but now i am deeply concerned about a military strike   said private bank employee homayoun barkhordar   i do not want war with any country  i love my country  we just want to live in peace   said the  year old father of two  while experts say both sides would take care to avoid armed confrontation in the oil rich gulf  u s  threats of reprisals for the missile test  coupled with iran s defiant reaction  could ratchet up tensions dangerously   i am thinking of moving to a small town   said ali gharveh in the central city of isfahan  which was bombed by iraq during the   war   life is cheaper and is safer than big cities that might be the main targets if america wants to attack iran    the united states and iran have been at loggerheads since the revolution that toppled the u s  backed shah and washington cut diplomatic ties when students stormed the u s  embassy soon after and took  americans hostage for  days  the united states and its regional allies accuse iran of trying to tighten its grip on arab states  from iraq to lebanon  to syria to yemen  and trump has accused former u s  president barack obama of being too kind to tehran  days after coming to power  trump barred residents from seven mainly muslim countries  including iran  from traveling to the united states for  days  officials in iran said tehran would limit issuing visas to americans in response   i always wanted my two children to study in america  but the new government is just spreading hatred towards iranians   said firuzeh hengam  a computer engineer in the central city of kashan   they say no options are off the table  it means attacking iran is among their options   but while many iranians worry about an escalation with the united states  just as they worry about economic hardship at home  they are also loyal and defiant    iran is my home no matter who the rulers are  look at syrians who left their country because of the war  they are being humiliated     i do not want to be like them   said hairdresser samira azamzadeh    in the northern city of rasht   i don t have money to go abroad  i am a single mother of two teenage girls   iran s economy has been hit hard by the double hammer blows of years of sanctions over its nuclear program and the plunge in oil prices since the middle of    iranians had pinned their hopes on economic progress following the nuclear deal  but a year after sanctions were lifted the economy is only recovering slowly and deals with western investors are few and far between  they now worry that u s  aggression and the curbs on travel will make wary western investors even less likely to return to do business with tehran   the economic situation will even get worse because of the america s tough language  it will scare away foreign investors   said omid sadrzadeh  a factory owner in karaj near the capital tehran  one former senior iranian official also said trump s approach was playing into the hands of powerful hardliners such as iran s elite revolutionary guards corps  irgc   the irgc controls the country s missile program and its deputy said on thursday it had many underground missile facilities hidden in the mountains   iran s hardliners want a war  it will strengthen their position in the establishment  they want iran to be isolated   said the official  who asked not to be named   they will do whatever they can to deepen tension between iran and america  from launching missiles to giving fiery speeches   analysts say tehran could retaliate against any military strike with hit and run attacks in the gulf and by closing the strait of hormuz  the strategic waterway through which some  percent of gulf oil exports pass  iranian authorities have warned arch enemy israel and the united states in the past that tehran s response to a military strike would be tough  and some of iran s guided missiles have the range to strike israel  arash kiai  a teenager in the central city of yazd is scared  and angry  both with trump and iranian officials  but he will fall in line behind them if it comes to war   whatever happens in the world they blame iran  but why  we are peaceful people   he said   i am not an iran regime supporter but trump has no right to humiliate iranians  if attacked  i will fight for iran
