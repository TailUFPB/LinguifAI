 reuters    the following are highlights from u s  president elect donald trump s hour long news conference in new york on wednesday  nine days before he takes the oath of office  trump blasted the release of an unsubstantiated intelligence report saying he had been compromised by russia and was vulnerable to blackmail  characterizing it as  nonsense that was released by  maybe the intelligence agencies  who knows  but maybe the intelligence agencies     it should never have been written  it should never have been released    it s all fake news  it didn t happen  it s phony stuff  it was a group of opponents who got together  sick people  who put that out    i think it was disgraceful  disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out there     that s something that nazi germany would have done   he praised some news organizations for not initially reporting on the document    i just want to compliment many of the people in the room     i have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press   he strongly criticized cnn for its reporting of the story  refusing to take a question from a reporter for the network  telling him   i m not going to give you a question  you are fake news    some of the media outlets we are dealing with are fake news     all i can ask for are honest reporters    asked whether he accepted that russian president vladimir putin tried to help him win the election  trump said   if putin likes donald trump  i consider that an asset  not a liability   he denied having any business dealings with or in russia   i have no loans with russia at all    as far as hacking  i think it s russia  but we also get hacked by other countries and other people  and i can say that   on putin and hacking  trump said   he shouldn t be doing it  he won t be doing it    within  days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense  how do we stop this new phenomena    russia will have far greater respect for our country when i m leading it     we re either going to get along  or we re not  i hope we get along  but if we don t  that s possible too    but russia and other countries  and other countries  including china  which has taken total advantage of us economically    and  taken  advantage of us in the south china sea     russia  china  japan  mexico  all countries will respect us far more  far more  than they do under past administrations   asked about nominating a supreme court justice  trump said   so  as you know  i have a list of   i ve gone through them     they were outstanding in every case     i ll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the united states supreme court  a replacement for the great  great justice  antonin  scalia  that will be probably within two weeks of the   of january       it will be a decision which i very strongly believe in  i think it s one of the reasons i got elected    we have to get our drug industry coming back  to the united states  he said  adding that companies had been  leaving left and right   trump also called for new bidding procedures for u s  drug companies  saying   they re getting away with murder  with drug prices      there s very little bidding for drugs    we re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don t bid properly  we re going to start bidding and we re going to start saving billions of dollars    i said i will be the greatest jobs producer that god ever created  and i mean that    you want to move your plant  and you think  as an example  you re going to build that plant in mexico  and you re going to make your air conditioners or your cars  or whatever you re making  and you re going to sell them through what will be a very  very strong border     not going to happen  you re going to pay a very large border tax   trump said he would not wait for negotiations with mexico to be completed before starting to build a wall along the two countries  border   i could wait about a year and a half until we finish our negotiations with mexico  which will start immediately after we get into office  but i don t want to wait    we re going to be submitting     a plan  it ll be repeal and replace  it will be essentially simultaneously  it will be various segments  you understand  but will most likely be on the same day or the same week    obamacare is the democrats  problem  we are going to take the problem off the shelf for them     we are doing the democrats a great service   trump announced the nomination of dr  david shulkin as secretary of veteran affairs  shulkin is currently under secretary for health at the va    we re going to straighten out the va for our veterans  i have been promising that for a long time     we interviewed at least  people  for va head   some good  some not so good     our veterans have been treated very unfairly
