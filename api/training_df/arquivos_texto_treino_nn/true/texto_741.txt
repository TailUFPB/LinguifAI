washington  reuters    democratic election victories in virginia and new jersey showed republicans losing more ground in suburban areas  where president donald trump s unpopularity could cost them dearly in next year s congressional races   the results from tuesday  particularly in virginia  suggest that trump s strategy of playing to a loyal but limited base has not enabled him to broaden support for his presidency or his party  democrats were delighted  believing that control of the u s  house of representatives  and perhaps even the senate  now both controlled by republicans  might be up for grabs in next year s elections  some republicans shared that view after their party s candidates did poorly among independent  college educated  women  and minority voters in suburban areas   unless we get our act together  we are going to lose heavily   republican senator john mccain said on wednesday   democrats would need to pick up  seats next year to retake control of the house  should that happen  trump s policy agenda would be effectively dead and the administration would come under greater scrutiny   the win by democrat phil murphy in new jersey s governor s race came as no surprise because of the unpopularity of outgoing republican governor chris christie  but ralph northam s  point victory over republican ed gillespie for governor in swing state virginia was larger than expected  trump quickly tried to distance himself from gillespie s poor showing  saying on twitter that the republican candidate  worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for   still  trump s leadership record appeared to motivate democrats to vote in record numbers in virginia  with exit polls showing that many came out simply to express their displeasure with the president    trump is turning off more voters than he s bringing in   said rodell mollineau  a democratic strategist in washington   his base is strong  but it isn t growing   during his first year in office  trump has consistently played to a base of passionate supporters  many of them older white men who live in rural areas declining in population  and has shown little inclination to reach out to the majority of voters who disapprove of him   whit ayres  a republican pollster based in virginia  said the party was on a risky track   republicans have traded fast growing upscale suburban counties for slow growing or declining rural areas  that is not a formula for long term success   there also may be signs of slippage in trump s political  base   in virginia  gillespie campaigned hard on immigration and crime   two hot issues with the president s supporters   but did worse than expected in some rural and suburban areas that trump easily won last year  in rural dickenson county  considered to be the heart of trump country in virginia  gillespie s margin over northam was almost  percentage points less than trump s margin of victory over democrat hillary clinton last year   trump won the city of virginia beach in  by  points  but gillespie lost to northam there by   a swing of eight points  more critically  gillespie was blown out by northam in northern virginia s populous suburbs  where trump also struggled in the presidential race   the suburbs came out in full force   said matt mackowiak  a republican strategist   they appear to be very motivated to try and deliver a message to trump   in growing loudoun county  outside of washington  democrat barack obama barely edged out republican mitt romney in the  presidential race  on tuesday  northam buried gillespie there by almost  points   i m worried   ari fleischer  a former white house spokesman for republican president george w  bush  told fox news on wednesday   democrats came out in huge numbers yesterday in the races and if they have that kind of enthusiasm going into   it s going to be very tough sailing for republicans   gillespie  a longtime washington insider and lobbyist  tried to keep his distance from trump personally even as he adopted some of his more combative campaign rhetoric  it was a strategy that failed and mackowiak said the result reflected trump s historically low approval rating   i don t think the white house was worried about that before  but now i think they have to be   the five day reuters ipsos tracking poll has trump hovering around  percent approval nationally  with close to  percent of respondents disapproving of his performance in office  a person familiar with trump s political operation dismissed the election results on tuesday as having anything to do with the president  noting that both new jersey and virginia were won by clinton in   andrew surabian  an adviser to the pro trump political group great america alliance  said gillespie lost because he was exactly the kind of establishment republican that trump voters have rejected   ed gillespie s campaign went down in flames because he failed to fully embrace the president or his agenda   surabian said   and without a coherent message and an authentic messenger  republican candidates will not be successful moving forward
