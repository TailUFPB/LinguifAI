new york  reuters    federal and state prosecutors said on thursday they would not bring criminal charges against new york city mayor bill de blasio or his aides in two simultaneous year long investigations into his fundraising practices  but the mayor s conduct was criticized by prosecutors  with manhattan district attorney cyrus vance saying de blasio s fundraising for other democratic candidates in  appeared to violate the  intent and spirit  of state campaign finance laws  the decisions are a victory for de blasio  who was dogged by questions about the probes as he prepared to run for re election this year  it is unusual for prosecutors to announce the conclusion of criminal inquiries  in a statement  acting u s  attorney joon kim in manhattan said it was done  in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and mayoral election   at a news conference  de blasio said the statements confirmed he and his administration had acted lawfully  he dismissed questions pointing out that prosecutors criticized his actions despite deciding not to pursue a case   i do not agree with some of the characterizations   he said   what matters is the fact that this was extensively investigated for a year  and no charges have been brought   u s  prosecutors had probed whether the de blasio administration gave favors to donors who contributed either to his campaign or to a nonprofit organization set up to promote his political agenda  in a statement  kim said his office had investigated  several circumstances  in which the mayor or his associates contacted or directed agencies on behalf of donors  the decision not to prosecute  kim said  was made based on several factors  including  the particular difficulty in proving criminal intent in corruption schemes where there is no evidence of personal profit   vance s office separately examined whether de blasio steered campaign contributions to county committees in order to sidestep new york state campaign finance limits  in a  page letter to the state board of elections  whose own inquiry led to his investigation  vance detailed how de blasio and his allies sought to help democrats win a majority in the state senate in   wealthy donors were encouraged to give to county committees rather than individual candidates because the limits are much higher for the committees  the money then flowed from the committees to individual candidates  often within days  while each individual transaction appeared lawful  the overall effect was to evade campaign finance law by creating an  end run  around contribution limits  vance said  but vance said the transfers were approved by an election law attorney working with the coordinated campaign  under the law  an individual who acts on the advice of an attorney is typically shielded from prosecution  the conclusion not to bring charges  is not an endorsement of the conduct at issue   wrote vance  though city hall was spared  the investigations have previously uncovered multiple unrelated schemes  including some involving high ranking police officials  the federal probe was initially centered on two businessmen  jona rechnitz and jeremy reichberg  who helped raise money for de blasio in  and   reichberg and several police officials were charged in june with a bribery scheme involving prostitutes and luxury trips  rechnitz had already pleaded guilty in secret and cooperated with investigators  his assistance also helped prosecutors build a case against the once powerful head of the city s correction officers union  norman seabrook  who was charged alongside a hedge fund financier with secretly investing union pension funds in exchange for kickbacks  in yet another fraud linked to the probe  u s  prosecutors charged two police officers and a brooklyn man  alex lichtenstein  in a bribery scheme involving gun licenses  he was sentenced to more than    years in prison on thursday after pleading guilty  another peripheral figure  restaurateur hamlet peralta  was charged last year with running a   million ponzi scheme in a case that grew out of the probe  several high ranking police officials have been disciplined as a result of the investigation into rechnitz and reichberg
