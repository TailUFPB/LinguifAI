washington  reuters    republican leaders in the u s  house of representatives are working to build support to temporarily extend the national security agency s expiring internet surveillance program by tucking it into a stop gap funding measure  lawmakers said  the month long extension of the surveillance law  known as section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  would punt a contentious national security issue into the new year in an attempt to buy lawmakers more time to hash out differences over various proposed privacy reforms   lawmakers leaving a republican conference meeting on wednesday evening said it was not clear whether the stop gap bill had enough support to avert a partial government shutdown on saturday  or whether the possible addition of the section  extension would impact its chances for passage  absent congressional action the law  which allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states  will expire on dec
