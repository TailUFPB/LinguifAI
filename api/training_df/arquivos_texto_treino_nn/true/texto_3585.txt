washington  reuters    mitch mcconnell  the top republican in the u s  senate  says he could live without the drama surrounding president donald trump s white house  but from a policy standpoint sees the new commander in chief as a solid ally in the mode of any president from his party  mcconnell told reuters that he finds trump accessible and that they talk regularly  even more frequently than he spoke to the last republican president  george w  bush  while mcconnell would not discuss the substance of their conversations  he said the two are able to be frank with one another without it damaging their relationship   we have a good relationship  he s never  as far as i can tell  gotten angry at me   in my presence  anyway  we have a good working relationship   mcconnell said during a roundtable with reuters reporters on wednesday  mcconnell  who last week said he hoped to see  less drama  from the white house  said that trump does not always take his advice   he knows  as you all know  that i ve not been a fan of the tweets and the extracurricular comments  i said last week we could do with a little less drama   mcconnell said  cracking a grin  he added   the reason i m smiling   obviously  he s disinclined to take my advice on some things  but it has not impaired the ability to communicate and convey my opinion  which i do frequently   in matters of style  mcconnell and trump are a study in contrasts  the senate majority leader is a taciturn traditionalist steeped in the ways of washington  after more than three decades in congress  trump  a real estate magnate and reality tv celebrity who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency in january  airs his views regularly on twitter and has vowed to drain what he calls the  swamp  of the u s  capital  mcconnell declined to say if he had advised trump to speak less about the controversy dogging the administration  questions about whether associates of trump colluded with alleged russian meddling in the  u s  presidential campaign  and concerns about trump s abrupt dismissal of fbi director james comey as the agency was probing the russia matter  on questions concerning russia  mcconnell stuck to his script   i think all of that is going to be handled by the special counsel and the senate intelligence committee  and i m confident in their ability to do the job   he said  referring to a special counsel appointed by the justice department last week  and to one of several congressional panels probing the russia issue  some republican lawmakers and lobbyists worry the issue will slow legislative plans  republicans have yet to chalk up significant legislative achievements despite being in control of the white house and both chambers of congress  but mcconnell said he and trump are aligned in putting an overhaul of obamacare and a rewrite of the tax code at the top of their agenda  mcconnell acknowledged there had been doubts within his party during the  campaign about what trump would do in the white house   this was a guy who was giving fund raisers for  senate democratic leader  chuck schumer four or five years ago   mcconnell said  but mcconnell  whose wife elaine chao is a member of trump s cabinet as transportation secretary  said he sees trump as someone who has embraced republican orthodoxy   in other words  what the administration is doing  not only am i comfortable with it  but i think the vast majority of republicans in congress feel that this is a right of center presidency  which is what we had hoped  for  he said   if you look at what the president is actually for  it strikes me as indistinguishable from what a president jeb bush or a president marco rubio would have been advocating  deregulation  tax reform  repeal and replace of obamacare  judges like neil gorsuch   mcconnell said  trump s relationship with congress has been boosted by the frequent and  very significant  presence of vice president mike pence in the halls of capitol hill  mcconnell said  describing pence s role as  serious value added    he is  in my view  kind of the de facto congressional relations guy for the administration   he said  noting pence  a former indiana governor and republican congressman  has strong relationships on the hill  mcconnell described pence as playing a similar role with congress as vice president dick cheney did during the george w  bush administration  listening and sometimes weighing in on discussions about healthcare and tax reform   it s been really helpful because members feel like they can go over and whisper in his ear about whatever their particular problem is  and something will be done about it  because they ve kind of elevated it to a higher level   mcconnell said
