washington  reuters    democrats in the u s  house of representatives introduced a new version of a russia and iran sanctions bill on wednesday  hoping to send a message to president donald trump to maintain a strong line against moscow  seeking to force republican house leaders to allow a vote  democrats on the house foreign affairs committee introduced legislation unchanged from what passed the senate by   on june  but has been stalled ever since  while the new bill is identical to what the senate passed  it will be labeled as house legislation to avoid a procedural issue that prompted house republican leaders to send the measure back to the senate  however  there was no sign of support from trump s fellow republicans  who control majorities in both the house and the senate and control what legislation comes up for a vote  ashlee strong  a spokeswoman for republican house speaker paul ryan  dismissed the democrats  action as  grandstanding   the measure was introduced by house democratic leader nancy pelosi and representatives steny hoyer  the no   house democrat  and eliot engel  the ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee  democrats have accused house republicans of stalling the sanctions package because of trump administration concern about provisions setting up a process for congress to approve any  effort by the president to ease sanctions on russia  trump s attempts to mend relations with russia have been hindered by allegations that moscow interfered in the  u s  election and colluded with trump s campaign  russia denies meddling and trump says there was no collusion      the issue has become even more heated since emails released tuesday showed that donald trump jr  the president s eldest son  eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about hillary clinton  the democratic rival in the  presidential election  lawmakers and aides said news of that meeting  and the failure to disclose it  added new urgency to the push to pass the russia package   dilly dallying  house republican leaders said they had not taken up the original senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that all legislation affecting government revenues originate in the house  known as a  blue slip  issue  democrats and some republicans who backed the bill scoffed  saying the problem could have been quickly remedied   dilly dallying around about the blue slip issue was just a ridiculous waste of time  we could have fixed it in five minutes   senator bob corker  the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  told reporters  the senate changed the bill to address that issue  but also tweaked it in a way that democrats said weakened a provision requiring congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on russia  the new bill introduced on wednesday would eliminate that change to allow house democrats  as well as republicans  to force a vote on a resolution of disapproval of any effort to ease russia sanctions   i don t believe that having the president s party in a position to protect him from any oversight is good policy for our country   hoyer told reporters  ryan told a news conference he wants to move a strong bill regarding sanctions on russia as quickly as possible but that the legislation still faced procedural and policy hurdles  the u s  energy industry has been lobbying against the bill and some republican house members  particularly from oil producing states  have said they might want changes  the russia sanctions legislation was written as an amendment to a bill imposing new sanctions on iran over issues including its ballistic missile program  besides establishing the review process  it puts into law sanctions previously imposed on moscow via presidential executive order and introduces new sanctions
