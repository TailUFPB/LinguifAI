washington  reuters    barely two days into crafting a new bill to roll back obamacare  u s  senate republicans were already on the defensive on tuesday over the absence of any women in their core working group  after a meeting of the senate healthcare group  lawmakers were bombarded with questions as to why no women were named to the  man panel  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell tried to explain   the working group that counts is all  of us   mcconnell told reporters  referring to all  republican senators in the  member chamber   nobody is being excluded based upon gender     everybody s at the table  everybody   democrats pounced  republican men are negotiating  a secret healthcare plan  which i really hope is not happening in the men s locker room   said senator patty murray  a member of the democratic leadership from washington state       if the criticism was any sign of what lies ahead as senators try to improve on a rollback bill passed on thursday by house of representatives republicans  it could be a long road ahead  dismantling the parts of president barack obama s signature healthcare law that they dislike and preserving other parts of it is proving to be a difficult task for president donald trump and his fellow republicans  a house of representatives  plan for doing that  approved last week amid much drama  faces an uncertain future in the senate  some republicans eye drafting a similar senate bill by mid summer  possibly with the involvement of democrats  others indicate the house bill requires major surgery and that the effort to replace the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  could take months   regardless of timing  two decisive factors will come into sharper focus soon  one is voter reaction to the house bill  now being voiced in town hall events being hosted nationwide by house members in their home districts  the other factor is an expected analysis by the non partisan congressional budget office of how many million americans would lose their health insurance coverage under the house bill  if it became law  and how it would affect the u s  budget deficit  both the cbo analysis and the town hall events have the potential to do damage to the house legislation  which trump hailed as a triumph just days ago  senators are already talking about major changes in the house bill concerning medicaid  the government healthcare program for the poor  and tax subsidies for healthcare coverage  trying to get past the controversy over the absence of women on the healthcare panel  senate republicans said they expected to devote much time to healthcare in the near future    i don t think we re going to be talking about much else other than healthcare at least three days a week with all members of our conference present   said senator john cornyn  the no   republican  cornyn said senators would start with the house bill   if we have to make modifications in order to pass it  we ll make those modifications and work out the differences with the house   medicaid was the topic at the senate working group meeting  tuesday  the house bill would cut federal spending on medicaid by   billion over  years  but some republicans want any reductions to be more gradual  and trump made a campaign pledge not to cut the program   there ought to be a glide path where you do not have a cliff that the house provides in    when the expansion of medicaid under obamacare is abruptly ended  said senator rob portman of ohio  but other republicans said cutbacks were important to save taxpayer money   the public wants every dime you can give them  let s face it  once you get them on the dole  they are going to take every dime they can  we ve got to find some way of getting things under control  or this country and your future s going to be gone   said republican senator orrin hatch  a member of the healthcare working group
