 washington  reuters    president donald j  trump is planning to increase u s  defense spending by   billion next year  but a series of recent reports by the defense department inspector general and the government accountability office say that pentagon accounting systems will struggle to track how the money is spent   the reports found that the pentagon remains unable to accurately track its   billion annual budget and experiences billions of dollars in accounting gaps and errors each year despite two decades of reform efforts  taken together  the reports show that many of the endemic accounting problems exposed in a  reuters investigative series remain in place    these deficiencies not only affect  the department of defense s  ability to have auditable financial statements   a feb   government accountability office  gao  report found   they also affect its ability to make sound decisions on missions and operations    a spokesman for the white house s office of management budget  omb  said he was confident that defense secretary james mattis would properly spend the additional funds    the need to replenish our military and bolster american security is unquestioned and an important priority of this president   omb communications director john czwartacki said in a statement   we believe secretary mattis will deploy all of his resources in the most effective and efficient way possible    critics of wasteful pentagon spending say increasing the defense department budget is unwise when the department is unable to account for what it already has    it s ludicrous   said mandy smithberger  director of the straus military reform project in washington   reform isn t going to happen as long as the spigot is turned on    the pentagon s continued accounting problems are drawing particular scrutiny now because the defense department faces a congressionally mandated legal deadline of sept      to become ready for its first audit ever  unlike every other u s  government department  the pentagon has never undergone an audit because its financial records are in such disarray   a spokesman for the defense department comptroller s office said he is confident it will meet the deadline    the department is committed and on track to be ready to undergo a full financial statement audit in  fiscal year     lieutenant colonel eric d  badger said in an email   at the same time trump proposes to boost defense spending  he has called for deep cuts to other areas  a white house summary of his proposed  budget shows  whether congress will accept or reject trump s proposals is unclear   trump calls for cutting the state department s budget by    billion  or    among other things  u s  payments to support the united nations would be cut   the environmental protection agency  epa  would take a particularly big hit  trump would cut    billion  or    of its budget  the white house document says the budget would eliminate more than  epa programs  and cut epa s research and development budget by   million  or    the budget for grants to states for lead clean up would be cut by   to    million   the recent watchdog reports on the defense department found that it lacks a unified  functioning accounting system  as reuters reported in its  series  the pentagon has hundreds of independent systems  built ad hoc and some dating from the   that are riddled with errors and incapable of sharing accurate data   billions of dollars disappear from accounting records  the military has spent large sums building new systems meant to solve the problem  but so far they have not   a march  defense department inspector general report said the navy could not find any records to back up how it had spent   million in the first quarter of  in u s  military operations in afghanistan  the report said that as a result  there was no way to know what the money actually was used for   a navy spokeswoman  lieutenant kara yingling  referred reuters to the navy s official response to the report  which said the navy agreed with the inspector general s conclusions but said its accounting problems will not be fixed until it begins using a new computer system in   yingling said the navy is  on track  to help the pentagon meet its sept   audit deadline   the feb   gao report said the pentagon s continued bookkeeping errors affect the federal government as a whole  defense spending makes up such a large part of the federal budget that the department s unreliable data skews accounting for the entire u s  government  the gao said   the report noted that the defense department has been on the gao s list of  high risk  entities that represent threats to the federal government s financial well being since   the report said the pentagon has remained on the list because of  long standing deficiencies with its financial management systems    the gao report noted that the pentagon had hired large independent accounting firms for each of the military services to try to help them meet the sept   audit deadline  but the report said the firms have found so many problems that the ability of the pentagon to meet the deadline remains in doubt   a separate defense department inspector general report issued on march     found that the army continues to be unable to balance its checkbook  the report concluded that the problem for the army grew worse in    the report said that for october   the army had   discrepancies  the monthly numbers rose steadily to   for june   the report did not give dollar amounts for those months   army spokesman wayne hall said the number of discrepancies continued to increase in  because planned fixes to computer systems have not yet been made  he said the army is working on building more reliable systems   the report said that because rules require that the army s numbers exactly match in monthly reports to the treasury  the army and the defense finance and accounting service must find a way to make them match  their solution was to enter made up numbers to make it appear falsely that the army s numbers do match   the report said that for march   there were    billion in such  forced balance entries   hall said the army must make the numbers match under federal rules   in separate reports  the inspector general found that other military services have also had problems balancing their financial numbers with the treasury s  accountants interviewed by reuters said that such large discrepancies would be considered accounting fraud in the corporate world   badger  the spokesman for the defense department comptroller s office  said any errors by the military services were unintentional    we strongly oppose any accusation of intentionally misrepresenting our books   badger said in an email   many manual accounting adjustments are often caused by the ineffective design of legacy business or financial systems    trump has said the   billion in increased defense spending will send a  message to the world in these dangerous times of american strength  security and resolve   trump has also vowed to negotiate cheaper contracts with defense contractors  a problem also cited in recent watchdog reports   in a march  report  the inspector general found that the air force had spent  billions  on a contract to maintain one type of jet engine  without first getting any idea of a fair price   the open ended contract  with a guaranteed profit margin regardless of cost  was awarded in   the report said that before signing the contract the air force obtained no data on the actual cost of the repairs and how the costs compared to private sector rates   the exact amount of the contract was redacted from the report  the inspector general has not ruled on a march  freedom of information act request filed by reuters that asked for the redacted information to be made public
