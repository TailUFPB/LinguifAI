washington  reuters    democrats in the u s  house of representatives opposed to republican legislation that would repeal major sections of the dodd frank financial reform law on tuesday made multiple efforts to delay the bill  the house financial services committee was due to consider representative jeb hensarling s sweeping bill to rework the  law  in addition to eliminating large portions of dodd frank   enacted in the wake of the global financial crisis   it would put new handcuffs on regulators charged with writing and enforcing its rules  the partisan maneuvering to slow work on the bill demonstrated how divided the two parties are regarding rules for the financial sector  casting doubt on congress s ability to revisit them significantly despite republican president donald trump s vow to  do a number  on existing regulations  first  democrats ordered a vote on whether the committee even wanted to actually consider the bill  that amendment passed with support from only the republican majority  then  democrats ordered that all  pages of the law be read out loud by the committee clerk  the reading of legislative language is almost always waived by committee members when considering a bill  after about    hours of the bill being read to a largely empty committee room  democrats agreed to shelve that request and proceed to the amendments they wanted to offer  democrats had drawn up roughly  amendments they wanted to offer to change the bill  according to a house aide  but that number is expected to shrink as the two parties work out a path forward  hensarling announced on tuesday that despite earlier plans to vote on amendments to the bill throughout the day  no votes would be held on the bill until wednesday morning at the earliest  the procedural obstacles were all aimed at a bill that is not expected to actually become law  as the sweeping rewrite of dodd frank is not expected to garner enough support in the senate  which the republicans hold by a slim majority   but it is expected to pass the republican led house  and the skirmish over it was a clear indication of how much democrats are willing to dig in on measures that would make life easier for the financial sector   this is one of the worst bills i ve seen in my time in congress   said representative maxine waters  the committee s top democrat  as the committee began debate on the measure   the bill is rotten to the core  and simply carries water for trump and his buddies on wall street   hensarling s bill would allow large banks to avoid most dodd frank rules if they agree to establish a  percent capital ratio  and also scraps several powers given to regulators after the financial crisis to more closely scrutinize some of the nation s largest institutions  it also makes several changes to the consumer financial protection bureau  severely limiting its power and giving congress and the white house more direct control over its operations and funding
