washington boston  reuters    in a white house marked by infighting  top economic aide gary cohn  a democrat and former goldman sachs banker  is muscling aside some of president donald trump s hard right advisers to push more moderate  business friendly economic policies  cohn    did not work on republican trump s campaign and only got to know him after the november election  but he has emerged as one of the administration s most powerful players in an ascent that rankles conservatives  trump refers to his director of the national economic council  nec   as  one of my geniuses   according to one source close to cohn  more than half a dozen sources on wall street and in the  white house said cohn has gained the upper hand over trump s chief strategist  steve bannon  the former head of the right wing website breitbart news and a champion of protectionist trade opposed by moderate republicans and many big companies  cohn is a key administration link to business executives and white house sources say he will lead the charge for trump on top domestic priorities such as tax reform  infrastructure and deregulation    gary s singular focus is tax reform and he s working to try and get that done in    said orin snyder  a partner at law firm gibson dunn and a long time friend of cohn    he is working to implement the president s twin goals of economic growth and job creation  the tax plan will also include a reduction in the corporate rate  but also tax relief for middle  and low income americans   some conservatives fear cohn may push through a tax plan that is unnecessarily complicated and argue that including tax relief for middle  and low income americans would not spur economic growth as much as cuts focused entirely or mostly on businesses and entrepreneurs  adam brandon  president of the conservative group freedomworks  is disappointed trump is not charging ahead with a plan unveiled last year during his campaign that would slash taxes on businesses and wealthy individuals   that plan was shaped heavily by stephen moore  an economic policy expert at the conservative heritage foundation think tank  who advised trump s campaign  but it has since been shelved   i don t like the idea of scrapping it and starting over again   brandon said  a senior administration official said the white house has started from scratch on the tax plan and  while setting business tax cuts as the highest priority  is consulting with lawmakers  economists and business leaders before taking it to the republican led congress  two administration officials said reports that the white house was considering a carbon tax and a value added tax were incorrect  but that other ideas were on the table   we are considering a multitude of options for tax reform   a white house official said on sunday  associates of both trump and cohn say the two have developed a bond  people who have worked with cohn say he is loyal  direct and assertive  traits that trump likes   crucially  cohn also has the trust of jared kushner  trump s adviser and son in law  and his wife ivanka  trump s daughter  cohn hired his staff more quickly than other top officials  building a reputation for competence in an administration hurt by early missteps over healthcare reform and a travel ban  the sources said   gary is a huge asset to the trump administration  he ll be of great help in eliminating unnecessary regulation  stimulating growth and reforming the tax code   said billionaire hedge fund manager john paulson  an early backer of trump who knows cohn through wall street circles  the son of middle class parents in cleveland  ohio  cohn overcame dyslexia and worked in sales before elbowing his way into a position as a wall street trader and rising to become president and chief operating officer at goldman sachs group inc  gs n        kushner was a goldman sachs intern when he first crossed paths with cohn  after trump s election victory  kushner paved the way for cohn to meet the president elect  who had spent much of the campaign blasting investment banks as modern day robber barons  trump soon named cohn his nec director  apparently paying more heed to cohn and other moderates on his team  trump last week said he was open to reappointing janet yellen as federal reserve chairman when her term is up and he also held back from naming china a currency manipulator   both stances marked a reversal from his campaign when trump criticized yellen and vowed to label china a currency manipulator on  day one  of his administration  a move that could lead to punitive duties on chinese goods  sources close to cohn and inside the white house said there are sharp policy differences between cohn and both bannon and reince priebus  white house chief of staff  a white house spokesperson denied there was a power struggle inside the west wing   cohn has already put his stamp on regulatory policy by working with kushner to successfully push wall street lawyer jay clayton for head of the securities and exchange commission after billionaire investor carl icahn  an early trump supporter  had vetted other candidates  clayton s nomination has been advanced to the senate for a vote  the vacant federal reserve vice chairman s seat is a key regulatory role cohn and his colleagues on the economic team want to fill soon  cohn has interviewed nearly two dozen candidates and has whittled the list down  randal quarles  a veteran of the george w  bush administration is one of several candidates left  a source familiar with the process said  cohn will also take a leading role in developing trump s infrastructure plan to rebuild airports  roads and bridges  the biggest challenge may be figuring out how to pay for the initiative  which trump has estimated at   trillion  while conservatives are concerned by cohn  they note that bannon is still part of trump s mercurial administration and that cohn could fall out of favor as quickly as he has risen       whoever is up today   brandon said   could be gone tomorrow
