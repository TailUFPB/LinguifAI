washington  reuters    a plan by president donald trump and congressional republicans to slash taxes on so called pass through businesses is testing lawmakers  ability to design rules to prevent wealthy people from dodging taxes by paying a lower rate meant to help small businesses grow  businesses ranging in size from the corner mom and pop shop to accounting firms and industrial conglomerates are called pass throughs because their profits flow to owners and are taxed as individual income  often at the top   percent rate  by contrast  publicly held corporations have their own top corporate income tax rate of  percent  at least on paper  corporate profits are further taxed when they flow through to shareholders as dividends  republicans including house of representatives speaker paul ryan have vowed to get tax legislation to trump s desk before the end of   but pass throughs are one of the thorniest issues in their effort to enact the first comprehensive tax overhaul since   the republican timeline is in doubt because of complexities posed by pass throughs and other difficult issues that could roll the debate into  and beyond  analysts and lobbyists said  trump and republicans  who control the house and senate  want to give pass throughs their own tax rate of   percent  saying such a low rate would help unleash economic growth by leaving owners with more money to hire and invest  the danger with this proposal is that high income people who pay the top individual tax rate could reap enormous windfalls simply by reclassifying their wages and salaries as pass through business income to qualify for the new low rate        tax avoidance schemes along these lines could erase up to   billion from government coffers over the next decade  the nonpartisan tax policy center estimated  the nonpartisan tax foundation estimates that over  million businesses are organized as pass throughs  income from them has been taxed at the same rates as wages and salaries since the individual income tax was enacted in    these are tough  tough questions  and politics aside  they re what has held up tax reform for so long   said one corporate lobbyist  who asked not be identified   this is an area where there s still a lot of discussion and no solution   to address this  policymakers are looking at limiting how much of a business owner s income should get pass through treatment  but that s hard to define because pass throughs range from sole proprietorships and partnerships to s corporations  rebecca boenigk  chairman and chief executive of the pass through manufacturer neutral posture  worries that congress could choose solutions that inadvertently add complexity for small businesses and deny business owners the capital they need   there s always a rule that s put into place to take care of the  percent of people who are bad  and that rule ends up affecting the  percent of people who are good   said boenigk  who began making ergonomic furniture with her mother  years ago in their family garage     one proposal under consideration would apply the pass through rate to only  percent of a business owner s income  while giving taxpayers the option of qualifying for more favorable treatment from the internal revenue service  congressional sources and lobbyists said  the remaining  percent of income would be taxed at the higher individual rate    the national federation of independent business  a small business lobbying group in washington  wants congress and the trump administration to apply the lower tax rate to  percent of a business owner s income  some lobbyists warn against the idea of allowing business owners to qualify for a higher percentage of income for the pass through rate with the irs  saying an additional layer of complicated procedures could backfire and encourage fraud     keith hall  president of the national association for the self employed  would rather see business owners pay individual tax on a portion of their income set by living standards data for the geographical areas in which they live  but if lawmakers adopted the   approach  hall said  higher earners should see the larger portions of their income qualify for the pass through rate to maximize the amount of capital they can invest in their businesses      other proposals would limit the pass through rate according to the business owner s capital or stock value  exclude income from partnerships engaged in  personal services  such as law  accounting  medicine and engineering  or exclude passive income from royalties  rents  dividends and income  with republicans pushing to overhaul the tax code before year end  analysts say tax legislation could include a number of anti abuse rules   lawmakers aren t going to know which anti abuse measures work  if they re risk averse  they may throw in more than one   said scott greenberg  senior analyst at the tax foundation
