 reuters    financial markets are fretting about the fiscal situation in washington  with deadlines looming in late september and early october on the u s  budget and the federal debt ceiling  republican president donald trump stoked anxieties by threatening on aug   to shut down the government if congress does not fund his u s  mexico border wall  here is what you need to know about the budget and the debt ceiling  separate issues but ones that are politically connected  congress is supposed to pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on sept   to fund most of the u s  government  but disagreements often prevent this  when that happens  lawmakers usually pass a temporary bill extending current spending levels with no changes for days  weeks or months  while they work on a long term agreement  when even a short term budget patch cannot be agreed in congress  or if the president decides to veto either a long term or short term budget measure  the government shuts down   this year  when congress returns on sept   from its long summer recess  lawmakers will have only about  working days to pass a budget measure  probably a short term patch  known as a continuing resolution  to keep the government open  if a budget measure is not passed before oct    or if trump vetoes a budget deal over his mexican border wall demand  portions of the government will begin to shut down and non essential employees will go without pay until an agreement is reached  the last time the government shut down  in october  for about two weeks  was because of a dispute over funding for former democratic president barack obama s healthcare law  there were three shutdowns in the   the longest lasting  days  in the  and  there were  shutdowns  most brief and some only partial  shutdowns hurt federal workers  rattle financial markets and shake confidence in the u s  government abroad  but to date they have done little lasting economic damage  according to analysts  the  debt ceiling  is a legal cap on how much money the u s  government can borrow through bonds and other debt issued by the u s  treasury  it now stands at about    trillion  very close to the actual national debt   since march  the treasury has been using financial  extraordinary measures  to stave off hitting the ceiling  once the ceiling is hit  congress must raise it  if it does not  the government cannot keep borrowing  this matters because the government spends more than it collects in taxes  that accounts for the federal budget deficit  so washington continually borrows money to cover its bills  the treasury has said that congress must increase the debt ceiling by sept    however  default likely could be staved off a few more weeks by extraordinary measures  analysts said   in any case  legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted  at the very latest  by mid october  they said  if the debt ceiling is not raised and the government can no longer pay its bills  default results  along with a likely downgrade in the u s  credit rating  political gridlock has never led to the united states  reaching its debt ceiling and its bills going unpaid  but there have been some close calls  a standoff in august  cost the country its top notch bond rating from the credit ratings agency standard   poor s and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the   global financial crisis  the two move on separate tracks  but are likely to get tangled  with republican opponents of increasing the debt ceiling probably demanding federal spending cuts  some analysts said congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time  perhaps in a single piece of legislation  both the spending and debt ceiling bills can pass the republican led house of representatives by a simple majority vote  but in the senate  where republicans hold  of  seats   votes are needed to pass  meaning the bills will need some democratic support   trump made his u s  mexico border wall a central promise of his  presidential campaign  he also promised that mexico would pay for it  but mexico has steadfastly refused to do so and trump has largely stopped talking about that pledge  conservative house republicans agree with the president on the need for a wall and say border wall funding should be a priority in any spending legislation  some have already indicated they are willing to shut down the government to get it  moderate republicans have called a shutdown unwise  and republican leaders are determined to prevent one  fearing it would worsen doubts about the party s ability to govern  democrats are uniformly opposed to trump s wall and say any blame for a shutdown would rest solely with republicans  the trump administration reversed course earlier this month and said it would back a  clean  raising of the debt ceiling  meaning it would not be tied to other policy measures  democrats and moderate republicans also support a clean debt ceiling increase  but conservative republicans  especially in the house  often use debt ceiling legislation to insist on changes to spending  making them opposed to a clean bill
