washington  reuters    in the trump white house  it s getting lonely at the top  president donald trump s fellow republicans in congress are showing signs of going their own way  both on politics and policy  determined to salvage what they can of their agenda on healthcare and tax reform in the wake of one of the most difficult weeks of any american presidency  at the same time  trump s failure to fill senior roles at federal agencies means he does not have a cadre of loyalists who can help rein in a bureaucracy that many in trump s orbit believe are out to leak information intended to damage the president  that has worsened the isolation of the white house in a city that relies on friends and allies to shake off a crisis  the result is problems on multiple fronts  a government whose bonds with congress  federal agencies and the public look increasingly fractured  an ambitious but stalled program of reforms  and a president whose low approval ratings threaten his party s control of congress in the  midterm elections  trump and his beleaguered staff  some white house aides told reuters  feel besieged by a parade of negative stories and abandoned by fellow republicans on capitol hill  as the furor over the firing of fbi director james comey and allegations that trump tried to influence the probe into russian meddling in last year s election show little sign of abating  since tuesday  when leaked excerpts of a purported memo by comey detailing his conversations with trump were made public  few republicans beyond the white house have rushed to the airwaves to push back against suggestions that the president may have obstructed justice in asking comey to end the probe into the conduct of former national security adviser michael flynn  as the russia probe entered a new phase on wednesday with the appointment of former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel in the investigation  a move that will likely place the white house under even stronger scrutiny  some republicans expressed surprise that the white house had not done more to recruit them to backstop the president   it s kind of funny  the answer is no   said senator james inhofe  a republican from oklahoma  when asked by reuters whether the white house had reached out to him to come to trump s defense   i don t know anyone else that has been contacted       the white house did not respond to a request for comment on this story  trump left on friday for his first foreign trip as president  the  day trip will take him to saudi arabia  israel  and europe      the administration has continued to struggle to fill the hundreds of open positions at senior levels of government that remain open  leaving the white house alone to grapple with one challenge after another  for example  the justice department still lacks senior officials in place to head up the anti trust  civil rights  criminal  and civil divisions  as well as the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives  according to its website  at the department of homeland security  the chiefs of the u s  customs and border protection  immigration and customs enforcement  and the transportation security administration  have yet to be confirmed  and at the department of education  a sprawling bureaucracy of   employees with a   billion budget   all the key roles except for the secretary remain empty or filled with people in an acting capacity   said a department of education official   nobody knows when or if they will be filled anytime soon   said the official  who declined to be identified by name  the department did not respond to a request for comment  trump has frequently complained that senate democrats have stalled the approval process for his nominees  but the white house has also been slower to send nominees to the senate than previous administrations  many top state department posts also remain vacant  one consequence  say several officials  is that department experts played little role in briefing trump for his telephone call to russian president vladimir putin or his meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ambassador sergei kislyak  where officials say he disclosed highly classified intelligence  state department and intelligence officials say that as power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few trump loyalists in the white house  the roles of professional foreign service  intelligence and civil service officers have shrunk compared to past administrations  for instance  said two u s  diplomats  no one from the state department attended trump s feb   meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu   a sharp contrast from past administrations which would typically staff such a high profile meeting with high level state department officials  asked for comment  the state department would not address the circumstances of the meeting with the russian officials in the oval office  but did speak to the efforts involving netanyahu and the middle east    as the president has repeatedly noted  middle east peace is a top priority for this administration   a department spokesperson said   this is an effort supported by both the white house and the state department  claims that the state department has not been involved have no basis in facts    overall  more than  of the  federal government positions requiring senate confirmation remain vacant  only  nominees have been confirmed  and only  other positions now have a nominee  according to the partnership for public service  a nonprofit  nonpartisan organization in washington      a lack of communication from the white house left many republicans on capitol hill frustrated as a sense of crisis mushroomed over the past week  one  richard burr  chairman of the senate intelligence committee  which is conducting its own russia probe  publicly complained about the situation  tuesday morning  after news broke the previous evening that trump had shared classified information with russian officials  burr said he couldn t get through to the white house  as the story lit up television news programs and buzzed online    maybe they re busy   he said  some republicans said the constant focus on responding to allegations concerning the russia probe was draining their caucus of focus and energy to push through their agenda  absent guidance  republican staff members in congress were beginning to devise their own strategy about how to respond to the gusher of bad news  one aide told reuters   and at the white house  with lines of communication to congress seemingly frayed at times  a narrowing circle of people has come to the president s defense  as senior staff grapple not only with the cascade of revelations but with a president who at times contradicts on twitter their talking points   everyone is just tired   said one white house aide
