 reuters    the u s  tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable  according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by reuters  with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it  a decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off u s  home values and led to a deep global recession  the housing market has bounced back smartly  u s  house prices are expected to rise next year and in   faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages  that is in sharp contrast to the outlook for britain   the s p case shiller composite index of u s  home prices in  metropolitan areas is expected to gain   percent next year and   percent in   the main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes  which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers  who tend to be young and not particularly well paid and  if university educated  already saddled with huge amounts of debt  now adding to those concerns is an effort by president donald trump s administration to overhaul the tax code  which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market  the republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to     down from the current   million  the house of representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on tuesday afternoon  and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said his chamber would vote on tuesday evening  twelve of  analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive  eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability   losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes   of having deductibility limited   makes housing less attractive and less affordable   said robert brusca  chief economist at fao economics  but he added   the trump congress plan is such a not well thought out mess it s hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way   asked to rate affordability on a scale of  being the cheapest and  the most expensive  the median answer was   while the latest consensus on u s  housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling  the range of forecasts has narrowed   we think there s a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth  housing affordability could take a turn for the worse   noted ralph mclaughlin  economist at trulia in san francisco    this is because the housing market has a supply  not a demand problem  so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are   another challenge has been lingering for years  while the unemployment rate has plunged to a  year low of   percent  annual wage growth has not broken above   percent since the great recession that ended about eight years ago   home prices have been appreciating circa   percent well above wage growth at    percent  decreasing affordability for the average buyer  particularly first time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities   said lindsey piegza  chief economist at stifel in chicago  she also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable   the latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis  existing home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of   million units in october  but well below the peak above  million units in    property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average     million  less than the   million unit pace hit in march  which was the highest since february    those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a reuters poll in august  but data on monday showed u s  single family homebuilding and permits rose in november to a level not seen since august  and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an    year high in december  in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints  the u s  federal reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year  while lifting short term rates won t necessarily push up longer term market rates  the path of least resistance is higher  still  the latest reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in august  the  year mortgage rate is expected to average   percent next year  rising to   percent in  and   percent in   analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the fed would significantly slow activity    if there are more than three hikes  it is likely that the fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up   and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates   said david berson  chief economist at nationwide insurance in columbus  ohio
