washington  reuters    high income wall street financiers could be unintended winners from a section of u s  president donald trump s tax cut plan that is meant to help mostly small   mom and pop  businesses  trump called on wednesday for a new  pass through  tax rate of  percent that could mean big savings for owners of sole proprietorships and partnerships who now pay   percent  but it could also mean a windfall for partners in private equity  venture capital and hedge funds  unless congress can figure out a way to block them from taking advantage of the new rate  ron wyden  top democrat on the tax writing senate finance committee  said democrats supported a pass through rate for small businesses  such as  a cleaner  a garage  a restaurant   he said trump s plan  however  would create  a whole new set of wealthy individuals being able to dodge their taxes through this new provision   at issue is the taxation of the roughly  percent of american businesses that are not public corporations  non public pass through businesses  such as sole proprietorships  limited liability companies and partnerships  pay no income tax themselves  instead their profits  pass through  directly to their owners  who pay tax on them at the individual tax rates  a small fraction of those business owners pay the top individual tax rate of   percent  higher than the current top corporate income tax rate of  percent  those business owners have long complained that the disparity is unfair  especially in view of the fact that many multinationals pay much less than the  percent statutory corporate tax rate by exploiting abundant loopholes and tax breaks available to large  global corporations  republicans have been eager to address the issue  trump s plan proposes a new tax rate of  percent for the pass through income of  small and family owned businesses   the problem  according to the plan s critics  is that financial entities such as private equity  venture capital and hedge funds are all partnerships whose wealthy partners would see substantial tax savings on large portions of their income unless congressional tax writers find a way to exclude them   good  versus  bad  pass through income the white house document that spelled out trump s plan signaled that the administration was aware of the potential problem but would leave addressing it up to congress  the document said   the framework contemplates that the  congressional tax  committees will adopt measures to prevent the recharacterization of personal income into business income to prevent wealthy individuals from avoiding the top personal tax rate   trump s plan also proposes cutting the top corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent and cutting the top individual tax rate to  percent from   percent  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said two weeks ago that the administration would ensure partners at services firms such as accounting  law and financial firms would not benefit from a new  lower pass through rate  a treasury department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the pass through rate or plans to exempt certain categories of firms  frank clemente  executive director of americans for tax fairness  a liberal advocacy group  said the idea that a new pass through rate would help small business was  simply a hoax   tax experts said it would be difficult for congressional tax writers to exempt partners at services firms from using the new pass through rate   there has always been talk of how to carve out  good  pass through income from  bad  pass through income  the problem is it s exceedingly hard to do and there is no way to draw clear lines that won t be manipulated   said seth hanlon with the center for american progress  a liberal group  victor fleischer  a law professor at the university of san diego  agreed it would be  challenging    still  i think it can probably be done   fleischer said
