washington  reuters    a republican backed senate rule change expected on thursday could make it more likely that presidents will pick ideologically extreme u s  supreme court nominees with little incentive to choose centrist justices  experts said  with a deep partisan divide in washington  democrats are using a procedural tactic called a filibuster to try to block confirmation of president donald trump s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch in the republican led senate  majority leader mitch mcconnell has threatened to change long standing rules in the  seat senate if the democrats succeed with the filibuster in order to prohibit the tactic against supreme court nominees  that would mean such nominees could be confirmed by a simple majority rather than needing to first muster a  vote super majority  experts said the rule change  called the  nuclear option   could produce an ever more ideologically polarized supreme court  over the years with the senate narrowly divided  the filibuster rule has meant that presidents have needed to make appointments who could win at least a few votes from the other party  for the court  the prospect of a filibuster has shaped the way presidents pick nominees  said stephen wermiel  a supreme court scholar at the american university washington college of law   although it has not been widely used  the idea that it was there as a deterrent to presidents appointing justices who might be considered extreme has been a significant factor   wermiel said   republican senator john mccain  a defender of senate traditions  warned of the consequences of the rule change  though he said he would reluctantly support the move   we will see more and more nominees from the extremes of both left and right   mccain said   i do not see how that will ensure a fair and impartial judiciary  in fact  i think the opposite will be true  and americans will no longer be confident of equal protection under the law   republican senator lindsay graham said supreme court  nominees  are going to be more ideological  not less  with the rule change  which he warily supported  the nuclear option would erase  the last shred of bipartisanship in the senate confirmation process   said senate democratic leader chuck schumer  who led the filibuster against gorsuch  elimination of the filibuster for supreme court nominees could matter most with the next vacancy on the nine seat court after gorsuch  who was nominated by trump to replace justice antonin scalia  who died last year  three current justices are  or older  liberal ruth bader ginsburg is   conservative anthony kennedy  who sometimes sides with the court s liberals in big cases  is   and liberal stephen breyer is   having more justices who are ideologically extreme would make compromise among them harder and lead to rulings the public may view as based more on a political agenda than the law  said university of massachusetts  amherst political science professor paul collins  co author of a book on supreme court confirmation hearings   if confirmed as expected on friday  gorsuch would restore the court s   conservative majority  overturning the landmark  roe v  wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide may become more likely if there is no filibuster to moderate the choice of future court nominees  wermiel said  without a filibuster  a future democratic president with a democratic led senate could feel free to name a justice from the dogmatic left  the result would be a court even more polarized than the current one already is perceived to be  said brookings institution think tank expert russell wheeler said   an ideologically driven administration would eschew middle of the road judges   wheeler said   they would stack the court with ideological soulmates   trump advisor leonard leo said the best way to avoid extreme nominees is through the electoral process  trump made it clear during the  presidential campaign he would pick from a list of potential supreme court nominees that he made public  and the voters elected trump  leo said    people knew or should have known what they were getting when he was elected president   leo said
