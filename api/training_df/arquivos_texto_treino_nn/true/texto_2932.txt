washington  reuters    president donald trump s administration has dropped plans for an executive order that will require all u s  food aid to be transported on american ships after members of congress protested  congressional and aid sources said on friday  reuters reported on thursday that trump was considering issuing an order that would have increased to  percent the current requirement that  percent of such aid be transported on u s  flagged vessels  senator bob corker  the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  stopped short of confirming information about the order but said he had discussed the issue with trump and that he understands that the shift would have increased the cost of food aid and caused more people to starve   i had a good conversation today with president trump   corker said in a statement emailed to reuters   as a businessman  he understands that expanding the cargo preference would substantially drive up the cost of food aid and cause more people to starve around the world   corker said  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment  although unlikely to have any significant effect on the   trillion global cargo shipping industry  the initiative originally touted as part of trump s  america first  platform might have slowed food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs  critics said  aid groups  and members of congress from both parties have been working for years to lower  or eliminate  the  percent shipping requirement  the united states  the world s largest provider of humanitarian assistance  spent about    billion on foreign food aid in   about half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage  the conservative leaning american enterprise institute said in a november report that shipping food aid on u s  flagged vessels costs  percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as  weeks longer  jeremy konyndyk  a former director of usaid s office of u s  foreign disaster assistance  welcomed the administration s decision to drop the order   konyndyk  a senior policy fellow at the washington based center for global development  said that with four potential famines in the world  it would have been the worst possible moment to be shifting money out of hungry mouths and into subsidies for big shipping conglomerates   corker has been pushing for years to reform the u s  food aid program  including by eliminating the cargo preference  he said in his statement he looked forward to working with congress and the administration to achieve  long overdue reforms   after hearing about the possible executive order  several members of congress called the white house to express their concern  congressional aides said   the administration s budget proposal has suggested slashing foreign aid in general while increasing defense spending  that plan was also met with stiff opposition in congress  as lawmakers argued that  soft power  options such as food and medical aid and disaster recovery assistance can be effective tools in foreign policy that should not be discounted  supporters say trump s initiative would not only create new u s  jobs in the shipping industry but that u s  controlled food shipments are important for national security because the u s  fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict   food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow  critics argue  while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the  century military  they said the costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower cost international carriers  requiring more u s  taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people
