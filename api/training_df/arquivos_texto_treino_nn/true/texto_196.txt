washington  reuters    u s  house republicans proposed on tuesday to delay or suspend several taxes under former president barack obama s healthcare law  including a tax on medical devices and the so called  cadillac  tax on generous health insurance plans  the move represents a new republican attempt to roll back provisions of the  affordable care act widely known as obamacare  after repeated failures by congress  majority party this year to repeal the law  republicans in the house and senate are also in the final stages of reconciling tax overhaul legislation  including a proposal to scrap obamacare s individual mandate  which imposes a tax penalty on americans who do not obtain health insurance   a spokeswoman for the house ways and means committee said the additional proposed healthcare tax rollbacks would not be part of the broader tax overhaul bill  republicans could try to merge the healthcare tax proposals with a must pass government funding bill that is expected to be passed by dec    when current funding runs out  but to succeed  republicans in the senate  who hold a slim majority of seats  would need an assist from democrats to get past procedural hurdles   in a statement  house ways and means chairman kevin brady announced five new republican sponsored bills to provide targeted relief from obamacare taxes  saying he looked forward to  advancing legislation in the weeks ahead   one proposed bill would retroactively eliminate obamacare penalties for employers who did not offer health insurance to their employees over the last three years  as well as for next year  the bill would also delay for one year the cadillac tax on high cost employer sponsored insurance  which is otherwise scheduled to go into effect in   labor unions oppose this tax because their members often receive more generous healthcare plans  and they fear it would increase their costs  another bill would suspend for five years the tax on medical devices  such as pacemakers and artificial hips  it was first imposed in january  as a funding mechanism for obamacare  a law that has brought medical coverage to millions of previously uninsured americans  the medical device tax has powerful opponents in both parties and manufacturers have lobbied heavily against it  other proposals in the package would suspend a tax on health insurers for two years  and provide two years of relief from a tax on over the counter medications
