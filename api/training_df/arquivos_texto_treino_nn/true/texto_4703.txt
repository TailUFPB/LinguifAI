 reuters    wall street s predilection for a glass half full view of president donald trump was on full display friday as investors backed off fears that a failure to repeal obamacare would endanger trump s entire agenda in favor of optimism that he would simply get on with tax cuts and infrastructure spending  as the clock ticked down to a close vote in the house of representatives set tentatively for friday afternoon  u s  stocks were little changed even as it appeared that the republican leadership had yet to secure the support needed to pass the measure   that was in stark contrast with earlier in the week when equities suffered their biggest one day drop since the november election on grounds that the shaky prospects for a successful repeal of the affordable care act   known popularly as obamacare   was a litmus test for everything championed by trump   i think investors are of the belief that trump is just going to pivot to taxes   said paul nolte  portfolio manager at kingsview asset management in chicago   i think it s a pivot from what we saw on tuesday   indeed  trump delivered lawmakers an ultimatum late thursday  saying the time for negotiation had ended and that he was willing to leave the aca in place and get on with his other priorities  s p e mini futures rallied about   percent in overnight trading following the statement   if this goes on the back burner  and they start addressing corporate tax rates or infrastructure  that would be a positive for the market because the administration is not going to look at this and say   hey  this thing is going to take a while   they want to win   said bucky hellwig  senior vice president at bb t wealth management in birmingham  alabama    so they will go on to something that they could get through more quickly  which will be beneficial to the market   hellwig said  u s  stocks have rallied hard since trump was elected on nov    with the benchmark s p  gaining around  percent in that span  most of the gains have come as investors embraced prospects for the pro growth and pro business agenda trump touted during his campaign  but more recently  doubts have arisen over trump s ability to deliver on the agenda as the effort to repeal obamacare grew more rancorous  stocks have drifted sideways for the last several weeks  even amid the more sanguine mood on friday as the vote approached  not all investors were ready to embrace the notion that a failure to repeal obamacare could be so readily overlooked given how far the market has come since the election   if the republicans cannot settle their own conservative moderate division on healthcare then that divide will be exacerbated for any other issue they attempt   said joseph trevisani  chief market strategist at worldwide markets in woodcliff lake  new jersey  still  with less than about  minutes to go to the house vote  there was little evidence of the angst evident earlier in the week when investors saw the vote as a clear pass fail test for trump s agenda    i think what trump did by saying that they are going to take a vote and if it doesn t go they will move on to the next item is kind of a positive thing  because i think the more important things are fiscal stimulus and tax reform   tom tucci  head of treasuries trading at cibc in new york said   i know a lot of people are saying this will foreshadow the battle there  but i think there s a lot more support on that end
