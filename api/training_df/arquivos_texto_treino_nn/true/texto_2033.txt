jerusalem  reuters    u s  president donald trump remains committed and optimistic about achieving israeli palestinian peace  his son in law and senior adviser told the sides on thursday during his first visit to the region since last month s surge of violence   but there was little to suggest any breakthrough or significant progress toward ending a decades old conflict is imminent as kushner met separately with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas  palestinians were still seeking a pledge of support from the trump administration for the creation of a palestinian state alongside israel   the foundation of u s  middle east policy for the past two decades  the last round of peace talks between the two sides collapsed in   for his part  netanyahu faces pressure from right wing coalition partners not to give ground on jewish settlement building in occupied territory that palestinians seek for a independent state  the settlement issue contributed to the breakdown of negotiations three years ago   we have things to talk about   how to advance peace  stability and security in our region  prosperity too  and i think that all of them are within our reach   netanyahu  welcoming kushner to his tel aviv office  said in a video clip released by the u s  embassy  kushner  a  year old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation   arrived in israel with u s  middle east envoy jason greenblatt on wednesday after meeting arab leaders in the gulf  egypt and jordan       the president is very committed to achieving a solution here that will be able to bring prosperity and peace to all people in this area   kushner  who was tasked by trump to help broker a peace deal  said in his response to netanyahu  meeting abbas later in the west bank city of ramallah  kushner said trump sought  peaceful relations between the countries in the whole region  and was  very optimistic and hopeful for a better future for all palestinian people and israeli people   according to a statement from abbas s office    trump has described peace between israelis and palestinians as  the ultimate deal    and added a new wrinkle last february by saying he was not fixed on two states co existing side by side as a solution to their dispute  kushner last traveled to israel and the palestnian territories in june  a month later  he was involved in telephone diplomacy to stem palestinian and jordanian unrest over israel s handling of a contested jerusalem holy site  four palestinians  three israelis and two jordanians were killed during the crisis   abbas spokesman nabil abu rdainah said kushner s visit could prove significant  particularly because of the envoy s consultations with regional allies this week   this may create a new chance to reach a settlement based on the two state solution and the arab initiative and stop the current deterioration of the peace process   abu rdainah was referring to a  arab league initiative that offers israel diplomatic recognition from arab countries in return for a statehood deal with the palestinians and a full israeli withdrawal from territory captured in a  war  netanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the blueprint  but there are many caveats on the israeli side  including how to resolve the complex palestinian refugee issue  the statement from abbas s office quoted the palestinian president as telling kushner   we know things are difficult and complicated but nothing is impossible when efforts are sincere
