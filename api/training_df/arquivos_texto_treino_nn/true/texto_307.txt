washington  reuters    democrats have a rare chance to win major concessions in a u s  congress they do not control by taking advantage of a battle within the republican party over keeping the government open   with a friday deadline looming when most funding for federal agencies runs out  democrats finally have some clout  but their power is strongest while the republicans in congress remain fractured and fighting   the showdown with republicans could come to a head on thursday when democrats are expected to press their demands to president donald trump at a white house meeting  for trump  the complex  and very public  battle over the shutdown will also be a demonstration of his ability to deliver on a central  campaign promise of adding billions of dollars to the u s  military budget  that issue is at the core of republicans  behind the scenes negotiations with democrats  most republicans want a defense buildup  but many also want to limit government spending  while many democrats also support bolstering defense  they insist on raising spending on non defense programs too   democrats  top two demands include passage of legislation that has eluded them for  years  protecting from deportation nearly   young people known as  dreamers   whose parents brought them illegally to the united states as children  the democrats also want to shore up obamacare by reversing trump s decision to stop monthly subsidy payments to insurance companies offering healthcare policies to lower income people  democrats will enter the white house meeting knowing their support is crucial to senate republicans passing any spending bills  republicans control the chamber by    but need  vote for passage of most spending measures  while a partial government shutdown would keep emergency services and the military mainly operating  thousands of operations would be suspended  such as the operation of national parks  republicans have clear control of the house of representatives  but a core of conservative republicans who consistently vote against funding bills in their drive for smaller government could balk  democrats have a history of strongly supporting stopgap funding bills  providing the cushion for victory in the republican house  conservative republicans said on tuesday they would try to pass temporary spending bills without house democrats  support  if so  it is unclear whether such a bill could clear the senate  where democratic votes are necessary to pass most bills    there is another wild card for both parties in thursday s meeting  trump  democrats will test the unpredictable president to see whether he is willing to go the bipartisan route in order to keep federal agencies running smoothly or whether he will be in a confrontational mood  in may  angry he did not win money to build his promised wall along the border with mexico  trump said the united states needed a  good shutdown  to force his agenda on congress  just last week  he wrote on twitter about the spending bills   i don t see a deal   democrats are counting on the bipartisan trump showing up  betting that he and fellow republicans in congress do not want to leave the immigration legislation  popularly known as the dreamers act  to fester until a march deadline  so close to the  congressional election season  chuck schumer  senate minority leader  and nancy pelosi  house minority leader  are calculating that voters  wrath would rain down on republicans if the government lights go out  republicans would blame democrats  at a news conference last thursday  house speaker paul ryan said that if democrats vote against the temporary spending bill because they have not won their demands   then they will have chosen to shut the government down   republicans already are trying to exploit possible differences among democrats over whether to link support for the stopgap spending bill to the immigration measure  democratic senator dianne feinstein said she expected democrats to vote for the government funding bill this week  telling reuters in an interview that while it  is important to all of us  to take care of the dreamers   i don t think we should shut the government down   senator dick durbin  the chamber s no   democrat  told the washington post last week he would oppose any spending bill if congress had not first taken care of the dreamers  on tuesday  schumer noted there were  good negotiations  under way on the immigration measure  this week s vote to keep the government operating on temporary funding is likely to be the first of a three step process that could stretch to jan    a second step would be another short term funding bill  followed by one to fund the government through the fiscal year ending sept
