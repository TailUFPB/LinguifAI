washington  reuters    the republican chairman of the u s  senate foreign relations committee said on monday that if the house of representatives does not pass a russian sanctions bill  it is because members do not want to impose new sanctions  not because of a procedural issue cited by republican leaders in the house    there is no issue  except do they want to pass a russia sanctions bill or not   senator bob corker told reporters at the u s  senate  the senate passed the sanctions measure by   on june   but it has been stalled in the house  where president donald trump s fellow republicans hold a larger majority than in the senate  house republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the house  not the senate  they also blamed democrats for holding it up  democrats  and some republicans  scoffed  they said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the house in a matter of minutes  trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get congress  permission before easing any sanctions  and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory  so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons  some republicans have also echoed concerns raised by u s  energy firms and european governments that the legislation could complicate investment in russian energy projects  and potentially cost industry jobs  corker said the bill was written to allow the trump administration to address energy related issues  and he said any white house would prefer to conduct foreign policy without congress  but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill   no one has called me and said   we don t want this legislation to pass   that has never occurred   corker said  lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure  the senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on june   with a  fix  to address the procedural issue  but it has still not been taken up by the house  house republicans said on monday that the senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the senate would have to change it and vote again
