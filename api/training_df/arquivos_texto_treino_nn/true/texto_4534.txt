washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on friday backed a decision by his former national security adviser to seek immunity in congressional investigations of possible ties between his election campaign and russia  but there was no immediate sign a request would be granted  retired general michael flynn  who resigned only  days after becoming national security adviser  wants protection against  unfair prosecution  if he testifies before the intelligence committees of the u s  senate and the house of representatives  his lawyer  robert kelner  said on thursday  testimony from flynn could help shed light on the conversations he had last year with sergei kislyak  russian ambassador to the united states  while national security adviser for trump s presidential campaign  u s  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee  said it was too soon to consider immunity requests   as with any investigation   and particularly one that grows in severity and magnitude by the day   there is still much work and many more witnesses and documents to obtain before any immunity request from any witness can be considered   he said in a statement  schiff said the house intelligence panel would discuss any request with the justice department and the senate intelligence committee  describing such a request  a grave and momentous step   schiff on friday was allowed to see documents at the white house that previously had been seen only by the republican chairman of the intelligence committee  trump  a republican  said in a tweet that democrats were instigating the congressional investigations because they were upset about his nov   victory over their party s candidate  hillary clinton   mike flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt  excuse for big election loss   by media   dems  of historic proportion   trump said  trump would not comment further when asked about flynn during a white house meeting with u s  manufacturers  white house spokesman sean spicer was asked at a news briefing if he was concerned that flynn could provide information that could be harmful to the administration and replied   nope   he said trump wanted flynn to testify to  get this matter behind us  but declined to say specifically that he should be granted immunity   the president is very clear that he wants mike flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee  and whatever it takes to do that he is supportive of   spicer said  schiff and an aide went to the white house on friday at the administration s invitation to review documents that it said  support trump s contention he and his team were subjected to surveillance by the obama administration during the presidential campaign  the republican chairman of the house intelligence committee  devin nunes  has been criticized by his colleagues on the panel  for his handling of the investigation of possible russian connections  including going to the white house complex independently to review documents on the purported surveillance   while i cannot discuss the content of the documents   schiff said   if the white house had any concern over these materials  they should have been shared with the full  house and senate intelligence  committees in the first place as a part of our ordinary oversight responsibilities   he said the material should now be given to both congressional intelligence committees  fbi director james comey has said there is no evidence of wiretapping at trump tower in new york but that the agency is investigating whether the trump campaign colluded with russia  senator angus king  a member of the senate intelligence committee  also said it was too soon to discuss immunity  a government official with direct knowledge of the case told reuters that lawyers for flynn raised the immunity request roughly  days ago with representatives of the senate panel  officials told them the committee was not interested in any immunity discussions at that time  the wall street journal reported on friday that flynn had also sought immunity from the federal bureau of investigation in exchange for testimony  flynn was forced to resign on feb   for failing to disclose talks with kislyak about u s  sanctions on moscow and misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations  which occurred before trump took office  congressional committees and the fbi are looking into allegations by u s  intelligence agencies that russia meddled in the  u s  election campaign  the russian government has denied the allegations and denied that it hacked emails of democratic groups and released information to tip the election toward trump  who has called for better u s  relations with moscow  king  an independent who caucuses with the democrats  defended the investigations in a cnn interview   this is not a witch hunt   he said   this is an effort to get to the truth of some very important questions   there is no doubt whatsoever that the russians were behind an effort to interfere in our elections   he said   to continue to deny that   it just flies in the face of all of the reality
