 reuters    former manhattan u s  attorney preet bharara took several shots at the administration of president donald trump on thursday  calling for  facts not falsehoods  as the basis for political discourse and a more welcoming stance towards immigrants in his first public speaking event since being fired one month ago  bharara sprinkled the hour long speech with humor  including a joke about the size of the crowd clearly aimed at trump  but bharara also made a series of thinly veiled criticisms of the new administration  referring multiple times to trump s campaign pledge to  drain the swamp  in washington   you don t drain a swamp with a slogan  you don t drain it by replacing one set of partisans with another  you don t replace muck with muck   bharara    said at the cooper union in new york    to drain a swamp you need an army corps of engineers  experts schooled in service and serious purpose  not do nothing  say anything  neophyte opportunists who know a lot about how to bully and bluster but not so much about truth  justice and fairness    bharara was fired by trump on march  after refusing to step down  while he was among  u s  attorneys told to submit their resignations  his dismissal was a surprise because trump had asked him in november to stay in the job  bharara has said it was not made clear to him at first whether or not he was being dismissed  he joked about that initial confusion with a reference to trump s tv reality show in which he regularly fired people on the spot   i don t really understand why this was such a big deal  especially to this white house  i had thought that was what donald trump was good at   bharara said   as the chief federal prosecutor for the southern district of new york  bharara oversaw several notable corruption and white collar criminal cases  as well as cases involving national security  he said he was equally proud of the less high profile work his office did to combat gangs and consumer fraud  bharara said he expected his successor to carry on with the office s reputation for independence  he did not comment on who his possible successor  as for his own future  bharara ruled out running for public office   i don t have any plans to enter politics just like i have no plans to join the circus  and i mean no offence to the circus
