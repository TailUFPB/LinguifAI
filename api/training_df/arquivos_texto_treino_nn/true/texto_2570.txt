washington  reuters    long delayed legislation to impose new sanctions on russia hit another snag on monday when the influential republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said the announcement of a deal to move the bill forward was premature   we still have a little work to do   senator bob corker told reporters at the u s  senate  he said he expected differences could be resolved quickly but declined to give a specific timeframe  republicans and democrats in the house of representatives and senate democrats had announced on saturday that they had reached an agreement that would allow a vote on the sanctions bill in the house on tuesday  house aides said the bill is expected to pass overwhelmingly  but corker said the announcement of a deal  seemed somewhat premature    it s not quite done  but it feels like it s moving to a good place   corker said  he said issues included north korea sanctions that were added to a bill including sanctions on iran and russia that passed the senate overwhelmingly in june  he said senate and house staff members were still discussing the measure   it s very  very close   he said  an earlier version of the bill  including sanctions on russia and iran  passed the senate   on june   but it never came up for a vote in the house  after president donald trump s administration objected to provisions including a requirement that he obtain congress  approval before easing any sanctions on moscow  trump s relationship with russia has been a focus of the first six months of his presidency after he called for warmer relations with moscow while campaigning and amid an investigation of whether his associates colluded with russian hackers to influence the election on his behalf  the new sanctions bill is the latest in a series of efforts by members of congress to prevent trump from easing sanctions on moscow  the new version of the measure announced on saturday added sanctions on north korea but left intact most provisions of the bill passed by the senate  including the congressional review provision  corker said he had been in touch with the administration since saturday but declined to elaborate beyond saying he thought officials had come to a  fuller understanding  of the measure  on monday  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump would examine whether the bill was offering the  best deal  for the american people and then decide whether he would support it
