washington  reuters    near the end of president donald trump s rocky first year in office  white house aides view imminent victory on a tax overhaul as a starting point to strengthen his weak approval ratings ahead of key congressional elections next november  some republicans said any effort at a political turnaround must include reining in trump s habit of lashing out at critics on twitter  white house aides said they recognized that trump s poll numbers needed to start rising to limit the damage in  elections in which his fellow republicans  continued control of congress will be at stake  a democratic takeover of the house of representatives and senate could jeopardize trump s agenda   we have to grow  we have to move up  and i think having more successes like the tax vote will be important to us   said a senior white house official  administration officials said trump would seek to use momentum generated from the biggest tax rewrite in  years to help propel other legislative priorities  including an infrastructure program and welfare reform  final passage of the republican tax bill is expected on wednesday in what would be trump s first major legislative victory since taking office in january  but the tax bill carries risks  republicans insist it will boost the economy and job growth  democrats condemn it as a giveaway to corporations and the rich  in a reuters ipsos poll  some  percent of adults said they opposed the tax plan  while  percent supported it  unless trump practices greater discipline  some republican strategists see disaster looming in the congressional elections  in which a third of the  member senate and all  seats in the house will be up for grabs   stop tweeting and start the new year with a new level of message discipline  just try it  it ll work  and you ll get those poll numbers back up   said republican strategist scott reed   they ve got to focus on that job approval number because it s a historic death watch for midterm elections  the record is strong  his discipline is key for year two   reed said  trump has repeatedly caused controversy with early morning tweets  particularly those aimed at individuals  he raised hackles recently when he tweeted that democratic senator kirsten gillibrand  would do anything  for campaign donations   there are definitely moments that we d all like to see stop   one senior aide said   some of the early morning stuff has not been helpful over the last few weeks   there has been some talk in the white house and among trump s outside advisers about hiring a senior political adviser akin to former president barack obama s political aide david axelrod or former president george w  bush s adviser karl rove  the white house political director  bill stepien  is seen as a more data driven adviser  trump  who sees himself as his own strategist  does not have anyone steeped in politics like his former white house chief of staff  reince priebus  or former chief strategist steve bannon  aides said there was some discussion of getting trump into events with smaller settings in order to show a more personal side of the president  his standard appearance is to go to an event  deliver a speech to a big crowd and leave     trump is up against a historical trend in which the party that holds the white house typically loses seats in the first congressional elections after a president s initial two years in office   democratic president bill clinton had a  percent approval rating in november  and his party still lost  seats in the house and eight in the senate  trump was at  percent in a mid december poll from nbc news and the wall street journal  republican strategist ford o connell said trump had done much to keep his conservative base of support happy but had to expand his popularity  to do that  he needs to ease voters  concerns about his fitness for office   what he has to do to win over people like independents and never trumpers is make the american people feel comfortable with him as president   said o connell   his achievements are quite striking  but he s just not connecting  with the public
