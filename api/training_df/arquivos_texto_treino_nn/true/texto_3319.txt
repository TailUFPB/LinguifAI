 reuters    following is the full text of former fbi director james comey s testimony as prepared for delivery to the u s  senate intelligence committee  comey is scheduled to testify at  a m    gmt  on thursday as part of the committee s investigation into u s  intelligence agency allegations that russia tried to interfere with the  presidential election and potential collusion by president donald trump s campaign  russia has denied the allegations and trump denies any collusion   the committee posted comey s opening statement on its website on wednesday   chairman burr  ranking member warner  members of the committee  thank you for inviting me to appear before you today  i was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with president elect and president trump on subjects that i understand are of interest to you  i have not included every detail from my conversations with the president  but  to the best of my recollection  i have tried to include information that may be relevant to the committee  january  briefing  i first met then president elect trump on friday  january  in a conference room at trump tower in new york  i was there with other intelligence community  ic  leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an ic assessment concerning russian efforts to interfere in the election  at the conclusion of that briefing  i remained alone with the president elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment   the ic leadership thought it important  for a variety of reasons  to alert the incoming president to the existence of this material  even though it was salacious and unverified  among those reasons were     we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the ic should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the president elect  and    to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming president  we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing   the director of national intelligence asked that i personally do this portion of the briefing because i was staying in my position and because the material implicated the fbi s counter intelligence responsibilities  we also agreed i would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the president elect  although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing  the fbi s leadership and i were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new president came into office uncertain about whether the fbi was conducting a counter intelligence investigation of his personal conduct   it is important to understand that fbi counter intelligence investigations are different than the more commonly known criminal investigative work  the bureau s goal in a counter intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the united states or to steal our secrets  the fbi uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts  sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power  sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked  sometimes it involves  turning  the recruited person into a double agent  or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of embassy based intelligence officers  on occasion  criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities   because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known  counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the fbi suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power  when the fbi develops reason to believe an american has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power  the fbi will  open an investigation  on that american and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted   in that context  prior to the january  meeting  i discussed with the fbi s leadership team whether i should be prepared to assure president elect trump that we were not investigating him personally  that was true  we did not have an open counter intelligence case on him  we agreed i should do so if circumstances warranted  during our one on one meeting at trump tower  based on president elect trump s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question  i offered that assurance   i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president elect in a memo  to ensure accuracy  i began to type it on a laptop in an fbi vehicle outside trump tower the moment i walked out of the meeting  creating written records immediately after one on one conversations with mr  trump was my practice from that point forward  this had not been my practice in the past  i spoke alone with president obama twice in person  and never on the phone    once in  to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time  briefly  for him to say goodbye in late   in neither of those circumstances did i memorialize the discussions  i can recall nine one on one conversations with president trump in four months   three in person and six on the phone  january  dinner  the president and i had dinner on friday  january  at   pm in the green room at the white house  he had called me at lunchtime that day and  invited me to dinner that night  saying he was going to invite my whole family  but decided to have just me this time  with the whole family coming the next time  it was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner  although i assumed there would be others   it turned out to be just the two of us  seated at a small oval table in the center of the green room  two navy stewards waited on us  only entering the room to serve food and drinks   the president began by asking me whether i wanted to stay on as fbi director  which i found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped i would stay  and i had assured him that i intended to   he said that lots of people wanted my job and  given the abuse i had taken during the previous year  he would understand if i wanted to walk away   my instincts told me that the one on one setting  and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position  meant the dinner was  at least in part  an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship  that concerned me greatly  given the fbi s traditionally independent status in the executive branch   i replied that i loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten year term as director  and then  because the set up made me uneasy  i added that i was not  reliable  in the way politicians use that word  but he could always count on me to tell him the truth  i added that i was not on anybody s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense  a stance i said was in his best interest as the president   a few moments later  the president said   i need loyalty  i expect loyalty   i didn t move  speak  or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed  we simply looked at each other in silence  the conversation then moved on  but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner   at one point  i explained why it was so important that the fbi and the department of justice be independent of the white house  i said it was a paradox  throughout history  some presidents have decided that because  problems  come from justice  they should try to hold the department close  but blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work   near the end of our dinner  the president returned to the subject of my job  saying he was very glad i wanted to stay  adding that he had heard great things about me from jim mattis  jeff sessions  and many others  he then said   i need loyalty   i replied   you will always get honesty from me   he paused and then said   that s what i want  honest loyalty   i paused  and then said   you will get that from me   as i wrote in the memo i created immediately after the dinner  it is possible we understood the phrase  honest loyalty  differently  but i decided it wouldn t be productive to push it further  the term   honest loyalty   had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect   during the dinner  the president returned to the salacious material i had briefed him about on january   and  as he had done previously  expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them  he said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn t happen  i replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally  which we weren t  and because it was very difficult to prove a negative  he said he would think about it and asked me to think about it   as was my practice for conversations with president trump  i wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the fbi  february  oval office meeting  on february   i went to the oval office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the president  he sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a semi circle of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk  the vice president  deputy director of the cia  director of the national counter terrorism center  secretary of homeland security  the attorney general  and i were in the semi circle of chairs  i was directly facing the president  sitting between the deputy cia director and the director of nctc  there were quite a few others in the room  sitting behind us on couches and chairs   the president signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone  i stayed in my chair  as the participants started to leave the oval office  the attorney general lingered by my chair  but the president thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me  the last person to leave was jared kushner  who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me  the president then excused him  saying he wanted to speak with me   when the door by the grandfather clock closed  and we were alone  the president began by saying   i want to talk about mike flynn   flynn had resigned the previous day  the president began by saying flynn hadn t done anything wrong in speaking with the russians  but he had to let him go because he had misled the vice president  he added that he had other concerns about flynn  which he did not then specify   the president then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information   a concern i shared and still share  after he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks  reince priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and i could see a group of people waiting behind him  the president waved at him to close the door  saying he would be done shortly  the door closed   the president then returned to the topic of mike flynn  saying   he is a good guy and has been through a lot   he repeated that flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the russians  but had misled the vice president  he then said   i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go  to letting flynn go  he is a good guy  i hope you can let this go   i replied only that  he is a good guy    in fact  i had a positive experience dealing with mike flynn when he was a colleague as director of the defense intelligence agency at the beginning of my term at fbi   i did not say i would  let this go    the president returned briefly to the problem of leaks  i then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock  making my way through the large group of people waiting there  including mr  priebus and the vice president   i immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about flynn and discussed the matter with fbi senior leadership  i had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the russian ambassador in december  i did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into russia or possible links to his campaign  i could be wrong  but i took him to be focusing on what had just happened with flynn s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls  regardless  it was very concerning  given the fbi s role as an independent investigative agency   the fbi leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the president s request  which we did not intend to abide  we also concluded that  given that it was a one on one conversation  there was nothing available to corroborate my account  we concluded it made little sense to report it to attorney general sessions  who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in russia related investigations   he did so two weeks later   the deputy attorney general s role was then filled in an acting capacity by a united states attorney  who would also not be long in the role  after discussing the matter  we decided to keep it very closely held  resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed  the investigation moved ahead at full speed  with none of the investigative team members   or the department of justice lawyers supporting them   aware of the president s request   shortly afterwards  i spoke with attorney general sessions in person to pass along the president s concerns about leaks  i took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me  i told the ag that what had just happened   him being asked to leave while the fbi director  who reports to the ag  remained behind   was inappropriate and should never happen  he did not reply  for the reasons discussed above  i did not mention that the president broached the fbi s potential investigation of general flynn  march  phone call  on the morning of march   the president called me at the fbi  he described the russia investigation as  a cloud  that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country  he said he had nothing to do with russia  had not been involved with hookers in russia  and had always assumed he was being recorded when in russia  he asked what we could do to  lift the cloud   i responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could  and that there would be great benefit  if we didn t find anything  to our having done the work well  he agreed  but then re emphasized the problems this was causing him   then the president asked why there had been a congressional hearing about russia the previous week   at which i had  as the department of justice directed  confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between russia and the trump campaign  i explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in congress for more information  and that senator grassley had even held up the confirmation of the deputy attorney general until we briefed him in detail on the investigation  i explained that we had briefed the leadership of congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating president trump  i reminded him i had previously told him that   he repeatedly told me   we need to get that fact out    i did not tell the president that the fbi and the department of justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on president trump for a number of reasons  most importantly because it would create a duty to correct  should that change    the president went on to say that if there were some  satellite  associates of his who did something wrong  it would be good to find that out  but that he hadn t done anything wrong and hoped i would find a way to get it out that we weren t investigating him   in an abrupt shift  he turned the conversation to fbi deputy director andrew mccabe  saying he hadn t brought up  the mccabe thing  because i had said mccabe was honorable  although mcauliffe was close to the clintons and had given him  i think he meant deputy director mccabe s wife  campaign money  although i didn t understand why the president was bringing this up  i repeated that mr  mccabe was an honorable person   he finished by stressing  the cloud  that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped i could find a way to get out that he wasn t being investigated  i told him i would see what we could do  and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could   immediately after that conversation  i called acting deputy attorney general dana boente  ag sessions had by then recused himself on all russia related matters   to report the substance of the call from the president  and said i would await his guidance  i did not hear back from him before the president called me again two weeks later  april  phone call  on the morning of april   the president called me and asked what i had done about his request that i  get out  that he is not personally under investigation  i replied that i had passed his request to the acting deputy attorney general  but i had not heard back  he replied that  the cloud  was getting in the way of his ability to do his job  he said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the acting deputy attorney general  i said that was the way his request should be handled  i said the white house counsel should contact the leadership of doj to make the request  which was the traditional channel   he said he would do that and added   because i have been very loyal to you  very loyal  we had that thing you know   i did not reply or ask him what he meant by  that thing   i said only that the way to handle it was to have the white house counsel call the acting deputy attorney general  he said that was what he would do and the call ended   that was the last time i spoke with president trump
