new york  reuters    planned parenthood  the national health organization that would have lost federal funding under sweeping healthcare overhaul legislation  views the withdrawal of the bill on friday as a temporary reprieve  not the end of a threat to its existence  officials of the organization   long a target of those who oppose its abortion services   anticipate further attempts by republicans to curb its participation in federally funded public health programs  a major source of its funding  in a major setback for republican president donald trump  u s  house of representatives leaders pulled the healthcare bill after a rebellion by republican moderates and the party s most conservative lawmakers left them short of votes  democrats were unified against it   planned parenthood leaders will meet in washington next week to plan their strategy for coming rounds in what they see as a protracted fight   it s one good night s sleep  and then we have to see what they are going to cook up   chris charbonneau  chief executive of planned parenthood of the great northwest and the hawaiian islands  said in a phone interview   they re trying to find some vehicle that they could hook some planned parenthood defund ing  to   many republicans oppose the organization  some on religious grounds  because its healthcare services include abortions  although it receives no federal funding or reimbursement for abortions  as stipulated by federal law   the federal funding it receives is primarily through reimbursement via medicaid and the title x family planning grant program for its care for low income patients  abortion opponents said republican leaders had promised for years to end federal reimbursement for planned parenthood  and that voters would continue to hold them to this  before winning the presidential election in november  trump had also promised to defund planned parenthood  and fought to get the healthcare bill passed   i m confident the republicans in congress and the president will move ahead and defund planned parenthood   said joe pojman  executive director of the anti abortion texas alliance for life  the issue  is so dear to the electorate who put the republicans and president in office   he said after the bill was pulled  on the other side of the issue  georges benjamin  the american public health association s executive director  welcomed the withdrawal of the legislation  and said the renewed public attention on planned parenthood may make future efforts to limit its funding more difficult   i think in many ways it s going to be harder for them to go after planned parenthood  not that they won t   he said in a telephone interview    i hope people recognize that planned parenthood did more than abortions  that they recognize it has a broader portfolio   he said  referring to services such as cancer screenings provided by the organization  the proposed american health care act  ahca  would have repealed many parts of the affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  which democratic president barack obama signed into law in    charbonneau and other planned parenthood officials pointed to a widespread outpouring of public opposition to ahca as one of the reasons that its moderate republican backers could not reach a compromise with members of the conservative freedom caucus  who demanded a complete evisceration of obamacare      the irony is that the freedom caucus  which is very pro life and against planned parenthood  allows p p  to continue if they stop this plan   trump wrote in a message on twitter on friday morning public opinion polls found the ahca bill was unpopular among americans  including republican voters  and that there was broad public support for funding some of planned parenthood s work  in a reuters ipsos poll conducted last month  almost half of   american adults surveyed said planned parenthood should receive federal funding  about a third said they should not  even so  about  percent of those people said planned parenthood should get the money when they were asked about specific services such as free cancer screenings  contraception and prenatal care  women were significantly more likely than men to think the organization deserved funding   the planned parenthood federation of america had described the republicans  proposed law as containing a  long list of anti women s health provisions  in a statement earlier this week  the federation s president  cecile richards  cheered its withdrawal on friday   the organization said that   million men  women and children rely on planned parenthood for cancer screenings  medical testing  contraception  abortions and other healthcare services each year at around  health centers around the country   the warnings were echoed by two dozen national public health organizations  including the american public health association  the american nurses association and the american college of nurse midwives  in a letter to u s  lawmakers in february  they argued that in some parts of the country  particularly rural areas  planned parenthood was the only nearby provider of health services
