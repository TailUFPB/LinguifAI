washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans have reached a tentative budget deal that could allow tax reform legislation to eliminate as much as    trillion in revenues over  years through tax cuts  raising the odds that their planned tax overhaul would expand the federal deficit  two members of the senate budget committee  republicans pat toomey and bob corker  announced the formal agreement late on tuesday  but their joint news release did not provide dollar figures for revenue reduction or tax cuts  the prospective tax cuts are part of closed door talks among  senate budget committee republicans who are drafting a fiscal  budget measure needed to help the  member senate pass a tax overhaul with as few as  republicans votes and prevent democrats from blocking the legislation  the u s  economy is in a steady expansion and stock markets are rising  but the tax cuts being weighed by congressional republicans  with encouragement from president donald trump  are on a scale normally reserved for times of economic hardship and intended to drive annual economic growth above  percent  trump campaigned last year on a promise of comprehensive tax reform  but republicans have made little tangible progress toward that ambitious goal so far  toomey told reporters he is confident that republicans will agree to a budget resolution that foresees a deficit in the first decade  he said  however  that talks have not settled definitively on    trillion     i d like to see a bigger number   said toomey  who argues that tax cuts would increase economic growth  in their joint news release  toomey and corker said they agreed on a budget resolution that would use a standard analysis of the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit  some republicans like toomey have pushed for a  dynamic  model  which tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts  resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit  senator john thune  a member of the senate republican leadership team  said he expected the agreement to provide  maximum flexibility to craft a tax overhaul capable of driving economic growth and ultimately raising worker wages  but looming in the background is washington s steady flow of red ink that adds every year to the   trillion national debt  a target of outrage not long ago for republican  fiscal hawks   in recent weeks  some fiscal hawks have expressed a willingness to consider deficit financing for tax reform but many at levels well below   billion   toomey s comments suggest senate republicans may be looking to deficit spending as a way to cut taxes on businesses and individuals while avoiding hard decisions that would be needed to raise taxes elsewhere or eliminate popular tax breaks  if adopted by congress in a budget resolution  the    trillion figure would set a ceiling on how much revenue tax reform could eliminate over  years  analysts and democrats have warned that higher deficits resulting from tax cuts would eventually overwhelm economic growth at a time when u s  interest rates are set to rise  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch  whose panel would use the budget figure in crafting a tax reform bill  told reporters he was not sure that revenue losses of    trillion were needed for tax reform  senator ron wyden  the senate finance committee s top democrat  dismissed the development as a distraction from the more important question of how republican tax reform would ultimately benefit the wealthy   it looks to me like yet another trial balloon   wyden said  republicans have been unable to agree on how to pay for tax cuts and other proposed tax changes  aside from arguing that some lost revenue would be clawed back from the buoyant economic growth they believe tax reform will deliver   there s no way you re going to be able to do tax cuts that pay for themselves   said louisiana senator john kennedy  another budget committee republican   but i think most people would concede that cutting taxes does stimulate the economy
