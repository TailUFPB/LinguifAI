   this story published on april  corrects typographical error in paragraph    washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on wednesday he thinks susan rice  a former top adviser to president barack obama  committed a crime by seeking the identities of trump associates mentioned in intercepted communications  but he declined requests for evidence  the new york times reported  in an interview  trump declined to tell the new york times whether he had reviewed intelligence to bolster his claim about rice but said he would explain himself  at the right time   rice said she had no immediate comment on the president s remarks when contacted by reuters  later on wednesday  erin pelton  a spokesman for rice  said in an email to reuters   i m not going to dignify the president s ludicrous charge with a comment   trump and his allies have focused on unsubstantiated reports that rice  who served as obama s national security adviser  disclosed the names of trump aides swept up in u s  surveillance of foreign targets  rice dismissed the reports as  absolutely false  in an interview with msnbc on tuesday  according to five u s  intelligence officials  rice followed standard procedure in requesting the national security agency to reveal to her the names of american citizens who had been in contact with russians whose communications were monitored by u s  intelligence  it is unlikely she would have known that any unidentified american had a connection to trump  the officials said  as white house national security adviser  rice could not order the nsa to reveal the identities of any americans  instead  she could only request it to do so  such requests  which a number of senior officials are authorized to make  trigger a legal and intelligence review by the agency to determine whether revealing the name has potential intelligence value and could expose a security threat to the united states  said one of the officials  who is familiar with the process and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal intelligence procedures  there is nothing unusual  much less suspicious  about any request by rice  said another intelligence official  especially since it could have revealed russian intelligence contacts or agents operating in the united states  this official and two other intelligence officials said the nsa often receives dozens of such requests in a month  john culhane  a professor at widener university delaware law school  said he thought rice could have a credible libel lawsuit against trump  though public figures like rice face a higher standard in bringing such claims  culhane said she could contend trump demonstrated a  reckless disregard  for the truth  but the president typically enjoys immunity from civil lawsuits over official acts  culhane noted  and a court could find that trump s interview with the newspaper was within the scope of his official duties
