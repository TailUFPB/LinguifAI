washington new york  reuters    after a crackdown on illegal immigration that has sharply reduced the number of unauthorized border crossings from mexico  u s  president donald trump is now turning his attention to reducing the number of legal immigrants in the country  the white house is throwing its support behind a bill developed by republican senators tom cotton of arkansas and david perdue of georgia that would cut legal immigration by  percent over  years by reducing the kinds of relatives immigrants can bring into the country   but the legislation faces an uphill climb to get through congress where some senior republicans back comprehensive immigration reform  not a tough crackdown  under the new bill  known as the raise act  the united states would prioritize high skilled immigrants by setting up a merits based system similar to those used by canada and australia   trump and the republican lawmakers blasted the current immigration system as out of date and argued that it hurts american workers by driving down wages   this competitive application process will favor applicants who can speak english  financially support themselves and their families and demonstrate skills that will contribute to our economy   trump said  the senators said they worked closely with the white house on this latest version of their bill   this is probably our third or fourth visit to the oval office to work with president trump   cotton told reporters  slashing legal immigration has long been pushed by low immigration advocacy groups in washington like numbersusa and the ideas have been backed by now attorney general jeff sessions  who is now facing public criticism from trump  numbersusa president roy beck hailed the bill and said that it  will do more than any other action to fulfill president trump s promises as a candidate   trump vowed to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign and signed two executive orders soon after taking office to increase border security and interior enforcement  cotton and perdue said their bill does not affect temporary visas for workers in certain tech sectors and seasonal jobs that are popular with many businesses  they stressed that the legislation was narrowly focused  an approach they hoped would be able to get bipartisan support   we re not trying to boil the ocean here and change everything about our immigration law   cotton said  but other republican lawmakers said the bill might be going too far  senator lindsey graham  from south carolina  said his state is dependent on immigrant labor to sustain the two biggest sectors of the economy  agriculture and tourism        economists have called into the question the benefits of cutting legal immigration  fwd us  a group that represents the tech industry said that the bill would  severely harm the economy         the bill aims to end the diversity visa lottery  which allows   people from underrepresented countries to obtain green cards   it also sets a   annual cap on refugees  instead of a level mandated by the president   refugee organizations said permanently limiting number of refugees allowed in the country goes against an american value of offering safe haven to people fleeing violence and oppression   trump suggested at an event in new york s long island on friday  where he spoke out against violence committed by central american gang members  that immigrants today are different than in previous generations      what happened to the old days when people came into this country and they worked and they worked and they worked and they had families and paid taxes and they did all sorts of things and their families got stronger and they were closely knit   trump asked the audience of law enforcement officers   we don t see that
