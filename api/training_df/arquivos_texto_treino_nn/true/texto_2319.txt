new york  reuters    grand jury subpoenas have been issued in connection with a june  meeting that included president donald trump s son  his son in law and a russian lawyer  two sources told reuters on thursday  in a sign that special counsel robert mueller s investigation is gathering pace  the sources added that mueller had convened a grand jury in washington to help investigate allegations of russian meddling in the  u s  election   bonds view this as a flight to quality while stocks had a minor hiccup  the euro is near the highs of the day  this makes the placement of treasuries going into tomorrow s employment number at the recent highs  not a good risk reward   jim paulsen  chief investment strategist  the leuthold group  minneapolis   we re going to get a fair number of these headlines  it s going to take a while  whatever happens  anything that represents volatility is an automatic sell  for stocks     i m not even sure if beyond the volatility there s much of wall street that would get terribly upset if  trump  got impeached  that would give them  current vice president mike  pence  and likely full power for republicans and maybe some policies being enacted including health care  tax reform and a fiscal spending program  even reinforce less regulations   from a wall street standpoint i can t say over the long term that  a trump impeachment  would be a bad result for stocks  the uncertainty of going through it all would be a negative  but i m not sure the market would remain lower for long  assuming all else is equal    axel merk  president and chief investment officer of merk investments in palo alto  california   given that trump s approval rating is very low  and given that it might be all but impossible to find a jury that hasn t heard of the allegations  odds are this jury might be leaning against trump  this is yet a negative for the administration  and with that  if recent months are any guide  it is a negative for the dollar  and so yes  sure enough  the euro rallied on this  this is good news for the euro  this should be good news for gold and it is ultimately a negative also for risk assets only for the reason that the trump agenda has ever more difficulty of being realized because it does weaken the presidency  the hopes for real growth picking up are just diminishing the more headwinds the administration is getting   chris zaccarelli  chief investment officer  cornerstone financial partners  huntersville  north carolina      to the extent that people are afraid something will happen to the presidency of the united states  whether that brings us closer to impeachment or serves as a further distraction for the administration  neither of those are good for the markets or a risk on position    it s more distraction for the white house and less stability   it definitely was market moving  the timing lines up perfectly   the immediate drop was probably computer driven but people aren t taking advantage of the dip   juan perez  currency strategist  tempus inc  washington dc    the world is paying attention and ultimately currencies are weighed to measure the stability of a country  whether you can have faith in what s going on or not   i think with this investigation and the constant bombardment of news out of the white house the rest of the world is starting to see this image of somewhat of an unstable u s   which is somewhat unprecedented  and now politics  even more than economic data  is really a driver of dollar weakness    what s really going to weigh heavily on the dollar for the remainder of the year is that as long as this investigation continues and there is a probe and the white house continues to work on everything except the economic agenda it s going to weigh heavily on the dollar  the reaction was certainly immediate  to the news   looking at it long term  is this going to affect the dollar in a negative way  absolutely it is   stocks  u s  stocks extended losses  with the s p falling around   percent after the news  then tracking back slightly   bonds   u s  bond yields fell to session lows   forex   the us dollar index fell around   percent in the minutes after the news  then tracked back slightly
