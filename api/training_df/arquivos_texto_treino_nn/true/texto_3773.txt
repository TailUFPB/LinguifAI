san francisco  reuters    ramin forouzandeh had applied to  phd economics programs in the united states  but after president donald trump signed his first travel ban in january  the  year old iranian turned to canada for other options   he said he had focused on u s  schools because they hosted most of the world s top  economics programs   before the travel ban  i never really considered other alternatives    by late march  u s  courts had halted two versions of trump s travel ban  yet forouzandeh signed for university of toronto s rotman school of management and turned down the university of minnesota s prestigious phd program  his countryman  mahdi ebrahimi kahou    was well into his first year of the minnesota program when he decided to transfer to the university of british columbia because of trump s executive orders that banned travel from seven and later six muslim majority countries  including iran   i lost my motivation to work completely   he said   a reuters survey of  canadian universities showed a spike in international applications  most notably from iran and india  five top canadian economics and business phd programs are getting at least half of their new iranian students this fall because of the ban  based on interviews with universities and students  most of those  like forouzandeh and ebrahimi kahou  are opting out of u s  programs in a field where the united states both dominates and relies on foreign talent  while those programs represent only one field and a fraction of the u s  student population  they offer early evidence of the direct impact of trump administration policies  academics fear they may also be a sign of things to come if the chilling effect of trump s  america first  agenda spreads beyond any specific field of study or nationality   this strikes at the heart of what has made u s  higher education the envy of the world   said mary sue coleman  chair of the association of american universities      it s this notion that the u s  is no longer a welcoming place for the best and the brightest     iranians are by far the biggest group among students directly affected by the bans and form a small but notable part of the talent pool in areas such as engineering and economics  where u s  academic institutions excel  iranians ranked sixth last year among international students enrolled in u s  graduate programs  according to the institute of international education   a survey conducted jointly by five u s  higher education associations in february showed  percent of u s  colleges reporting a drop in foreign applications  with those from the middle east down the most  while  percent saw no change   a significant cool down after nearly a decade of steady growth  in   at least  percent of graduate students at u s  universities granting graduate degrees in science  engineering and health were foreigners  according to the national science foundation    for a graphic on u s  universities  global brains  click tmsnrt rs    this year  about  percent of graduating phds from the top  u s  economics departments come from other countries  a reuters analysis shows   you ve got an issued order that s been temporarily blocked that applies to six countries  but the destabilization of the whole situation for international students and faculty could not be overstated   said rice university president david leebron  he said that for foreign students everything from getting a visa on time to employment opportunities had been thrown into question  according to rice s dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies  this year s phd programs will have slightly fewer chinese  indian and middle eastern students than expected  more iranian students declined offers of admission than usual  with several saying that they decided to study in another country because of concerns about getting a u s  visa   there is no evidence of a mass exodus of foreigners   indeed  rice will have more students than expected from europe and latin america  offsetting declines elsewhere   but academics cite dozens of examples where trump s policies had an impact  at arizona state university  for example  iranians would typically make up a fourth of the economics phd program  but there will be none in the incoming class this fall  of those already enrolled  two are moving to canada  one student who visited his family in iran over the christmas break still has not been able to return  leaving the university scrambling to cover the classes he was supposed to teach     the effects of this are big   said gustavo ventura  asu s economics department chair   these people  not just the ones that come to us   anyone who comes to a phd program abroad   are the cream of their student population   the university of illinois now has  iranians in its phd program  and while it s not certain why  none of the iranians whom it offered admission are among the  students from  countries entering in the fall   at indiana university s economics program  three iranians withdrew their applications almost immediately after the travel ban  said todd walker  director of the department s graduate studies   we also had many more international applicants turn us down this year relative to the last three years   he said   i cannot say definitively how much of this is attributable to the travel ban  but i suspect it played a role   in british columbia  the simon fraser university has admitted  percent more international students for the fall term  according to associate dean jeff derksen  he said queries he had received and an online survey suggested more graduate students were considering alternatives to u s  programs   this indicates that the international map of academic knowledge production has changed   the prestige of the u s  programs remains a big draw  but those committed to a u s  career are more aware of risks   for example  soheil ghili  who is getting a phd in economics from northwestern university s kellogg school of management this month and will start as a post doctoral fellow at yale this summer  is hedging his bets   let me put it this way  i will be more careful to not miss networking opportunities with people from toronto and london
