beijing  reuters    u s  president donald trump pressed china to do more to rein in north korea on thursday and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the united states  but praised president xi jinping s pledge that china would be more open to foreign firms  on north korea s nuclear and missile programs  trump said  china can fix this problem quickly and easily   urging beijing to cut financial links with north korea and also calling on russia to help  trump was speaking alongside xi in the chinese capital to announce the signing of about   billion in commercial deals between u s  and chinese firms  a display that some in the u s  business community worry detracts from tackling deep seated complaints about market access in china  xi said the chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms  including those from the united states  and welcomed u s  companies to participate in his ambitious  belt and road  infrastructure led initiative  trump made clear that he blamed his predecessors  not china  for the trade imbalance  and repeatedly praised xi  calling him  a very special man    but we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us   trump said  xi smiled widely when trump said he does not blame china for the deficit and also when trump said xi gets things done   of course there are some frictions  but on the basis of win win cooperation and fair competition  we hope we can solve all these issues in a frank and consultative way   xi said   keeping opening up is our long term strategy  we will never narrow or close our doors  we will further widen them   he said  china would also offer a more fair and transparent environment for foreign firms  including u s  ones  xi said  trump is pressing china to tighten the screws further on north korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of u n  sanctions  at least modest progress is hoped for  although there are no immediate signs of a major breakthrough  a u s  official said earlier  referring to xi  trump said   i do believe there s a solution to that  as do you   xi reiterated that china would strive for the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula but offered no hint that china would change tack on north korea  with which it fought side by side in the   korean war against u s  led forces   we are devoted to reaching a resolution to the korean peninsula issue through dialogue and consultations   xi said  briefing reporters after the talks  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said trump told xi   you re a strong man  i m sure you can solve this for me   tillerson said both leaders agreed they could not accept a nuclear armed north korea but he acknowledged they had some differences over tactics and timing  tillerson pointed out that trump  in a speech in seoul  had  invited the north koreans to come to the table   in line with the chinese desire for a negotiated solution  he added  however  that trump was prepared for a  military response  if he deemed the threat serious enough  but  that s not his first choice    we are going to work hard on diplomatic efforts as well   he said  but did not elaborate  in a show of the importance china puts on trump s first official visit  thursday s welcoming ceremony outside beijing s great hall of the people overlooking tiananmen square was broadcast live on state television   unprecedented treatment for a visiting leader  earlier on thursday  xi said he had a deep exchange of views with trump and reached consensus on numerous issues of mutual concern   for china  cooperation is the only real choice  only win win can lead to an even better future   he said  xi said china and the united states strengthened high level dialogue on all fronts over the past year and boosted coordination on major international issues  such as the korean peninsula and afghanistan   relations between china and the united states are now on a new historical starting point   xi said  trump and xi hit it off at their first meeting in april at trump s mar a lago resort in florida and continued their  bromance  on wednesday with an afternoon of sightseeing together with their wives  however  divisions persist over trade and north korea  and while xi is riding high after consolidating power at a twice a decade communist party congress last month  trump comes to china saddled with low public approval ratings and dogged by investigations into russian links to his election campaign  trump has ratcheted up his criticism of china s massive trade surplus with the united states   calling it  embarrassing  and  horrible  last week   and has accused beijing of unfair trade practices  for its part  china says u s  restrictions on chinese investment in the united states and on high tech exports need to be addressed  several corporate chief executives were in beijing as part of a delegation led by u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross  with general electric and semiconductor maker qualcomm inc among those announcing billions of dollars in sales to china   but qualcomm s agreement to sell   billion worth of components to three chinese mobile phone makers over three years is non binding  and critics say such public announcements are sometimes more show than substance   this shows that we have a strong  vibrant bilateral economic relationship  and yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field because u s  companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in china   said william zarit  chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china  trump railed against china s trade practices during the  u s  presidential campaign and threatened to take action once in office  but he has since held back on any major trade penalties  making clear he was doing so to give beijing time to make progress reining in north korea  a u s  official said both sides were  in sync  about wanting to minimize friction during the visit and recreate the positive tone of the april summit  trump was not expected to put much emphasis in his talks with xi on thorny issues such as the disputed south china sea and self ruled taiwan  claimed by china as its own  although the leaders  aides may deal with those matters privately  the official told reuters  speaking on condition of anonymity  china has repeatedly pushed back at suggestions it should be doing more to rein in north korea  which does about  percent of its trade with china  saying it is fully enforcing u n  sanctions and that everyone has a responsibility to lower tension and get talks back on track   this story was refiled to restore dropped word in paragraph
