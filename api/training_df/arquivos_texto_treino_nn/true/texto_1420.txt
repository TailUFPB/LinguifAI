washington  reuters    u s  house democrats introduced legislation on wednesday to direct banking regulators to review operations at the country s largest banks and consider shutting them down if they exhibit repeated wrongdoing to consumers   the bill  likely to meet stiff opposition from the republican majority in congress  represents the most direct threat yet from policymakers eager to see the nation s biggest banks  including wells fargo and jpmorgan chase  broken up   it is clear steeper penalties need to be used when a megabank demonstrates a pattern of consumer abuse   said representative maxine waters  a lead sponsor of the bill and the top democrat on the house financial services committee  deficiencies in processing customer complaints  servicing residential mortgages  as well as engaging in deceptive business practices or opening unauthorized accounts could all be deemed harmful to consumers under the bill  opening banks up to significant regulatory action  eight democrats  led by waters  introduced the legislation on wednesday  if signed into law  the bill would require federal banking regulators to review every u s  bank identified as a  global systemically important bank  within  days  specifically  regulators would need to determine if the banks have exhibited  repeated law violations that harmed consumers   as defined by the consumer financial protection bureau  another federal regulator  the bill puts pressure directly on banking regulators  who democrats argue are not utilizing all their tools to curb what they see as bad behavior in the banking sector  democrats in congress are frequently critical of the banking sector  but this new legislation represents the most direct attempt by lawmakers to significantly curb big banks      if any banks are found to be repeat offenders  regulators would have  days to begin winding the institution down and barring its executives from the financial industry  using their existing powers  and large bank executives would be required to attest annually they have reviewed all lines of bank business and are compliant with consumer protection laws  executives would also face heightened civil and criminal liability under the bill  lawmakers backing the bill identified several banks they believe should face such a comprehensive review and possible dissolution  including wells fargo  jpmorgan  bank of america  and citigroup  one week earlier  waters released a report claiming wells fargo has shown a  pattern of abusive business practices   making clear  and reiterated her belief the bank should be broken up  spokespeople for those banks either declined to comment on waters s bill or did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the new bill is also the latest step democrats have taken to increase pressure on banking regulators  who they believe are not taking a sufficiently harsh stance with the industry  senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts has repeatedly pressed the federal reserve to remove members of wells s board of directors who were in that role when bank employees created potentially millions of fake customer accounts  warren has not signed on to the new legislation
