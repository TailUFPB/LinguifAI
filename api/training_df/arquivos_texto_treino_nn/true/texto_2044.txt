 reuters    president donald trump said on tuesday he was willing to shut down the government to get funding for a u s  mexico border wall  complicating two must pass measures congress will take up in september  a spending package and raising the debt ceiling  here is what you need to know about both  and the potential for a shutdown of the u s  government  congress must pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on sept   to fund much of the u s  government  when disagreements prevent that  which is frequent  lawmakers often pass a temporary bill extending existing spending levels with no changes for days  weeks or months  while they work on a longer lasting deal  when they cannot agree on either a new spending plan or a short term extension  the government shuts down  that has happened many times since the   usually for a few days  and can rattle markets  congress will return from its long summer recess on sept    at the time  it will have only about  working days to approve spending measures to keep the government open  if spending measures are not passed before oct    portions of the government will begin to shut down and non essential employees will go without pay until an agreement is reached  the government most recently shut down for about two weeks in october  over funding for former president barack obama s healthcare law  there were three shutdowns in the   the longest lasting  days  in the  and   there were  shutdowns  some partial and most lasting only a few days  the  debt ceiling  is a legislative limit on how much money the federal government can borrow through debt issued by the u s  treasury  once the limit is reached  congress must raise it or the government cannot continue borrowing money and would default  or be unable to pay its bills  the treasury has said it wants congress to increase the debt ceiling by sept    although default likely could be staved off until mid october  thanks to  extraordinary measures  the treasury put in place in march to delay a debt reckoning    legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted  at the very latest  by early to mid october  if the debt ceiling is not raised  the government would not be able to borrow more money or pay its bills  including payments on its debts  which could hurt the u s  credit rating  political gridlock has never led to the united states reaching its debt ceiling and its bills going unpaid  but there have been close calls  an august  standoff cost the country its top notch bond rating from the credit rating agency standard   poor s and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the   global financial crisis  the two move on separate tracks  but are likely to get tangled together  with republican opponents of a debt ceiling increase likely demanding federal spending cuts  some analysts say congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time  both the spending and debt ceiling bills can pass the republican led house of representatives by a simple majority vote  but will need  votes to pass the senate  where republicans hold  of  seats  meaning they will need some democratic support   trump made his u s  mexico border wall a central promise of his  presidential campaign  he also promised that mexico would pay for the wall  but mexico has steadfastly refused and trump has largely stopped talking about that pledge  conservative house republicans agree with the republican president on the need for a wall and say border wall funding should be a priority in any spending legislation  some of them have already indicated they are willing to shut down the government to get it  moderate republicans have called a shutdown unwise and republican leaders are determined to prevent one  fearing it would worsen doubts about the party s ability to govern  democrats are uniformly opposed to trump s wall and say the responsibility for a shutdown would rest solely with republicans  the trump administration reversed course earlier this month and said it would back a  clean  raising of the debt ceiling  meaning it would not be tied to other policy measures  democrats and moderate republicans also support a clean debt ceiling increase  but conservative republicans  especially in the house  often use debt ceiling legislation to insist on changes to spending  making them opposed to a clean bill
