washington  reuters    supreme court nominee neil gorsuch said on wednesday presidents must obey court orders and expressed uncertainty about language in the constitution barring u s  government officials from taking payments from a foreign country as democrats grilled him on issues involving president donald trump  gorsuch  the conservative appeals court judge from colorado nominated by trump on jan   to a lifetime job on the nation s highest court  sparred with senate judiciary committee democrats on the third day of his confirmation hearing   he completed his testimony on wednesday night  the committee will complete its deliberations on thursday by hearing testimony from outside witnesses  gorsuch seems assured of winning committee approval  moving his nomination to the full republican led senate  his challenge then would be to gather enough democratic votes to avoid a prolonged floor fight with the potential  if it gets rocky  of changing how the senate works  while gorsuch s confirmation process looked to be proceeding smoothly  democrats pressed him on matters swirling around trump  even asking him about the standards for impeachment  gorsuch s expected senate confirmation would restore a conservative majority on the court and hand the republican president his biggest achievement in office  senator patrick leahy cited comments by trump adviser stephen miller after courts blocked the president s executive action temporarily banning people from several muslim majority nations from entering the united states  on feb    miller challenged the authority of courts to rule on the issue  saying the president s power to enforce the ban should not be questioned   i m a judge now  i take that seriously  and you better believe i expect judicial decrees to be obeyed   gorsuch said   that s the rule of law in this country   gorsuch added  gorsuch declined to say how he would approach an alleged violation of the u s  constitution s emoluments clause  which prevents american officials from accepting any gifts or favors from foreign governments without congressional approval   the question is  what exactly does that mean   gorsuch said  noting there was ongoing litigation on the matter   i have to be very careful about expressing any views   trump has been sued by ethics lawyers  who say his businesses have accepted payments from foreign governments in violation of the emoluments clause  on the basis for which an official can be impeached  gorsuch said historically the focus had been on  high crimes  rather than  misdemeanors   he said the number of criminal misdemeanors on the books had increased substantially since the u s  constitution was written in the  century   a unanimous ruling on wednesday by the supreme court justices whom gorsuch would join  if confirmed  rejected legal reasoning he used as an appellate judge in a  ruling against an autistic child who sought a public education more tailored to his needs  the supreme court ruled in favor of another autistic student who argued he was denied an adequate education  democrats have called gorsuch s earlier decision an example of how he rules against everyday americans while favoring corporate interests  an assertion the nominee and his republicans supporters reject  gorsuch said he was bound by court precedent in the  decision  adding it would be  heartbreaking  to suggest he would like ruling against disabled students  he sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious past cases had been decided correctly  including those on abortion  gun rights  political spending and religious rights   what worries me is you have been very much able to avoid any specificity  like no one i have every seen before   senator dianne feinstein  the panel s top democrat  told gorsuch   feinstein asked gorsuch to explain a document dating from his work in former president george w  bush s justice department related to  anti torture restrictions  the document asked whether aggressive interrogation techniques used by bush s administration had yielded valuable intelligence or stopped a terrorist incident  and gorsuch had written  yes   gorsuch said he was merely doing what he was told by the administration   my recollection of  years ago is that was the position that the clients were telling us   he said  feinstein expressed concern about women s rights and preserving legalized abortion  and asked gorsuch about his views as an  originalist  seeing the constitution s meaning as unaltered since its enactment despite centuries of societal change   no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days   gorsuch said  regarding the constitution s promise of equal protection under the law  gorsuch said it did not matter that some of the drafters of the language  were racists  because they were  or sexists  because they were   republicans hold  seats in the  member senate  the senate has a  vote hurdle for confirmation of supreme court justices  meaning gorsuch would need backing by eight democrats  if democrats stand together  republicans could change senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority vote  a committee vote is expected on april   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell has said gorsuch would be confirmed before lawmakers  mid april recess  if confirmed  gorsuch would replace conservative justice antonin scalia  who died in february
