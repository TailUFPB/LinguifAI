washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s sudden decision to ban transgender  personnel from serving in the military has alarmed some senior military officers who were caught off guard by it  trump s declaration  which came via early morning tweets on wednesday  appeared to pre empt an ongoing pentagon review looking into allowing openly transgender recruits to join the military  and he drew criticism from three senior officers interviewed by reuters on thursday       i hope our commander in chief understands that we don t transmit orders via twitter  and that he can t  either   one said by telephone  speaking on the condition of anonymity   even if this were an order  implementing it legally would take considerable time  if it s even possible        rights groups and some lawmakers from both parties accused trump of politically motivated discrimination and said the decision creates uncertainty for transgender active duty service members and reservists  who say they number in the thousands   the united states  top military officer  marine general joseph dunford  told the armed forces on thursday there had been no change yet to pentagon policy on transgender personnel  dunford  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  acknowledged the uncertainty that followed trump s announcement in a note to service chiefs  commanders and senior enlisted leaders   i know there are questions about yesterday s announcement on the transgender policy by the president   dunford wrote   there will be no modifications to the current policy until the president s direction has been received by the secretary of defense and the secretary has issued implementation guidance   dunford said in the message  first reported by reuters  dunford then made the assurance that the military would  treat all of our personnel with respect    his message neither voiced support nor opposition to trump s decision  one official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said dunford in a separate message sent more narrowly to heads of the army  navy  marine corps and air force acknowledged that trump s announcement on wednesday was  unexpected   the defense department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year  but mattis on june  approved a six month delay to allow for a review   as a presidential candidate  trump last year had vowed to fight for lesbians  gays  bisexuals and transgender people   his move on wednesday was praised by conservative activists and some fellow republicans  the white house said trump had  extensive discussions with his national security team   and that defense secretary jim mattis was informed after the president decided on tuesday to go ahead  trump cited  tremendous medical costs and disruption  as a justification for the ban  a point disputed by experts and advocates for allowing military service to be determined by an individual s capabilities  not gender identity or sexual preference  the army s chief of staff  general mark milley  said on thursday that there had been issues with transgender individuals serving in the army   i will be candid      this is a complex issue and there  are  a variety of challenges out there that we have to deal with and we have been working through it  but this is not clean cut either way   he said  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said implementation of  trump s decision was still being worked out  separately  the trump administration on thursday told a u s  appeals court in new york that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees  a sharp reversal of the position democratic former president barack obama took  trump s plan to ban transgender military service members has  unleashed legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to sue  trump s tweets did not make clear when a ban would go into effect  nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join   but if the defense department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military  the pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight  legal experts say   there s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military   said jon davidson  legal director for lgbt rights group lambda legal  it was also unclear whether it might go beyond active duty forces and apply to reservists  indiana national guard reservist cameron st  andrew  who  resigned from full time service after the november election  told reuters that as a transgender person he was concerned about his status   i try to be tough about it   he said  but added   it breaks your spirit down   one active duty u s  military officer  speaking on condition of anonymity  said senior officials were not consulted   we re scratching our heads and asking where the hell this came from   the officer said by phone    maybe the president is in step with some members of congress and some voters  but he is out of step with today s military  our service personnel today don t give a damn about the personal lives of their comrades so long as they know they can trust them when it counts
