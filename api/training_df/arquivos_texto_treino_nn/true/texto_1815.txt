washington  reuters    a powerful senate committee blasted the trump administration on friday in a report accompanying its spending plan for the state department  saying its approach to foreign policy weakens u s  standing in the world  on thursday  the senate appropriations committee voted   for legislation allocating more than   billion for the state department and foreign operations  nearly   billion more than requested by president donald trump s administration  in the report released on friday accompanying the legislation  the committee criticized the administration s request to cut spending on such operations by  percent from the year ending on sept       the lessons learned since september     include the reality that defense alone does not provide for american strength and resolve abroad  battlefield technology and firepower cannot replace diplomacy and development   it read   the administration s apparent doctrine of retreat  which also includes distancing the united states from collective and multilateral dispute resolution frameworks  serves only to weaken america s standing in the world   it said  senator lindsey graham  the republican chairman of the state and foreign operations subcommittee  which wrote the bill  said on thursday that he had asked for more details from the white house about its spending plans   we ve got nothing back   he said  senator patrick leahy  the top subcommittee democrat  called the  soft power  work of the state department  absolutely essential   democrats and many of trump s fellow republicans have blasted his budget request since it was released earlier this year  congress  not the administration  controls spending  the administration says the state department would be more effective if it were run more efficiently  arguing that the country needs to cut in other areas to fund a large increase in military spending  the bill passed by the appropriations committee is still several steps from becoming law  it must pass the senate  and be reconciled with legislation passed by the house of representatives  and then signed by trump   or garner enough votes to override a trump veto  the bill passed by the senate committee on thursday departed from trump policy in other ways  including approving funding for the u n  climate body and rejecting prohibitions on funding for international organizations that perform or provide counseling on abortions  those measures  however  stand little chance in the house  although republicans control both chambers of congress  conservative republicans most skeptical about climate change and opposed to abortion exert more control in the house than in the senate
