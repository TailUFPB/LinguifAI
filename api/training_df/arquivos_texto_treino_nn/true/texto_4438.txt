washington  reuters    the u s  senate is set for a vote on thursday that will test the resolve of democratic opposition to president donald trump s supreme court nominee  neil gorsuch  and likely prompt republicans to change the chamber s rules to allow his confirmation by the end of the week  the senate vote  expected at  a m    gmt   is a bid by republican leaders to try to end a democratic procedural effort called a filibuster aimed at blocking gorsuch s confirmation to a lifetime post on the court  republicans were expected to fall short of being able to halt the filibuster  but have said they have the votes needed to change long standing senate rules to prohibit such a procedure against supreme court nominees  republicans said gorsuch would be confirmed on friday one way or the other  senate confirmation of gorsuch    would reinstate the nine member court s conservative majority  allowing trump to leave an indelible mark on america s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the republican president   there is still time for them to support a nominee who even longtime democrats have praised  or at the very least  do not block him with the first successful partisan filibuster in american history   republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said of the democrats on wednesday  during senate debate on wednesday  various republicans called the conservative colorado based federal appeals court judge  incredibly qualified   an  intellectual heavyweight  and  always true to the law   democratic senate leader chuck schumer indicated  however  that democrats intended to follow through on their filibuster pledge  having gathered more than the  votes they need to mount the effort  a filibuster requires a super majority of  votes in the  seat senate to proceed to a simple majority vote on a supreme court nominee or legislation  republicans control the senate     we democrats believe the answer isn t to change the rules  it s to change the nominee  as presidents of both parties have done when a nominee fails to earn confirmation   schumer said on the senate floor  democrats accuse gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream  favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions  and displaying insufficient independence from trump  they are also angry that senate republicans last year refused to consider former democratic president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to replace conservative justice antonin scalia  who died in february   the same seat gorsuch has been named to fill  the rule change  which requires a simple majority  has been dubbed the  nuclear option   and trump has encouraged mcconnell to  go nuclear   ending the filibuster would make it easier for future supreme court nominees to be confirmed when the president and senate leadership belong to the same party  republican senator john mccain  known as a defender of senate traditions  offered reluctant support for the rule change  but said it would likely lead to judicial nominees  from the extremes of both left and right   the  vote threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments
