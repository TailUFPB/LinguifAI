new york  reuters    democrat doug jones won a bitter fight for a u s  senate seat in deeply conservative alabama on tuesday  dealing a political blow to president donald trump in a race marked by sexual misconduct accusations against republican candidate roy moore  key points     the stunning upset makes jones the first democrat elected to the u s  senate from alabama in a quarter century and will trim the republicans  already narrow senate majority to    opening the door for democrats to possibly retake the chamber in next year s congressional elections      peter cardillo  chief market economist at first standard financial in new york    if anything it prompts congress to get the tax bill signed before year end and they have another week  if they don t they do have a problem    from that perspective yesterday s defeat is good news in terms of tax legislation  they re not going to risk tax reform because of the election  while it s a defeat it s actually a positive    if the president doesn t sign legislation by year end we have a major problem  that would just speed up the process of a correction  would it affect the economy  reverse the economic growth  not in   perhaps in     it was a defeat for the republican party and mr  trump but it also motivates the republicans to get their act together and get a bill signed   keith lerner  chief market strategist  suntrust advisory services in atlanta  ga   tax reform is still likely to go through  what happened overnight may present an obstacle to the gop agenda in   but that s arguably less important than tax reform  perhaps there will be some obstacles to infrastructure  entitlement reform  but from a market perspective  those weren t high probability anyway   the high probability is  tax  gets through  the republicans have tried to fast track it before  jones  gets seated  so it s unlikely his victory will change that   we ll have a short term setback  if the tax bill doesn t pass   and it may cap the upside of the market since companies won t be getting an earnings boost  but if there s a pullback  i think it will be in the  to  percent range  as opposed to a bear market   it s still early  but there looks certainly to be big changes in the midterm with the makeup of the house and senate    as long as the economy is on sound footing  gridlock in washington is not necessarily a bad thing  it s not necessarily preferable  but with the majority so slim as it is  it s more of a question  does the economy chug along  if the economy continues to move forward  it s less important    gennadiy goldberg  interest rates strategist  td securities  new york   we think one of the possible biggest impact is on the deficit  with the jones win  it makes it more difficult to pass the tax cut bill   this puts pressure on the republicans to pass tax cuts before year end  the question is can they do it  are we going to see special provisions or deals to get it done  i think it s a  get it done  mentality  if not  it does bleed into early    it lowers the odds of getting anything done in      l  thomas block  fundstrat global advisors  washington policy strategy  from research note     bottom line is that the alabama senate race doesn t change the basic  washington  dc headlines  first that tax bill should pass by christmas  and that there are tough negotiations ahead to solve the budget issues and avoid a government shutdown    marc chandler  global head of currency strategy  brown brothers harriman  from research note     the dollar  did slip to the low for the week against the yen  when it became clear that the republicans were going to lose the senate seat in alabama  this reduced the republican majority to one in the senate  owing the fissures in the party  this is putting at risk other parts of trump s agenda  which treasury secretary mnuchin acknowledged earlier this week is necessary to achieve the kind of growth levels that the tax bill assumes    u s  stock futures and the dollar dipped on wednesday  although equities turned around by the open and the s p  index was last up   percent
