san francisco  reuters    a u s  judge on monday appeared skeptical toward a request from several states that want him to order the administration of republican president donald trump to continue payments to health insurers under obamacare   at a hearing in san francisco federal court  u s  district judge vince chhabria said he aimed to issue a ruling on tuesday   the trump administration earlier this month terminated the payments  which help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income americans  as part of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his democratic predecessor  barack obama   trump had threatened to cut off the subsidies for months  prompting health insurers such as anthem inc  humana inc  unitedhealth group inc and aetna inc to raise premiums or exit insurance markets  democratic attorneys general from  states and the district of columbia sued the federal government and asked for an immediate order halting trump s move while the case is being litigated and argued that terminating the payments harmed customers by raising insurance rates   but chhabria on monday suggested that california and other states had anticipated trump s move and worked with insurers to make sure most consumers would not be harmed  that weakens the case for a court order forcing the payments  chhabria said    why should i be ordering the administration to make these payments in the next few months while we get the case adjudicated   chhabria asked  since cutting off the payments  trump has alternately supported  and dismissed  an effort by republican and democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years until a broader replacement to the  affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  can be negotiated  while democrats accused trump of sabotaging obamacare  the president argued that the subsidies made insurance companies  rich    in a court filing on friday  the u s  department of justice pointed to a prior ruling from a washington  d c  federal court that said congress had never appropriated the money for the subsidies  an appeal of that ruling is currently on hold  either side could appeal chhabria s ruling to the  u s  circuit court of appeals  which is weighted with democratic appointed judges   from there  any further appeal would go to the u s  supreme court
