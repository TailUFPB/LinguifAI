washington  reuters    the trump administration  in line with its tough immigration policy  is keeping red tape in place that could make it harder for immigrants in the aftermath of hurricane harvey to find jobs with contractors  a decision critics say is likely to slow the gulf coast s recovery  in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in   republican president george w  bush temporarily exempted employers hiring katrina victims from verifying that new employees were authorized to work in the united states  the  day suspension allowed survivors whose identification documents had been lost during the storm to work while awaiting new ones  but it also allowed undocumented immigrants to quickly find jobs with contractors  u s  citizenship and immigration services said in a statement on wednesday that while it will expedite the replacement of lost documents for storm victims  employment verification requirements will remain in place  a move that drew both praise and scorn from politicians and others   with so much rebuilding needed  we should make it easier for folks to get back to work   said representative lloyd doggett  a democrat whose constituency includes parts of southeast texas   unfortunately  always overflowing with anti immigrant hysteria  the trump administration is choosing red tape and bureaucracy instead of learning lessons from past disasters   president donald trump  a republican  built a base of support in the   election campaign by vowing to stop people immigrating to the united states illegally and is pushing for a wall to be built along the u s  border with mexico  but business leaders say immigrants make important contributions and that any effort to limit their employment will hurt economic growth and tax revenue  representative marc veasey  another texas democrat  said the government should not penalize harvey victims   providing employers with temporary leeway will allow texans to focus on rebuilding their lives and not on pressuring potential employees to provide documents that may have been lost during hurricane harvey   veasey said  representative lamar smith  a republican congressman for  south central texas  was critical of the department of homeland security  dhs  decision in  and thinks it should not be repeated now  harvey came ashore last friday as the most powerful storm to hit texas in  years  flooding houston and driving tens of thousands from their homes before moving to louisiana  on thursday  he said harvey s destruction  does not mean federal immigration laws should be ignored    nor should regulations that require federal contractors to verify legal work authorization of their employees   he said in a statement to reuters   these policies were put in place to protect american workers and taxpayers   uscis referred questions on the decision to immigration and customs enforcement  the division under the dhs that enforces federal immigration policy  ice spokeswoman dani bennett declined to speculate about future policy changes  but said it was not ice s intent to conduct immigration enforcement in areas affected by harvey  waiving verification requirements after katrina was aimed at citizens and legal residents who had lost documents in the storm  since employers must verify the identity of all new hires through documents  such as passports  permanent residence cards  or driver s licenses  but several immigration attorneys said the dhs   decision was also a tacit acknowledgment that undocumented immigrants were needed to help the rebuilding  the pew research center estimated last year that  percent of texas s construction workforce is undocumented  while other studies have put the number as high as  percent    in certain circumstances those are the people you desperately need to help you do things   said william j  manning  an immigration attorney in new york   this is not the time to get precious about their documentation   in the days and weeks after katrina  contractors from inside and outside new orleans moved to rebuild and take advantage of government reconstruction funds  but the number of workers in construction and related industries in the new orleans area plummeted just after the hurricane  according to a  brookings institution study  the dhs decision  and a separate decision by the department of labor to temporarily lift wage restrictions  were part of an effort by the bush administration to address the labor shortage  some worry that the trump administration s decision will slow down the post harvey rebuilding  because employers will struggle to meet the federal documentation requirements in the storm s aftermath   damage is damage  and there are repairs that need to be done   said jorge lopez  an immigration attorney in florida   local folks are trying to hire right away because even with their existing crew they re not going to have enough people to do all the work that needs to be done
