london  reuters    a top u s  government legal official has given strong backing to britain s campaign to force silicon valley to compromise on encrypted communications  rebuking tech firms for failing to balance crime fighting demands with privacy needs  u s  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein met with senior british government officials including interior minister amber rudd and the chief of  intelligence agency on thursday to discuss encryption  he plans to see the head of britain s gchq service on friday  he told reuters     at this point we are coordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are   rosenstein said in response to a question from a reporter at the global cyber security summit  organized by skytop strategies   top officials in prime minister theresa may s government  including rudd  have been trying to rein in encryption but have been met quiet resistance from tech leaders like facebook  fb o   google  googl o  and twitter  twtr n   critics see the demands as a back door for government snooping   in his speech  rosenstein decried what he called  warrant proof encryption that puts zero value on law enforcement   british and u s  officials argue that default encryption settings on free messaging apps  such as facebook s whatsapp  hinder authorities  ability to collect evidence needed to pursue criminals  even with clear  court ordered mandates    increasingly  the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them   rosenstein said  britain is trying to step up attempts to counter criminal activity online after a series of islamist militant attacks this year but must ensure it balances the demands of state security with the freedoms of democratic societies    tech companies and many cyber security experts say that requiring law enforcement access be given access to encrypted products will broadly weaken security for everything from online banking to shopping to casual conversations among friends  the u s  deputy attorney general said he was not seeking to criticize technology firms but rather to lay out the trade offs   in many ways the economic interests of technology companies align with law enforcement   rosenstein said   but in one particular area   encryption   competitive forces drive technology companies to resist cooperating with governments   i wouldn t describe my goal is to put pressure on the tech industry   he said  adding  regulation is a potential option   but in a speech earlier this week rosenstein accused silicon valley of being more willing to comply with foreign government demands for data than those made by their home country   the approach taken in the recent past   negotiating with technology companies and hoping that they eventually will assist law enforcement out of a sense of civic duty   is unlikely to work   he said at the u s  naval academy on tuesday
