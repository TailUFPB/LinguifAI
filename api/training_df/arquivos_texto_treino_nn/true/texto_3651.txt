dubai  reuters    the images from the same night broadcast around the middle east speak as loudly as the words  on the one hand  the young people of iran  dancing in the streets to mark the re election of a pragmatist  men and women together  on the other  the president of the united states  swaying through an all male  sword dance  under the stars with the absolute rulers of saudi arabia  where publicly calling for any form of political change risks prosecution  president donald trump told admiring arab absolute monarchs and military strongmen in a gilt chamber at the weekend that he wanted  peace  security and prosperity   and the united states was not there to tell them how to run their own countries  he joined them in berating their arch foe iran  and signed a   billion arms sale to saudi arabia that put him firmly on one side of the sectarian divide fuelling most of the middle east s wars  the contrast between the two scenes was noted by iran s newly re elected president  hassan rouhani  who has sought to reach out to the west while batting back hardliners at home   buying arms or building weapons won t make a country powerful   rouhani told a news conference on monday   the foundation of power is national strength and this only happens through elections  trump saw millions of iranians took part in an election  but he visited a country whose people have not seen a ballot box and don t know what an election is    pre obama era on steroids  trump s attempt to orchestrate a muslim and arab coalition against iran was a repudiation of the regional policy of his predecessor barack obama  whose administration held the first direct talks with tehran since the  islamic revolution  although washington and tehran were still a long way from normalizing their relations  obama reached an accord to lift sanctions in return for iran curbing its nuclear program  which trump repeatedly slated as  the worst deal ever signed   by swinging american policy back to firm support for the sunni arab states  trump has jettisoned that carefully constructed balance  said jean marc rickli  head of global risk and resilience at the geneva centre for security policy    we are back in the pre obama era  on steroids   he said   under obama you had this attempt of the usa playing the external balancer in the region  now the regional balancer has gone  the balancer has chosen his camp   just as dramatically  trump also repudiated the policies of obama s republican predecessor george w  bush  who promised to spread democracy across the middle east in a landmark  speech that declared  freedom can be the future of every nation   trump told his audience of autocrats   we are not here to lecture you  we are not here to tell other people how to live  what to do  who to be or how to worship   washington s alliance with the mainly sunni muslim countries of the arab world against shi ite iran is decades old  but in practice the united states has had to improvise in recent years when choosing its friends in a more complex middle east  where enemies can appear on either side of the sectarian divide  washington and tehran are still frequently on opposing sides  most notably in syria  where iran supports the government of president bashar al assad  but elsewhere  notably iraq  u s  forces are fighting on the same side as shi ites close to iran  obama s outreach to tehran reflected that reality  but those subtleties were cast aside on sunday when trump nodded approvingly as saudi king salman described iran as the  tip of the spear  of terrorism in the middle east  a senior u s  official defended the initiative  citing  a common threat from terrorist organizations as well as from iranian subversion throughout the region   in fact  most of the militant groups u s  troops have fought in iraq  afghanistan  and elsewhere since the sept     attacks on new york and washington  such as al qaeda  islamic state and the taliban  are sunni muslims who consider shi ite iran their enemy  the timing of trump s uncompromising call for a u s  backed axis against iran was particularly awkward because it coincided with the re election of rouhani  swept to a second term on his promises to seek rapprochement with the west  although democracy in iran has clear limits   all candidates must be vetted by a hardline body and the unelected supreme leader can veto policies of the elected government   it still goes further than in most of the countries that attended trump s speech  a fact noticed across the region  u s  arms deals for iran s sunni foes help bolster the case of rouhani s hardline opponents  who say any detente with the west is dangerous folly  the riyadh summit showed that the  passivity  of rouhani s government  has emboldened the enemies of iran   wrote hossein shariatmadari  editor in chief of kayhan  a newspaper closely associated with security hardliners who opposed rouhani           small and weak countries that could not imagine a fight with iran  are now publicly talking about forming a military alliance against it   the revolutionary guards  irgc   the powerful iranian security force that supported rouhani s hardline opponent in the election  has the power to stir up confrontation across the region to undermine rouhani at home   all the indicators point to a further arms race in the region and on the rhetorical level we are on a path of escalation   said rickli   you just need a small trigger that can escalate the situation on the ground    i would not be surprised to see an increase in hostilities in syria and yemen  also  the irgc might want to foster pro shi a groups in bahrain and some parts of kuwait to regain power after the elections   rickli said  putting a huge arms deal at the center of the visit also plays into the hands of foes who say u s  policy is driven mainly by money  saudi arabia is both the world s biggest exporter of oil and one of the world s biggest importers of military hardware made in the west  trump boasted about the jobs that would be created at home by the arms deals he signed   we will make sure to help our saudi friends to get a good deal from our great american defense companies  the greatest anywhere in the world   trump said in his speech   doubling down on saudi arabia has a lot to do with trade and investment considerations  the supporting allies  anti terrorism and anti iranian rhetoric provides a cover for that   said richard dalton a former uk ambassador in the middle east  but the policy could be counter productive  he said   furthering more enmity with iran  rather than seeking common ground and interests at a time when iran is ready to reach out diplomatically on the region s long term problems  is going to work against the long term aim of a peaceful and stable middle east
