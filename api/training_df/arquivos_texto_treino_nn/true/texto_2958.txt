washington  reuters    the u s  congress will need to raise the nation s debt limit by early to mid october to avoid defaulting on loan payments  the congressional budget office said in a report on thursday  treasury secretary steve mnuchin has suggested his agency could hit the debt ceiling in september  and has encouraged congress to raise the limit before the lawmakers go on their august recess  republican leaders in congress have begun having bipartisan discussions on the matter in the house   the u s  government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from washington spending more than it collects in taxes  only congress can raise that limit   the updated deadline will do little to diminish the urgency in congress to act on the debt ceiling  lawmakers will be still be pressured to tackle the increase before september  when funding the government will become their primary focus  the cbo report pointed to slower than expected tax receipts this year  a factor that mnuchin has cited as a reason to raise the debt ceiling sooner   lower tax payments were cited also as a factor in an increase in the deficit estimate  the cbo increased the deficit estimate for the current fiscal year to   billion  a   billion increase from its january estimate  the report factors in only current law that has been approved by congress  and does not include proposals that have been made by president donald trump in his budget proposal released earlier this year  congress continues to struggle with completing its hefty to do list  in addition to raising the debt ceiling  congress must pass a government spending bill before the end of september or face a government shutdown in october  this aligns the deadlines for the debt limit and the spending bill  creating the potential for them to become intertwined  congressional leaders have expressed a desire to see the two kept separate to avoid getting the debt ceiling increase caught up in the politics of government spending   congress also is trying to repeal the affordable care act healthcare law and to overhaul the tax code   two efforts that have stalled and consumed more time than was initially expected  and there still are forces pushing against the effort to find agreement on the debt ceiling  including some republicans who say an increase in the limit should accompany a cut in spending  and there are democrats who have warned they will not  contribute votes to legislation increasing the level if tax cuts for the rich add to the deficit
