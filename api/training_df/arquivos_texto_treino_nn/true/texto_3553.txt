brussels  reuters    u s  president donald trump on thursday intensified his accusations that nato allies were not spending enough on defense and warned of more attacks like this week s manchester bombing unless the alliance did more to stop militants  in unexpectedly abrupt remarks as nato leaders stood alongside him  trump said certain member countries owed  massive amounts of money  to the united states and nato   even though allied contributions are voluntary  with multiple budgets  his scripted comments contrasted with nato s choreographed efforts to play up the west s unity by inviting trump to unveil a memorial to the sept      attacks on the united states at the new nato headquarters building in brussels   terrorism must be stopped in its tracks  or the horror you saw in manchester and so many other places will continue forever   trump said  referring to monday s suicide bombing in the english city that killed  people  including children   these grave security concerns are the same reason that i have been very  very direct     in saying that nato members must finally contribute their fair share   trump said  nato secretary general jens stoltenberg defended trump  saying that although he was  blunt  he had  a very plain and clear message on the expectations  of allies   but one senior diplomat said trump  who left the leaders  dinner before it ended to fly to italy for friday s group of seven summit  said the remarks did not go down well at all   this was not the right place or time   the diplomat said of the very public harangue   we are left with nothing else but trying to put a brave face on it    in another unexpected twist  trump called on nato  an organization founded on collective defense against the soviet threat  to include limiting immigration in its tasks  and trump did say that the united states  will never forsake the friends who stood by our side  but nato leaders had hoped he would more explicitly support the mutual defense rules of a  military alliance s he called  obsolete  during his campaign   instead  he returned to a grievance about europe s drop in defense spending since the end of the cold war and failed to publicly commit to nato s founding article v rule which stipulates that an attack on one ally is an attack against all   twenty three of the  member nations are still not paying what they should be paying for their defense   trump said  standing by a piece of the wreckage of the twin towers   this is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the united states  and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years   trump said as the other leaders watched  nicholas burns  a former long time diplomat and ambassador to nato from    now a professor at harvard s kennedy school of government  said every u s  president since harry truman had pledged support for article v and that the united states would defend europe  white house spokesman sean spicer said trump was   percent  committed to collective defense   we are not playing cutesie with this  he is fully committed   spicer said  praise was always going to be in short supply after trump s sharp election campaign criticism of the alliance  which he blamed for not doing more to combat terrorism  last year  trump threatened to abandon u s  allies in europe if they did not spend enough on defense  comments that were particularly unnerving for the ex soviet baltic states on russia s border which fear moscow might try a repeat of its  annexation of ukraine s crimea  although he has since softened his tone in phone calls and meetings with western leaders  trump s sharp words on thursday recalled his awkward meeting with angela merkel in march  when he pressed the german chancellor for germany to meet nato s military spending target  nato diplomats planned to placate trump with a pledge on thursday to agree to national plans by the end of this year showing how nato allies will meet a promise to spend  percent of economic output every year on defense by   but trump increased the pressure  calling that agreement made at a summit in wales in   the bare minimum    even  percent of gdp is insufficient      percent is the bare minimum for confronting today s very real and very vicious threats   trump said  he also made his presence felt at his first nato summit  literally  pushing his way past montenegro s prime minister  dusko markovic  whose country joins the organization next month  in footage that went viral  spicer said he had not seen the video but assumed the u s  president was moving to his designated spot  nato nonetheless strived to impress trump with allied jets flying overhead and a walk through the new glass headquarters  which replaces a  prefab structure  trump  a real estate magnate  called the building  beautiful  and joked that he did not dare ask how much it cost
