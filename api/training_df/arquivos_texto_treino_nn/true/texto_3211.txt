 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump has given defense secretary jim mattis the authority to set troop levels in afghanistan  a u s  official told reuters on tuesday  opening the door for future troop increases requested by the u s  commander   the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said no immediate decision had been made about the troop levels  which are now set at about     the pentagon declined to comment   the decision is similar to one announced in april that applied to u s  troop levels in iraq and syria  and came as mattis warned congress the u s  backed afghan forces were not beating the taliban despite more than  years of war    we are not winning in afghanistan right now   mattis said in testimony to the senate armed services committee earlier on tuesday   and we will correct this as soon as possible  commentary  why a troop surge in afghanistan is a terrible idea mattis said the taliban were  surging  at the moment  something he said he intended to address   a former u s  official said such a decision might allow the white house to argue that it was not micromanaging as much as the administration of former president barack obama was sometimes accused of doing   critics say delegating too much authority to the military does not shield trump from political responsibility during battlefield setbacks and could reduce the chances for diplomats to warn of potential blowback from military decisions   it has been four months since army general john nicholson  who leads u s  and international forces in afghanistan  said he needed  a few thousand  additional forces  some potentially drawn from u s  allies   current and former u s  officials say discussions revolve around adding   to   troops  those forces are expected to be largely comprised of trainers to support afghan forces  as well as air crews   deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against taliban fighters   some u s  officials have questioned the benefit of sending more troops to afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide  much less create stability and security  to date  more than   americans have been killed and more than   wounded since the war began in    any increase of several thousand troops would leave american forces in afghanistan well below their  peak of more than   troops   the afghan government was assessed by the u s  military to control or influence just   percent of afghanistan s  districts as of feb    a nearly  percentage point decrease from the same time in   according to data released by the u s  special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction   a truck bomb explosion in kabul last month killed more than  people  making it the deadliest attack in the afghan capital since the taliban were ousted in  by a nato led coalition after ruling the country for five years   on saturday  three u s  soldiers were killed when an afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern afghanistan   the broader regional u s  strategy for afghanistan remains unclear  mattis promised on tuesday to brief lawmakers on a new war strategy by mid july that is widely expected to call for thousands more u s  troops   senator john mccain  the chairman of the armed forces committee  pressed mattis on the deteriorating situation during the tuesday hearing  saying the united states had an urgent need for  a change in strategy  and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around     we recognize the need for urgency   mattis said
