san francisco  reuters    the trump administration s refusal to publicly accuse russia and others in a wave of politically motivated hacking attacks is creating a policy vacuum that security experts fear will encourage more cyber warfare  in the past three months  hackers broke into official websites in qatar  helping to create a regional crisis  suspected north korean backed hackers closed down british hospitals with ransomware  and a cyber attack that researchers attribute to russia deleted data on thousands of computers in the ukraine  yet neither the united states nor the  member nato military alliance have publicly blamed national governments for those attacks  president donald trump has also refused to accept conclusions of u s  intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the  u s  elections using cyber warfare methods to help the new york businessman win   the white house is currently embroiled in a cyber crisis of existential proportion  and for the moment probably just wants  cyber  to go away  at least as it relates to politics   said kenneth geers  a security researcher who until recently lived in ukraine and works at nato s think tank on cyber defense   this will have unfortunate side effects for international cyber security   without calling out known perpetrators  more hacking attacks are inevitable  former officials said    i see no dynamics of deterrence   said ex white house cyber security officer jason healey  now at columbia university   the government retreat is underscored by the departure at the end of july of chris painter  the official responsible for coordinating u s  diplomacy on cyber security  no replacement has been named and the future of the position in the state department is in flux  some of trump s cyber officials have publicly highlighted a strategy to focus less on building global norms and more on bilateral agreements  trump and the kremlin have said russia and the united states are in discussions on creating a cyber security group  but at the big black hat and def con security conferences this week in las vegas the u s  government will have an unusually light footprint  past government speakers have included a head of the national security agency and senior homeland security officials   a session featuring u s  law enforcement officials discussing the purported theft by russia of hundreds of millions of yahoo account credentials was pulled at the last minute  a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of investigation said the presentation was canceled  because the yahoo expert slated to talk  deputy assistant director eric sporre  had been reassigned to run the tampa fbi office  the policy vacuum left by the united states is also affecting private security firms  which say they have grown more cautious in publicly attributing cyber attacks to nation states lest they draw fire from the trump administration   trump suggested in an april interview that the security firm crowdstrike  which worked on investigating the election hack of the democratic national committee  might not be trustworthy because he was told it was controlled by a ukrainian  it is not  cyber policy veterans are particularly alarmed about the lack of u s  and nato response to the destructive attack  dubbed notpetya  in june that struck computers worldwide but was especially harmful for ukraine  which is in armed conflict with russia in the east of the country  cyber security experts  such as jim lewis of the center for strategic and international studies  a government veteran who advised former president barack obama  believe russia carried out the attack  the russian defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment  lewis and others predicted that trump will not publicly accuse russia  and nato has only said it appears to be the work of a government agency somewhere   if you are not ringing alarm bells in an eloquent way  then i think you re dropping the ball   said retired cia officer daniel hoffman  who worked on russian issues   when we fail to do enough  that just emboldens them
