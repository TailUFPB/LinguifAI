washington  reuters    the white house will take a lead role in crafting legislation to overhaul the u s  tax code  eyeing an august target date as president donald trump seeks his first legislative victory following the failure last week of a long promised bill to undo obamacare  trump s pledge to cut taxes  including a lowering of the rates paid by corporations  was a pillar of his  presidential campaign and provided much of the fuel for the heady stock market rally that followed his nov   victory  the white house said on monday it was moving ahead with tax reform  calling it a  huge priority  for the republican president and  something that he feels very strongly about    obviously  we re driving the train on this   white house spokesman sean spicer said during a briefing  adding   we re going to work with congress on this   spicer noted that treasury secretary steven mnuchin has talked about august as a target date for tax legislation  but said the timetable could slip depending on how quickly a consensus could be reached  getting a broad tax bill passed by congress and on trump s desk to be signed into law will not be easy  especially after intra party differences torpedoed the healthcare legislation  after the trump administration fiercely lobbied for it  republicans for seven years had promised to dismantle  democratic former president barack obama s affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  and the trump administration made it its top priority when trump took office in january  but the effort collapsed on friday when members of the freedom caucus  the most conservative lawmakers of the house of representatives  refused to support the bill  which was also backed by house speaker paul ryan  the stinging defeat alarmed investors who began reassessing the chances for passage of the tax agenda this year  major u s  stock indexes opened sharply lower on monday before paring losses  with the dow jones and the s p  ending only moderately down   house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady  the top house republican tasked with tax reform  said over the weekend that the white house should start with proposals already in the house instead of crafting a separate bill   my point is that the trump tax plan and the house republican plan started at  percent the same  it think it s grown to  percent or better   brady told reporters on monday   i think it s critical for the white house and republicans in congress to agree on pro growth tax reform together and move forward together as well   he added   analysts at bank of america merrill lynch predicted in a research note that a tax bill   if passed at all  could be a very watered down version of current proposals   the white house over the weekend dangled the idea of a compromise tax restructuring that could win support from moderate democrats  white house chief of staff reince priebus on sunday said such a package could include middle class tax cuts  spicer on monday remained vague on how much trump would allow the federal deficit to grow as a result of the tax cuts   it s a really early question to be asking at this point   spicer said  the u s  tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since   during the administration of republican president ronald reagan  democratic senator christopher coons signaled his party would be open to discussing tax legislation if it was not merely a giveaway to the rich  democrats had fought former president george w  bush s tax policies for that reason    if we have a move toward tax reform that could strengthen manufacturing  strengthen our exports and provide tax relief to the middle class   not overwhelmingly to the wealthiest   there s a menu for us to start talking about it   the delaware senator told msnbc s  morning joe  program  although winning over democrats may be tough  the alternative   getting republicans to vote as a bloc   could be a hard road in light of the healthcare rebellion by republican lawmakers   trump is stuck  he can t cajole the arch conservatives in the republican party  and at the same time  my sense is the democrats don t want to throw him a bone either  so it is going to be difficult   said jack ablin  chief investment officer at bmo private bank in chicago  one republican lawmaker  representative tom cole of oklahoma  suggested congress focus first on such things as getting a  realistic budget  done and passing legislation to raise the national debt ceiling   and then start on tax reform   cole told msnbc s  morning joe  program   but start with real hearings and start in a way that everybody at least at the outset is a potential player    representative ted poe of texas  who resigned from the freedom caucus after the healthcare debacle  said that getting an infrastructure spending package   another key piece of trump s legislative agenda intended to spur economic growth   through congress will be no  slam dunk    it s going to be very  very difficult   poe told cnn s  new day  program
