 reuters    a texas law that requires voters to show identification before casting ballots was enacted with the intent to discriminate against black and hispanic voters  a u s  federal judge ruled on monday  the decision by u s  district judge nelva gonzales ramos came after an appeals court last year said the  law had an outsized impact on minority voters  the court sent the case back to ramos to determine if lawmakers intentionally wrote the legislation to be discriminatory  ramos said in a  page decision that evidence  establishes that a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage  of the measure   the terms of the bill were unduly strict   she added  spokesmen for texas attorney general ken paxton jr  and governor greg abbott  both republicans  could not be reached for comment  in january  after the supreme court declined to hear the case  paxton said it was a common sense law to prevent voter fraud  the ruling on voter id comes about a month after two federal judges ruled that texas lawmakers drew up three u s  congressional districts to undermine the influence of hispanic voters  the measure requires voters to present photo identification such as a driver s license  passport or military id card  plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters  including minorities  hardest because they are less likely to have identification  they contend the measure is used by republicans to suppress voters who typically align with democrats  the legislation has been in effect since  despite the legal challenges  ramos said the law had met criteria set by the u s  supreme court to show intent that included its discriminatory impact  a pattern not explainable on other than racial grounds  texas  history of discriminatory practices and the law s unusually swift passage  kristen clarke  president of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  one of the plaintiffs  said the ruling showed other states that discriminatory laws would not stand up to legal scrutiny   this is a good ruling that confirms what we have long known  that texas  voter id law stands as one of the most discriminatory voting restrictions of its kind   she said  in a shift from its stance under former president barack obama  the u s  justice department dropped a discrimination claim against the law in february  the department said that the state legislature was considering changing the law in ways that might correct shortcomings
