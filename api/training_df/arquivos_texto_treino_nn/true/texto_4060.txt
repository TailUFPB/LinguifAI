washington  reuters    the u s  congress inched toward a deal to fund the government through september but was preparing to possibly extend a midnight friday deadline in order to wrap up negotiations and avoid an imminent government shutdown  the one week extension would give leading republicans and democrats  a little breathing room  to finish negotiations and present their plan for spending around   trillion through the rest of the fiscal year to rank and file lawmakers  according to a house of representatives source familiar with the talks  negotiators were racing against the clock to clear away remaining disputes in the massive spending bill  the arduous talks have produced at least two major victories for democrats so far  even though they are the minority party in congress  president donald trump gave in to democratic demands that the spending bill not include money to start building the wall he wants to erect on the u s  mexico border  trump has said the  big  beautiful  powerful  wall is needed to block illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country  mexico has adamantly rejected trump s assertion that it would pay for the wall  democrats have also gotten the administration to agree to continue funding  at least for now  for a major component of the affordable care act  even though trump campaigned on a vow to end the program  commonly known as obamacare  administration officials had threatened in recent days to pull the plug on subsidies for low income people enrolled in the  healthcare law  former democratic president barack obama s signature domestic achievement   while we agreed to go ahead and make the     payments for now  we haven t made a final decision about future commitments   a white house official said  anthem inc  one of the largest insurers on the obamacare exchanges  said on wednesday that without the government payments  premiums would increase  percent next year and that it might have to withdraw from some regions and states  both concessions robbed trump from claiming some major legislative successes he had hoped to achieve in his first  days in office  which will be marked on saturday  if congress cannot agree to either a short stopgap funding bill or a longer term one by midnight friday  federal agencies will run out of money and likely have to abruptly lay off hundreds of thousands of federal government workers until an appropriations bill is enacted  many policymakers are nervous about a repeat of   when the government was shuttered for  days  it was unclear whether republicans might prevail on their demand for a significant increase in defense spending without similar increases to other domestic programs  trump has proposed a   billion spending boost for the pentagon for the rest of this fiscal year   our major concerns in these negotiations have been about funding for the wall and uncertainty about     payments crucial to the stability of the marketplaces under the affordable care act  we ve now made progress on both of these fronts   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement  she added that other disagreements must be ironed out   we re getting really close   house speaker paul ryan  a republican  told reporters earlier on wednesday  adding that negotiators were  getting down to the last  final  areas of disagreement  trump s push for a border wall  a signature campaign proposal  is seen by most democrats and many republicans as an ineffective way of securing u s  borders  the trump administration likely will seek money for the wall in legislation funding the government for the fiscal year starting oct    but lawmakers are likely to balk again  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican from the coal mining state of kentucky  threw his weight behind a plan democrats were insisting on to make a healthcare program for coal miners permanent  it was unclear if ryan would go along  even though trump s fellow republicans control both chambers of congress  they only have  seats in the senate  to amass the  votes needed there to pass a spending bill  republicans will have to win the support of at least some democratic lawmakers  democrats have been seeking immediate assistance for a funding gap in puerto rico s medicaid program  the federal health insurance program for the poor  saying it is in such bad shape that  million people are set to lose healthcare  also unclear is what  riders  that set new policy might be tucked into the legislation  past riders have touched on areas such as banning the securities and exchange commission from requiring corporations to disclose political donations  democrats said they were worried republicans could try to attach language limiting family planning funds or undo wall street reforms enacted after the   financial crisis
