anaheim  calif   reuters    the federal government has not notified u s  state election officials if their voting systems were targeted by suspected russian hackers during the  presidential campaign  and the information will likely never be made public  a top state election chief told reuters   you re absolutely never going to learn it  because we don t even know it   judd choate  state election director for colorado and president of the national association of state election directors  said in an interview on thursday during the group s summer conference  nearly  months after republican donald trump s upset presidential victory over democrat hillary clinton  choate said he had not spoken to a single state election director who had been told by the u s  department of homeland security if their state was among those attacked  the lack of information sharing on the election breaches reflects the difficulty state and federal officials have had in working together to protect u s  voting from cyber threats  all u s  elections are run by state and local governments  which have varying degrees of technical competence  dhs told congress in june that  states were targeted during the  presidential race  and that while a small number were breached  there was no evidence any votes were manipulated   other reports have said  states were targeted  choate said he had heard both numbers mentioned  several lawmakers  including senator mark warner  the top democrat on the u s  senate intelligence committee  have expressed frustration at dhs  refusal to identify which states had been targeted  arizona and illinois confirmed last year that hackers had targeted their voter registration systems  in a statement  the dhs did not refute that states had not been notified if they were targeted  adding the agency informed the owners or operators of systems potentially victimized  who may not necessarily  be state election officials   dhs was working with senior state election officials  to determine how best to share this information while protecting the integrity of investigations and the confidentiality of system owners   the agency said  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that the kremlin orchestrated an operation that included hacking and online propaganda intended to tilt the november election in trump s favor  several congressional committees are investigating and special counsel robert mueller is leading a separate probe into the russia matter  including whether moscow colluded with the trump campaign  russia has denied election meddling and trump has denied any collusion  the four day conference of election directors was originally supposed to be about issues like voter registration  but took a sharp turn following the election hacking   after the  election  we all had to be lawyers   choate said   and now after the  election  we all have to be cyber security experts   dhs representatives at the event fended off questions about whether the federal government would be prepared to mobilize sufficient support for the states in the event of a catastrophic cyber attack near or during the  elections    we want to make sure we learn from the missteps that may have happened in  and we want to make sure we continue building on the things we did that were right   robert gatlin  a dhs cyber official  said during a panel discussion  gatlin said the agency was working with u s  intelligence agencies to  downgrade  more classified information so it could be shared with the states  information about cyber attacks is typically guarded by a high classification because it may involve nation state involvement or contain sensitive sources and methods  he said  legislation recently approved by the senate intelligence committee would require the director of national intelligence to sponsor top secret security clearance for eligible election officials in each state  something the national association of secretaries of state has advocated  the bill would also require dhs to submit a report to congress detailing cyber attacks and attempted cyber attacks by foreign governments on u s  election infrastructure during the  election  choate said communication about cyber threats had improved with federal agencies since the election and the decision by the outgoing obama administration in january to elevate voting systems to a  critical infrastructure designation    prior to the election  some state officials worried that closer oversight of election systems represented a dangerous federal intrusion into local affairs
