taxes and the estate tax on inherited assets  senators said  providing few details  john cornyn  the no   senate republican  told reporters that senators would be briefed on the bill on thursday before its release   house and senate republicans are working on separate plans for the biggest overhaul of the u s  tax code since the   president donald trump and his house allies have proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  one of the costliest features of the wide ranging house plan  the tax overhaul is a priority for trump  who says it will boost economic

proposals in the republican tax legislation as giveaways to large corporations and the rich  senator orrin hatch  chairman of the tax writing finance committee  told reporters he would prefer not to delay a corporate tax cut by a year  which some lawmakers said was a possibility   i d prefer to get it done   he said  financial markets have rallied since trump s stunning election victory in november   partly on expectations that he and congress would slash taxes on businesses  stock markets closed little changed on wednesday  with investors focused on chances for a tax bill becoming law   i do think there s disappointment with republicans kicking the tax bill around      some of the things leaking out are not encouraging   said bucky hellwig  senior vice president at bb t wealth management in birmingham  alabama  the latest version of the house bill would add    trillion to the federal deficit over  years  said the nonpartisan congressional budget office  which tallies the costs of legislation  that would violate a rule requiring the legislation to add no more than    trillion to the deficit  but representative kevin brady  republican chairman of the house tax committee  said he would revise the legislation on thursday to bring it into compliance   a report from the nonpartisan tax policy center think tank said the biggest tax cuts would go to high income households under the current bill  which would raise taxes on more than one in four taxpayers by  because of the expiration of certain benefits including a   family credit   top earners with incomes of more than

their tax bill   schumer said  there are enough republicans from high tax states in the house to torpedo the tax bill  given that democrats broadly oppose it  republicans  who have a slim   majority in the senate  also may need support from democrats to pass their version  the house and senate must agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president  republican senator susan collins  whose vote is crucial  declined to say if the senate bill would duplicate the house s proposed estate tax repeal  but she told reporters   it s certainly true that i expressed reservations about having complete repeal     a washington tax expert raised concern about a house provision to create a  percent tax rate for  pass through  businesses  saying it would do little to help small business
