seoul pyongyang  reuters    u s  vice president mike pence warned north korea on monday that recent american military strikes in syria and afghanistan showed president donald trump s resolve should not be questioned  but pyongyang vowed to continue missile and nuclear tests  after a huge display of missiles in pyongyang and a failed north korean missile test during the weekend  u s  officials praised china for stepping up efforts to rein in north korea  beijing s neighbor and ally  but pence and south korea s acting president  hwang kyo ahn  said they would proceed with the early deployment to south korea of the u s  thaad missile defense system  in spite of chinese objections  at a white house easter celebration on monday  trump was asked if he had a message for north korean leader kim jong un  and replied   gotta behave   but senior north korean officials remained defiant  north korea s deputy representative to the united nations  kim in ryong  accused washington of creating  a situation where nuclear war could break out an any time  and said pyongyang s next nuclear test would take place  at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary    graphic   carl vinson strike group  tmsnrt rs    graphic   north korea s nuclear program  tmsnrt rs   north korea s vice foreign minister han song ryol told the bbc that missiles would continue to be tested on  a weekly  monthly and yearly basis    kim song gyong  director general of the european department of north korea s foreign ministry  told reuters in pyongyang that if washington made  the slightest movement  to make a nuclear strike on north korea  pyongyang would strike first and  destroy the aggressors without any mercy   he went on to clarify that the approach of a u s  naval strike force led by the nuclear powered aircraft carrier carl vinson to korean waters would not be considered enough to constitute  the slightest movement   korean tensions have escalated following repeated north korean missile tests and concerns that pyongyang may soon conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test in defiance of u n  sanctions  washington is increasingly worried about north korean efforts to develop a nuclear tipped missile that could hit the u s  mainland  speaking alongside hwang  pence said the world had witnessed trump s resolve in the past two weeks  which saw a u s  missile attack on a syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non nuclear bomb on islamic state in afghanistan   north korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the united states in this region   pence said on what was his first stop of a four nation asia tour intended to show that trump is not turning his back on the increasingly volatile part of the world  pence  whose father served in the   korean war  visited the north south border on monday and said washington would stand by its  ironclad alliance  with south korea   all options are on the table to achieve the objectives and ensure the stability of the people of this country   he told reporters as tinny propaganda music floated across from the north korean side of the so called demilitarized zone  dmz   the trump administration has said that military action remains an option for dealing with north korea  but mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in south korea and japan and among u s  troops there  u s  officials say the trump administration s main focus is on tougher economic sanctions to try to get pyongyang to abandon its weapons programs     trump himself  when asked on monday if he was considering military action  told fox news channel he didn t want to  telegraph  his plans like the previous administration   we ll see what happens  i hope things work out well   he said but added that the united states had tried to engage the north koreans in talks for a long time   on sunday  trump s national security adviser  h r  mcmaster  said that the united states  its allies and china were working on a range of responses to north korea s latest missile test  citing what he called an international consensus to act  he indicated trump was not considering military action for now  despite the dispatch the carrier group  u s  officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo  a global ban on north korea s airline  intercepting cargo ships and punishing chinese banks doing business with pyongyang  they say greater chinese cooperation is vital   white house spokesman sean spicer said china had taken some  very helpful  steps  although it remained to be seen how effective these would be  asked if trump had a  red line  on north korea  spicer said the president did not believe these worked   susan thornton  acting u s  assistant secretary of state for east asia  said secretary of state rex tillerson and china s top diplomat  state councilor yang jiechi  agreed in a phone call on sunday on the need for strict enforcement of u n  resolutions and for international action to press pyongyang  to cease provocative actions and recommit to peaceful denuclearization   thornton said any new north korean nuclear test  would draw a pretty significant international response    we re definitely not seeking conflict or regime change   she said   but we are committed to defending our people and our allies should it be necessary   pence is expected to discuss korean tensions with japanese prime minister shinzo abe on tuesday when he travels to tokyo for economic talks with finance minister taro aso  he will also visit jakarta and sydney  his economic discussions will be closely watched to see how hard a line washington is prepared to take on trade  trump campaigned on an  america first  platform  and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations like china and japan  but trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues  saying he would cut a better trade deal with china if it exerts influence on north korea  china has appeared increasingly frustrated with pyongyang  speaking out against its weapons tests and supporting united nations sanctions  while repeatedly calling for talks  china banned imports of north korean coal  the country s most important export  in february  and chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the north  however  beijing says the crisis is one between the united states and north korea   chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said the situation was  highly sensitive  complicated and high risk  and all sides should  avoid taking provocative actions
