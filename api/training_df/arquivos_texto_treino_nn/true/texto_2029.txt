washington los angeles  reuters    a u s  energy department report calls for incentives to boost coal fired and nuclear power plants following a slew of closures that it said undermined reliable sources of electricity   the findings of the study  released late on wednesday  drew praise from the coal and nuclear industries and a mixed reaction from renewable energy groups   some of which said the report s recommendations could help them too   president donald trump has promised to revive the ailing coal mining sector but has also said he welcomes all forms of energy development to shore up domestic production  energy secretary rick perry commissioned the grid study in april to evaluate whether  regulatory burdens  imposed by past administrations  including that of former president barack obama  had hurt the grid by forcing shutdowns of baseload plants  which provide nonstop power  like those fired by coal and nuclear fuel  obama introduced regulations intended to slash emissions of carbon dioxide  which are blamed for climate change  this accelerated the retirement of coal fired power plants and bolstered the nascent solar and wind sectors  which depend heavily on weather conditions for their power output       it is apparent that in today s competitive markets certain regulations and subsidies are having a large impact on the functioning of markets  and thereby challenging our power generation mix   perry said in a letter introducing the study   it is important for policy makers to consider their intended and unintended effects   the study  conducted by the department s staff  said cheap natural gas was the main driver of the closure of baseload coal and nuclear plants  a trend that was putting areas of the country at greater risk of power outages   the department recommended giving baseload plants pricing advantages for their power  as well as making it easier and cheaper to get permits to build more such projects  the report differed from an earlier draft  which had said big increases in renewable power generation remained possible without undermining grid reliability  and which did not propose added support for baseload producers   the administration had not yet reviewed the earlier draft  which was written by department staff   some coal and nuclear energy groups welcomed the final report s findings   this is a much needed  pragmatic look at u s  electricity reliability and resilience  including the priority of maintaining critical clean baseload power as electricity markets change   said rich powell  director of clearpath  which advocates for nuclear and hydropower  renewable fuels supporters had a wide range of reactions  the center for biological diversity called the report s recommendations  dangerously misguided   and the sierra club also bashed the study  but america s biggest solar and wind power associations said they felt the study contained elements that were positive such as not singling out renewable energy as a big problem   the report did not    lay the demise of coal at the feet of renewable energy  and that is an important finding   abigail ross hopper  president of the solar energy industries association  wrote in an email to the trade group s members on thursday  seia and other groups  including the american wind energy association  said wind and solar could benefit from some of the report s recommendations  such as a call for infrastructure development and market reforms  awea said in a blog post that technological advances could allow wind energy to provide reliability services  such as fast ramping to regulate the grid s frequency signal
