 reuters    u s  president donald trump used his barnstorming strategy on wednesday to try to build momentum for his first legislative initiative  a healthcare overhaul  by holding a massive rally in nashville  tennessee  reminiscent of his campaign events  back on capitol hill  republican leaders negotiated behind closed doors  held media conferences and gave cable news interviews as they tried to push forward their plan to dismantle the affordable care act  commonly called obamacare  after republican house speaker paul ryan unveiled the new plan last week  fault lines appeared within the party as some conservatives said it did not go far enough and others rejected it entirely   trump used campaign like language in his wednesday night speech  pledging  to repeal and replace horrible  disastrous obamacare   speaking to reporters aboard presidential plane air force one after the rally  trump expressed optimism about his plan s chances in congress    we re going to come up with something  we always do   he said  republicans control both congress and the white house for the first time in a decade  but the overhaul still faces political battles to be fought by a president new to governing  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters before the rally the trump administration had been in talks with ryan and congressional leaders and was flooding the media with interviews with administration officials to help advance the plan  ryan  the top republican in the house of representatives  also continued to champion the legislation  saying on cable news he was open to making  improvements and refinements   but also adding  the major components are staying intact   he told a news conference later in the evening the house would hold votes on repealing and replacing obamacare but refused to provide a timetable  two house committees approved the bill s provisions with no changes last week  the budget committee will try on thursday to unify the plan into a single bill for consideration on the house floor  republicans cannot afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass  three committee republicans are members of the hardline conservative house freedom caucus  signs emerged on wednesday that the white house was winning over reluctant conservatives who initially questioned the legislation on the grounds that it too closely resembled obamacare  the signature domestic policy achievement of former president barack obama  the administration indicated it was open to revisiting the plan s treatment of medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor  during a meeting with a conservative wing of the party  specifically  conservatives want obamacare s expansion of medicaid to end sooner than proposed in the ryan plan  and want to introduce medicaid work requirements for able bodied adults without children  state governments run medicaid with reimbursements from the federal government  obamacare expanded its eligibility and increased funding for it  which enabled about  million previously uninsured americans to obtain medical insurance   vice president mike pence advocated for the plan earlier on wednesday behind closed doors with the republican study committee  a large group of house conservatives  republican representative phil roe said after the pence meeting the bill would probably be changed to move up the end of the medicaid expansion by one year  to   the conservative group s members were  very close to signing off  on the legislation  its leader  representative mark walker  told reporters  speaking on cnn  ryan mentioned  giving states better chances at more flexibility with medicaid   but provided no details  just as the party s conservatives began expressing optimism about the proposal s fortunes  republican moderates raised concerns that tax credits currently in the bill intended to help people buy health insurance were not sufficient  representative charlie dent  following a meeting of moderate republicans with pence  told reporters that speeding up the termination of the medicaid expansion was a  non starter   senate republicans have also voiced rising unease   as written  the house bill would not pass the senate  but i believe we can fix it   senator ted cruz told reporters  republican senator lindsey graham told nbc s  today  show   it is mortally wounded   the conservative advocacy group freedomworks held a rally amid snow flurries and a frigid wind outside the capitol  where several house and senate republicans  including cruz and senator rand paul  voiced dissatisfaction with the bill  paul later told reporters   the white house has been much more open to negotiation on this  than house leaders   a libertarian  paul posted an op ed on the breitbart news website later on wednesday calling ryan s plan  obamacare lite  and suggesting smashing it to  smithereens   the u s  department of health and human services released data showing enrollment in the individual insurance plans created under obamacare has declined to   million americans  enrollment in these individual insurance plans was down by about   people from  by the end of january  it said  it is about   million people short of obama s goal for  sign ups  the government said
