atlanta  reuters    the costliest u s  congressional race in history will be decided on tuesday in suburban atlanta  where america s divisive political climate has been on display in an election seen by some analysts as a political test for president donald trump  days after a lone gunman opened fire on u s  lawmakers at a baseball team practice in virginia  a conservative group was running a tv ad in atlanta that  with no evidence  appears to link the democratic candidate  jon ossoff  to the shooting spree  ossoff called the ad  shameful  in a statement  the atlanta journal constitution newspaper reported that ossoff s republican opponent  karen handel  also condemned the ad  it was an ugly  last minute twist in the ossoff handel contest for the u s  house of representatives seat vacated by tom price  who resigned after becoming trump s secretary of the health and human services department  total spending in the georgia race for all candidates has topped   million  including tens of millions by outside groups  according to the center for responsive politics  a campaign finance watchdog in washington  d c   easily topping the previous record of    million set in a  florida race  out of the total     million has been spent on handel and ossoff  the center for responsive politics said  envelopes containing a white powder turned up last week in the home mailboxes of handel and a few neighbors  prompting a probe by the federal bureau of investigation  the washington post reported that the powder was only baking soda and both candidates now are traveling with bodyguards  the district spans affluent and increasingly diverse suburbs north of atlanta  it has elected republicans for decades  but trump carried it by only  percentage point in   ossoff    initially drew national attention with the slogan  make trump furious   inspiring volunteers from as far away as oregon to knock on doors and make phone calls for him  handel  a  year old former georgia secretary of state  has painted ossoff as an inexperienced tool of national liberal interests who does not live in the district he hopes to represent  like ossoff  handel rarely mentions trump  whatever the outcome  the race will not significantly alter the balance of power in washington  where republicans control the house by a wide margin  but victory could provide a blueprint for democrats on how to win outside of their urban  coastal strongholds   democrats fell short in special house elections earlier this year in kansas and montana  in districts that trump won by double digits  also on tuesday is a race in south carolina  which republicans are expected to win handily  for a replacement for republican mick mulvaney  now trump s budget director
