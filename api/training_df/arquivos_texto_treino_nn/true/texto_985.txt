washington new york  reuters    the white house promoted president donald trump s tax cut plan on friday with a forecast of faster u s  economic expansion and wage growth  as independent analysts said the plan would swell the budget deficit and provide little spark to the economy  the rival projections reflected the many unknowns swirling around the plan  expected to be unveiled in legislative form on wednesday  republicans were still undecided on some of the hardest parts  such as how to pay for the costly cuts proposed  weeks and possibly months of debate lie ahead for a project that trump promised to tackle in his  election campaign  in september  he unveiled a rough framework for cutting taxes  now he wants congress to approve a bill  which would mark his first major legislative victory  before the end of the year  the trump plan for tax cuts of the sort normally reserved for times of economic recession is taking shape in congress amid signs the economy is already growing briskly  gross domestic product increased at a  percent annual rate in the july september period  supported by strong business spending on equipment  the commerce department said on friday  the economic recovery begun under former president barack obama after the   recession is in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue amid a tightening labor market   it s hard to say that we need to have tax cuts at the individual level     you don t need to provide further fiscal stimulus when the economy is already strong   said bernard baumohl  chief global economist at the economic outlook group in princeton  new jersey  faced with improving economic prospects  republicans have shifted their rhetoric on tax cuts away from getting the economy moving again to keeping it on an expansion track  an analysis released by white house economic adviser kevin hassett said slashing the top federal corporate tax rate and letting businesses write off the full cost of most capital investments immediately  as proposed in the plan  would bring faster growth and higher wages  hassett s projections envisioned a  percent to  percent increase in gdp that  over  years  could represent an additional   billion to    trillion in economic output  but the tax policy center  a nonprofit washington think tank  released an analysis that concluded the trump tax plan would not produce a significant  permanent economic boost  the group said the plan would reduce federal tax revenue by roughly    trillion over the next decade and by over   trillion in the decade after that  adding significantly to a u s  national debt that already exceeds    trillion  the center said trump s tax cuts would drive new activity at first  but that the impact would be blunted in later years by rising deficits  forcing more federal borrowing to finance the tax cuts and driving up borrowing costs for the private sector  hassett told reporters he does not expect tax reform to add significantly to the deficit  but he conceded that it would become  a big negative  if economic growth failed to materialize and the debt level soared  the framework of trump s plan unveiled last month called for reducing the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  the small business rate to  percent from up to   percent and the top individual rate to  percent from   percent  it also called specifically for repealing the estate tax on inheritances and the alternative minimum tax  both of which are typically paid by the country s highest income earners  less clear were the plan s proposals to reduce the number of tax brackets  enhance the child tax credit and possibly put new limits on popular  k  retirement pension plans  because details of the unfinished tax legislation are unknown  its economic impact is unclear  said omer eisner  chief market analyst at commonwealth foreign exchange in washington  hours after the commerce department reported stronger than expected third quarter u s  economic growth of  percent  hassett said the data did not undercut the need for tax cuts  he said economic expansion and stronger stock market performance could be undermined if the republican controlled congress fails to enact the tax cuts   firms are optimistic both because of regulatory reform but also because they expect corporate tax reform and overall tax reform   hassett said   the thing that i m worried about is that if those expectations prove to be incorrect  then i would expect business capital spending to go back to a disappointing path and equity markets to decline as well   kevin brady  chairman of the u s  house of representatives tax committee  said progress was being made toward satisfying republicans who have held back support for the tax plan because it could end a deduction for state and local taxes   i m hopeful     we can find a good solution for them   brady said
