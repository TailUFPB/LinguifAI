washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on wednesday nominated carnegie mellon university professor marvin goodfriend to become a member of the federal reserve board of governors  adding a well known monetary economist to a central bank losing two of its top economic thinkers  the nomination  if confirmed by the senate  will help ensure the  member board of governors keeps at least four of those seats filled following the announced departure of fed chair janet yellen once her predecessor  current fed gov  jerome powell  is approved by the senate  along with powell  goodfriend would join recently appointed vice chair for supervision randal quarles  and fed gov  lael brainard  atop the world s most influential central bank  a former economic adviser in the administration of president ronald reagan and research director of the richmond federal reserve bank from  to   goodfriend is arguably the most conservative of trump s fed appointments yet  he has been critical of some recent fed practices including the purchase of mortgage backed securities  he has also argued that the central bank should invite more oversight from elected officials  including getting a congressional sign off on its  percent inflation target and more discussion of how its policy decisions line up with a  reference rule   those ideas are likely to find favor among conservatives on capitol hill who feel the fed has accumulated too much influence  but his writings have also defied easy description  he has argued the benefits of negative interest rates  for example  as a way to give central banks more flexibility to combat crises  rather than having to resort to unconventional means like bond buying after rates are cut to zero  perhaps most significantly  he will bring recognized academic credentials to a fed board that is losing yellen  a recognized expert on labor markets  and in october lost vice chair stanley fischer  one of the intellectual forces behind modern central banking  powell  a lawyer  was lauded by trump for his private sector experience  but also will be the first non economist to run the fed since the   goodfriend will bring to the board background in many of the same debates and intellectual fights  over inflation targeting and other issues  that fischer and yellen have participated in over the years
