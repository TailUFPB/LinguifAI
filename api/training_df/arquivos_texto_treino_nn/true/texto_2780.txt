superior  arizona  reuters    rio tinto s proposed resolution copper mine in arizona would tunnel   feet underground  where rocks radiate heat from the earth s molten core  it would suck up enough water to supply a city and leave a crater a mile and a half wide and   feet deep  planned for more than a decade  the project would be a prototype for a looming era of more invasive u s  mines as companies run out of easy to reach deposits  geologists say  it is also the project president donald trump s commerce secretary  wilbur ross  had in mind as he began crafting a  hit list  of regulations that should be killed to speed industrial permitting   a company shouldn t have to be hundreds of millions of dollars into risk money without knowing whether there is a real chance it is going to get approved   ross told reuters in a may  interview  referring to the mine  the massive project   which would be among the world s largest copper mines   underscores the dangers of weakening america s rigorous permitting process at a time mining endeavors are becoming increasingly complex and environmentally risky  and ross s citation of resolution as a poster child for suffocating regulation reflects how far the trump administration is willing to go to advance economic growth  sorting out the mine s potentially negative impacts is anything but simple  and many local residents  along with native american and environmental groups  say resolution is exactly the kind of development that cries out for intense public scrutiny   no matter how long it takes   the companies have to mitigate their risks   mitigate what people are losing   said mila besich lira  the mayor of superior  the town closest to the project  a federal government review of the project has drawn about   comments from concerned constituents   more than  times the number who gave input on the smaller rosemont copper mine nearby  the resolution mine would also give the region a big economic boost  employing   people and injecting   billion into public coffers  rio tinto  rio l  estimates  it could supply the united states with a quarter of its copper  putting this small town at the epicenter of the global metals market  trump has vowed sweep away regulations he says cost america trillions of dollars with no public benefit  the regulatory review by ross  due for release as soon as this month  is one of several parallel efforts to slash red tape  trump has also started dismantling obama era climate change regulations through executive orders  for example  and directed agencies to kill two rules for every one they create  in the meantime  congress could set the tone  a republican bill introduced early this year   and supported by rio tinto   would set a two and a half year deadline on mine permitting  a standard similar to that seen in australia and canada   rio tinto   along with the australian mining company bhp billiton  blt l   which owns a  percent stake in resolution   says it has spent  years and    billion on the project  including a decade acquiring acreage in the tonto national forest overlying the copper deposit  it is now four years into the federal regulatory review to approve new mines  a process that can take seven to  years  victoria peacey  a senior manager for environmental permitting at rio tinto  said the mine up probably won t begin operating for another decade  rio tinto acknowledges the vast scope and sensitivity of its plans   there are mines this deep  there are mines this hot  and there are mines this big  but there are no other mines this deep  this hot and this big all together   said carl hehnke  a geologist for resolution  resolution will take copper from a zone where temperatures run  degrees fahrenheit  with help from remotely controlled machines  miners will set off explosions to shatter sections of the deposit   the ore will be milled with a combination of sulfuric acid and as much as   billion gallons of water a year   enough to supply more than half the homes in the phoenix suburb of tempe  it would eventually render more than   acres of what is now the tonto national forest off limits to visitors   under the forest  in a process called  block cave mining   rio tinto will excavate material from underground  making the material above sink and creating the expected one and a half mile wide crater   that area will include a site considered sacred to the san carlos apache tribe  which has been holding annual protests against the project  if resolution s copper deposit had been discovered under private land   and not a national forest   rio tinto might have been spared the federal review and faced only state regulators  instead  the u s  forest service is leading the study  which will consider jobs  recreation  public health and wildlife  despite its substantial economic benefits to the nearby town of superior  where many homes and businesses are boarded up  residents still have their concerns   what am i going to tell my great grandkids   how this place was totally destroyed   said anna jeffries  a superior resident  during an april  public meeting with forest service officials at superior high school   mining industry lobbyists counter that they are only seeking an efficient and reasonable approval process   we are not talking in any way  shape or form about any environmental rollbacks here   said katie sweeney  general counsel for the national mining association  a trade group   we re talking about bureaucracy   the nma wants to see deadlines for permitting  along with rules requiring agencies to conduct studies simultaneously rather than consecutively  the nma and rio tinto back the bill   introduced in january by republican congressman mark amodei of nevada   that would give regulators the two and a half year deadline to approve or reject mining projects  mining companies in canada and australia applaud similar time limits in those countries  but a may  report by a government watchdog in the canadian province of british columbia found canada s mine regulation had  major gaps in resources  planning and tools  that led to  inadequate  inspections and  increasing environmental risks   commerce secretary ross told reuters in a june  phone message he believed the u s  forest service was doing  a good job in terms of rio tinto   but he added   the rest of the process has been so abysmal that rio tinto actually testified before the u s  congress  how bad the process was   ross and his spokesman did not respond to additional questions seeking examples of problems that occurred between resolution and permit issuing agencies  but his office said he was referring to congressional testimony given by rio tinto s managing director for copper and diamonds  nigel steward  in march  steward called the u s  permitting process  inefficient  and said it  presents a major barrier to the domestic sector s ability to perform to its full potential   rio tinto is advocating for more certainty in permitting timelines and improved coordination among agencies involved   along with more money for agencies  to ensure that experienced and highly skilled people are devoted to complex technical aspects of permitting   said todd malan  rio tinto s vice president for external affairs and communications for the americas  while the company supports permitting deadlines  at least one rio tinto official acknowledges that it would be hard to address the issues raised by the resolution mine in less than years   i m not necessarily saying time frames would not be helpful  but three years      that s a tight time frame   said peacey  while uncertain permitting timeframes raise financial risks for rio tinto  she said  the sometimes lengthy process also protects the public   those are people s rights   she said   this version of the story was refiled to add dropped word  to  in paragraph
