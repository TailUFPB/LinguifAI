washington  reuters    a bill passed by u s  house republicans would cause  million people to lose healthcare coverage by  while de stabilizing health insurance markets in some states and making it hard for sick people to buy insurance  a budget watchdog agency said on wednesday  the congressional budget office  a non partisan group of experts who analyze u s  legislation  said the bill would reduce federal deficits by   billion between  and   the report could give added ammunition to democrats who have accused president donald trump and congressional republicans of putting sick and low income people at risk with their effort to roll back former president barack obama s signature  healthcare law  formally known as the affordable care act but often called obamacare  the report also complicates the job of senate republicans   some of whom already have doubts about the house bill   as they craft their own healthcare legislation  republicans have sought to unravel obamacare since its passage and trump promised on the campaign trail to repeal it  saying it is too costly and an overreach by government in the healthcare market  as trump and republican leaders sought to bring wavering lawmakers on board with the house bill  they added a controversial last minute amendment that would give states leeway to drop an obamacare requirement that forces insurers to charge sick and healthy people the same insurance rates  another change would allow states to decide whether to require insurers to cover health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs that are mandatory under current law  but the cbo report said the amendment would make it difficult or impossible for people in poor health to purchase comprehensive coverage in some states   people who are less healthy  including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions  would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law  if they could purchase it at all   the cbo report said  the cbo said markets for people to buy individual insurance plans could then become  unstable  in states that choose to waive the obamacare requirements for coverage of pre existing medical conditions and essential health benefits  even before the report  many republican senators were wary of the house version of the healthcare bill  saying it unraveled obamacare too much and too quickly  about  million people gained insurance under obamacare  the house bill would eliminate most obamacare taxes that help subsidize private health coverage for individuals  roll back the government s medicaid health plan for the poor and disabled and replace the law s income based tax credits for buying medical coverage with credits based on age  a group of  republican senators led by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is expected to draft its own version of the healthcare bill in the coming months  mcconnell  however  told reuters on wednesday he does not yet know how republicans will get the necessary votes   this is a very challenging undertaking   mcconnell said     after the release of the cbo report  several republican senators said they could not support the house bill   while i am in favor of repealing obamacare  i am opposed to the american health care act in its current form   republican senator dean heller said in a statement  republican senator susan collins said too many people would lose insurance and that older and low income americans would be hurt  house republicans  who argue their healthcare bill would allow insurance markets to function more efficiently  focused on the projected budget savings from it and a finding in the cbo report that said insurance premiums for some people would decline  groups representing hospitals  insurers and doctors who opposed the house bill said the cbo report showed the senate should start fresh with an eye to maintaining coverage and benefits  democrats also blasted the bill and said the cbo report proved it would be catastrophic for millions of people who would lose health insurance   the report makes clear trumpcare would be a cancer on the american healthcare system   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said at a news conference  the new cbo score predicts the ahca would cover  million more americans than republicans  previous version of the bill  which the agency estimated would have left  million more people uninsured than obamacare in   to allay concerns about coverage of people with pre existing illnesses  house republicans allocated an additional   billion over five years in their bill to help sick people pay for insurance premiums but the cbo said the money would not be enough to help them afford coverage  the cbo said premiums would fall for younger people and rise for older people in states that did not waive obamacare requirements for an overall decline of about  percent  in states that made moderate changes to their markets  representing about one third of the u s  population  premiums would fall  percent on average  reaction on wall street was muted  with shares of hospitals affected by the cuts to medicaid  like community health systems  and health insurers specializing in medicaid  such as molina healthcare  moh n  and centene corp  cnc n  unchanged in light after hours trading  the republicans  first attempt at undoing obamacare this year resulted in a setback for the trump agenda in march  conservative and moderate republican factions in the house were opposed to the initial legislation and the leadership decided not to put it up for a vote
