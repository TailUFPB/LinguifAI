washington  reuters    u s  house of representatives republicans unveiled long delayed legislation on thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that president donald trump has promised  setting off a frantic race in congress to give him his first major legislative victory  the  page bill  representing what would be the largest overhaul of the u s  tax system since the   called for slashing the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals  congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every u s  company and family was far from certain  and some business groups quickly came out against it  contentious provisions will test republicans  who control the white house and both chambers of congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for trump since the businessman turned politician became president in january  a number of provisions would hit taxpayers in democratic leaning states hardest  like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction   the legislation  called the tax cuts and jobs act  produces new advantages for rich americans through lowered corporate taxes  phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax    this is a very important and special moment for our country  for all americans  are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral   republican house speaker paul ryan asked  despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth  meeting with ryan and other key house republicans  trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts  and repeated his request that congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the u s  thanksgiving holiday on nov    that is an ambitious timetable for such a long  multi faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many democrats  trump called the bill an  important step  toward tax relief for americans  adding in a statement   we are just getting started  and there is much work left to do   the bill presented by the tax writing house ways and means committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven   percent   percent   percent and   percent  an earlier republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to  percent  the national association of home builders blasted the legislation  saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas    we re concerned if enacted  this bill will throw us back into another housing recession   jerry howard  the group s president  said in an interview  the group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at      half the current amount   was unacceptable  howard said  million homes are currently above    and in high cost regions like washington  d c   new york city  california and hawaii  the impact would be felt the most   the bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes  and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at     those provisions would most affect americans in higher tax states such as california  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and illinois  the national federation of independent business  the influential small business lobby  also came out against the bill  while the u s  chamber of commerce business lobby backed it  ryan said the typical family of four would save    annually on taxes under the bill   with democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit  republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks   ultimately  what the american people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of donald trump personally along with his billionaire buddies  like a trump university degree  it is phony   said democratic congressman lloyd doggett  the bill s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax deferred  k  retirement savings program  the bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families  but it would repeal a personal exemption of    that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves  their spouse and any dependents  the legislation would also phase out tax exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to   percent excise tax on investment income  it would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities  the bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets  while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest  the bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non corporate enterprises at  percent  down from the present maximum rate on  pass through  income of   percent  it would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass through business income to prevent tax avoidance abuse of the new  lower tax level  it would create a new  percent tax on u s  companies  high profit foreign subsidiaries  calculated on a global basis  in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas  foreign businesses operating in the united states would face a tax of up to  percent on payments they make overseas from their american operations  u s  equities have rallied in  to a series of record highs  partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts  shares of u s  homebuilders fell after the bill was released  with luxury homebuilders including toll brothers taking the biggest hit  as investors parsed its provisions  the dow jones industrial average was up modestly and the s p  was down slightly  investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries   the ways and means committee will begin formal consideration of the bill next week before the full house can vote on it  it also must pass the senate  where republicans hold a slimmer   majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to approve a major healthcare overhaul sought by trump
