washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s dismissal of fbi director james comey has raised questions about the future of the agency s probe into russian attempts to sway the  presidential election and possible collusion with trump s campaign  the justice department announced on may  that deputy attorney general rod rosenstein had appointed former federal bureau of investigation director robert mueller as a special counsel to lead an independent probe  here is what to expect    the fbi s investigation will continue   comey s firing did not end the fbi s investigation into moscow s role in the  election  the career fbi staffers comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it  legal experts told reuters  even as the white house interviews new directors    probes underway in the u s  congress will also continue  investigations already underway in the senate intelligence committee and house intelligence committee and other panels will progress  congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes even after mueller s appointment  experts said  senate republicans  including some from leadership  previously argued that the appointment of a special counsel could imperil ongoing congressional probes  mueller will not have the authority to demand congress halt a probe  though criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters  legal experts said the complications would be indistinguishable from those created by the already ongoing fbi investigation    mueller will steer a parallel probe at the justice department   mueller will interview relevant witnesses  subpoena documents and  if the evidence merits  work with the fbi to bring criminal charges related to the probe   mueller will operate with a high degree of independence from the trump administration  rosenstein appointed mueller to head the department s russia probe citing department regulations that allow attorney generals to appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government   the department regulations are  not quite as robust  as a law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor that lapsed in the   according to justin levitt  a professor at loyola law school in los angeles  but  the regulations are designed to give the special counsel a great degree of independence   decisions can be overridden but if they are  to make sure that congress knows about them   levitt said  rosenstein appointed mueller because attorney general jeff sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in russia related probes because he had not told congress about his own contacts with russian officials   it would be difficult to fire mueller from the job  only the attorney general   or in this case rosenstein  as the acting attorney general in matters related to russia   has the authority to fire a special counsel  justice department regulations state that a special counsel can only be removed  for cause   such as misconduct  conflict of interest or dereliction of duty  levitt said  though rosenstein  like comey  serves at the pleasure of the president and could be removed without cause at any time  levitt cautioned that doing so in order to jeopardize mueller s probe would come at a high political cost   each of those actions will come with increasing public and congressional scrutiny   levitt said
