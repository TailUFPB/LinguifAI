washington  reuters    no   senate democrat dick durbin has had multiple conversations with jared kushner and other top white house officials about how to protect young immigrants known as  dreamers  from deportation  the lawmaker said on thursday  durbin  in an interview with reuters  described kushner as a conduit to his father in law  president donald trump  and open to the idea of doing something to help the   dreamers brought illegally to the united states as children  kushner  a top administration aide with a broad portfolio that includes brokering a middle east peace agreement  held private meetings at the white house with durbin and republican senator lindsey graham in april and july  according to durbin s office  durbin  an outspoken advocate for the obama era deferred action for childhood arrivals program that protected the dreamers from deportation and allowed them work permits  told reuters he teamed up with graham to discuss opportunities with the white house to help those enrolled in daca   we initially had a conversation  with kushner   at senator  chuck  grassley s invitation  on criminal justice and i asked mr  kushner afterwards if we could talk about immigration  separate and apart from senator grassley  which we did   durbin said   i went into     daca because i was concerned about how this was going to unfold   the illinois lawmaker said the conversations underscore a level of interest in the issue among senior white house aides that could lend momentum to the congressional debate on approving a permanent legislative fix for the dreamers that durbin has sought for the past  years  the talks also point to a white house that could be moving away from a more rigid immigration stance than during the initial weeks of trump s presidency  a white house spokesman said the administration  acted lawfully to correct the unconstitutional actions taken by  former president barack obama   it is now up to congress to act on behalf of the american people   he said  the fate of the dreamers has been in question since trump won last november s presidential election on a promise of clamping down on illegal immigration  several state attorneys general had threatened legal action to kill daca and set a sept   deadline for trump to rescind former president barack obama s executive order protecting the dreamers or face a lawsuit  on tuesday  the republican president said he would eliminate daca in six months and urged congress to work on an alternative during that time  besides the white house meetings  durbin said there were telephone calls with kushner as well as calls and meetings with then homeland security secretary john kelly  who recently became trump s white house chief of staff  durbin said that kushner invited trump aide stephen miller to attend one of the white house meetings because of his experience as a senate aide to jeff sessions  who now serves as attorney general  sessions has been a leading voice in the senate and trump s cabinet for tough enforcement of u s  immigration laws and curtailing immigration generally  durbin said that during the meeting with miller   there was nothing in my conversation with him that suggested  he had moved away from sessions  rigid stance  durbin said that he had not spoken directly with trump since an inauguration day handshake at a capitol hill luncheon when the new president spoke in positive terms about dreamers  in describing some of the behind the scenes efforts  the senator portrayed a roller coaster like series of  challenging  signals from trump that began even before his inauguration on jan     during the course of his presidency  he has said very positive things about dreamers and daca and it s been a notable exception to his statements on immigration and travel and muslims and mexicans  this seemed to be a separate category in his mind and that s why i explored it   durbin said  he said that trump s announcement about the program on tuesday appeared to be a setback  from what i hoped would occur based on his positive comments on dreamers and daca    but then within  hours   durbin added   the president was sending messages by tweet and otherwise that were more encouraging and they continue even until this morning
