washington  reuters    the u s  department of homeland security said on wednesday it is considering a request by members of congress to waive federal restrictions on shipping to puerto rico  but has not received any formal requests from shippers or other branches of the federal government to waive the law   we are considering the underlying issues and are evaluating whether a waiver should be issued   said a senior homeland security official  who spoke to reporters on the grounds of anonymity  the jones act requires that all goods shipped between u s  ports be carried by american owned and operated ships  several u s  lawmakers  including representative nydia velazquez  on monday asked dhs to waive the jones act restrictions for a year to help relief efforts in puerto rico where people are suffering from water and food shortages in the wake of hurricane maria  but a request from a member of congress is not the usual pathway by which the department gets waiver requests  the dhs official said  puerto rico has long railed against the jones act  saying it raises the cost of imported basic commodities  such as food  clothing and fuel  but the official said that the defense department and fema have not indicated there is a lack of ships to get food and goods to the island  the official did not deny that the law can add costs to goods delivered to the island  an argument made by longtime opponent of the jones act  republican senator john mccain  but the dhs official said jones act exemptions are based solely on the interest of national defense    the real challenges happen to be on the island itself   the official said  adding that there were plenty of u s  flagged barges and tugs available   dhs has the ability to initiate a waiver to the shipping law  but the official said it is constrained by the national defense parameter    right now  we do not have the authority to issue a waiver simply to make goods cost less   he said
