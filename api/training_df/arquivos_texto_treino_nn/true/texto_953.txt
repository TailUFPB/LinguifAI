beijing  reuters    a top u s  business lobby in china said on tuesday it was concerned u s  president donald trump s administration was not making sufficient preparation for talks on imbalances in the bilateral economic relationship ahead of his november visit  little advance work has been done for the visit  said william zarit  chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china  he was referring to meetings by working level officials to negotiate outcomes on commercial issues for trump s meeting with his chinese counterpart xi jinping   from what i understand  there really hasn t been much of that for this visit  which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues   zarit told reporters in beijing  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross will bring a business delegation to beijing during trump s visit  some in the u s  business community are worried that deals announced on the trip could distract from solutions to long standing complaints over discriminatory chinese policies and market access restrictions  zarit said he hoped proposed deals from the business delegation  do not overshadow the real need for structural changes in the economic relationship   trump  who will stop in five asian countries on his first visit to the region as president  will arrive in beijing on nov    u s  officials were  still waiting  for a chinese response to issues raised during the u s  china comprehensive economic dialogue in july  zarit said  though he did not give specifics  he called chinese officials  master negotiators  and said the u s  government and business community had long suffered from a less strategic view of the economic relationship   and i think there is no exception with this administration   zarit said   he added that it was  not unreasonable  to expect more progress  months into trump s presidency  ross  has said the united states will be looking for  immediate results  and  tangible agreements  during trump s visit  but has acknowledged that market access  intellectual property rights  and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate  washington and beijing launched a  day economic plan during trump s first meeting with xi in april  including some industry specific announcements  such as the resumption of american beef sales in china  but u s  business groups have expressed disappointment over the extent of the outcomes  xi vowed on monday that china would take more measures to open up the economy  he made the remarks at a meeting with members of an advisory board to tsinghua university s school of economics and management  including apple inc  aapl o  chief executive tim cook and facebook inc s  fb o  mark zuckerberg   china will make joint efforts with the united states to  take each other s interests and concerns into consideration  resolve disputes and contradictions  and engage in win win cooperation   xi said according to the official china daily newspaper  but such frequently made pledges have done little to assuage foreign companies  concerns over ownership caps in key sectors  such as autos  securities  insurance  and information technology  u s  business lobbies argue that their members are restricted in those industries while chinese companies operate freely in the u s  market  they have also criticized beijing s  made in china   plan  which offers government backing for sectors the chinese government deems strategic  particularly galling to foreign tech firms are a slate of new national security and cyber security regulations that mandate companies store crucial data within china and pass security reviews they argue could put business secrets at risk   basically  when we look at that  what it boils down to for us is it s a company competing against a country   zarit said
