 new york washington  reuters    republicans generally agree that politicians should not enrich themselves while running the country  yet most think it is okay for president donald trump to do so   democrats largely support the idea of government run healthcare  but their support plummets when they learn that trump once backed the idea   at a time of already deep fissures among american voters on political  cultural and economic issues  trump further polarizes the public as soon as he wades into the debate  according to the results of a reuters ipsos poll  the poll suggests any effort to reach a consensus on key policy issues could be complicated simply by trump s involvement   the survey from feb   to march  of nearly   people asked respondents to consider a series of statements trump has made on taxes  crime and the news media  among other issues  in many cases  the data showed that people will orient their opinions according to what they think of trump   republicans  for example  were more likely to criticize american exceptionalism   the notion that the united states holds a unique place in history   when told that trump once said it was insulting to other countries  they were more likely to agree that the country should install more nuclear weapons  and they were more supportive of government spending for infrastructure  when they knew that trump felt the same way   democrats moved in the opposite direction  they were less supportive of infrastructure spending  less critical of the judiciary and less likely to agree that urban crime was on the rise when they knew that those concerns were shared by trump    i m basically in disagreement with everything he says   said howard house    a democrat from jacksonville  florida  who took the poll   i ve almost closed my mind to the guy    trump is not the first president to polarize the public  a  poll by the washington post found that democrats appeared to favor legislative action when they thought it was then president bill clinton s idea  and a  survey by hart research associates showed that both positive and negative attitudes about the  affordable care act intensified when called by its other name  obamacare   but previous presidents were more popular than trump at this point  according to the gallup polling service  and they may have been better positioned to address the public divide because of it  gallup had trump at a  percent approval rating on tuesday  he was as low as  percent last week   that leaves trump facing a largely disapproving electorate  even as the white house signals that in the coming months it wants to pass a sweeping tax reform package  a large infrastructure plan  and perhaps try again to supplant the affordable care act   the white house said that trump has tried to reach out to those who did not support him during the campaign in an attempt to build political consensus    the door to the white house has been open to a variety of people who are willing to come to the table and have honest discussions with the president about the ways we can make our country better   a white house spokeswoman wrote in an email   the hyper partisan era of trump  poll respondents were split into two groups  each received nearly identical questions about statements trump has made in recent years  one group  however  was not told the statements came from trump   the poll then asked if people agreed or disagreed with those statements  in a few cases  trump made little to no impact on the answers  but most of the time the inclusion of his name changed the results   a series of questions about conflicts of interest produced the biggest swings   some  percent of republicans said it was okay if  an official  financially benefits from a government position  however  when a separate group was asked the same question with trump s name added in  more than twice as many republicans    percent   said it was okay   when interviewed afterward  some respondents said they knew they were making special exceptions for trump   susie stewart  a  year old healthcare worker from fort worth  texas  said it came down to trust  while most politicians should be forbidden from mixing their personal fortunes with government business  stewart  who voted for trump  said the president had earned the right to do so    he is a very intelligent man   stewart said   he s proved himself to be one hell of a manager  a builder  i think he has the business sense to do what s best for the country    on the other side of the political spectrum  house  the democrat from florida and a hillary clinton supporter  said he also made an exception for trump  but in this instance it meant that house disagreed with everything trump supported   if trump said the sky was blue   i m going to go outside and check   he said   it is impossible to say exactly what motivates people to answer a certain way in a political poll  said john bullock  an expert in partisanship at the university of texas at austin   some respondents may have looked past the question and answered in a way that they thought would support or oppose trump  bullock said   but he said it was also likely that others simply have not thought deeply about the issue and are looking to trump as a guide for how to answer    they think of him either as a man who shares their values or someone who manifestly does not   bullock said
