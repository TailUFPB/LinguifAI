washington  reuters    the trump administration s ability to win over the u s  supreme court will be put to the test when the nine justices begin their new term on monday with major cases awaiting on voting rights  religious liberty  union funding and class action suits  president donald trump s justice department already has flipped the government s position in some important cases  reversing the stance taken under democratic former president barack obama  and could have a receptive audience on the court  whose term runs through june  the addition of trump s appointee neil gorsuch in april restored the court s   conservative majority  as the new justice prepares to begin his first full term  the administration has backed companies against employees and supported voting laws that critics say could prevent eligible people from casting ballots   it also has reversed the obama administration s stance in support of protections for gay workers under federal law  an issue that could reach the court within weeks   the supreme court generally gives special deference to the views of the u s  solicitor general  the federal government s top lawyer  trump s appointee noel francisco holds the job  but some justices may look dimly upon the government abruptly changing its position in cases  former justice department lawyer pratik shah said a flip flop can provide an opening for justices sympathetic to the view of the prior administration  who can ask   what in the law has changed to warrant a different view   the court s oldest justice   year old liberal ruth bader ginsburg  has called the upcoming term  momentous  owing to the importance of the cases on the docket  on tuesday  the term s second day  the justices are due to hear a case that could help shape u s  elections for decades involving the long standing practice of a majority party manipulating electoral boundaries for future elections to try to cement their hold on power  wisconsin is appealing a lower court ruling that the way the republican led legislature redrew boundaries following the  census was so far reaching in its bid to marginalize democratic voters that it violated the constitution  in a case expected to be argued in december involving free speech  religious liberty and gay rights  the justices will weigh whether a denver area baker who cited his christian beliefs in refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple can be penalized for violating a colorado anti discrimination law  the new administration has backed the baker  infuriating groups that support gay  lesbian  transgender and bisexual rights   president trump said on the campaign trail that he s an advocate for lgbt people  but actions speak much louder than words   said james esseks  an american civil liberties union lawyer who works on gay rights issues  the supreme court on monday canceled arguments that had been scheduled for oct   in what would have been the biggest case of the term  whether trump s ban on people entering the united states from several muslim majority countries amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against muslims  the action came after a temporary ban expired and the administration announced a new set of restrictions   one two punch  a case on the first day of the term on monday presents a rarity  with the administration facing off against one of the federal government s own agencies  the national labor relations board   that will be a first for me in the nearly  years i have served on the court   ginsburg said at a georgetown law center event on sept    the administration is no longer defending the nlrb s position that employment agreements in which businesses require workers to waive their rights to bring class action claims are invalid  the waivers compel workers to individually arbitrate disputes with employers rather than bringing collective lawsuits with co workers  the court s conservative majority is expected to be sympathetic to the arguments made by employers   the court on thursday agreed to hear a case that could end an important source of funding for unions representing police  teachers and other government employees  the dispute centers on fees that some states require non union members to pay to unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other organized labor activities   claire prestel  associate general counsel of the service employees international union  seiu   said those cases could lead to a  one two punch against workers   the obama administration backed the unions in a similar case in which the justices ended with a   deadlock last year  the trump administration may change course and back the anti union challengers  in another about face  trump s justice department has also sided with ohio in its bid to revive a state policy of purging infrequent voters from voter registration lists  reversing the obama administration s stance that the practice was illegal  obama s former attorney general  eric holder  joined a friend of the court brief criticizing the reversal  saying the trump administration policy departed from the government s  interpretation of ohio s law dating back more than  years and spanning administrations from both parties  the justices are set to hear that case on nov
