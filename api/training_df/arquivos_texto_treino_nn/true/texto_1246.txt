washington  reuters    iran  u s  allies in europe and russia on friday defended the  nuclear agreement with tehran and said they would stick by it  after u s  president donald trump threatened to terminate the agreement  trump said in a washington speech that he would not certify that iran is complying with its agreement with six world powers and the european union  despite a determination by the u n  s nuclear watchdog that tehran is meeting the deal s terms  the republican president threw the issue to the u s  congress  which has  days to decide whether to reinstate u s  sanctions  he warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies  then the agreement will be terminated   trump s actions appeared to leave the united states relatively isolated on the world stage  his hawkish new stance toward iran  including steps against the islamic revolutionary guard corps  received strong backing only from israel and gulf states such as saudi arabia  iranian president hassan rouhani said iran will remain committed to the multinational deal as long as it serves the country s national interests  trump s decision to decertify the deal will isolate the united states  as other signatories of the accord remained committed to it  rouhani said in a live television address  the deal was not renegotiable  he said  the agreement  negotiated by trump s democratic predecessor barack obama  eased sanctions on tehran in returns for strict limits on its nuclear program  trump s stance put him at odds with key u s  allies  including britain  france and germany who  along with russia and china  negotiated the deal with iran alongside the european union  in brussels  eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini said washington could not unilaterally cancel the agreement   we cannot afford as the international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement that is working   said mogherini  who chaired the final stages of the landmark talks   this deal is not a bilateral agreement   the international community  and the european union with it  has clearly indicated that the deal is  and will continue to be  in place   mogherini told reporters in brussels  the leaders of britain  france and germany issued a joint statement warning the united states against taking decisions that could harm the nuclear deal such as re imposing sanctions  the three leaders also said they shared u s  concerns over iran s ballistic missile program and regional destabilizing activities and were ready to work with washington to address those concerns  french president emmanuel macron s office said he had spoken with rouhani by telephone and assured him of france s commitment to the deal  but that tehran must strictly comply with it  russia s foreign ministry said there was no place in international diplomacy for threatening and aggressive rhetoric  and said such methods were doomed to fail  in a statement issued after trump s speech  the ministry said trump s decision to de certify the deal would not have a direct impact on implementation of the agreement but that it ran counter to its spirit  there was no immediate reaction from china  though alexei pushkov  a pro kremlin lawmaker in the upper house of the russian parliament  said neither moscow nor beijing backed trump s stance   russia of course does not support the u s  position  nor does china  so trump will be left in proud isolation in an attempt to improve his image among his own supporters   pushkov told russia s state run rossiya  tv station   the head of the u n  s international atomic energy agency said iran was complying with the accord  formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action  under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime    the nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under  the jcpoa are being implemented   yukiya amano  director general of the iaea said in a statement   what has been agreed     must be fully implemented  it is a very important deal  i m sorry to see what is now happening   former united nations secretary general ban ki moon told reporters at the united nations on friday  ban  who stepped down at the end of   was u n  chief when the deal was agreed  trump received support from israel  saudi arabia  the united arab emirates and bahrain  all of which oppose what they say are iran s expansionary moves in the middle east   president trump has just created an opportunity to fix this bad deal  to roll back iran s aggression and to confront its criminal support of terrorism   israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in a video statement  in their comments  the gulf states focused on trump s overall iran policy rather than the nuclear deal itself  saudi arabia welcomed what it called trump s  decisive strategy  toward iran and said lifting sanctions had allowed tehran to develop its ballistic missile program  step up its support for militant groups including hezbollah and the houthis in yemen  and attack global shipping lanes      the riyadh government said in a statement it had supported the nuclear agreement   but iran took advantage of the economic gain from raising sanctions and used it to continue destabilizing the region   the united arab emirates said it fully supported the new u s  policy toward iran and renewed its commitment to work with washington to counter iran s support of extremism  the state news agency wam reported   the uae announces its full support to the new u s  strategy to deal with the iranian policies undermining security and  stability   wam said on its twitter account
