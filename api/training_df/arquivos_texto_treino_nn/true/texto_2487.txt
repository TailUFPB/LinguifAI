washington moscow brussels  reuters    u s  lawmakers reached an agreement on wednesday paving the way for the u s  senate to pass a bill as soon as this week to impose new sanctions on russia and bar president donald trump from easing sanctions on moscow without congress  approval  earlier on wednesday  russia warned it was edging closer to retaliation against washington after the house of representatives backed new u s  sanctions on moscow  while the european union said the move  might affect its energy security and it stood ready to act too   i am glad to announce that we have reached an agreement that will allow us to send sanctions legislation to the president s desk   senator bob corker  the republican chairman of the u s  senate foreign relations committee  said in a statement on wednesday evening  he said the senate would move to approve sanctions on russia and iran that it originally passed in mid june  as well as sanctions on north korea developed by the house of representatives and included in a bill the house passed overwhelmingly on wednesday  before the latest agreement  some senators had objected to the north korea measures and it had looked like the sanctions bill  already delayed since mid june  could languish into september  if the bill passes the senate as expected  it would be sent to the white house for trump to sign into law or veto  it is  however  expected to garner enough support to override a trump veto  the house voted   on tuesday to impose new sanctions on moscow and force trump to obtain lawmakers  approval before easing any punitive measures on russia   this is rather sad news from the point of view of russia u s  ties   said dmitry peskov  a kremlin spokesman   we are talking about an extremely unfriendly act   he said president vladimir putin would decide if and how moscow would retaliate once the sanctions became law  russia s deputy foreign minister warned the move was taking bilateral relations into uncharted waters  killing off hopes of improving them in the near future  trump  whose presidency has been embroiled in a distracting dispute over his associates  alleged ties to moscow  is on the defensive over accusations russia helped elect him last year  he has said he wants to mend relations with russia that are languishing at a post cold war low  trump had denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and russia  most white house watchers believe trump will reluctantly sign off on the new sanctions  given deep support for them among u s  lawmakers and his desire to avoid being accused of being soft on moscow  representative ed royce  the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  said trump would have little choice  the senate passed a version of the legislation  without the north korea sanctions  on june  by      i think the president will sign it   royce said on nbc s meet the press daily on wednesday  the issue has rattled russia  which fears that its economy  weakened by  western sanctions imposed over its role in the ukraine crisis  will now find it harder to recover and grow  foreign investors could be scared off  the european union frets that new u s  restrictions could pose obstacles to its companies doing business with russia and threaten the bloc s energy supply lines  the kremlin s alleged interference in the  u s  presidential election is one reason lawmakers have pushed for the new sanctions  peskov said moscow would wait until the sanctions became law before fully analyzing them and deciding how to respond    moscow had hoped that trump  who made upbeat statements about putin before winning the white house  would work to repair the u s  russia relationship  but it has watched with frustration as the vote meddling allegations killed off hopes of any detente  the russian foreign ministry said this month that too many american spies were operating in russia under diplomatic cover and it might expel some to retaliate for the expulsion of  russian diplomats last year by then president barack obama s administration  many russian politicians increasingly believe trump s political foes and congress have left the u s  president with little room for maneuver on russia and they have nothing to lose by retaliating  in brussels  european commission president jean claude juncker said the eu was ready to act  within a matter of days  if it felt the new u s  sanctions undermined the bloc s energy security  brussels fears the new sanctions will damage european firms and oil and gas projects on which the eu is dependent  the russia section of the bill includes sanctions on a range of industries  several provisions target russian energy  with new limits on u s  investment in russian companies  u s  firms also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where russian firms have a stake of  percent or higher  the bill includes sanctions on foreign firms investing in or helping russian energy exploration  although the president could waive those sanctions  the bill would give the trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on firms helping develop russian export pipelines  such as the nord stream  pipeline carrying natural gas to europe  in which german companies are involved  in a concession to allies  those sanctions are optional  not mandatory  the european commission said a number of eu concerns had been taken into account in the most recent version of the bill  but said it could lead to sanctions on any company  including european  that worked on russian energy export pipelines
