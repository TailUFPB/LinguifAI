washington  reuters    an already contentious move by republican president donald trump to block opposition democratic lawmakers from getting information about his administration received its most scathing criticism yet on friday   from one of the most powerful republican members of the u s  senate  judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley of iowa  in a more than   word letter to the white house  asked trump to rescind unprecedented guidance that told executive agencies they do not have to honor requests for information from lawmakers in the minority party  currently the democrats  this week in hearings all over capitol hill members of both parties have criticized the information block  democrats have posited that the trump administration is trying to hide mistakes  problems or wrongdoing from them  grassley  who has served in the senate since   called the guidance  nonsense  and described it as  a bureaucratic effort by the office of legal counsel to insulate the executive branch from scrutiny by the elected representatives of the american people    the judiciary committee has jurisdiction over the justice department and its office of legal counsel  which published the guidance last month  grassley said it goes against the u s  constitution by misrepresenting how congress functions and trying to tell the legislative branch how to do its job  it also impedes democratic lawmakers  ability to check up on the president  a responsibility also laid out in the constitution  grassley wrote in a letter replete with footnotes and case citations   i know from experience that a partisan response to oversight only discourages bipartisanship  decreases transparency  and diminishes the crucial role of the american people s elected representatives   he wrote   oversight brings transparency  and transparency brings accountability    the justice department declined to comment on grassley s letter or the guidance  the white house did not return a request for comment  the office of legal counsel has not explained the impetus for publishing the opinion  the guidance did not single out democrats by name  instead  it addressed information requests to executive agencies from the highest ranking lawmaker from the minority party sitting on congressional committees  called ranking members  the republicans hold the majority in both the senate and u s  house of representatives and therefore chair all the committees  with democrats as ranking members   the opinion said that agencies only have to respond to  information requests from committee chairs  ranking member requests  do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings   it said
