washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said on wednesday he had never considered resigning and was committed to president donald trump s agenda  but failed to address whether he had referred to the president as a  moron   as nbc reported  the state department later denied he had even used the word  an issue tillerson earlier declined to specifically address   the secretary      does not use that language to speak about anyone  he did not say that   state department spokeswoman heather nauert said at a briefing  the top u s  diplomat  whose tenure has been dogged with rumors about unhappiness with trump s policies and rhetoric  said he was as committed to trump s agenda today as he was when he accepted the offer to serve as secretary of state  the episode is the latest controversy to embroil trump s administration which has witnessed a string of high profile departures and firings in recent months  including his chief of staff  national security advisor and the former fbi director  nbc reported that in a session with trump s national security team and cabinet officials at the pentagon  tillerson had openly criticized the president and referred to him as a  moron   citing three officials familiar with the incident  tillerson sidestepped the issue when taking questions after making a statement at a hastily organized news conference   i m not going to deal with petty stuff like that   he said  adding   i m not from this place  washington   but the places i come from we don t deal with that kind of petty nonsense   tillerson spoke after nbc reported that vice president mike pence and other top officials had intervened to persuade him not to resign this summer as tensions rose between him and trump   the vice president has never had to persuade me to remain as secretary of state because i have never considered leaving this post   tillerson said   my commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day i accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state   tillerson said  nauert said tillerson and trump had spoken later on wednesday and that it was a  good conversation   tillerson did not offer an apology to trump because  one was not needed   tillerson  the former ceo of exxon and former president of the boy scouts  said of trump   he s smart  he demands results   trump later told reporters in las vegas   i m very honored by his comments  it was fake news  it was a totally phony story      it was made up by nbc  they just made it up      total confidence in rex  i have total confidence   trump had appeared to undercut tillerson over the weekend when the president tweeted that he told him that he was  wasting his time  trying to negotiate with north korean leader kim jong un over pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs  tillerson offered a vigorous defense of both the u s  president and his foreign policy even though the white house and state department have at times appeared to differ on policy   president trump s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country   tillerson said  the embarrassing episode underscored the sense of disarray that u s  friends and foes alike have detected in their dealings with trump s foreign policy apparatus and could further undermine u s  credibility in world affairs  pence  in a statement  said he never discussed with tillerson the prospect of the secretary of state s resignation  in a tweet  trump earlier urged nbc to apologize for its story  but nbc news anchor hallie jackson said on air   nbc will not be issuing an apology to america as the president is calling for because again     the secretary did not refute directly some of the key points  in the story  several nbc journalists who reported the story also stood by their piece  saying on msnbc that their reporting was true   defense secretary jim mattis has played down any tensions between trump and tillerson over their apparent split  most recently over north korea  some administration officials have privately described tillerson as chafing against some of the president s pronouncements and off the cuff decisions  sometimes contrary to advice from senior advisers  one u s  official said the view of many within the administration was that despite tillerson s denial of having contemplated resignation   it s only a matter of time  before he does consider it  the official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said there was no reason to believe that trump would give up his habit of publicly contradicting tillerson and that each time speculation on his future would resurface  tillerson has often found himself at odds with the president on a range of issues  according to current and former u s  officials and media reports  he has taken a more hawkish view on russia and tried to mediate a dispute among key u s  mideast allies after four arab nations boycotted qatar over its alleged extremist ties  tillerson also appeared to distance himself from trump s response to violence in charlottesville  virginia this summer  saying at the time  the president speaks for himself  when asked about trump s values  senator bob corker  a tennessee republican  said tillerson was working under difficult circumstances because some in the administration are undermining his authority by trying to act as secretary of state on a daily basis  he declined to name names  corker  who is chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  was asked whether he supported tillerson  and said   as a team  tillerson  mattis and  white house chief of staff john  kelly help separate us from chaos  so i absolutely support  em  absolutely   tillerson was confirmed by only   at his senate confirmation hearing in january  an unusually low confirmation for a secretary of state  many members of congress  including republicans  strongly object to his plans to slash the state department and foreign aid budgets
