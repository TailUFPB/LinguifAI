washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives passed a   billion defense policy bill on tuesday  backing president donald trump s call for a bigger  stronger military  but failing to decide how to fund the massive spending increase  the republican controlled house voted   for the annual national defense authorization act  or ndaa  which authorizes the level of defense spending and sets policies controlling how the money is spent  but the legislation defies spending caps set in the  budget control act and there is no clear plan from congress on how to provide the money for the pentagon  the  ndaa authorizes   billion in base defense spending  for such things as buying weapons and paying the troops  well above the   billion allowed under the previous legislation  the ndaa also includes provisions such as an increase in active troop levels by more than    and states that climate change is a national security threat  the defense policy bill will become law if it passes the republican controlled senate and is signed into law by the president  as expected  but spending will nonetheless be cut automatically if congress cannot come up with a deal to resolve the gap in funding  representative adam smith  the top democrat on the house armed services committee  said congress  failure to address the issue makes life more difficult for military leaders because they cannot plan in advance   this defense bill is   billion over the budget caps  so if we don t eliminate or raise the budget caps  that additional money will go away and leave us once again in the land of uncertainty for the department of defense   he said  representative mac thornberry  the house armed service committee s republican chairman  said congress needed to pass an appropriations bill to allow for the   billion   securing those appropriations must be congress  top priority before the year ends   thornberry said in a statement  the ndaa also includes about   billion in special war funding  which is exempt from the so called sequestration cap  the measure passed by the house on tuesday is a compromise reached by house and senate negotiators between separate versions of the bill approved in the chambers earlier this year  however  a budget fight is expected because senate democrats may not agree to big increases in funds for the military if spending caps on non defense programs are not also eased  the republican majority in the senate is so small that most legislation cannot pass without some democratic votes
