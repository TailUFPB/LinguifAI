washington  reuters    scandals enveloping u s  president donald trump have left republican lawmakers and lobbyists increasingly gloomy about the prospects for passing sweeping tax cuts  a rollback of obamacare  and an ambitious infrastructure program  with the white house and both chambers of the u s  congress under republican control  party leaders and their allies in the business community had expected to get quick traction on their plans  with corporate tax cuts among the top priorities  but four months into trump s tenure  only limited progress has been made  the house of representatives passed a measure to rewrite obamacare  but the senate is only in the very early stages of considering the issue  lawmakers are just beginning their push on tax reform  in addition to congressional probes that are taking place into possible collusion between trump s  campaign team and russia  the u s  justice department on wednesday named former fbi director robert mueller to investigate the matter   it s the elephant in the room right now   said republican representative pat tiberi   the smartest minds in the white house know that  whether it s tax reform or anything else on the public policy front  it s hard enough to get things done in the u s  capitol under the best of circumstances   the house ways and means committee will hold a hearing on tax reform on thursday  key administration and congressional leaders met wednesday afternoon to discuss a path forward  but they remain a long way from signing a bill into law  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that  less drama from the white house  was needed to advance legislative priorities   republican senator lindsey graham told reporters on wednesday that the legislative process had  pretty much ground to a halt  amid the tumult in washington  republican representative steve womack said it was important for committees investigating the russia matter to move forward expeditiously to both ensure that the public gets answers and to clear the way for congress to move on to other issues   any time we get bogged down on these kinds of issues unrelated to the governing agenda  it serves to delay and to sometimes complicate the real job that we have to do for the american people   womack said  at a news conference on wednesday  house speaker paul ryan urged his colleagues to  seize this moment  to pass tax reform  but instead of discussing tax rates and structures  ryan was faced with a series of questions about james comey  who trump fired as director of the federal bureau of investigation last week  and the russia investigation  several lobbyists said that in the past week their corporate clients have grown more cautious on the prospects for tax reform but still hope that at least a small package can be approved    my worry level has grown considerably   one lobbyist said  some lobbyists suggested that congress could consider focusing on tax breaks and perhaps leave aside the comprehensive overhaul of the tax code that they had originally hoped for    when this all started  the thing we heard from the hill was  transformative tax reform    said a strategist who consults with major companies focused on tax reform   i think as time passes  tax reform is going to look much different  that it may be begin to look more like tax cuts than tax reform
