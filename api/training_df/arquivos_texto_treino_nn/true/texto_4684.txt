 reuters    republican leaders of the house of representatives pulled legislation to overhaul the u s  healthcare system from consideration on friday due to a shortage of votes  despite desperate lobbying by the white house and its allies in congress  dealing a stiff setback to president donald trump  daniel morgan  senior portfolio manager  synovus trust company  atlanta  georgia   there s a bit of a relief rally  there were worries going into it    but it s a mixed bag   it does now open the door for maybe they table the whole thing and just move on  and i would think the next thing on the docket would have to be tax reform  the market  to me  is more interested in tax reform than it is in changing obamacare   in a way  for me  sitting on   million worth of investments  i think it s great  let s move and get into tax reform  and then get into the infrastructure bill   peter jankovskis  co chief investment officer  oakbrook investments llc  lisle  illinois   the market is relieved it s not going to go down to a defeat  and it s hopeful they ll come to some sort of agreement over the weekend  the market is hoping for an agreement as a stepping stone to additional agreements    news report suggested that the likely outcome was they were going to lose  i would think the expectations are that they re pulling it so they can work on it    the last few days  market has sort of traded on the back foot on anticipation of the vote that would happen at some point this week  generally  risk sentiment has been undermined off of that  especially with this steady drip of news that indicated lacking support for the bill  and now  i think  it sort of lifted that uncertainty  at least temporarily  for the rest of the day  maybe just lifting the uncertainty premium has markets breathing a sigh of relief for now   paresh upadhyaya  director of currency strategy  pioneer investments  boston   the initial market interpretation is a positive sign  it seems like it is taking that trump wants to instead of sinking it  he wants to give it another shot  it seems like they think he is working to get something on his agenda to be passed by congress  or perhaps it s a sign that if healthcare reform is shelved  trump will focus on tax reform  it s more a knee jerk reaction    there are still a lot of hard questions regardless to tax reform  he can t force people to change their vote on social media  good old fashion politicking is needed to build consensus    if this stronger dollar has legs  it depends on the next step  if there is a pivot to taxes from healthcare  the market has to see the plan   rahul shah  chief executive  ideal asset management  new york   from an investor viewpoint  it shows that trump will not be able to easily pass his agenda  that being said  healthcare is more difficult to pass than tax cuts and the infrastructure bill that he s proposing   in one sense that s a negative  but on the other hand it also might give some relief to investors who are concerned about some of trump s more controversial proposals like increased tariffs and a border adjustment tax    you could see this as a glass half empty or a glass half full  gridlock is not something that s unheard of on wall street  so i think stocks should be ok going forward    i think the most important thing is that this changes the perception of the relationship between trump and congress  for the last few months the assumption has been that congress would do whatever the trump plan called for  and that apparently is not going to be the case   peter kenny  senior market strategist  global markets advisory group  new york   i don t think it s going to have a huge impact on equities  although it may have more of an impact on biotech and healthcare    this is now an indication that the president s agenda is probably going to be more ambitious than congress can manage  it is probably going to mean that equity markets are going to have to factor in a degree of dysfunction that investors were hoping they wouldn t have to  which means it will likely have a muted impact on equity performance moving forward    there is very little on the horizon as of right now  as a result of this thing being pulled  that is going to fuel a significant move higher in prices  this is largely going to homogenize any sort of volatility moving forward and is probably going to be a cap on any near term performance in terms of the upside   the fact this bill  which the president has said flat out he will make it work for all americans in general  can t pass is an indication this agenda is going to be more ambitious than this congress can work with  this doesn t even include the democrats  it is not just divided between democrats and republicans  it is divided between progressives  democrats  republicans and libertarians  it is an indication that investors should not expect the kind of velocity in terms of agenda accomplishments they were expecting when he was elected   margaret patel  senior portfolio manager  wells fargo asset management  boston   it looked like the market was worried that the trump agenda would get completely bogged down in the healthcare issue  and now that they ve taken the healthcare issue off the table  i think the market is more optimistic that they can do other things that are more doable that are not so complicated  such as regulatory reform and lowering taxes  it does seem like a positive move to shelve an issue that s so complex and very expensive no matter what the plan  move on to something that is a little bit easier  which would be lowering taxes   brian battle  director of trading  performance trust capital partners  chicago   it didn t pass and it didn t fail so any conjecture about the ultimate meaning is premature  president trump is getting a lesson in varsity washington politics   stocks  s p  pares losses to end session down fractionally  dow ends down   percent  nasdaq ends up   percent
