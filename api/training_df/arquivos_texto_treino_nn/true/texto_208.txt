washington  reuters    president donald trump s campaign to shrink the  bloated federal bureaucracy  so far has made a small dent in the federal  workforce  and that largely because of a decline in civilian defense jobs  days after his jan   inauguration  trump ordered a hiring freeze later replaced with an order for federal agencies to cut staff immediately  and in march he proposed a  budget that sought to shift   billion to the military from other departments  however  federal civilian jobs declined around   in the first nine months of this year  or just   percent of   million such jobs tracked by the office of personnel management  according to reuters calculations based on the latest opm data published in late october  the white house office of management and budget declined to comment on the overall drop in federal employment or the mix of job gains and losses across agencies  the office issued in april the order for agencies to start near term staffing cuts and to submit plans for longer term reductions by september  trump has not detailed how much  fat  he aims to cut  but spoke of  billions and billions of dollars  of government waste and his aim to shrink the  bloated federal bureaucracy  while preparing his budget proposals in march  independent watchdogs agree the federal government could be made more efficient  with congress s government accountability office estimating in april that overlap and duplication lead to  tens of billions  of dollars in unnecessary spending   before trump  democrats barack obama and bill clinton and republican george w  bush have all spearheaded various efforts to streamline government bureaucracy  david lewis  a political science professor at vanderbilt university  said this year s numbers showed that trump s executive orders had limited power to reshape the federal bureaucracy  ultimately  the congress controlled the budgets and had the biggest sway over agencies  staffing  said lewis  whose research has largely focused on executive branch politics and public administration  the white house has said agencies  longer term workforce reduction plans will serve to develop trump s  budget proposal   the overall decline in federal staffing this year is largely due to a roughly   drop at the department of defense to about    a   percent decline  even though trump s budget proposal envisaged small increases between  and  in employment measured by hours worked  pentagon spokesman dave eastburn said hiring was slow during the white house ordered freeze  but exemptions allowed recruitment for mission critical positions and military readiness was never affected  he described the decrease in staffing this year as  well within historical norms   in fact  the number of active duty service personnel  which was exempt from the hiring freeze  grew by about   in the  months through september  according to defense department data   still  cuts in the civilian staff could push more work onto relatively expensive contractors and military officers  potentially raising costs over time  said scott amey  general counsel at the project on government oversight  a non partisan watchdog group      if we re just cutting jobs to cut jobs then mistakes are likely to be made   amey said after reviewing reuters  calculations of opm data   mallory barg bulman  a researcher at the partnership for public service  a non partisan nonprofit  said targeting the number of jobs in general was not the best way of improving how the bureaucracy works   a hiring freeze is not the answer to making the government more effective   said barg bulman  instead  agencies should invest more in training to boost productivity  she said   the opm figures  which exclude the postal service and some smaller independent agencies  showed the declines were in part offset by staffing gains   totaling about     at the homeland security and veterans affairs departments  much of the gains were in divisions that control immigration and in medical care for former soldiers  areas trump has identified as priorities  the department of veterans affairs did not respond to a request for comment  a spokeswoman at the department of homeland security said staffing increases owed to revised recruitment strategies as well as temporary hiring for hurricane relief efforts  some staffing ups and downs at agencies are part of long standing budget issues or seasonal factors  the treasury department lost staff largely due to budget cuts ordered by congress in past years for its tax collection service  while the departments of interior and agriculture saw increases due to seasonal hiring   this version of the story has been refiled to clarify description of the partnership for public service in paragraph
