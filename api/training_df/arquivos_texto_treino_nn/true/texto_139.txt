washington  reuters    president donald trump s drive to win passage of a sweeping republican tax bill in the u s  congress hit potential obstacles on thursday as two more republican senators insisted on changes  joining a list of lawmakers whose support is uncertain  florida s marco rubio  a former presidential contender  told reporters on capitol hill that if the bill s proposed refundability to taxpayers of the child tax credit is not expanded   i m a no     it has to be higher than      rubio and mike lee of utah are in talks with other senators about expanding child tax credit refundability  said conn carroll  a lee spokesman  lee is now  undecided on the tax bill as currently written   carroll said in a telephone interview  the child tax credit now in the u s  tax code is meant to lower the tax bills of working families with children  as the fast moving republican tax package has evolved  it has tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and wealthy taxpayers  a trend that aides were saying privately is a growing concern for some lawmakers  provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last minute changes also were becoming worrisomely unclear  they said   after resisting demands for weeks to cut the top income tax rate for the richest taxpayers  the bill s authors did agree in recent days to lower it to  percent from   percent   my concern is that if you found the money to lower the top rate     you can t find a little bit to at least somewhat increase the refundable portion  of the child credit  rubio said  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the white house will continue to work with rubio on the child tax credit  the headline feature of the bill is a deep cut to  percent from  percent of the corporate income tax rate  a step that corporate tax lobbyists have been pursuing for many years  orrin hatch  chairman of the senate tax committee and one of the bill s chief authors  said the senate would probably vote on a final senate house measure on monday  he said he hoped rubio s concerns could be addressed   he s important to us   hatch said   i don t know what leadership wants to do on that  it s a problem  no question   the senate approved a wide ranging tax bill of its own on dec   by a vote of    senator bob corker was the only republican to join all  senate democrats and two independents in voting against the bill  earlier  the house of representatives had approved its own tax legislation  in recent days negotiators from both chambers have been scrambling to reconcile the two bills  changing specific parts on the fly to lock in enough votes to pass it  trump has said he wants a final bill on his desk for enactment before christmas  if it is enacted  the bill would be the first major legislative achievement for trump and the republicans since he took office in january   corker  a leading republican fiscal hawk  reiterated that his concerns about the bill s expansion of the federal deficit have not been addressed  independent and nonpartisan tax analysts have estimated that the bill will expand the   trillion national debt by at least   trillion in the next  years  moderate senator susan collins also has been non committal on the bill  in part out of concern about its provision to repeal an obamacare federal fine imposed on americans who do not buy health insurance  the senate vote outlook has been further muddled by senator john mccain s admission to the hospital for treatment for side effects of cancer therapy  his office said he  looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible    carroll said if the child tax credit were to be made fully refundable  it would cost about   billion in lost revenues over  years  lee and rubio want expanded refundability  under current law  a maximum child tax credit of    per eligible child under  is allowed on a portion of family earnings  in its current form  the legislation expands that credit but lee and rubio are seeking more help for families  especially in lower income brackets  the two senators failed in an effort to do that on the senate floor when the tax bill initially was debated  republicans have a  vote senate majority  so they can lose no more than two of their own votes and still win approval  with vice president mike pence able to vote to break a tie  pence has delayed a planned trip to the middle east in case his vote is needed on the final tax bill
