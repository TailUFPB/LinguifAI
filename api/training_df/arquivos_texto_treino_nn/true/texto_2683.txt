washington  reuters    the u s  congress could act within weeks to kill a new rule that bars financial companies from blocking consumers who wish to file class action lawsuits  according to a key republican senator  senator tom cotton  a member of the senate banking committee writing legislation to tackle the rule  said wednesday he was optimistic that congress could pass a resolution revoking the new regulation authored by the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  within weeks   i m going to do all i can to repeal this regulation in the next three weeks of this congressional session   he said at an event hosted by the u s  chamber of commerce  cotton is drafting legislation that would repeal the cfpb s new ban on mandatory arbitration clauses often found in financial contracts  under the congressional review act  congress can pass legislation repealing any new regulations with a simple majority   mandatory arbitration clauses  found across a range of financial contracts  require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class action lawsuits  consumer advocates have hailed the cfpb rulemaking  arguing that the fine print frequently found in financial contracts unfairly bars consumers from seeking that option  if republican majorities in the house and senate rally around the bill  they would be able to eliminate the new rule  which the cfpb formally finalized on tuesday  cotton said he was working with senate banking committee chairman mike crapo on the bill  and was optimistic it would garner broad support  he went so far as to predict  half a dozen or so  democrats in the senate could join republicans in eliminating the rule  although democrats are generally supportive of the cfpb s regulatory work and no democratic senator has publicly criticized the rule  the house is expected to move first on a repeal bill  passing a measure next week  according to cotton   republican efforts to repeal the regulation via legislation is one of several fronts in an attack on the cfpb initiative  other financial regulators could consider challenging the rule  and business groups have indicated a legal challenge is on the way as well   the agency has shirked its obligation to properly study the arbitration issue  as it was mandated by congress   said lisa rickard  president of the chamber of commerce s institute for legal reform   the courts will have their say
