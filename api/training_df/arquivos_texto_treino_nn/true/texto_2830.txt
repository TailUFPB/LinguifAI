washington  reuters    president donald trump s eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic white house rival hillary clinton as part of moscow s official support for his father  according to emails released on tuesday  the emails  released by donald trump jr   are the most concrete evidence yet that trump campaign officials welcomed russian help to win the election  a subject that has cast a cloud over trump s presidency and spurred investigations by the justice department and congress  the messages show that the younger trump was open to the prospect of  very high level and sensitive information  from a russian attorney that a go between described as  part of russia and its government s support for mr  trump  ahead of a meeting on june       if it s what you say i love it   trump jr  responded  he released the messages on twitter after the new york times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him   bit ly  and bit ly       in an interview with fox news  trump jr  said that trump s campaign manager at the time  paul manafort  and son in law jared kushner  now a top white house adviser  also attended the meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya  who denies having kremlin ties  he said veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss russian sanctions   in retrospect  i probably would have done things a little differently   he said   for me  this was opposition research   nevertheless  the correspondence between him and rob goldstone  a publicist who arranged the meeting  could provide fodder for u s  investigators probing whether trump s campaign colluded with the kremlin   the crown prosecutor of russia     offered to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father   goldstone wrote trump jr  on june   russia does not have a  crown prosecutor    the equivalent title is prosecutor general  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that moscow sought to help trump win the election  in part by releasing private emails from democratic party officials   the conversation will now turn to whether president trump was personally involved or not  but the question of the campaign s involvement appears settled now   cornell law school professor jens david ohlin said in an interview   the answer is yes    moscow has denied any interference  and trump says his campaign did not collude with russia  trump jr  said he did not tell his father about the meeting  he said he may have since had contact with other russians   i ve probably met with other people from russia  but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything   he said on fox news  the news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration s economic agenda  stocks and the dollar fell  while u s  treasury securities gained ground  stocks later retraced most of their losses after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell pledged to keep lawmakers in washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare  along with his younger brother eric  trump jr  oversees the trump organization  his father s real estate and business empire  and does not have a formal role in the white house   my son is a high quality person and i applaud his transparency   trump said in a statement  the white house referred questions to lawyers for trump and his son  the emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity  but legal experts say trump jr  could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action  such as hacking into democratic computer networks  or violated campaign finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities  he is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter   the senate intelligence committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents  according to a senate source  while the house of representatives intelligence committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting  said the panel s top democrat  representative adam schiff   the american people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family   schiff told reporters  on fox news  trump jr  said he was  more than happy to cooperate with everyone   senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley  a republican  asked the trump administration how veselnitskaya was able to enter the united states even though her authorization had expired  cnn reported that special counsel robert mueller  who is heading a criminal investigation at the justice department  also planned to look into the meeting  vice president mike pence  who has said the campaign had no contacts with russia  said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting  held before he became trump s running mate later that summer  senator lindsey graham  a south carolina republican who is at times harshly critical of trump  told reporters   this is very problematic  we cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody s campaign and say   we d like to help you
