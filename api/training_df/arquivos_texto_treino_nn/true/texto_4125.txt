san francisco new york  reuters    president donald trump s travel ban on citizens of six muslim majority nations faces its second challenge at a u s  appeals court next month  and this time more republican states are backing the measure  while one democratic state attorney general dropped out of the legal fight this week  some legal experts say the states  realignment could signal that the changes made last month to trump s original executive order have strengthened the government s case  sixteen democratic state attorneys general and the district of colombia on thursday filed a  friend of the court  brief backing hawaii in its bid to block the march  executive order  which two federal judges put on hold before it could be implemented  hawaii and other states argue the ban violates the u s  constitution because it discriminates against muslims  but pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro  who opposed the original ban that trump signed on jan    did not join thursday s brief  which was filed in the  u s  circuit court of appeals in san francisco  shapiro declined to comment   on the other side  texas  which had been alone in its support for the original january order  has gained the support of  republican states urging that the ban go forward in a legal brief filed on april   those states back the government s argument that the president has wide authority to implement immigration policy and that the ban is needed to prevent terrorist attacks  trump s original ban  which the president said was needed for national security to head off attacks by islamist militants  applied to seven muslim majority nations and indefinitely banned the entry of all refugees from syria  it was revised and narrowed after a flurry of legal challenges   the second executive order was much more carefully written than the first  maybe when various states analyzed it they weren t as interested as joining   said stephen yale loehr an immigration expert at cornell university law school  however  he said   amicus briefs sometimes are filed for political reasons    some judges pay close attention to amicus briefs  while others disregard them  the u s  department of justice declined to comment  trump s january order was hastily implemented just days after his inauguration  leading to chaos and protests at airports and more than two dozen lawsuits  a federal judge in seattle halted the order and the  circuit upheld that ruling  the white house re crafted the order to exclude legal permanent residents and removed iraq from the list of targeted countries  iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen are still included in the new order  the new ban also dropped language giving preference to refugees who are part of a persecuted religious minority in their country of citizenship  the changes were meant to chip away at the plaintiffs   standing  to sue  which requires that anyone bringing a lawsuit show they have been directly harmed by the action they are contesting   but as soon as the second order was signed  states and civil rights groups went back to court  saying that it was still discriminatory   federal district judges in maryland and hawaii put the second order on hold before it could take effect on march     the judge in hawaii blocked the two central sections of the ban  on travel and refugees  while the maryland judge only halted the travel portion   most of the focus is now on the hawaii case  which is being heard by the  circuit on may    the  circuit appeals court in virginia is slated to hear arguments in the maryland case on may    not all states have staked out a side in the fight  pennsylvania now is among  states  including michigan  ohio  and new jersey that have not taken sides on the issue  opting not to file any legal briefs
