washington  reuters    mitch mcconnell  the u s  senate s top republican  clung to slim hopes on tuesday that his party could still dismantle obamacare  despite not having adequate support for a repeal bill  facing the possibility of another failure to make good on their  year old pledge to roll back the healthcare law  mcconnell told senators the debate on healthcare would continue  he said nothing about whether he would bring the repeal bill to a vote  leaving open the option of letting the measure simply die if more firm votes for it cannot be nailed down  republicans have vowed for years to get rid of the  affordable care act  or obamacare  but they are up against a sept   deadline to pass a bill with a simple majority  or face a much tougher path toward dismantling it  senator susan collins rebuffed intense lobbying from fellow republicans and the promise of money for her state when she decided on monday to oppose   and likely doom   the latest effort to repeal obamacare  it was a blow for president donald trump who has made undoing democratic former president barack obama s signature healthcare law a top priority since the  campaign and who pressured collins in a call on monday  republicans hold a slim   majority in the senate and  at least two other republican senators  john mccain and rand paul  have already rejected the bill  no votes from mccain  collins and another republican  lisa murkowski  killed an effort by the senate to undo obamacare in july  while obamacare extended health insurance to some  million americans  many republicans believe it is an unwarranted and costly government intrusion into healthcare  while also opposing taxes it imposed on the wealthy  mcconnell opened the senate on tuesday by praising the measure  which is sponsored by republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy  he said it contrasted sharply with democratic proposals for  single payer  healthcare   it s an important debate for our country   mcconnell said   it s one that will certainly continue   the graham cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the medicaid program for the poor and disabled  as well as subsidies to help americans buy private insurance  and divvy it up to the states in block grants  one main complaint by opponents of the bill is that it would mean sweeping cuts in funding to medicaid
