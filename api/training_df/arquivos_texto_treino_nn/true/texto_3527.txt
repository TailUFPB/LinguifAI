washington  reuters    the trump administration is nearing completion of a policy review to determine how far it goes in rolling back former president barack obama s engagement with cuba and could make an announcement next month  according to current and former u s  officials and people familiar with the discussions  president donald trump s advisers are crafting recommendations that could call for tightening some of the trade and travel rules that obama eased in his rapprochement with havana but which are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in  after more than five decades of hostility  the sources said  the policy review  coordinated by the national security council  is expected pick up steam now that trump has returned from his first foreign trip  one administration official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  the white house did not respond to a request for comment  trump threatened in a tweet shortly after his election in november to  terminate  obama s approach unless cuba made significant concessions  something its communist leadership is unlikely to do  the white house said in february that cuba policy was under comprehensive review and that human rights on the island would be a major part of any revised strategy  obama implemented his cuba normalization measures through executive actions that bypassed congress  and trump is believed to have the power to undo much of it with the stroke of a pen  but there are divisions within his administration over to what extent he should go  especially given that obama s opening to washington s former cold war foe has created opportunities for american companies ranging from telecommunications to airlines  some aides have argued that trump  a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash u s  businesses and create jobs  would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the cuban market  a group of  u s  senators reintroduced legislation last thursday to repeal all remaining restrictions on travel to cuba  signaling support for u s  cuba detente on capitol hill  but the republican administration has been under heavy pressure from cuban american lawmakers such as u s  senator marco rubio and u s  representative mario diaz balart to take a much harder line than trump s democratic predecessor  there is little support in the administration  however  for a full scale reversal of obama s steps that began with a  breakthrough with cuban president raul castro in   among the options under consideration are tightening restrictions on u s  firms doing business with cuban state or military enterprises and re imposing stricter rules on  americans traveling there  according to people familiar with the discussions  it remains unclear  however  which recommendation will make their way to trump  though the sources said a list was likely to be ready for his consideration in coming days or weeks   we re getting closer   an administration official said  an announcement of changes could come as soon as june  according to the official and people familiar with the matter  the daily caller newspaper reported on sunday that trump would announce policy changes in a june speech in miami  citing sources from a group opposed to the broader u s  economic embargo that remains in place against cuba  but the timing could also depend on factors such as whether trump fills key latin america posts at the state department and elsewhere that remain vacant  sources told reuters  the white house considered making a cuba announcement on may  to mark the  anniversary of cuba s independence  but that coincided with trump s overseas trip and the review also was not yet finished  the sources said
