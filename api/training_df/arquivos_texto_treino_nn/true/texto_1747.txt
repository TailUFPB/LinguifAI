washington  reuters    president donald trump said on wednesday that taxes on rich americans might rise  as he pursues a tax code overhaul and reaches out to both democrats and republicans in a push to win support for a plan still far from complete  trump met with the two top congressional democrats over dinner at the white house in a search for common ground that could make it easier to get a tax cut package through congress  both sides said the meeting  which covered an array of legislative issues  was productive  earlier  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said tax reductions would be paid for by faster economic growth  the white house and the republican led congress have yet to put forth a detailed tax plan  despite months of high level talks that had until recent days excluded democrats  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said an outline of a plan would be unveiled during the work week beginning sept    with congressional tax writing committees crafting detailed legislation in the subsequent weeks  mnuchin told fox news channel the trump administration would use its own economic assumptions to gauge the impact of its tax cuts on the federal budget deficit and the   trillion national debt  a key issue in washington s intensifying tax debate   it will be revenue neutral under our growth assumptions   mnuchin said   so  we can pay for these tax cuts with economic growth   the administration believes tax cuts will lead to much faster growth than do congressional analysts or most private forecasters  a likely fault line in the debate ahead  as for taxing the rich  trump said during a meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers   his second in as many days   that the wealthy  will not be gaining at all with this plan      if they have to go higher  they ll go higher  frankly   in a phone call with a small group of reporters  marc short  trump s legislative affairs director  said the president was not talking about higher tax rates  but that other changes in the tax code could affect the wealthy and how much they pay  the publication roll call reported   democrats have criticized republican tax overhaul efforts as benefiting mainly the wealthiest americans and corporations  tax experts said trump could raise taxes on high income people by lowering the cap on mortgages eligible for interest deductions to    from   million  another step might be to close a loophole that lets wall street fund managers pay low taxes on much of their income  analysts said  trump might also propose eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes  then use the revenue raised to fund tax cuts for the middle class  leaving top earners with a higher effective tax bill  there has also been talk in the senate about increasing tax rates on capital gains and dividends  but even with those changes  analysts said it was not clear top earners would end up paying more overall  partly because trump has also proposed cutting the top individual tax rate  steven rosenthal  a senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center think tank in washington  said trump was unlikely to raise taxes on investment income  instead  he said  trump could close a loophole that largely benefits super rich financiers  although they may be able to find other ways to avoid taxes   that s what i would expect him to do  take a symbolic but ineffective step   rosenthal said  trump hosted senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi on wednesday evening to discuss tax overhaul plans and other legislative items  a white house official said the meeting was constructive and covered border security and the status of so called dreamers who came to the united states illegally as children  as well as infrastructure and trade  in addition to taxes   the administration looks forward to continuing these conversations with leadership on both sides of the aisle   the official said  in a joint statement  schumer and pelosi called the meeting  very productive  and said it focused mainly on the plight of the  dreamers   nearly   young immigrants who are able to live and work in the united states legally under the obama era daca program that trump recently rescinded   we agreed to enshrine the protections of daca into law quickly  and to work out a package of border security  excluding the wall  that s acceptable to both sides   they said  one of trump s major campaign promises was building a wall the entire length of the u s  mexican border     in his meeting earlier on wednesday with eight democratic and five republican house members  trump had expressed hope he could bring a fresh bipartisanship to washington  asked what his message was to skeptical conservatives who worry he is cozying up to democrats  trump said   i m a conservative  and i will tell you i m not skeptical  and i think that if we can do things in a bipartisan manner  that ll be great  now it might not work out   trump blindsided republican leaders last week by striking a deal with schumer and pelosi on the u s  debt limit and federal spending for three months  ryan said the outline being worked on now would reflect the consensus of the house ways and means committee  the senate finance committee and the trump administration   i would love to have the democrats supporting and working with us in a constructive way on tax reform  but we re going to do it no matter what   ryan said  there has been no comprehensive u s  tax code overhaul since   and starkly different visions embraced by the two parties for how to move forward promise to make the task difficult   asked about trump s comment on a possible tax increase for the wealthy  house ways and means chairman kevin brady said   my goal is to lower taxes on every american as much as possible and help them keep more of what they earn
