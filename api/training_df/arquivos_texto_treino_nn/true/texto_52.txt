new york  reuters    passage of a long anticipated u s  tax overhaul has up ended the bond market s favorite trade of the year as yields on some long dated treasuries shot to their highest in months  but doubts that the tax cuts will fuel inflation have many investors confident the reversal will be short lived  the view that the u s  federal reserve will keep raising short term interest rates  even as inflation remains subdued  has made longer dated treasury bonds more appealing to own than short dated ones  this has made so called yield curve flattener trades   a bet that the gap between short  and long dated bond yields will narrow   a profitable bet in the bond market this year  investors  appetite for this trade drove the yield curve to its flattest level in a decade earlier this week  however  a sharp reversal got underway as the tax bill s passage became certain  paving the way for a bigger government deficit and more federal borrowing   it s a great time to cash out   said brian reynolds  asset class strategist at new york based canaccord genuity   both republican controlled congressional chambers have approved the tax legislation  and president donald trump is expected to sign it in the days ahead     the treasury market selloff pushed the benchmark  year yield up to nearly   percent  its highest in nine months and the  year yield to around   percent  a five week peak  some analysts reckoned the jump in yields reflects investors demanding higher compensation  or term premium  in case the tax cuts stoke inflation and hurt longer dated bonds  how long this prevails is an open question  though  given previous episodes of curve steepening in the last year have quickly faded   in other words  sharp term premium moves tend not be permanent   cornerstone macro analysts said in a note on wednesday  in late afternoon trading  the spread between two year and  year treasury yields was  basis points versus  basis points on tuesday and around  earlier in the week  even with this week s steepening  the two to  year part of the curve has flattened nearly  basis points this year  curve flatteners are seen as likely to regain popularity in the long run due to a low inflation outlook and sturdy global demand for long dated u s  debt  in the short term  however  it may prove a choppy trade as investors gauge the bill s impact   it s hard to predict how the yield curve would behave in the short term  the biggest question is the timing and level of cash flows going to the government after tax reform   canaccord s reynolds said  one factor is the mountain of corporate cash held overseas  as part of the new tax code  u s  multinational companies could bring back some of the estimated    trillion in business profits they have overseas and the treasury department could benefit from the taxes on the repatriated money   reynolds estimated the treasury might receive as much as   billion in tax receipts in  if the companies bring back all their overseas profits  this means the government could issue fewer two  and three year treasury securities  pressuring these yields lower and steepening the yield curve into   he said   independent government estimates suggest the tax plan could add at least   trillion to the   trillion in national debt in  years as the treasury department would ratchet up borrowing to compensate for shortfalls in tax receipts  the degree to which the bill may spur both business investment and consumer spending  which could lift tax receipts and cap the rise in the deficit  is another key unknown for the shape of the yield curve going forward  still  the dominant view on wall street remains that the cut will provide only a short term bump up in economic growth  and many analysts expect the longer term curve flattening trend to reassert itself in the year ahead   accordingly  we maintain our conviction on curve flattening going into    morgan stanley analysts wrote in a note on wednesday
