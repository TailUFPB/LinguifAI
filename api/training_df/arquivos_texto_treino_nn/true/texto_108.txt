washington  reuters    congressional republicans on friday unveiled the final version of their dramatic u s  tax overhaul   debt financed cuts for businesses  the wealthy and some middle class americans   and picked up crucial support from two wavering senators ahead of planned votes by lawmakers early next week  passage of the biggest u s  tax rewrite since  would provide republican lawmakers and president donald trump their first major legislative victory since he took office in january  prospects for approval soared after republican senators marco rubio and bob corker pledged support  three republican senators  enough to defeat the measure in a senate that trump s party controls with a slim   majority  remained uncommitted  susan collins  jeff flake and mike lee  the final version hammered out between senate and house of representatives republicans after each chamber previously passed competing versions contained no surprises  it would cut the corporate income tax rate to  percent from  percent  according to a summary distributed to reporters by congressional tax writers  corporate tax lobbyists have been seeking a tax cut of this magnitude for many years  the bill  the summary showed  would create a  percent business income tax deduction for owners of  pass through  businesses  such as partnerships and sole proprietorships  allow for immediate write off by corporations of new equipment costs  and eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax  under a new territorial system  the bill would exempt u s  corporations from taxes on most of their future foreign profits  it also sets a one time tax for companies to repatriate more than    trillion now held overseas  at rates of   percent for cash and cash equivalents and  percent for illiquid assets  if passed by congress  the changes would be in effect for  taxes  with tax returns for  unaffected  democrats have been unified against the measure  calling it a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit  bernie sanders  a leading liberal voice in the senate who unsuccessfully sought the democratic presidential nomination last year  called the bill  a moral and economic obscenity    it is a gift to wealthy republican campaign contributors and an insult to the working families of our country   sanders said  republicans have said the tax cuts are needed because the economy is not expanding quickly enough   now the american people are closer to a plan that will deliver higher wages  lower taxes  a simpler system  and a stronger american economy   house republican leader kevin mccarthy said  the house was expected to vote on the bill on tuesday  republicans have a large majority there  and passage was expected despite democratic opposition  the bill would then go to the senate  republicans can afford to lose only two votes from within their own ranks and still win senate passage  the tax bill was expected to add at least   trillion to the  trillion u s  national debt over  years  making it an unusual example of deficit spending on stimulative tax cuts at a time when the economy is already expanding  for months  trump has touted the bill as a middle class tax cut  studies from independent analysts and non partisan congressional researchers have projected that corporations and the rich would benefit disproportionately  the republican bill would maintain the existing seven individual and family income tax brackets with rates of            and  percent  that top rate  for the highest earning americans  would be cut from today s   percent  republicans abandoned their quest to eliminate the estate tax on inherited assets  a move that would have benefited the richest americans  but they did propose increasing the exemption for the tax to   million from   million person  the bill does not eliminate wall street s so called carried interest loophole that allows fund managers to claim a lower capital gains tax rate on profits from investments held more than a year  getting rid of the loophole was a trump campaign pledge  instead  the legislation makes it harder for some fund managers to take advantage of the loopholes by requiring them to hold investments for more than three years before claiming it  trump  who last year promised voters major tax cuts  wants a bill on his desk before the dec   christmas holiday so he can sign it into law and finish  with at least one big win in congress before the  mid term election campaigns  when republicans will defend their senate and house of representatives majorities  since sweeping to power in washington in january  trump and his fellow republicans have failed to pass major legislation including a promised healthcare overhaul  while trump s public approval ratings have remained low  since last month  republicans have lost hard fought elections in alabama and virginia  stock markets have been rallying for months in anticipation of sharply lower tax rates for corporations  wealthy financiers and business owners  all of which the bill would deliver  wall street s three major stock indexes closed at record  highs on friday  driven by corporate tax rates that looked likely to pass  the dow jones industrial average  dji rose   percent to     the s p   spx gained   percent to    and the nasdaq composite  ixic rose   percent  to     as the tax package evolved  it tilted increasingly toward benefiting businesses and the wealthy  provisions for offsetting the revenue costs of last minute changes were troublesome for some lawmakers  rubio said he would support the bill after its approach to the child tax credit was changed  the bill doubles the credit  meant to help reduce the costs of raising kids  to    per dependent child under the age of   with a refundable portion of     that refundable portion was raised from    at the last minute to win rubio s backing  lee called the change to the child credit  a big win  but stopped short of endorsing the bill until he saw the details  corker  a fiscal hawk who opposed an earlier bill that passed the senate because of its deficit impact  said the final measure was  far from perfect  but he would support it  calling it a  once in a generation opportunity  to help u s  businesses  collins has remained non committal  in part out of concern about a provision that would repeal the fine imposed under the affordable care act  or obamacare  on americans who do not obtain health insurance  flake has said he needs to see all the details before supporting the measure  the senate vote outlook has been complicated by republican senator john mccain s hospitalization for treatment for side effects of cancer therapy  his office said he  looks forward to returning to work as soon as possible   vice president mike pence has delayed a trip to the middle east in case his vote is needed to break a senate tie
