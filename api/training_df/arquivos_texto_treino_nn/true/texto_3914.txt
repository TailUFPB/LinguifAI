washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump  on his third try at overhauling obamacare  sent no tweets attacking fellow republicans  set no  deadlines and issued no public ultimatums  lawmakers who met with him said he spoke with them  not at them  some lawmakers and aides in the u s  house of representatives were hesitant to credit trump or his softer approach with thursday s   vote rolling back president barack obama s signature  healthcare overhaul  several aides emphasized the role of house republican leaders and vice president mike pence in bridging differences between the party s moderates and hardline conservatives  others said they saw a different trump at work this week versus march   when he backed a bill that collapsed and again in april when his fellow republicans failed a second time   representative mark sanford  a republican member of the conservative house freedom caucus  said on thursday that in march the white house threatened to work against his re election bid if he balked at supporting the healthcare bill  this time trump  who took office in january  was  largely absent   sanford said  adding   they got it clear that threats were not going to work with me   in white house talks with republican representatives fred upton and billy long  trump helped to nail down critical moderate votes  a senior white house official said trump worked the phones this time and realized it had been a mistake to set a deadline the first time  trump spoke with speaker paul ryan  the leading house republican  during late night calls  in conversations with lawmakers  trump kept the focus on meeting a republican promise from the  election campaign to roll back a federal government healthcare law that they view as too costly and over reaching  any plan to overhaul obamacare faces a tougher battle in the  member u s  senate  where republicans hold a slimmer majority  while republicans control both the white house and congress  senators are traditionally less easily moved by presidential pressure than members of the house  democrats in both houses remained firmly opposed to a bill they said would deprive millions of americans of healthcare coverage   the bill is going nowhere fast in the united states senate   said senate democratic leader chuck schumer  pre existing medical conditions a key house republicans joined an exuberant trump for a victory lap in the white house rose garden after the vote  turning to ryan  trump reminded him of the criticism the speaker faced when the healthcare bill stalled in the house the first time   for the last week  i ve been hearing   paul ryan doesn t have it     then today  i heard paul ryan is a genius    trump said  a key turning point came on monday  when upton and four other republican lawmakers met to discuss how the rollback bill could be changed to better protect people with pre existing medical conditions  a concern for republican moderates  no amendment had been hammered out by tuesday and upton  an influential moderate  said he opposed the bill  as did long  a close trump ally  trump called them both to the white house  at their meeting on wednesday  upton and long reminded trump of his promise in a weekend television interview that the republican plan would protect people with pre existing medical conditions  they pressed him to stand by that commitment and it worked  trump endorsed their amendment to add some money to the republican bill for that purpose   white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said trump had  to  meetings or calls with house republicans ahead of the vote  she said the president was  directly engaged   if senate republicans can pass a bill  a house senate panel of negotiators likely would have to iron out the differences and present a compromise version for both chambers to pass   my only concern is the u s  senate   said republican representative dave brat  a freedom caucus member   if they come back with any big changes that will make life a little tough   brat said trump s role will be important   the new variable is president trump  if he gets out there and puts a little heat on it   then a senate house compromise is possible
