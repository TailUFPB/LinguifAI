washington  reuters    u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross is likely to impose a new sugar trade deal with mexico even if final revisions to it fail to win support from the u s  industry  trade lawyers and experts say  after announcing a deal this week that would dramatically cut the amount of refined sugar that mexico ships to the united states  officials from the two countries are working with their industries on final language that would govern its operation  at issue is a new right of first refusal granted to mexico to supply all u s  sugar needs not met by domestic suppliers or other foreign quota holders  a coalition of american sugar cane and beet farmers and a major refiner want a more explicit guarantee that the u s  department of agriculture  not mexican producers  will dictate what type of sugar fills that gap  they are worried that a flood of refined sugar will pour in  rather than the raw sugar needed to keep u s  mills running  the final sticking point stands in the way of resolving a years long dispute over mexican access to the highly regulated u s  sugar market  which is protected by a complex web of subsidies and rationed quotas for foreign producers   the sugar industry is known for its sway in washington  but its point of view on mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda makers   the trump administration wants to clear away the sugar dispute and a lumber trade row with canada before starting full scale negotiations to revise the north american free trade agreement  an industry rarely objects to a government negotiated  settlement of its anti dumping case  and u s  sugar producers could do little to stop the commerce department from implementing a final deal after a two week comment period  said seattle based trade lawyer william perry  who previously worked at commerce and the u s  international trade commission  while the industry could ask the international trade commission to overturn the settlement that suspends anti dumping and anti subsidy duty orders issued in   chances for success look slim  the panel in  rejected a challenge by two sugar refiners to the previous u s  mexico pact   petitioners are never entirely happy with suspension agreements like this   perry said   they would rather have anti dumping and countervailing duty orders with rates high enough to shut out imports   a commerce spokesman said that ross hoped the u s  sugar industry would ultimately endorse the final agreement  gary hufbauer  a trade expert at the peterson institute for international economics  said the administration was probably willing to compromise on some industry specific concerns to help reach its larger nafta goals of reducing u s  trade deficits  the u s  sugar industry must probably present evidence of new mexican dumping before going back to commerce for more changes to the deal  said daniel pearson  a senior fellow of the libertarian cato institute and former international trade commission chairman   they would do well to take this agreement and run with it and see how it works   pearson said  noting that it raises prices and keeps u s  refiners well supplied with raw sugar  mexico made major concessions to maintain its access to the lucrative u s  market  agreeing to ship no less than  percent of its quota volume as raw sugar to u s  refineries  it gave ground on nearly all of the u s  producers  demands   american sugar alliance spokesman phillip hayes said the final hurdle should be easy to address by making clear that the usda  not mexico  can dictate the type and purity level of any additional imports  but juan cortina  head of mexico s main sugar trade group   said there was no problem with the language because any additional needs would filled with raw sugar  as mexican producers would have to keep higher inventories of that grade
