washington  reuters    president donald trump and his fellow republicans who control congress face their first major budget test next week  with the threat of a u s  government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed mexican border wall as well as obamacare funding  with republicans controlling the white house and both chambers of congress  keeping the federal government operating is a basic test of their ability to govern  but their task could become even more complicated if they insist on using the spending legislation to bring about contentious policy changes  not only must republicans overcome intraparty ideological divisions that stopped major healthcare legislation last month  but they will have to win over some opposition democrats with provisions that could be distasteful to conservatives  with the senate reconvening on monday and the house of representatives on tuesday after a two week recess  lawmakers will have only four days to pass a spending package to keep the government open beyond april   when funding expires for numerous federal programs   i think we want to keep the government open   trump said on thursday  adding he thinks congress can pass the funding legislation and perhaps also a revamped healthcare bill  democratic support depends on what provisions republicans demand in the bill  democrats have signaled they would not cooperate if it contains money for one of trump s top priorities  a southwestern border wall intended to combat illegal immigration  or if it ends federal subsidies to help low income people buy health insurance under the affordable care act  known as obamacare  which republicans want to repeal  democrats also want federal funds maintained for planned parenthood  which many republicans oppose because the women s healthcare provider performs abortions  another obstacle would be if trump demands large defense spending increases coupled with deep cuts to domestic programs democrats want to protect  late on thursday  leading house democrats were voicing skepticism a deal could be reached by the deadline  in a telephone call for house democrats  representative nita lowey  the senior democrat on the house appropriations committee  said   i don t see how we can meet that deadline  and avoid having to pass a short term extension  according to an aide on the call  the second ranking house democrat  representative steny hoyer  told his fellow democrats that they should only support such a short term measure if a deal on long term bill is reached and only finishing touches remained  the aide said  republican leaders face a familiar balancing act  satisfying the party s most conservative members while not alienating its moderates  rules in the  seat senate mean trump s party also would need the support of at least eight democrats even if the republicans remain unified  giving the opposition party leverage  house republican leaders would need some democratic votes if the most conservative lawmakers object to the bill  as they did to the healthcare plan championed by speaker paul ryan  with congressional elections looming next year  republicans acknowledge the stakes are high   even our most recalcitrant members understand that if you shut down the government while you re running it and you control the house and the senate  you can t blame anybody but yourself   said representative tom cole  a senior house appropriations committee republican  white house budget director mick mulvaney said the trump administration was willing to talk to democrats about funding for obamacare subsidies in exchange for their agreement to include some trump priorities such as the wall  the defense hike and more money for immigration enforcement   it is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and democrats some of their priorities  so we think we ve opened the door for that   mulvaney said  democrats reacted negatively   everything had been moving smoothly until the administration moved in with a heavy hand  not only are democrats opposed to the wall  there is significant republican opposition as well   said matt house  a spokesman for senate democratic leader chuck schumer  the government was last forced to close in october   when republican senator ted cruz and some of the most conservative house republicans engineered a  day shutdown in an unsuccessful quest to kill democratic former president barack obama s healthcare law   these kind of bills can t pass without a reasonable number of the party of the minority in the senate  and we are optimistic we will be able to work all that out   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said at the start of the spring recess  a deal is needed because congress was unable to approve funding for the entire  fiscal year that ends in september and has relied on stop gap spending legislation  congress has passed no major legislation since trump took office in january  and he has ambitious hopes for major tax cut legislation  infrastructure spending and other bills  with the difficulty passing a bill with so many divisive elements  lawmakers next week might need to buy time by passing a short term bill lasting possibly one to three weeks  maintaining current spending levels   that would be a setback  not catastrophic  but not a good thing  and a sign that you can t govern   cole said  a federal closure would shutter national park service destinations like the statue of liberty  yellowstone and the grand canyon  government medical research would be suspended  thousands of federal workers would be furloughed with thousands more working without pay until the shutdown ends  including homeland security personnel  some veterans benefits could be suspended  time would stand still in the u s  capitol with nobody on duty to wind the  year old  ohio clock  just outside the senate chamber
