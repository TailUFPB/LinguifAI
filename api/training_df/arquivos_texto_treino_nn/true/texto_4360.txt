palm beach  fla   reuters    chinese president xi jinping urged cooperation with the united states on trade and investment on thursday  inviting president donald trump to visit china in a cordial start to their first meeting likely to broach sensitive security and commercial issues  trump has said he wants to raise concerns about china s trade practices and press xi to do more to rein in north korea s nuclear ambitions during his two day visit to the spanish style mar a lago resort in palm beach  florida  though no major deals on either issue are expected  the two sides should promote the  healthy development of bilateral trade and investment  and advance talks on a bilateral investment agreement  xi said  according to a statement on china s foreign ministry website   we have a thousand reasons to get china u s  relations right  and not one reason to spoil the china u s  relationship   xi told trump  trump accepted xi s invitation to china later this year  state news agency xinhua news agency cited officials as saying on friday  xi and his wife  peng liyuan  joined trump and his wife  melania  at a long table in an ornate candle lit private dining room festooned with red and yellow floral centerpieces  where they dined on pan seared dover sole and new york strip steak   trump  a new york real estate magnate before he ran for office  joked before dinner   we ve had a long discussion already  and so far i have gotten nothing  absolutely nothing  but we have developed a friendship   i can see that   and i think long term we are going to have a very  very great relationship and i look very much forward to it   the fanfare over the summit on thursday was overshadowed by another pressing foreign policy issue  the u s  response to a deadly poison gas attack in syria  as trump and xi were wrapping up dinner  u s  forces fired dozens of cruise missiles at a syrian airbase from which it said the chemical weapons attack was launched this week  an escalation of the u s  military role in syria that swiftly drew sharp criticism from russia   in beijing  china s foreign ministry urged all parties in syria to find a political settlement  trump and xi were expected to get into more detailed discussions about trade and foreign policy issues on friday  concluding their summit with a working lunch  trump promised during the  presidential campaign to stop what he called the theft of american jobs by china and rebuild the country s manufacturing base  many blue collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory in november and trump wants to deliver for them   we have been treated unfairly and have made terrible trade deals with china for many  many years  that s one of the things we are going to be talking about   trump told reporters ahead of the meeting  the bilateral investment treaty mentioned by xi  talks on which began during former president george w  bush s administration and resumed under barack obama  has received little attention since trump took office   trump is still finding his footing in the white house and has yet to spell out a strategy for what his advisers called a trade relationship based on  the principle of reciprocity   he brought his top economic and national advisers to florida for the meeting  including defense secretary jim mattis  treasury secretary steven mnuchin  and commerce secretary wilbur ross   even as we share a desire to work together  the united states does recognize the challenges china can present to american interests   said secretary of state rex tillerson  also in florida for the meeting  trump s daughter  ivanka  and her husband  jared kushner  who both work at the white house  also were among the dinner guests  the summit brings together two leaders who could not seem more different  the often stormy trump  prone to angry tweets  and xi  outwardly calm  measured and tightly scripted  with no known social media presence   what worries the protocol conscious chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable trump could publicly embarrass xi  after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new u s  president   ensuring president xi does not lose face is a top priority for china   a chinese official said  the most urgent problem facing trump and xi is how to persuade nuclear armed north korea to halt unpredictable behavior like missile test launches that have heightened tensions in south korea and japan  north korea is working to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the united states  trump has threatened to use trade to try to force china to exert influence over pyongyang   i think china will be stepping up   trump told reporters on thursday  beijing says its influence is limited and that it is doing all it can  the white house is reviewing options to pressure pyongyang economically and militarily  including  secondary sanctions  against chinese banks and firms that do the most business with pyongyang  a long standing option of pre emptive strikes remains on the table  but despite the tougher recent u s  talk  the internal review  de emphasizes direct military action   the u s  official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  analysts believe any military action would likely provoke severe north korean retaliation and massive casualties in south korea and japan and among u s  troops stationed there  on trade  u s  labor leaders say trump needs to take a direct  unambiguous tone in his talks with xi   president trump needs to come away from the meeting with concrete deliverables that will restore production and employment here in the u s  in those sectors that have been ravaged by china s predatory and protectionist practices   said holly hart  legislative director for the united steelworkers union  a u s  administration official told reuters that washington expects to have to use legal tools to fight for u s  companies  such as pursuing world trade organization lawsuits   i don t expect a grand bargain on trade  i think what you are going to see is that the president makes very clear to xi and publicly what we expect on trade   a u s  official told reuters  speaking on condition of anonymity  trump has often complained beijing undervalues its currency to boost trade  but his administration looks unlikely to formally label china a currency manipulator in the near term   a designation that could come with penalties
