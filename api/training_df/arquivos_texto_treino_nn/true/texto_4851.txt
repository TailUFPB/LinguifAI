beijing  reuters    the united states and china will work together to get nuclear armed north korea take  a different course   u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said on saturday  softening previous criticism of beijing after talks with his chinese counterpart  china has been irritated at being repeatedly told by washington to rein in north korea s surging nuclear and ballistic missile programmes  one of a series of hurdles in ties between the world s two largest economies  but chinese foreign minister wang yi described the talks with tillerson as  candid  pragmatic and productive   the two sides appeared to have made some progress or put aside differences on difficult issues  at least in advance of a planned summit between chinese president xi jinping and u s  president donald trump   on friday  tillerson issued the trump administration s starkest warning yet to north korea  saying in seoul that a military response would be  on the table  if pyongyang took action to threaten south korean and u s  forces  tillerson took a softer line after the meeting with wang  he told reporters both china and the united states noted efforts over the last two decades had not succeeded in curbing the threat posed by north korea s weapons programmes   we share a common view and a sense that tensions on the peninsula are quite high right now and that things have reached a rather dangerous level  and we ve committed ourselves to doing everything we can to prevent any type of conflict from breaking out   tillerson said  he said wang and he agreed to work together to persuade north korea  make a course correction and move away from the development of their nuclear weapons   wang said u n  resolutions on north korea both mapped out sanctions and called for efforts to resume efforts for a negotiated settlement   no matter what happens  we have to stay committed to diplomatic means as a way to seek peaceful settlement   he said  wang said he and tillerson  both hope to find ways to restart the talks    neither of us are ready to give up the hope for peace   he said  tillerson had said on friday that any talks on north korea could only take place after it began the process of unwinding its weapons programmes  a u s  official had told reuters in washington earlier this week that tillerson may raise the prospect of imposing  secondary sanctions  on chinese banks and other firms doing business with north korea in defiance of u n  sanctions  trump said in a tweet on friday that north korea was  behaving very badly  and accused china  pyongyang s neighbour and only major ally  of doing little to resolve the crisis  xi trump summit however  the two sides appear to have toned down differences as they work on finalising a trip by xi to the united states  possibly next month  for his first summit with trump  wang said the two countries were in  close communication  on arranging the meeting  but gave no details       the state run chinese tabloid the global times said on saturday that it was in china s interests to stop north korea s nuclear ambitions but to suggest china cut the country off completely was ridiculous as it would be fraught with danger   once there is chaos in north korea  it would first bring disaster to china  i m sorry  but the united states and south korea don t have the right to demand this of china   it said in an editorial   a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience  tillerson will meet xi on sunday  north korea has conducted two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the beginning of last year  last week  it launched four more ballistic missiles and is working to develop nuclear tipped missiles that can reach the united states  washington has been pressing beijing to do more to stop north korea s nuclear and missile programmes   china has called for a dual track approach  urging north korea to suspend its tests and the united states and south korea to suspend military drills  so both sides can return to talks  china has also been infuriated by the deployment of the  thaad  or terminal high altitude area defense  missile defence system in south korea  which it says will both harm china s own security and do nothing to ease tensions  china says the system s powerful radar will extend into the country s northeast and potentially track chinese missile launches  and maybe even intercept them  russia also opposes thaad  for the same reasons  there are other tricky issues too  including the self ruled island of taiwan which china claims as its own  the trump administration is crafting a big new arms package for taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti ship missiles to defend against china  u s  officials said  a deal sure to anger beijing  wang said saturday s talks included discussions on thaad and taiwan but did not give details
