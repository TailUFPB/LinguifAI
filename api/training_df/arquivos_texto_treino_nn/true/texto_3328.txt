on wednesday  one day before comey is scheduled to testify in person  comey was leading a federal bureau of investigation probe into alleged russian meddling in last year s u s  presidential election when trump fired him last month  comey said he had a total of three face to face meetings with trump and six phone calls with him  following are details of what comey said occurred in some of the conversations  jan   briefing at trump tower in new york  when trump was president elect  at conclusion of a briefing given with other intelligence community officials  comey remained alone with trump to provide a private briefing on material that was  salacious and unverified    comey said he was prepared to tell trump the fbi was not investigating him personally  because the agency did not  have an open counter intelligence case on him     i felt compelled to document my first conversation with the president elect   comey said  saying he began to  type it on a laptop in an fbi vehicle outside trump tower the moment i walked out of the meeting    creating written records immediately after one on one conversations with mr  trump was my practice from that point forward   comey said  jan   dinner at the white house  comey had dinner with trump in the green room at the white house  trump called him earlier in the day to extend the invitation and comey had assumed that other people would be present  but it was just him and the president  trump asked comey if he wanted to remain fbi director  which comey said he  found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped i would stay  and i had assured him i intended to    my instincts told me that the one on one setting  and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position  meant the dinner was  at least in part  an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship   comey said   because the set up made me uneasy  i added that i was not  reliable  in the way politicians use that word  but he could always count on me to tell him the truth   comey said   a few moments later  the president said   i need loyalty  i expect loyalty   i didn t move  speak  or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed   trump returned to the subject of comey s job near the end of the dinner  and said   i need loyalty   comey said he replied   you will always get honesty from me   trump paused and said   that s what i want  honest loyalty   comey said he paused  and said   you will get that from me   although comey said it was possible he and trump  understood the phrase  honest loyalty  differently   feb   oval office meeting comey went to the oval office for a counterterrorism briefing with other officials  including attorney general jeff sessions  at the end of the briefing  trump indicated he wanted to speak to comey alone  and when sessions lingered  trump said he wanted to speak only to comey  once alone  trump began by saying   i want to talk about mike flynn   who had been fired as national security adviser the previous day  trump said of flynn   he is a good guy  i hope you can let this go   comey said he replied only that  he is a good guy   and said that  i did not say i would  let this go    comey discussed the conversation with the fbi leadership team and it was agreed not to report the conversation to the attorney general  but shortly afterward  comey said he spoke in person to sessions to pass along trump s concerns about leaks   i took the opportunity to implore the attorney general to prevent any future direct communication between the president and me  i told the ag that what had just happened   him being asked to leave while the fbi director  who reports to the ag  remained behind   was inappropriate and should never happen  he did not reply   march  phone call trump called comey at the fbi   he described the russia investigation as  a cloud  that was that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country   and asked what could be done to  lift the cloud   trump wanted to know why there had been a congressional hearing about russia the prior week  comey said the fbi had briefed congressional leaders on which individuals it was investigating and said trump was not being personally investigated  comey said he reminded trump that he had previously told him that  trump  he said   repeatedly told me   we need to get that fact out    april  phone call trump called comey and asked what he  had done about his request that i  get out  that he is not personally under investigation  i replied that i had passed his request to the acting deputy attorney general  but i had not heard back   trump again said  the cloud  was interfering with his ability to do his job  at the end of his conversation  trump said    because i have been very loyal to you  very loyal  we had that thing you know    comey reported  adding   i did not reply or ask him what he meant by  that thing    comey said that was his last conversation with trump
