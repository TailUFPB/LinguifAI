washington  reuters    house of representatives speaker paul ryan urged president donald trump on friday not to rescind an obama era program that protects immigrants who entered the united states illegally as children  as more republicans lined up against the move  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will announce on tuesday whether he will end the deferred action for childhood arrivals  or daca  program  which protects nearly   young men and women from deportation  it also makes those covered  so called dreamers  eligible for work permits   we love the  dreamers    the republican president  already facing calls from leading business figures and democrats to preserve the program  told reporters in the oval office  without tipping his hand on the decision  ryan and senator orrin hatch on friday joined a small but growing number of lawmakers from the party that controls congress and the white house to speak out against killing daca  created in  by democratic former president barack obama and long the target of conservative immigration hard liners   i actually don t think he should do that  and i believe that this is something congress has to fix   ryan said in an interview with wclo radio in his hometown of janesville  wisconsin  ryan said he believes obama exceeded his authority in creating daca by executive order  bypassing congress  but there now are  people who are in limbo     these are kids who know no other country  who were brought here by their parents and don t know another home  and so i really do believe that there needs to be a legislative solution  that s one that we re working on  and i think we want to give people peace of mind   ryan added  nancy pelosi  the top house democrat  said she was  heartened  by ryan s comments and asked him to meet with democratic lawmakers next week to discuss a  comprehensive legislative solution   hatch said in a statement rescinding the program would further complicate a u s  immigration system sorely in need of legislative reform   like the president  i ve long advocated for tougher enforcement of our existing immigration laws  but we also need a workable  permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here  and that solution must come from congress   the longest serving republican senator added  tennessee s republican attorney general  herbert slatery  said his office will not participate in a lawsuit challenging daca that is expected to be filed by a group of republican state attorneys general next week  and urged congress to pursue a legislative fix   many of the daca recipients  some of whose records i reviewed  have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions  which if achieved  will be of great benefit and service to our country   slatery wrote in a letter to tennessee s two republican u s  senators  about  dreamers and their supporters turned out on friday for a rally in downtown los angeles to urge national leaders not to end the program    among them was docnary reyes    who came to the united states from guatemala with her parents in  when she was a toddler  before obtaining daca in   reyes had to work under the table cleaning apartments  she said  her work authorization allowed her to obtain a paid internship last year working on a project involving cyanobacteria  the los angeles resident will continue her education at the university of california  davis  to study environmental restoration    i feel like i really care about our environment and not enough people do   reyes said  trump made a crackdown on illegal immigrants a centerpiece of his  election campaign and has stepped up deportations since taking office in january  but business leaders say immigrants make important economic contributions and that ending the program would hit economic growth and tax revenue  leading business figures including facebook inc  fb o  ceo mark zuckerberg have rallied in defense of the program and the dreamers  congress under presidents of both parties has been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform  spokeswoman sanders said trump  who previously has called daca illegal  is not taking the decision lightly    the president s priorities on immigration are to create a system that encourages legal immigration and benefits our economy and american workers   sanders told a news briefing  most of the dreamer immigrants came from mexico and other latin american countries  more than   live in california  while   are in texas  new york  illinois and florida also have large numbers  what to do about dreamers has been actively debated within the white house and trump administration  one senior administration official described the debate as a  tug of war  between factions in favor and against the move  daca supporters argue that the people it protects grew up and were educated in the united states and were integrated into american society  with little connection to the countries in which they are citizens  opponents of the program argue that illegal immigrants take jobs from u s  citizens   there are deep divisions in the united states over the fate of roughly  million illegal immigrants  most of them hispanics  trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them  undoing daca could have political consequences for trump and his fellow republicans  further alienating hispanics  a growing voting bloc in the united states  trump s pardon for an arizona sheriff who critics accused of targeting hispanics  his planned wall along the u s  mexican border and his comments about mexico sending  rapists  and drug dealers into the united states already had antagonized many hispanic americans
