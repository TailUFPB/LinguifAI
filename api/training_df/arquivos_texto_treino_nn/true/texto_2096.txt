washington  reuters    with stephen bannon  the worry always was that he could be even more disruptive to president donald trump s white house from outside than he was within  in the hours following his firing on friday  those fears seemed warranted  as the conservative voices who viewed bannon as one of their own howled in rage over trump s decision to fire his chief strategist  the reaction was most notable from breitbart news  the hard right news site that bannon ran before he joined trump s presidential campaign last year   war   tweeted one of the site s editors  joel pollak  who published a piece questioning whether trump would now move in a more moderate direction with bannon out of the white house    steve bannon personified the trump agenda   pollak wrote  bannon rejoined breitbart as executive chairman only hours after his firing was announced  he is now expected to use it as a platform to blast those within the white house   and perhaps trump himself   when they don t hew to the fiercely nationalist policies bannon advocated as an inside adviser  as trump s chief strategist  bannon fought numerous battles with senior trump aides and top republicans in congress over the administration s policy agenda  breitbart frequently backed him up  ripping establishment republicans such as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and speaker of the house of representatives paul ryan  blaming them for obstructing trump s agenda  more recently  the site trained its fire on trump s national security adviser  h r  mcmaster  after he removed officials who espoused bannon s foreign policy world view  in recent days  bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars  is a worldwide leader in the populist nationalist movement that propelled trump to power  and could go back to breitbart  which he refers to as a  killing machine   or perhaps other endeavors financed by the family of hedge fund tycoon robert mercer  his longtime ally   steve has a powerful voice  and he s going to keep that voice up   said sam nunberg  a former trump campaign adviser and bannon friend   he s going to continue to promote policies that got donald trump in the white house   bannon had clashed with the likes of gary cohn  the director of the national economic council  and jared kushner  a trump adviser and the president s son in law  both of whom favored more business friendly  mainstream economic policies on trade  taxes  and other matters  while bannon s ouster may mean a short term win for the relative moderates in the west wing  those he dubbed the  globalists   it does not mean that policy battles on national security  immigration and the economy will dissipate  trump has a shown a proclivity for seeking counsel from former advisers such as corey lewandowski and newt gingrich and from conservative pundits such as sean hannity  the outspoken and provocative bannon could join their number  and there remain other white house officials sympathetic to bannon s world view  such as domestic policy adviser stephen miller  even so  bannon s absence will be felt   trump is always going to be trump on immigration  trade  and foreign policy  but steve was the highest ranking adviser who shared trump s world view  with him gone  there s not a replacement for that voice in internal debates   one administration official said   i think people have always overestimated how influential anyone can be on trump  but without steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so called  globalists   it s easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles   mike cernovich  an alt right activist and personality  suggested to his more than   followers on twitter that bannon was sacked to ensure that the white house raises troop levels in afghanistan  which bannon opposed   this is a full on coup now  guys   cernovich said in a posted video  beyond breitbart and the alt right  some more traditional conservative groups were also concerned about the implications of bannon s departure  twenty republican grassroots leaders  including longtime activists richard viguerie  jenny beth martin  and ginni thomas  wrote to trump earlier in the week urging him to keep bannon on   we will miss steve bannon in the white house because he helped president trump keep many of the promises he made on the campaign trail   martin  co founder of tea party patriots  said in a statement after bannon s ouster  but she also reiterated her support for the president  saying  he is his own man   if bannon has anything to do with it  he will push to make sure that trump stays that way   but some supporters still worried that the radical agenda  bannon fought for could be at risk   it s a sad day for the movement   nunberg said   i think it will end up being a mistake    corrects spelling of name in paragraph  to viguerie
