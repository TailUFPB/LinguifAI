washington  reuters    the u s  congress is struggling through another contentious week as infighting over defense spending  healthcare and other matters complicates the drive to pass a temporary spending bill by midnight on friday to avert a partial government shutdown  in a week when president donald trump and his fellow republicans in congress are hoping to celebrate the passage of tax overhaul legislation  many in the party showed little appetite for a government shutdown at week s end  but they sounded resigned to having to navigate through some drama over a package that includes so many disparate components  which could make for a messy process   i m going to vote for whatever i need to  to keep the government open   republican representative chris collins told reporters  the last time government agencies had to shut down because washington could not pay its bills was in october   leading republicans in the senate and house of representatives expressed optimism that a funding bill  coupled with a large new disaster aid package  would pass by friday s deadline  but some were predicting that lawmakers would bump right up against the cutoff  the house could vote as soon as wednesday on legislation that extends most funding for domestic programs through jan    democrats are likely to mainly oppose the bill  arguing that their priorities are being ignored  conservative republicans are insisting on higher military funding through the rest of the fiscal year ending on sept   as part of the house bill  democrats in the senate are expected to block that formula if  as expected  it does not also have more money for non defense programs  the house measure would also include   billion in disaster funding to help puerto rico  the u s  virgin islands and several u s  states recover from hurricanes  wildfires and other natural disasters  that price tag has made some republicans uneasy  some republicans are also worried about a senate strategy to add a bipartisan healthcare proposal to the government funding bill  in keeping with a promise senate majority leader mitch mcconnell made in order to coax republican senator susan collins to vote for the tax legislation  conservative house republicans do not like the bipartisan healthcare proposal because it would fund subsidies for low income participants in the obamacare health insurance program  and does not include language that restricts federal funds for abortion  mcconnell s promise to collins  means squat over here   said representative mark walker  chairman of the republican study committee  the largest group of conservatives in the house  some conservatives may vote against the funding bill in protest  he told reporters outside the house  the house bill also would extend the children s health insurance program for five years  if democrats continue to withhold their support for the stopgap spending bill and some republicans peel off  congress could find itself struggling to pass a bill as the clock ticks toward midnight on friday
