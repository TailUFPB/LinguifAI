washington  reuters    sean spicer burst onto the public stage six months ago with a scolding rant against reporters  accusing them of lowballing the size of president donald trump s inauguration day crowd   following a turbulent half year run as white house press secretary  spicer is leaving the building with a final burst of drama after rejecting what amounted to a downsizing of his role  until he got swept up in trump s orbit  spicer had been a party functionary for the republican national committee  well known and respected among washington political operatives and reporters but with no national profile  as trump s frontman at televised white house news briefings  however  the  year old achieved a certain fame for defending the president at all costs through a variety of crises that have beset trump s young presidency  he became instantly recognizable around the country and an inspiration for social media memes  his live televised briefings drew big audiences for cable tv  spicer was lampooned on nbc s  saturday night live   with melissa mccarthy playing the combative  spicey  character  swallowing gum and driving a motorized lectern into actors playing reporters who asked hard questions   asked what he thought of the show  spicer told fox news in an interview on friday   i think that there were parts of it that were funny  but there s a lot of it that was over the line  it wasn t funny  it was stupid  or silly  or malicious   over time  however  trump felt he was not being defended strongly enough by his communications team and that there were not enough people advocating for him on tv  according to a republican close to the white house  in a crushing snub  spicer  a devout roman catholic  was kept off the list of white house officials who met pope francis when trump visited the vatican in may   with trump eager to make changes in his communications team  the president began courting anthony scaramucci  a new york financial whiz who has been an eloquent defender of trump in tv interviews  scaramucci is a prominent republican fundraiser who advised trump during his presidential campaign last year after working first on rival scott walker s campaign until it fizzled  trump met scaramucci on thursday and talked about making him communications director  and planned a formal job interview and offer on friday   spicer was dubious when told he would continue in the duties of press secretary and communications director with scaramucci  who is not experienced in the ways of washington  taking over the ceremonial title  a source close to the white house press operation said   this is a joke   the source said   trump wanted scaramucci on television as a surrogate for the white house and wanted to give him more of a formal title  there was simply no understanding by the president that the communications director title comes with lots of responsibilities  not just going on television   when trump went ahead with the hire on friday and asked spicer to stay on  spicer had had enough  telling the president he was resigning  the source said  after the announcement was made to the white house communications staff at midmorning  white house chief of staff reince priebus huddled with spicer and scaramucci privately  spicer told fox news the president did not want him to go and had been  very gracious throughout this process     i just thought it was in the best interest of our communications department  of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen   he said  trump tweeted late on friday   sean spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the fake news media   but his future is bright        spicer  spotted around the white house complex  was described by colleagues as in a good mood and feeling he had made the right decision
