  this march  story was corrected to note prieto says wisniewski  not prieto  was acting for political reasons in paragraph   by joseph ax new york  reuters    a day after two former allies of new jersey governor chris christie were sentenced to prison in the  bridgegate  scandal  a state lawmaker who helped uncover the scheme to cause massive traffic jams over a political slight wants to keep pushing for answers to the two biggest unanswered questions  what did the governor know about the lane closures at the george washington bridge  and when did he know it  to learn the truth  the legislature s bridgegate probe should be resumed  with christie subpoenaed and required to testify  said democratic assemblyman john wisniewski  who co chaired a special committee that unearthed the damning emails and texts revealing the plot  he also is campaigning to replace christie as governor  but fellow democratic leaders in the state legislature offered a lukewarm response  saying it was not clear what further investigation would accomplish  bridget kelly  christie s former deputy chief of staff  was  sentenced on wednesday to    years in prison  bill baroni  former deputy executive director of the port authority of new york and new jersey  got a prison sentence of two years  along with david wildstein  another former port authority executive who pleaded guilty  they are the only officials charged in connection with the shutdown of access lanes at the bridge in fort lee  new jersey  in september   the resulting traffic nightmare was intended to punish the town s democratic mayor  mark sokolich  for declining to endorse christie s re election campaign  christie has denied any involvement  but the fallout damaged his unsuccessful  presidential campaign and saddled him with historically low approval ratings at home  a spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on thursday  at trial  numerous witnesses  including close christie advisers  testified that the governor and his inner circle were aware of the lane closures much earlier than they admitted publicly  following her sentencing  kelly said she refused to be a  scapegoat  and vowed to fight her conviction  the criminal case might never have existed had it not been for the legislative committee  which used its subpoena power to secure communications between kelly  baroni and wildstein  those documents included the now infamous email from kelly to wildstein saying   time for some traffic problems in fort lee    we need to follow the facts wherever they go   wisniewski said in a phone interview  he noted that christie previously invoked executive privilege to avoid turning over texts and emails in what he called a  nixonian  move  but the assembly speaker  democrat vincent prieto  said in a statement it was  unlikely after the federal trial that additional hearings or subpoenas will provide new information   prieto  whose approval would be needed to set up a new committee  also criticized wisniewski for sending out a campaign statement calling for a renewed investigation  saying wisniewski was using the issue for political reasons   christie cannot run for another term this year due to term limits  wisniewski  however  said leaving the investigation half finished would allow such abuses to occur again  state sen  loretta weinberg  a longtime christie foe who co chaired the investigative committee  said she had  mixed feelings  about further action   i m not sure what our goal would be   weinberg  a democrat  said in a phone interview  she said it was not clear whether the legislature could force christie to testify under oath or gain access to his communications  christie s status as a lame duck governor is another factor weighing against a renewed probe  as is the potential cost to taxpayers  weinberg said  the target of the scheme  sokolich  the fort lee mayor  said it was obvious the plot extended beyond the three charged defendants   there were many others who were half a text or one email conversation away from getting indicted   he said  adding that christie has already been found guilty in the court of public opinion   i guess we ll never know for sure   sokolich said   welcome to jersey politics
