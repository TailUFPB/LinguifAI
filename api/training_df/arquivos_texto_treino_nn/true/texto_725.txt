beijing  reuters    if chinese president xi jinping was trying to impress u s  president donald trump with lavish treatment during his visit to beijing  it appears to have worked  trump was effusive in his praise of xi and china  even speaking admiringly of beijing s ability to run up a huge trade surplus at u s  expense  which trump blamed on his predecessors  he described as  tremendous  his meetings with xi on topics including trade  north korea and controlling opioids  despite the lack of major breakthroughs on easing access to china for u s  companies or further pressuring north korea to halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons   my feeling toward you is an incredibly warm one   trump said  standing beside xi  the two had spent the previous afternoon and evening with their wives  touring the forbidden city and dining there  a privilege rarely extended to visiting leaders   as we said  there s great chemistry  and i think we re going to do tremendous things  both for china and the united states   trump said  that chemistry took shape in april  when the two first met at trump s mar a lago resort  softening the edges on sharp differences over trade and north korea  and concern in the west over an increasingly prosperous china s growing assertiveness  while trump enjoys a chummy  golfing buddy relationship with japanese prime minister shinzo abe  he has shown admiration for autocratic leaders such as xi  russian president vladimir putin and philippines president rodrigo duterte  stylistically  the leaders of the world s two largest economies are opposites  xi is scripted and cautious  cultivating a down to earth image  trump  a developer and reality tv star before his upset election win a year ago  is known for his off the cuff style  freewheeling tweets  and rhetorical hyperbole  both negative and positive  the two also face different political realities at home  xi has never been more powerful  solidifying his grip at a twice a decade communist party congress last month  trump is saddled with low public approval ratings and dogged by investigations into russian links to his election campaign  though he and his aides claim credit for the u s  stock market s record highs  but trump appears to recognize the clout that china   and by extension  xi   wields as a rising power  recently likening xi to a  king    and is convinced he needs beijing s leverage with north korea to deal with his biggest global security challenge  the transactional currying of favor cuts both ways  china is eager to deflect u s  pressure to do more on north korea  and to avoid an escalation in trade tensions that seemed inevitable after trump  during his presidential campaign  accused china of  raping  the united states with its trade practices   china attaches great importance to guanxi  personal relationships  and it s especially important  given you have a top down approach to leadership in china  to see xi get on so well with a foreign leader   said wang huiyao  head of the center for china and globalization  a think tank   it s much easier to tackle structural problems with a good atmosphere   he said  some of their more personal exchanges won prominent play in chinese social media  including the video of trump s granddaughter singing to  grandpa xi  and  grandma peng   an exchange between the two leaders in the forbidden city when xi explained to trump that china has the longest unbroken cultural history of any current nation was especially popular   we are called the descendants of dragons   xi tells trump   that s great   trump replies and laughs  trump went so far as to call xi a  very special man  in a joint briefing on thursday  and seemed so enthusiastic that secretary of state rex tillerson was asked if trump had been too deferential   i didn t detect that at all   tillerson said  however  the white house yielded to beijing s wish that the two leaders not take questions during a joint press statement  xi did not openly reciprocate trump s personal praise  maintaining his usual stern demeanor  although he grinned when trump said he did not blame china for the trade gap and again when he said xi was someone who got things done   i don t blame china   trump said of the trade deficit    who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for benefit of their citizens  i give china great credit
