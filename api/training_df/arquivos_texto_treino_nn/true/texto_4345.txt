washington  reuters    the republican led senate on friday gave donald trump the biggest triumph of his young presidency  confirming his supreme court nominee over stout democratic opposition and restoring a conservative majority on the highest u s  judicial body  the senate  which last year refused to consider democratic former president barack obama s nominee to the court  voted   to approve republican trump s pick  colorado based federal appeals court judge neil gorsuch  to the lifetime job  three democrats joined the republicans in voting for gorsuch  gorsuch s confirmation ends the longest supreme court vacancy since  during the american civil war  with the court down a justice for almost  months since long serving conservative justice antonin scalia died on feb       judge gorsuch s confirmation process was one of the most transparent and accessible in history  and his judicial temperament  exceptional intellect  unparalleled integrity and record of independence makes him the perfect choice to serve on the nation s highest court   trump said in a statement   he s going to make an incredible addition to the court   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on the senate floor  illustrating the importance of the moment  vice president mike pence served as the senate s presiding officer during the vote to confirm gorsuch  who also worked in republican former president george w  bush s justice department and is the son of the first woman to head the environmental protection agency  republicans  possessing a   senate majority  on thursday overcame a ferocious democratic effort to block a confirmation vote  resorting to a rule change known as the  nuclear option    today  for the first time in history  the theft of a supreme court seat has been completed  profoundly damaging the integrity of the court   said democratic senator jeff merkley  referring to republicans casting aside obama s nominee merrick garland  who would have tilted the court to the left for the first time in decades  merkley this week delivered a    hour senate speech against gorsuch  the senate s approval of gorsuch reinstates the nine seat court s   conservative majority  fulfilling an important trump campaign promise  gorsuch    was the youngest supreme court nominee since republican president george h w  bush in  picked clarence thomas  who was  at the time  gorsuch could be expected to serve for decades  while trump could make further appointments to the high court to make it even more solidly conservative because three of the eight justices are  or older  three democratic senators up for re election in  in states won by trump last year   indiana s joe donnelly  west virginia s joe manchin and north dakota s heidi heitkamp   voted for gorsuch  republican senator johnny isakson missed the vote while recovering from back surgery  gorsuch s confirmation gave a boost to trump  showing he can get important agenda items through a congress controlled by his fellow republicans after the house of representatives last month failed to pass healthcare overhaul legislation  trump is planning major tax cut legislation as well  senate republicans resorted to extraordinary steps to overcome democratic opposition to gorsuch  including changing long standing senate rules to prohibit the use of a procedural blockade called a filibuster for supreme court nominees  the rule change was dubbed the  nuclear option  because it was considered an extreme break from senate tradition  democrats accused gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream  favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions  and displaying insufficient independence from trump  gorsuch joins fellow conservatives thomas  john roberts  samuel alito and anthony kennedy on a court that also includes liberal justices ruth bader ginsburg  stephen breyer  sonia sotomayor and elena kagan  trump has recorded accomplishments since taking office on jan    including a variety of unilateral executive actions such as moving to undo obama s climate change regulations  but he has encountered trouble with other major initiatives  courts blocked his executive action to stop people from several muslim majority countries from entering the united states  his administration also has faced questions about any role the president s associates may have played in alleged russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election to help trump  the rule change could make it easier for trump to win confirmation of supreme court nominees as long as republicans control the senate  with democrats left powerless to resist even if he gets a chance to replace the court s senior liberal   year old ginsburg  or the court s swing vote   year old kennedy  with more conservative replacements  a conservative majority court is more likely to support gun rights  abortion regulations  an expansive view of religious liberty and republican backed voting restrictions  while opposing curbs on political spending  the court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years  among the groups congratulating gorsuch on his confirmation were the u s  chamber of commerce business lobbying group  the national rifle association gun rights group and anti abortion activists  gorsuch will be sworn in on monday in two different ceremonies  one at the court and one at the white house  he can then prepare for the court s next round of oral arguments  starting on april   the court s current term ends in june  gorsuch will participate in the justices  private april  conference to consider taking new cases  there are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms
