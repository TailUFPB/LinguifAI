washington  reuters    a group of about a dozen u s  state department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing secretary of state rex tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers  according to internal documents reviewed by reuters  a confidential state department  dissent  memo  which reuters was first to report on  said tillerson breached the child soldiers prevention act when he decided in june to exclude iraq  myanmar  and afghanistan from a u s  list of offenders in the use of child soldiers  this was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries   keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with u s  military assistance  iraq and afghanistan are close allies in the fight against islamist militants  while myanmar is an emerging ally to offset china s influence in southeast asia  documents reviewed by reuters also show tillerson s decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the state department s regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the middle east and asia  the u s  envoy on afghanistan and pakistan  the department s human rights office and its own in house lawyers       beyond contravening u s  law  this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of state department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the u s  government s primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world   said the july  memo  state department spokeswoman heather nauert  questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing  strongly defended tillerson s decision as valid and in  technical compliance with the law in the way he read it    no one in the united states government likes the idea of the use of child soldiers   she said   it s abhorrent  asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting peruvian foreign minister about his decision  tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials  complaint   reuters reported in june that tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on iraq  myanmar and afghanistan  the new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the state department  including the rare use of what is known as the   dissent channel   which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals  the views expressed by the u s  officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of exxon mobil corp appointed by president donald trump to pursue  an  america first  approach to diplomacy       the child soldiers law passed in  states that the u s  government must be satisfied that no children under the age of   are recruited  conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  for a country to be removed from the list  the statute extends specifically to government militaries and government supported armed groups like militias  the list currently includes the democratic republic of congo  nigeria  somalia  south sudan  mali  sudan  syria and yemen      in a written response to the dissent memo on sept    tillerson adviser brian hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers  he said  however  it was necessary to distinguish between governments  making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations     and those which are making sincere   if as yet incomplete   efforts   hook made clear that america s top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law  foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid  training and weapons from washington unless the white house issues a waiver based on u s   national interest   in   under the obama administration  both iraq and myanmar  as well as others such as nigeria and somalia  received waivers     at times  the human rights community chided president barack obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions  especially for governments that had security ties with washington  instead of sanctioning more of those countries   human rights watch frequently criticized president barack obama for giving too many countries waivers  but the law has made a real difference   jo becker  advocacy director for the group s children s rights division  wrote in june in a critique of tillerson s decision  the dissenting u s  officials stressed that tillerson s decision to exclude iraq  afghanistan and myanmar went a step further than the obama administration s waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers      the officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by reuters that those three countries had made progress  but in their reading of the law  they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers  ben cardin  ranking democrat on the u s  senate foreign relations committee  wrote to tillerson on friday saying there were  serious concerns that the state department may not be complying  with the law and that the secretary s decision  sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions   the memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the senate foreign relations committee and the state department s independent inspector general s office that relate to allegations that tillerson violated the child soldiers law  legal scholars say that because of the executive branch s latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter tillerson s decision     herman schwartz  a constitutional law professor at american university in washington  said u s  courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to tillerson s interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion     the signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues  said an official familiar with the matter  reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it     tillerson s decision to remove iraq and myanmar  formerly known as burma  from the list and reject a recommendation by u s  officials to add afghanistan was announced in the release of the government s annual human trafficking report on june       six days earlier  a previously unreported memo emailed to tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by u s  officials in  and recommended that he approve them for the new list      it noted that in iraq  the united nations and non governmental organizations  reported that some sunni tribal forces     recruited and used persons younger than the age of   including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities       ali kareem  who heads iraq s high committee for human rights  denied the country s military or state backed militias use child soldiers   we can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues   he said       the memo also said  two confirmed cases of child recruitment  by the myanmar military  were documented during the reporting period   human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there      myanmar government spokesman zaw htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used  he noted that in the latest state department report on human trafficking   they already recognized  myanmar  for reducing of child soldiers    though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted      the memo said further there was  credible evidence  that a government supported militia in afghanistan  recruited and used a child   meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the state department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list      the afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in afghan national security forces  an assertion that contradicts the state department s reports and human rights activists
