washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans said tuesday they will seek to bring their healthcare overhaul to the senate floor next week after a lengthy intraparty struggle  but it remained unclear whether they had the votes to pass the measure or even what form it would finally take   with his reputation as a master strategist on the line  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell laid out a timetable for senate consideration of legislation to fulfill president donald trump s campaign promise to dismantle the  affordable care act  also known as obamacare  in a departure from republican orthodoxy on tax cutting  the legislation likely will retain some of the taxes that were imposed on the wealthy under obamacare  senate sources said  but it was unknown whether a revised version of the bill to be announced on thursday morning can satisfy both moderates and hard line conservatives in the republican majority who voiced opposition to a draft unveiled last month on very different grounds  with trump urging the senate to act before taking the august break  mcconnell pushed back the senate s planned august recess by two weeks to allow senators more time to tackle the measure that would repeal key parts of obamacare  as well as pursue other legislative priorities  mcconnell s announcement drove a turn around in stock prices in afternoon trading on wall street after an earlier sell off  on hopes that a shortened recess could mean progress on the stalled republican legislative agenda   a dark mood lingered among some republicans over the healthcare subject  with party leaders appearing to act because of the need to dispense with healthcare and turn to other issues  among them increasing the u s  debt ceiling   i think we ve narrowed down now to where we know where the decision points are  and we just have to make those decisions   senator john thune  a junior member of the republican leadership  told reporters  leaders were still trying to  figure out how we get to   votes  he said  republicans  who hold  seats in the  seat senate  would need  votes to pass the bill  with vice president mike pence providing the tie breaking vote   i am very pessimistic  about the prospects for republican healthcare legislation  chuck grassley  a senior senator  told fox news on tuesday  another republican senator  lindsey graham  was working on his own healthcare proposal and will unveil it this week  a graham aide said  mcconnell said the plan was to vote on the healthcare bill next week  and said he hoped to have a fresh analysis of the bill from the nonpartisan congressional budget office at the start of the week  he did not reveal any of the planned changes to the draft  on which he postponed action last month after it failed to gather enough support  but senate sources said it is likely that two obamacare taxes on the wealthy will be kept in place   a   percent net investment tax and a   percent payroll tax that helps finance medicare   which would appeal to moderates who have balked at the prospect of cutting taxes for the wealthy while reducing benefits for the poor   obviously that s the direction i think that a lot of our members want to move  is to keep some of those  taxes  in place and be able to use those revenues to put it into other places in the bill   thune said  while stressing that no decisions were final  republicans could also retain obamacare s limit on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry  one senate source said  it was unclear whether the bill would include a proposal by conservative republican ted cruz that would allow insurers to offer basic low cost healthcare plans that do not comply with obamacare regulations  cruz argues it would help to lower premiums  but critics say it would allow insurers to offer skimpier plans that may not cover essential health benefits while also charging more for more comprehensive  obamacare compliant plans  the senate republican healthcare bill unveiled last month would phase out the obamacare expansion of medicaid health insurance for the poor and disabled  sharply cut federal medicaid spending beginning in   repeal many of obamacare s taxes  end a penalty on individuals who do not obtain insurance and overhaul obamacare s subsidies to help people buy insurance with tax credits  democrats are united in opposition to the bill and at least  republicans have said they oppose the existing draft  the house of representatives passed its own version in may  moderate republicans are uneasy about the millions of people forecast to lose their medical insurance under the draft legislation  and hard line conservatives say it leaves too much of obamacare intact  democrats call the republican legislation a giveaway to the rich that would hurt the most vulnerable americans
