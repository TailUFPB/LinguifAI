and french president emmanuel macron  the nations that remain in the paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created   i believe the united states of america

cities  and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got     former u s  president barack obama  who was in office when the

variation on trump s  make america great again  slogan  that deal imposes little responsibility on the world s largest emitters  while costing the u s  economy   trillion in reduced output   million

   u s  treasury secretary steve mnuchin in a fox news interview  removing the united states from the paris agreement is a reckless and indefensible action  it undermines america s standing in the
