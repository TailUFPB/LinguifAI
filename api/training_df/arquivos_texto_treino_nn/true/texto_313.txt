 frankfurt washington  reuters    a u s  federal investigator probing alleged russian interference in the  u s  presidential election asked deutsche bank  dbkgn de  for data on accounts held by president donald trump and his family  a person close to the matter said on tuesday  but trump s lawyer denied any such subpoena had been issued  germany s largest bank received a subpoena from special counsel robert mueller several weeks ago to provide information on certain money and credit transactions  the person said  without giving details  adding that key documents had been handed over in the meantime  deutsche bank has lent the trump organization hundreds of millions of dollars for real estate ventures and is one of the few major lenders that has given large amounts of credit to trump in the past decade  a string of bankruptcies at his hotel and casino businesses during the  made most of wall street wary of extending him credit  mueller is investigating alleged russian attempts to influence the election  and potential collusion by trump aides  russia has denied u s  intelligence agencies  conclusion that it meddled in the election and trump has said there was no collusion with moscow  jay sekulow  one of trump s personal lawyers  said deutsche bank has not received any subpoena for financial records relating to the president as part of mueller s probe   we have confirmed that the news reports that the special counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false   sekulow told reuters in a statement   no subpoena has been issued or received  we have confirmed this with the bank and other sources   he later said the bank in question was deutsche bank  a spokesman for mueller declined to comment  a deutsche bank spokesman in new york had no immediate comment beyond the statement the bank issued earlier on tuesday which said the bank takes  its legal obligations seriously and remains committed to cooperating with authorized investigations into this matter   a u s  official with knowledge of mueller s probe said one reason for the subpoenas was to find out whether deutsche bank may have sold some of trump s mortgage or other loans to russian state development bank veb or other russian banks that now are under u s  and european union sanctions  veb  as well as the russian agricultural bank and gazprombank gzpri mm did not immediately reply to emailed requests for comment   no one from the vtb group  vtbr mm  representatives has received a subpoena because there are absolutely no grounds for it   a bank representative said in response to a request from reuters   deutsche bank did not contact us regarding people connected with the trump administration    we would not comment on the existence of any such request  had one been received   responded a representative of sberbank  sber mm   holding trump debt  particularly if some of it was or is coming due  could potentially give russian banks some leverage over trump  especially if they are state owned  said a second u s  official familiar with russian intelligence methods   one obvious question is why trump and those around him expressed interest in improving relations with russia as a top foreign policy priority  and whether or not any personal considerations played any part in that   the second official said  speaking on the condition of anonymity  a source close to deutsche bank said the bank had run checks on trump s financial dealings with russia  during his election campaign  trump said he would seek to improve ties with russian president vladimir putin  which were strained during president barack obama s administration  the subpoena was earlier reported by german daily handelsblatt  during a photo opportunity with senators at the white house on tuesday  trump declined to answer shouted questions from reporters about whether mueller had crossed a line by asking deutsche bank for information  in a july  interview with the new york times  trump said mueller should not extend his investigation into trump s finances if they were not directly related to the russia accusations  asked if delving into his and his family s finances unrelated to the russia probe would cross a red line  trump replied   i would say yeah  i would say yes   deutsche bank earlier this year rebuffed efforts by democratic u s  lawmakers to get more information on its dealings with trump as well as any information it may have about whether the republican  his family or advisers had financial backing from russia  trump had liabilities of at least   million to deutsche bank trust company americas  a unit of the german bank  according to a federal financial disclosure form released in june by the u s  office of government ethics  the deutsche debts include a loan exceeding   million for the old post office  a historic property he redeveloped in downtown washington  mortgages worth more than   million on a golf course in florida  and a   million plus loan on a trump hotel and condominium in chicago  the disclosure shows  all of those loans were taken out in  and will mature in  and   according to the disclosure  trump and deutsche bank have not always been on good terms  trump sued the bank and other lenders in   demanding   billion in damages  claiming they broke agreements in the construction and financing of a chicago hotel  deutsche bank countersued and the two sides eventually settled  internal deutsche bank documents seen by reuters feature the names of trump s former campaign manager paul manafort and his wife  kathleen  in a series of client profiles  but it was not immediately clear what their relationship with the bank is or had been  according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity  manafort and his wife do not have deutsche bank accounts  the bank declined to comment on whether manafort is or has ever been a client  a spokesman for manafort declined to comment  in october  manafort pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy against the united states  the charges were brought as part of mueller s investigation
