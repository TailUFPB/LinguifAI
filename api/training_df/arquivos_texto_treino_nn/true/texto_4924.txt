detroit washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday ordered a review of tough u s  vehicle fuel efficiency standards put in place by the obama administration  handing a victory to auto industry executives and provoking criticism from democrats and environmental groups  in a move widely seen as a preamble to loosening fuel standards  trump told an audience of cheering union workers  he would  ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs  your factories   and promised he would encourage growth in the u s  auto sector    the assault on the american auto industry is over   trump said  standing in front of a banner that read  buy american hire american   trump added that the white house is  setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines american auto production   the backdrop and message underscored trump s efforts to lock down support in industrial states such as michigan that put him in the white house  trump spoke at the site of the former willow run bomber factory in ypsilanti  michigan  which won fame for building an operational b  heavy bomber every  minutes during world war two  now  the site is being redeveloped as a testing ground for autonomous vehicles   at a roundtable with industry leaders trump made clear he expected automakers to hire more americans in return  a theme that dominated his election campaign   we re going to do some wonderful work with you  but you re going to have to help us with jobs   he said  trump s event was attended by around   people  including automotive executives  united auto workers union president dennis williams   who sat next to trump   and workers from detroit s  big three  automakers  general motors co  gm n   ford motor co  f n  and fiat chrysler automobiles nv  fca   fcha mi   fcau n   automakers lined up examples of vehicles they build in the united states for the president to see  auto industry executives have said they are hopeful the trump administration will pursue tax and regulatory policies that would benefit u s  manufacturers   reopening the fuel efficiency rules put in place by democratic president barack obama days before he left office is one of the top items on the industry s agenda  automakers  through their lobbying groups  have said the obama rules were too expensive and could cost american jobs   these standards are costly for automakers and the american people   said environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt  after one participant in wednesday s meetings mentioned environmental concerns  trump said he agreed but did not want an  extra thimbleful of fuel  to get in the way of growth  in a meeting with top auto executives from u s  and foreign automakers  trump said the government needs to get out of the way of the auto industry building vehicles  a person who attended the meeting said  automakers are wary of being seen as out of touch with environmental concerns  or unwilling to invest in new technology  ford  for example  used its twitter account on wednesday to highlight previously announced commitments to develop electric vehicles  it could take a year for the review process to play out  and wednesday s event was effectively a starting gun for intense lobbying efforts over how government policy will drive technology investment decisions in the auto sector   critics like democratic u s  senator edward markey of massachusetts said trump s move could hurt consumers   filling up their cars and trucks is the energy bill americans pay most often  but president trump s roll back of fuel economy emissions standards means families will end up paying more at the pump   markey added   the president is not seeking to revoke california s authority to set vehicle efficiency rules even stricter than federal rules  including mandated sales of electric vehicles  as part of this move  a white house official said  the official did not rule out seeking to withdraw california s authority in the future  pruitt  an ally of the fossil fuel industry  would not commit during his senate confirmation hearing to allowing california to continue its own clean vehicle rules  a group of  state attorneys general led by california and new york said on wednesday they would fight attempts to weaken the rules  california s attorney general late tuesday filed legal papers in a federal court defending the obama administration s decision to finalize the determination in january  barclays auto analyst brian johnson said in a research note that he expects the trump administration review will lead to reductions in planned hikes in fuel efficiency standards after   the obama administration s rules  negotiated with automakers in   were aimed at doubling average fleetwide fuel efficiency to   miles per gallon by   although the real world mileage figures would be lower   automotive industry executives and lobbying groups were quick to praise the administration s announcement   the trump administration has created an opportunity for decision makers to reach a thoughtful and coordinated outcome predicated on the best and most current data   said mitch bainwol  chief executive of the alliance of automobile manufacturers  an industry lobbying group  automakers have signaled they want the government to give manufacturers more credit toward achieving fuel efficiency targets for technologies such as  stop start  systems that shut down a car s engine at a traffic light   regulators should also look at whether ride hailing and vehicle to vehicle communications systems designed to prevent accidents and alleviate road congestion could be counted toward the industry s greenhouse gas emissions goals  the automaker group proposed in comments to the epa last year  the group represents a dozen automakers  including gm  ford and fca   under the  agreement with the industry  the epa was given until april  to decide whether the standards were feasible under a  midterm review   but the agency moved up its decision to a week before obama left office in a bid to maintain a key part of his administration s environmental legacy  an epa analysis indicated that compared with previous rules  the  standards would result in savings of between    and    over the lifetime of a vehicle and payback for new technology required to meet the new standards of around five years  the obama administration said the rules would cost the auto industry   billion over  years  but save motorists    trillion over the life of the vehicles
