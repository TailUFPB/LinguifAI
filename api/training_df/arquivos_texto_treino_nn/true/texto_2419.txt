washington moscow  reuters    u s  president donald trump will sign legislation that imposes sanctions on russia  the white house said on friday  after moscow ordered the united states to cut hundreds of diplomatic staff and said it would seize two u s  diplomatic properties in retaliation for the bill  the u s  senate had voted almost unanimously on thursday to slap new sanctions on russia  forcing trump to choose between a tough position on moscow and effectively dashing his stated hopes for warmer ties with the country or to veto the bill amid investigations in possible collusion between his campaign and russia  by signing the bill into law  trump can not ease the sanctions against russia unless he seeks congressional approval  moscow s retaliation  announced by the foreign ministry on friday  had echoes of the cold war  if confirmed that russia s move would affect hundreds of staff at the u s  embassy  it would far outweigh the obama administration s expulsion of  russians in december  the legislation was in part a response to conclusions by u s  intelligence agencies that russia meddled in the  u s  presidential election  and to further punish russia for its annexation of crimea in   late on friday  the white house issued a statement saying trump would sign the bill after reviewing the final version  the statement made no reference to russia s retaliatory measures  russia had been threatening retaliation for weeks  its response suggests it has set aside initial hopes of better ties with washington under trump  something the u s  leader  before he was elected  had said he wanted to achieve   relations were already languishing at a post cold war low because of the allegations that russian cyber interference in the election was intended to boost trump s chances  something moscow flatly denies  trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and russian officials     the russian foreign ministry complained of growing anti russian feeling in the united states  accusing  well known circles  of seeking  open confrontation   president vladimir putin had warned on thursday that russia would have to retaliate against what he called boorish u s  behavior  putin s spokesman  dmitry peskov  told reporters on friday that the senate vote was the last straw  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told u s  secretary of state rex tillerson by telephone that russia was ready to normalize relations with the united states and to cooperate on major global issues  lavrov and tillerson  agreed to maintain contact on a range of bilateral issues   the russian foreign ministry said  the ministry said the united states had until sept   to reduce its diplomatic staff in russia to  people  the number of russian diplomats left in the united states after washington expelled  russians in december  it was not immediately clear how many u s  diplomats and other workers would be forced to leave either the country or their posts  but the interfax news agency cited an informed source as saying  hundreds  of people would be affected  a diplomatic source told reuters that it would be for the united states to decide which posts to cut  whether occupied by u s  or russian nationals   an official at the u s  embassy  who declined to be named because they were not allowed to speak to the media  said the embassy employed around   diplomatic and support staff in russia  including russian and u s  citizens  russian state television channel rossiya  said over  staff would be affected but that was not confirmed by the foreign ministry or the u s  embassy  the russian foreign ministry s statement said the passage of the bill confirmed  the extreme aggression of the united states in international affairs   deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov met outgoing u s  ambassador john tefft on friday to inform him of the counter measures  russian news agencies reported  the u s  embassy said tefft had expressed his  strong disappointment and protest   most u s  diplomatic staff  including around  u s  citizens  work in the main embassy in moscow  with others based in consulates in st petersburg  yekaterinburg and vladivostok  the russian foreign ministry said it was also seizing a moscow dacha compound used by u s  diplomats for recreation  from aug    as well as a u s  diplomatic warehouse in moscow   in december  the outgoing obama administration seized two russian diplomatic compounds   one in new york and another in maryland   at the same time as it expelled russian diplomats  trump and putin met for the first time at a  summit in germany this month in what both sides described as a productive encounter  but russian officials have become increasingly convinced that congress and trump s political opponents will not allow him to mend ties  even if he wants to  the european union has also threatened to retaliate against new u s  sanctions on russia  saying they would harm the bloc s energy security by targeting projects including a planned new pipeline to bring russian natural gas to northern europe      a european commission spokesman in brussels said the bloc would be following the sanctions process
