washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson has authorized the state department to notify congress of the trump administration s sale of precision guided munitions for saudi arabia to use in its yemen campaign  a senior u s  diplomat said on tuesday  the notification is one of the last steps in the arms sale process and triggers a formal  day review to allow members of congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale  u s  lawmakers introduced legislation last week seeking to block about   million of a   billion arms sale to saudi arabia  including the portion on precision guided missiles and other offensive weapons  an announcement of the sale had been expected in march but objections from mostly democratic lawmakers and human rights groups led to washington to ask riyadh for commitments to improve targeting procedures that would minimize civilian casualties  asked on tuesday whether the saudis had taken specific measures to improve targeting capabilities  the senior u s  diplomat  acting assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs stuart jones  did not answer directly   that s a continuing source of conversation between us   jones told reporters   we re constantly trying to improve that process   the yemen civil war pits iran allied houthi rebels against the government backed by a saudi led arab coalition  nearly   civilians have been killed since march   the united nations said in march  jones said tillerson s authorization  which was expected  occurred just before president donald trump s may   visit to saudi arabia  trump s predecessor  barack obama  in december limited military support to saudi arabia s campaign in yemen because of concerns over civilian casualties  and halted the sale of the precision guided munitions  on his trip to saudi arabia  trump received a warm welcome from gulf arab leaders  who want to crack down on iran s influence in the region  a commitment they found lacking in obama  trump also did not make overt mentions of human rights abuses in saudi arabia in his speech there  a move criticized by democrats and republicans in congress   the fact that it wasn t featured in the speech doesn t mean that it s not part of the bilateral dialogue   jones said   by taking it out of the public debate and having those conversations directly and quietly  we ll be more effective   tillerson last week told reporters that human rights issues were not the  central part  of trump s private meetings with  saudi officials  which instead focused on the fight against terrorism
