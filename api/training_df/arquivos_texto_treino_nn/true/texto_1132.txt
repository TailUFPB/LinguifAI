 philadelphia  reuters    tom westerman voted for donald trump in last year s election but says he might not do so again after the president cut off billions of dollars in obamacare subsidies to health insurance companies    it really upset me   said westerman    a self described  middle class guy  with an annual household income of about    in the western pennsylvania city of arnold   westerman s change of heart reflects mounting fears among middle class democrats and republicans that their health insurance costs will soar as trump weakens former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  which extended insurance to more than  million americans   trump said last week he would stop paying the monthly subsidies  which he has derided as a bailout of insurers  the money reimburses insurers for discounts on deductibles  copays and other out of pocket costs the firms still must provide under obamacare to low income households   some insurers  anticipating that trump would end the funding  had already raised  premiums on insurance plans under obama s affordable care act to recoup those funds  others withdrew from obamacare markets in many states because of the uncertainty    it seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class   said westerman  who is retired from a manufacturing company in pennsylvania  a state that trump won by little more than   votes over democrat hillary clinton  it was the first time a republican candidate had won pennsylvania since    westerman already pays   a month in healthcare premiums and about   a month for his  year old daughter s college tuition   he says he s going to make it better for everyone  how does a  premium  increase make it better    a white house spokesman declined to comment and referred inquiries to the u s  department of health and human services  which did not immediately respond to a request for comment   trump has called subsidy payments a  gift  for insurance companies  his administration has argued that it cannot lawfully make the payments unless congress passes new legislation   some people said they were encouraged to see trump deliver on a campaign promise to dismantle obamacare  after repeated failures by congressional republicans to repeal the  law    i support the president because i think obamacare is imploding and it not only impacts those on obamacare  but everybody   said roger heuring    who lives in new jersey  heuring is on an employer plan but said his sister in ohio buys insurance on the obamacare market    forget the president   it s the congress s responsibility  they re the ones that passed this mess to begin with   heuring said   in addition to cutting subsidies  trump signed an executive order last week that could eventually make it easier for americans to buy cheaper  bare bones health insurance plans than required by obamacare   on tuesday  two senators struck a bipartisan deal to stabilize the obamacare market  including reinstating the subsidies for two years  trump initially said he might back the deal  but reversed course on wednesday  as senior republican lawmakers spoke out against a plan that might allow obamacare to survive   meanwhile  democratic attorneys general have asked a california judge to intervene and direct the administration to continue the payments until their legal challenge to trump s cutoff is settled in court   the moves created new uncertainty over the subsidies  just two weeks before americans begin to enroll in obamacare plans for    middle class squeeze  if the subsidies are not restored  some middle income families and small business owners who buy insurance on the obamacare markets could see their premiums rise the most  said larry levitt  health economist at the kaiser family foundation   these include cash strapped self employed workers who rely on obamacare to buy insurance but make too much money to qualify for government assistance  the very poor receive other forms of government subsidies to buy coverage that shields them from premium increases   karyn feit  a self employed mental health therapist in philadelphia  said a hike in premiums will strain her already stretched finances and force her to cut back on trips to florida to care for sick parents   feit    and her husband together earn    annually  placing her among america s vast tier of middle income families  they bought obamacare individual coverage four years ago  when feit left her job at a hospital to start her own business  leaving her without employer coverage  she has no children   her current monthly premiums are    she expects this to rise by   a month after trump s decision    the first thing i would have to cut is travel  and caring for other people   said feit  a democrat   trump voter stephen lewis    lost his job as a veterinarian in wisconsin and bought a health insurance plan under obamacare  lewis still supports trump although he said he fears that his premiums  now   a month  could rise further with the subsidy cut  making it harder for him to meet other expenses  including   in monthly mortgage payments    it is a concern obviously   lewis said   graphic the trump effect  repeal and replace
