paris  reuters    france s president has not given donald trump an easy ride  a crunching handshake at one meeting was followed by a body swerve at another and then a public rebuke over his attitude to climate change  but now there seems to be an olive branch from paris  the u s  leader said on wednesday he had accepted an invitation from emmanuel macron to celebrate july  bastille day celebrations and  years since the u s  troops entered into world war one  trump will likely revel in a ceremony laden with pageantry and military pomp  with u s  soldiers marching down the champs elysees boulevard beside french servicemen   a welcome respite from his domestic woes  for macron    it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win trump s confidence as he tries to establish himself as a leading global statesman at a time when decision making in the white house has become increasingly unpredictable   we don t want the united states to isolate themselves   a macron aide said recently   that s what diplomacy is for  it s not to let people sulk in their corner   in the space of six weeks  france s youngest leader since napoleon  will have hosted russian president vladimir putin in versailles and trump on paris  most iconic avenue  macron flattered putin in may with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of france s former monarchy  built outside paris by louis xiv   the  sun king    to symbolize absolute power  even so  macron pulled no punches  accusing russian state media of  lying propaganda  during his french election campaign  a french diplomat indicated there would be frank exchanges with trump too after macron took a dig in english at trump s withdrawal from the paris climate accord when he urged u s  citizens to help  make this planet great again    on climate change it s complicated   the diplomat said   but the rest is sufficiently important for him to make this historic trip on july    macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with u s  priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with russia  the battle against islamic state  syria s civil war and iran s nuclear accord are likely talking points  privately  some french diplomats have lamented the lack of a clear u s  policy on the long term political process in syria and say even setting up a meeting between the french and u s  foreign ministers is tough   a white house statement said the two leaders would  further build on the strong counter terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries   past words may haunt trump  it will be his first visit since he declared that a wave of militant attacks showed france was soft on immigration and fighting jihadists    france is no longer france  they won t like me for saying that but    france is no longer france and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart   the u s  president said in a campaign speech   in bringing trump to paris  macron has stolen a march on britain s embattled prime minister theresa may       london s offer in february of a state visit for trump met fierce public resistance  britons perceiving it as a desperate act by a government in need of a trade deal as it faced tough negotiations on its exit from the european union  a date has still not been confirmed  in paris  public opinion appeared divided   you can see that the way trump s headed isn t going to help things and i think diplomatic channels are the best way to calm things down   said antique dealer florence toussaint  psychologist martine aubourg was less impressed   trump isn t an honorable president   she said   he changes his mind all the time
