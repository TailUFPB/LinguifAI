washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump  who pledged to help protect young people known as  dreamers  brought illegally to the united states as children  called on sunday for money to fund a border wall to be part of any immigration deal  in a list of  principles  laid out in documents released by the white house  the trump administration also pressed for a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the united states  many of them from central america  the plan  which was delivered to leaders in congress on sunday night  drew a swift rebuke from democrats  who are seeking a legislative fix for the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program that trump ended last month   the administration can t be serious about compromise or helping the dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the dreamers  to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of americans   said house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer   the list includes the wall  which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations  if the president was serious about protecting the dreamers  his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so   they said in a statement  the trump administration wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in congress and accompany a bill to replace daca  the obama era program that protected nearly    dreamers  from deportation and allowed them to secure work permits  if enacted  the white house priorities could result in the deportation of dreamers  parents  the proposals emphasize immigration enforcement and include a request for funds to hire  more immigration judges    attorneys for the immigration and customs enforcement agency   federal prosecutors and   additional ice agents to enforce immigration laws   these priorities are essential to mitigate the legal and economic consequences of any grant of status to daca recipients   trump s legislative affairs director  marc short  told reporters on a conference call  the white house made clear it would not be pushing for dreamers to achieve u s  citizenship  only legal status  in a potential deal  trump told congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help dreamers  who are a fraction of the  million illegal immigrants in the united states  most of whom are hispanic  the documents call for tighter standards for those seeking u s  asylum  denial of federal grants to  sanctuary cities  that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants  and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as  e verify  to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs  trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the u s  border with mexico  he vowed repeatedly that mexico would pay for the wall  but began prodding congress earlier this year to approve funding  mexico has said it will not pay for the wall  trump s suggestion after a meeting with schumer and pelosi  that wall funding would not have to be part of a daca fix alarmed some of his supporters  the white house sees the wall as a priority but has indicated that it could be established as part of a daca bill or through other legislative avenues  administration officials said that legislation that did not include all of the priorities on the list would not necessarily trigger a presidential veto  republicans in congress have introduced several bills that include aspects of trump s ideas  but many democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh   the trump administration has put forth a serious proposal to address the enforcement of our immigration laws and border security   said republican house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte in a statement   we cannot fix the daca problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place   the white house s wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the united states  it would require such children to be treated the same  regardless of their countries of origin  so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries   the white house documents said  it would expand the list of  inadmissible aliens  to include members of gangs  those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony  and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior  the plan also seeks to reduce the number of people who overstay their visas and reform how green cards that establish legal permanent residents are granted   trump s white house has so far not been able to achieve a major legislative victory  casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform  which republican and democratic presidents have tried before without success  since trump took office in january  his fellow republicans have failed to repeal and replace former democratic president barack obama s affordable care act  known as obamacare  and a white house plan for tax reform needs more support
