glen jean  west virginia  reuters    after another challenging day in washington  president donald trump flew to west virginia to a field full of   chanting and cheering boy scouts  telling them he was happy to leave washington behind   who the hell wants to speak about politics   trump boomed  telling the boys he wanted to talk about how to achieve their dreams   but politics proved too hard for trump to resist on a day he spent pleading for republican senators to vote to advance his long promised health care overhaul and watching his son in law jared kushner being grilled on capitol hill about contacts with russia  it did not take long for trump to veer from inspiration to denigration  the teenaged boys loved it  cheering wildly at each sick burn  hooting and hollering like they were at a wrestling match   tonight we put aside all of the policy fights in washington  d c  you ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of that   he told the teenaged boys  sitting state by state in brightly colored t shirts   you know  i go to washington and i see all these politicians and i see the swamp and it s not a good place   said trump   in fact  today i said we ought to change it from the word  swamp  to the word  cesspool  or perhaps to the word  sewer   it s not good  i see what s going on and believe me  i d much rather be with you  that i can tell you   trump said  he told the boys that the media were dishonest and would not  show the size of their jamboree on television   fake media  fake media   trump said  eliciting a chorus of boos and cheers  trump recounted his election night victories  state by state  the boys from wisconsin cheering when they heard their state mentioned  the boys from michigan doing the same  but the most sustained round of cheers and jeers came when trump mentioned his predecessor president barack obama  who had declined invitations to speak to the scout gathering while he was in office   by the way  just a question  did president obama ever come to a jamboree   trump said  trump said he has  former boy scouts serving in his cabinet and white house  and brought a few on stage as examples of boy scout leadership in action  including tom price  his health secretary   hopefully he s going to get the votes tomorrow to start our path toward killing this horrible thing known as obamacare   trump said  referring to obama s signature health care legislation  as the boys booed   he better get them  otherwise i ll say   tom  you re fired    he said  borrowing the catch phrase from his reality television show   the apprentice
