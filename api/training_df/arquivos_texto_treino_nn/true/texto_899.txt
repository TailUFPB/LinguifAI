washington  reuters    president donald trump will further pressure chinese president xi jinping in talks next week to take tougher measures against north korea  as the united states compiles information for possible new sanctions on chinese banks working with pyongyang  senior administration officials say trump will try to convince xi when they meet in beijing to squeeze north korea with steps such as limits on oil exports  coal imports and financial transactions  it is the latest attempt by trump to have china  north korea s only major ally  rein in pyongyang s nuclear weapons ambitions but it is far from clear if xi  who has just consolidated his power at a communist party congress  will agree  china says its leverage over pyongyang is exaggerated  and points to its support in the u n  security council for recent sanctions on north korea as evidence that it is trying to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests      north korea this year conducted a powerful nuclear test detonation and has test fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that  if perfected  could reach the u s  mainland  trump has vowed to prevent north korea gaining that capability  two u s  officials said the threat of additional u n  and other economic sanctions on north korea is another option to solicit greater cooperation from china  by playing on beijing s concerns that deeper poverty in north korea could prompt an exodus of refugees across its border  the officials said the united states and its allies have been collecting detailed information on chinese bank transactions with north korea to try to identify institutions with the  most egregious  records of doing business with pyongyang  the objective  the officials said  is to craft a proposal for escalating sanctions on chinese financial and other entities that stops short of sanctioning the people s bank of china central bank  washington so far has mostly held off on new sanctions against chinese banks and companies doing business with north korea  given fears of retaliation by beijing and possibly far reaching effects on the world economy  in a brief statement on thursday formally announcing the visit from the chinese end  the country s foreign ministry said china was ready to work with the united states to achieve  important results  for trump s visit  it did not elaborate    trump s stop in beijing is part of a nov    tour of five asian nations in which north korea will be a major focus  the visit includes u s  allies japan and south korea who have watched with increasing worry as the united states and north korea have exchanged bellicose rhetoric      to prepare for his trip  trump met with former u s  secretary of state henry kissinger  a key player in president richard nixon s opening to china in    and over lunch last week at the white house  trump asked singapore prime minister lee hsien loong for his opinion about north korea and its unpredictable leader  a participant said  lee told him that kim sees his nuclear weapons program as essential to his survival after the u s  led ouster of iraqi president saddam hussein  and libyan leader muammar gaddhafi s downfall   lee said it s probably impossible for kim to become convinced that the united states doesn t want to overthrow him   a participant at the lunch said   they re super paranoid                       while part of the u s  strategy on north korea is to deprive kim jong un s government of resources  trump has left open the threat of military force  u s  officials  while emphasizing they want a diplomatic solution  have highlighted military preparedness to counter a north korean threat and there are three u s  aircraft carrier groups in the region  trump has threatened to  totally destroy  north korea and has derided kim as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission  to the dismay of some u s  military and intelligence officials who fear such rhetoric could backfire       as well as pressuring china  the united states is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with north korea  using a  new york channel  to get in contact with diplomats at pyongyang s united nations mission   analysts in asia are skeptical trump s pressure on china will work   i don t think china will seriously change its existing policy on north korea simply because of more pressure from the united states   said zhao tong  a north korea expert at the carnegie tsinghua center in beijing      china s ambassador to the united states  cui tiankai  told reporters on monday it will take a broad effort to pressure north korea and china alone cannot solve the problem   china has been doing everything we can on the korean issue   he said  in japan  the threat from pyongyang hit close to home after tests this year in which two ballistic missiles flew over its territory  but there is concern in tokyo that the trump administration lacks a clear north korea strategy   the biggest worry is that trump s grand asia policy  north korea policy  is not well defined    but responds to circumstances instead       said toshihiro nayakama  a professor at keio university   they turn to china to exert pressure but the question is to what extent there is chinese pressure  i believe this is not yet evaluated by the u s  administration   he said  the trump administration has considered threatening china with trade actions over its resistance to do more on north korea  while some advisers from outside his administration have  urged trump to pursue this course  he has been persuaded against it by his own advisers who have warned of a trade war  u s  officials said
