washington  reuters    hundreds of government employees file in and out of the u s  agency for auto safety in washington every working day  investigating potentially dangerous vehicles and managing a   million annual budget  but an administrator is not among them   nobody has been nominated to the top job since president donald trump took office   also missing from the roughly  people on the payroll of the national highway traffic safety administration  or nhtsa  are a permanent chief counsel  director for government affairs  chief financial officer and enforcement chief  while a deputy administrator was appointed last week  slow progress in bringing in senior politically appointed officials has nearly frozen key decision making at the agency  according to five former nhtsa officials  consumer groups  lawmakers and some business leaders  they said that without leadership in place nhtsa has either pushed back or failed to act on rules setting new standards for improving how buses fare in rollover crashes  a system to remind passengers in rear seats to wear seat belts  and new tire standards  eight months into trump s presidency  senior positions in many government agencies across washington remain vacant  including roles at the state department  the department of energy  the environmental protection agency and throughout the transportation department that oversees nhtsa   some of the vacancies are the result of trump s efforts to slim down the federal bureaucracy  others are simply waiting to be filled   the white house blames democrats for dragging out the confirmation process for its nominees  and says vetting picks has been more complicated than usual because many come from the business world rather than government  while many companies applaud trump s moves to roll back federal bureaucracy  some also complain that delays in bringing aboard political appointees is hindering government decisions that could impact business   the frustration extends to some u s  diplomats  private sector lawyers and others who regularly deal with government agencies  according to interviews  in september  the u s  tire manufacturers association urged trump in a letter to accelerate his efforts to nominate a nhtsa administrator so the agency can comply with a  road safety law passed by congress      the law ordered nhtsa to write regulations setting minimum tire standards for fuel efficiency and traction in wet conditions and create an online database for consumers to check for tire recalls  u s  manufacturers and consumer groups support the regulations  drawn up in response to vehicle deaths linked to faulty tires  because they will raise standards and make the u s  market less accessible to poorly made versions   we don t want the u s  to be kind of the dumping group for the really low technology because there isn t a standard to meet   said dan zielinski  the association s senior vice president   two former nhtsa leaders and consumer groups say the agency is also moving slowly on other regulatory issues  such as improving side impact standards   this agency is in a stall     they are not going to do very much without political leadership   said joan claybrook  a former nhtsa administrator under president jimmy carter and a prominent consumer advocate  nhtsa said in a statement friday that safety is its top priority  the agency is  committed to meeting all obligations as required  by the  law  nhtsa has an ongoing review of all regulatory actions as part of an administration wide effort  a white house spokeswoman declined to comment on nhtsa but said  capable and professional staff  are filling essential positions throughout the government on an acting basis until confirmations go through  leadership shortages extend beyond the nhtsa  the white house had by oct   nominated  political appointees for civilian positions in the executive branch and  have been confirmed by the u s  senate  according to the non partisan partnership for public service  both numbers were well below those in the first eight months under at least the last four presidents  in the same period of barack obama s presidency   candidates were nominated and  confirmed  one senior administration official said it aims to have all top positions   those at the level of assistant secretary and above   nominated by year s end  still  some political appointee jobs are expected to stay empty  the white house spokeswoman said   the federal government has grown unrestrained for decades because politicians have been too afraid to  drain the swamp    she said  follow trump s impact on energy  environment  healthcare  immigration and the economy at the trump effect www reuters com trump effect in many cases  dire warnings from opponents that trump s delays in putting forward political nominations for approval would cause chaos have proven overblown        but there are examples of government slowing down because mid level employees do not have the authority or are unwilling to make decisions      at the committee on foreign investment in the united states  cfius   which analyzes proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security  private sector lawyers complain of slow decisions on big deals       there is an unwillingness for the staff people to make a decision   said michael gershberg  a trade and investment attorney with fried frank   a lobbyist who works on cfius deals said some companies have had to refile proposals because cfius failed to reach a decision within  days  that drives up legal and financing fees and creates uncertainty about the deal         deals that have been refiled include a bid by jack ma s ant financial to buy moneygram  mgi o  and zhongwang usa s    billion bid for aleris corp  alsd pk   the senate last week confirmed heath tarbert  who is expected to oversee cfius  as an assistant secretary of the treasury  at the state department  only six of the top  jobs have been filled  and no confirmed officials are in place to run regional bureaus that handle foreign relations  instead  they are in the hands of career diplomats with limited authority      the united states does not have an ambassador in place in such key allied countries as south korea  jordan  qatar and saudi arabia        we re pretty much frozen in amber here   one official said      a congressional aide said it was hard to determine the precise impact of the vacancies  but he added that u s  policy in the north korea missiles crisis would likely be helped by an ambassador in seoul  a fully empowered assistant secretary of state for east asia and an active special envoy for north korea        that s just one example in the region with the most prominent national security crisis  and really one of the most serious in a long time   he said      deputy secretary of state john sullivan  testifying in congress on sept    addressed the slow pace of filling posts       we re behind the curve  we should be ahead of the curve  and we re doing all we can to catch up   he said   our work is getting done  it would be better done if we had those positions filled
