beijing  reuters    china reacted relatively calmly on friday after a series of  diplomatic broadsides by the united states  expressing anger over new arms sales by washington to taiwan but hoping ties could soon be brought  back on track  u s  officials have said president donald trump is growing increasingly frustrated with china over its inability to restrain north korea s arms and missile programs   this week  the united states imposed sanctions on two chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping north korea s weapons programs  announced a    billion arms sale for taiwan  and said it would like sick chinese dissident liu xiaobo to be treated  elsewhere   it has also placed china on its global list of the worst offenders in human trafficking and forced labor and senior u s  officials have told reuters that washington is considering trade actions against beijing  including tariffs on steel imports  trump met indian prime minister narendra modi on monday at the white house and made a point of noting that the united states  india and japan would be joining together in naval exercises soon in the indian ocean  a point that seemed aimed at china  it s a long way from the  bromance  that trump and chinese president xi jinping appeared to have at their first summit in april  trump had made a grand gesture of his desire for warm ties in the meeting at his florida residence and subsequently called xi a  good man   while china said it was  outraged  at the arms sales for taiwan  and upset with the north korea related sanctions  it did not make specific threats of retaliation  in   beijing threatened to sanction u s  firms that sell weapons to taiwan after washington announced a much bigger    billion arms package  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said he hoped the united states can correct its mistakes and get ties back on track  so as to avoid cooperation in important areas being impacted   he did not elaborate  jia qingguo  dean of the school of international studies at peking university and who has advised the government on foreign policy  cautioned against interpreting recent events as indicating a shift in china u s  relations  saying it was still too early to tell   we had a good first summit and a good beginning but the relationship in the long run is characterized by not just cooperation but also conflict   jia said   arms sales to taiwan  the south china sea and east china sea  and other problems in the relationship will appear  it s a question of how much the two countries will be able to manage these conflicts  whether they can manage them better than the previous administration   trump and xi are expected to meet next week on the sidelines of a  summit in the germany city of hamburg  china has long been cautious about trump  china based diplomatic sources say  believing he is unpredictable and needs to be handled with care   how does the chinese government view trump  we re still discovering who he is  he often does things we can t predict  we re not clever enough to predict what he ll do   said shen dingli  a professor at shanghai s elite fudan university  trump upset china even before taking office  taking a call from taiwan president tsai ing wen  overturning decades of precedent of no high level official contacts between the united states and an island china considers to be a wayward province   while china has worked hard to get trump to understand the importance of taiwan to the china u s  relationship  it has never seriously expected washington to stop selling it weapons  provision for which is explicitly made in u s  law   the u s  selling weapons to taiwan is routine   said shen   they re selling much less than before  and that s much better  so i don t think there s anything too terrible about that   still  the risks around taiwan are profound   china s defense ministry  responding to the u s  weapons sales  said taiwan was the  most important  most sensitive core issue  between the united states and china  the arms sale came hot on the heels of a u s  senate committee approving a bill calling for the resumption of port visits to taiwan by the u s  navy for the first time since washington ditched taipei and established ties with beijing in   while china s defense ministry registered its opposition to the bill on thursday  spokesman wu qian pointed out that as long as they respect each other s core concerns  the chinese and u s  militaries can be an  engine of stability  for the two countries  shi yinhong  who heads the center for american studies at beijing s renmin university and has advised the government on diplomacy  said it was important people are realistic about the challenges china and the united states face   perhaps people appraised too highly the xi trump meeting  although the atmosphere was very good  there were still real problems there   shi said  referring to the florida summit   maybe you can say that china u s  relations have gone back to being normal   shi added   trump has no patience  and nobody can be surprised that he s pushed certain issues to the fore
