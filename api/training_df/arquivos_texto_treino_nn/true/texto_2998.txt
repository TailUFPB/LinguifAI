washington  reuters    as the u s  supreme court navigated a difficult period in which it was short one member for more than a year  justices from across the ideological spectrum often managed to find common ground  that sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test  the nine justice court ended its   term on monday with a flurry of rulings  when it resumes work in october  its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the u s  constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons  presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain  neil gorsuch  republican president donald trump s appointee  joined the court in april  giving conservatives a   majority  gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term    we will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided   chicago kent college of law professor carolyn shapiro said  while partisan tensions in washington have deepened since trump took office in january  the supreme court largely remained above the fray  in the  months that the court operated with only eight justices following justice antonin scalia s death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative  it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years  during that time  the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues  resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid   votes that would leave legal questions unresolved   the court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on monday on how to handle trump s contentious order banning people from six muslim majority countries from entering the united states  the four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term  the court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines  including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a christian baker from colorado who refused to make a cake for a same sex couple  citing his religious beliefs  the justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a republican configured electoral map in wisconsin that could have major consequences for u s  elections  the travel ban case  trump s first big supreme court battle  is a major test of presidential powers  with trump s administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters  in the term that just ended  the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard  on monday  the justices ordered that those cases  both on immigration related issues  be re argued in its next term  when gorsuch would be able to participate  the action suggests the court was divided   along ideological grounds on those cases  a review of rulings from the   term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity  likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote  in  cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits  there were no dissenting votes in  of them  or  percent  according to kedar bhatia  who compiles court statistics for the scotusblog website  that compares with  percent in the court s previous term and  percent in the one prior to that    with only eight members  i think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible  both in the close cases and in the not so close ones   said kannon shanmugam  a lawyer who regularly argues before the court  while they were shorthanded  the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically  for example  they took six cases on patent protections  a higher than normal number  on an issue in which they usually are unanimous
