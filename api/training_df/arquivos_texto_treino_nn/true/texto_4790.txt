washington  reuters    republicans considering whether or not to back u s  president donald trump s healthcare reforms in a crucial house of representatives vote this week face a painful choice  if they vote against  they could face the wrath of a vengeful and combative president  if they vote for it  they risk retribution from the billionaire brothers charles and david koch and other powerful right wing players whose money can be pivotal in re election races  as trump faces the most formidable  high stakes negotiation of his presidency  the fierce battle in the u s  congress over his plan to replace obamacare is a test of whether republicans will trust him with their political futures at the risk of alienating deep pocketed conservative advocacy groups  as trump and leaders in the house round up support for the bill ahead of a planned thursday vote  some groups are threatening to retaliate against those who do support it  including the club for growth  the heritage foundation s political arm  and americans for prosperity  which is part of the expansive political pressure network established by the koch brothers  all three groups are  keying  the vote  which means it will be a factor in determining whether the groups deem a lawmaker to be sufficiently conservative  that opens up the possibility that some republicans who vote in favor of the bill could face a primary challenge in next year s congressional elections and may not be able to count on help from the kochs and others   trump himself warned house republicans in a meeting on tuesday that their seats will be at risk next year if they do not support his healthcare bill  which would modify but not eliminate obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  democratic former president barack obama s signature healthcare legislation passed in    he warned us that there are consequences if we don t come together for us as a party and also for individuals   representative richard hudson of north carolina said after the meeting   he wasn t threatening in any way  he was just giving us a pretty clear warning   trump also told representative mark meadows of north carolina  an outspoken critic of the bill  that he was  coming after  him  according to people in the meeting  meadows later said the president was joking   some conservatives believe the bill does not go far enough in dismantling obamacare and have not been satisfied by the white house s attempts to mollify them  nbc news reported on tuesday that  house republicans oppose the bill  which would leave house speaker paul ryan short of the  votes he needs  no democrat is expected to support the bill   the conflict has created an odd dynamic  trump  who ran as an  outsider  candidate siding with the republican political establishment against the hard line conservatives who were some of his most ardent supporters  at the same time  trump has never been a favorite of libertarian conservatives such as the kochs  or of groups such as the club for growth  because  among other things  he has never taken a strong stand on reining in federal spending  they opposed him during the republican presidential campaign   for them  the healthcare vote is a test of their continued relevance in a party seized by trump  the koch network spent an estimated   million on last year s election  the koch run americans for prosperity  which has chapters in more than  states and boasts that it can deploy   million citizen activists  spent almost   million on the  elections  according to federal records  freedom partners  another koch entity which largely targeted democrats with attack ads  spent   million   tim phillips  president of americans for prosperity  would not say directly that republicans who support the bill will face consequences next year  but noted   members of congress know how serious we take a vote like this    james davis  a spokesman for freedom partners  said  network organizations will stand with principled lawmakers who will oppose the house healthcare proposal   davis said the koch network would spend between   million and   million ahead of the  elections   last year  americans for prosperity and the club for growth targeted an incumbent house republican  then representative renee ellmers of north carolina  for being too close with house leadership and not holding the line on government spending  ellmers lost in a primary fight   house republicans have been nervous about primary challenges since  when eric cantor  then the majority leader  lost to a little known conservative named david brat   phillips said his organization last year was instrumental in getting republican incumbents senators rob portman of ohio and pat toomey of pennsylvania re elected  the two leading koch groups sat out then senator kelly ayotte s tight race in new hampshire  ayotte lost by   percent of the vote    groups such as the kochs have been an important part of a coalition of outside republican money   said nathan gonzales  a congressional political analyst in washington   if that coalition falters  that could contribute to democratic gains   but several lawmakers interviewed by reuters were dismissive of the opposition by conservative groups    for me  this healthcare bill is an absolute no brainer   said representative devin nunes of california  a close trump ally   any conservative group who opposes it  i don t even understand how they can categorize themselves as being a conservative group   the bill s supporters have argued that voters are more likely to punish republicans who do not act to replace obamacare when given the chance   if it fails there are going to be a lot of people who are looking for work in    said representative mike conaway of texas   the political implications of the bill  though  remain largely unclear   even if it passes the house  the bill faces a difficult path in the senate  where several conservatives have declared their opposition  veteran house members recall in   when then speaker nancy pelosi forced a vote on a bill that would cap carbon emissions  the bill did not pass the senate  and many democrats from coal states lost their seats in the  elections for their votes
