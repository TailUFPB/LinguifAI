caracas washington   reuters    u s  president donald trump signed an executive order that prohibits dealings in new debt from the venezuelan government or its state oil company on friday in an effort to halt financing that the white house said fuels president nicolas maduro s  dictatorship   maduro  who has frequently blamed the united states for waging an  economic war  on venezuela  said the united states was seeking to force venezuela to default   but he said it would not succeed  the order is washington s biggest sanctions blow to date against maduro and is intended to punish his leftist government for what trump has called an erosion of democracy in the oil rich country  which is already reeling from an economic crisis  it suggests a weakening in already strained relations between the two countries  just three days ago  maduro said the relations between caracas and washington were at their lowest point ever   all they re trying to do to attack venezuela is crazy   said maduro on a tv broadcast on friday   with the efforts of our people  it will fail and venezuela will be stronger  more free  and more independent   venezuela faces a severe recession with millions suffering food and medicine shortages and soaring inflation  the south american nation relies on oil for some  percent of export revenue  citgo petroleum   the u s  refiner of venezuela s ailing state run oil company pdvsa  is  practically  being forced to close by the order  warned maduro  adding that a preliminary analysis showed the sanctions would impede venezuelan crude exports to the united states  he said he was calling  urgent  meetings with u s  clients of venezuelan oil  the new sanctions ban trade in any new issues of u s  dollar denominated debt of the venezuelan government and pdvsa  because the ban applies to use of the u s  financial system   as a result  it will be it tricky for pdvsa to refinance its heavy debt burden  investors had expected that pdvsa would seek to ease upcoming payments through such an operation  as it did last year  which usually requires that new bonds be issued  additional financial pressure on pdvsa could push the cash strapped company closer to a possible default  or bolster its reliance on key allies china and russia  which have already lent caracas billions of dollars    they want us to fall into default   said maduro  adding that just under two thirds of venezuelan bond holders are in the united states  maduro insisted that venezuela would continue paying its debts  the decision also blocks citgo petroleum from sending dividends back to the south american nation  a senior official said  in a further blow to pdvsa s coffers  however  the order stops short of a major ban on crude trading that could have disrupted venezuela s oil industry and worsened the country s faltering economy  it also protects holders of most existing venezuelan government and pdvsa bonds  who were relieved the sanctions did not go further  venezuelan and pdvsa bonds were trading broadly higher on friday afternoon   maduro may no longer take advantage of the american financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the venezuelan economy at the expense of the venezuelan people   u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday  venezuela s oil ministry and pdvsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment   pdvsa  the financial engine of maduro s government  is already struggling due to low global oil prices  mismanagement  allegations of corruption and a brain drain  washington last month sanctioned pdvsa s finance vice president  simon zerpa  complicating some of the company s operations as americans are now banned from doing business with him  trump has so far spared venezuela from broader sanctions against its vital oil industry  but officials have said such actions are under consideration  the republican president has also warned of a  military option  for venezuela  although white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster said on friday that no such actions are anticipated in the  near future   venezuela has for months struggled to find financing because of pdvsa s cash flow problems and corruption scandals have led institutions to tread cautiously  regardless of sanctions  russia and its state oil company rosneft have emerged as an increasingly important source of financing for pdvsa  according to a reuters report    on at least two occasions  the venezuelan government has used russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders  a high level pdvsa official told reuters   at this point our view is that the country can scrape by without defaulting this year  largely with the help of chinese and russian backing and by further squeezing imports  next year is a tossup   said raul gallegos  an analyst with the consultancy control risks  however  china has grown reticent to extend further loans because of payment delays and corruption  russia has been negotiating financing in exchange for oil assets in venezuela  sources have told reuters  but going forward it would be difficult for the opec member to provide enough assets to keep up loans destined for bond payments  venezuela s government has around   billion in available cash to make    billion in bond payments by the end of the year and to cover the import of food and medicine  according to documents reviewed by reuters
