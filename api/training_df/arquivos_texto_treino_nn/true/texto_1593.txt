pacific and president donald trump and kim jong un traded more insults   trump called the north korean leader a  madman  on friday  a day after kim dubbed him a  mentally deranged u s  dotard  who would face the  highest level of hard line countermeasure in history  in retaliation for trump saying the u s  would   totally destroy  north korea if it threatened the u s  or its allies      we have to calm down the hot heads   russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters at the united nations  where world leaders gathered this week for the annual u n  general assembly   we continue to strive for the reasonable and not the emotional approach   of the kindergarten fight between children   u s  secretary of state rex tillerson expressed hope in an interview with abc that sanctions and  voices from every corner of the world  could lead north korea back to talks  but admitted intensifying rhetoric had left washington  quite challenged    north korea s foreign minister ri yong ho  warned on thursday that kim  could consider a hydrogen bomb test of an unprecedented scale over the pacific  ri  who is due to speak to the united nations on saturday  added that he did not know kim s exact thoughts  in response  tillerson said u s  diplomatic efforts would continue but all military options were still on the table  north korea s six nuclear tests to date have all been underground  and experts say an atmospheric test  which would be the first since one by china in   would be proof of the  success of its weapons program  a senior u s  official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said washington was taking kim s threat seriously and added that any atmospheric test would be a  game changer   but he said there were questions about north korea s technical capabilities and washington did not give  too much credence  to pyongyang taking such action   there s a certain amount of bluster that s taken for granted when you re dealing with north korea   the official told reuters  pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept   and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at enabling it to target the united states with a nuclear tipped missile  lavrov on friday again pushed a proposal by moscow and beijing for a dual suspension of north korean weapons tests and the u s  south korean military drills to kick start talks  lavrov suggested that a neutral european country could mediate   he described the exchange of insults between the u s  and north korean leaders was  quite bad  unacceptable   u s  treasury and gold prices rose while the japanese yen strengthened on friday as the exchange of barbs fueled geopolitical jitters and drove investors into assets considered safer during times of turmoil  the latest round of rhetoric began on tuesday when trump  in his first address to the united nations  made the threat to destroy north korea  a country of  million people  he also called kim a  rocket man  on a suicide mission   his remarks     have convinced me  rather than frightening or stopping me  that the path i chose is correct and that it is the one i have to follow to the last   kim said in the statement carried by the north s official kcna news agency on friday  promising to make trump  pay dearly for his speech   south korea said it was the first direct statement of its kind by a north korean leader  japan  the only country to suffer an atomic attack  called the north korean threat to conduct an atmospheric test  totally unacceptable   trump on friday tweeted   kim jong un of north korea  who is obviously a madman who doesn t mind starving or killing his people  will be tested like never before   the white house said on friday that trump and south korean

rotational basis   it did not name specific weapons systems  on thursday trump announced new u s  sanctions that he said allows the targeting of companies and institutions that finance and facilitate trade with north korea  then when asked if diplomacy was still a possible  he said   why not   the additional sanctions on pyongyang  including on its shipping and trade networks  showed trump was giving more time for economic pressure to weigh on north korea  u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said banks doing business in north korea would not be allowed to operate in the united states  kcna also published rare criticism of official chinese media  saying comments on north korea s nuclear program had damaged ties and suggested beijing  its neighbor and only major ally  had sided with washington  kcna said chinese media was  openly resorting to interference in the internal affairs of another country  and driving a wedge between the two countries  china s foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said   all relevant sides should exercise restraint and dedicate themselves to easing the situation rather than irritating each other   the rhetoric has started to rattle some in other
