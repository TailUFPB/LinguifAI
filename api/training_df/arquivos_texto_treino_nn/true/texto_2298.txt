washington  reuters    donald trump s choice of a general as chief of staff has quickly brought more order to the white house and is giving the president more time to ponder decisions as he tries to bounce back from a rocky six months with no major legislative achievements  but john kelly  a retired four star marine corps general with an intimidating air  still has many challenges to confront to stem the chaos that has raged at the white house since trump took office in january  not least the republican president s free wheeling style   trump  who attended a military prep school growing up  is said to be pleased at the increased discipline that kelly has brought in since taking over from reince priebus  who struggled to maintain order and was often ignored by senior staff   he is feeling like he s getting more time to read the materials and have substantive discussions and talk about the decisions he s making   said a white house official  who asked not to be identified   before  he was carrying a lot himself  it feels now like there is more burden sharing around  he has more trust and confidence in kelly   the official said  aides said kelly  who previously was running the department of homeland security and who began work on monday  was commanding respect in the west wing   kelly is scary in a way that reince wasn t   said an administration official  senior staff meetings are well attended and no longer considered optional as they were under priebus  typically anyone who goes into the oval office to see trump makes sure kelly knows   i think you ve seen less backbiting   said ken duberstein  who was a chief of staff for  president ronald reagan   i think the idea that he is asserting  that the white house cannot be a free wheeling place but rather there is a chain of command and things go in an orderly process  are all major steps in the right direction   so far  kelly has not managed to put a stop to leaks to the media that have infuriated trump   on thursday  the washington post published transcripts of trump s sometimes fraught calls in the early days of his presidency with mexican president enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull  he has not reined in the president himself  and it is by no means clear he will try to do so  confidants say trump is still speed dialing people in the evenings  as he has done for decades  he is still firing off bombastic tweets  like one on thursday blaming the republican controlled congress for what he called an all time low in relations with russia because it piled on more sanctions  but trump did stay on message at a rally in west virginia on thursday night  reading from a teleprompter and sticking to the script  barry bennett  a former trump campaign adviser  said time will tell whether kelly can reform any of the habits trump has displayed during the first six months in office  he ll have some of the smartest people around him and they re not there to change him but to make him better  even tom brady needs a coach   said bennett  referring to the highly successful new england patriots quarterback  trump s friends said there is value to letting trump be trump  particularly since priebus  attempt to shape trump into a more traditional president failed spectacularly   kelly can go too far in the other direction  donald trump doesn t need a babysitter  he s his own man   said one friend   i understand the attitude of the military types that if they can control all information flow they can control the president  but the first time he learns something that he should have heard from staff  there will be hell to pay   trump has yet to notch up a major legislative win and kelly has scant experience with lawmakers  in the mid  he served as the marine corps commandant s liaison officer to the u s  house of representatives  so far his appointment is being welcomed on capitol hill  where lawmakers had grown weary of the chaos at the white house  many were heartened to see one of kelly s first acts was to jettison anthony scaramucci as communications director after a foul mouthed tirade against priebus and chief strategist steve bannon   he is going to bring such an air of calm   said senator david perdue  a republican and early supporter of trump s election campaign   this man has been through a career of providing results  and showing leadership   kelly is seen as likely to form a partnership with two other retired generals in trump s inner circle  defense secretary james mattis and national security adviser h r  mcmaster  the three attended a meeting of top national security aides on thursday in the white house situation room aimed at settling on a strategy for afghanistan that trump  who tends to be non interventionist  will find acceptable  whether they will be able to overcome his doubts about sending around   more u s  troops to afghanistan is unclear   i think he likes the snap and efficiency  but i seriously question whether any of them share his non interventionist world view   the friend said
