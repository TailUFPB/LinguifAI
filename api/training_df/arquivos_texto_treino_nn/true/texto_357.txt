washington  reuters    former national security adviser michael flynn pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the fbi about his contacts with russia  and he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors delving into the actions of president donald trump s inner circle before he took office  the dramatic turn of events also raised new questions about whether trump s son in law  jared kushner  had a role in those russia contacts  flynn was the first member of trump s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel robert mueller s wide ranging investigation into russian attempts to influence the  u s  election and potential collusion by trump aides   under a plea bargain deal  flynn admitted in a washington court that he lied when asked by fbi investigators about his conversations last december with russia s then ambassador  sergei kislyak  just weeks before trump took office  prosecutors said the two men discussed u s  sanctions against russia and that flynn also asked kislyak to help delay a u n  vote seen as damaging to israel  on both occasions  he appeared to be undermining the policies of outgoing president barack obama  they also said a  very senior member  of trump s transition team had told flynn to contact russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the u n  vote  sources told reuters that the  very senior  official was kushner  a key member of trump s transition team and now the president s senior adviser  kushner s lawyer  abbe lowell  did not respond to multiple requests for comment  he has previously said kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and would continue to do so  flynn s decision to cooperate with mueller s team marked a major escalation in a probe that has dogged the president since he took office in january  there was nothing in the court hearing that pointed to any evidence against trump  and the white house said flynn s guilty plea implicated him alone       nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than mr  flynn   said ty cobb  a white house attorney  flynn  a retired army lieutenant general  only served as trump s national security adviser for  days  he was forced to resign after he was found to have misled vice president mike pence about his discussions with kislyak  but flynn had been an enthusiastic supporter of trump s election campaign and the president continued to praise him even after he left the administration  saying flynn had been treated  very  very unfairly  by the news media  a small group of protesters yelled  lock him up   as flynn left the courthouse on friday  echoing the  lock her up   chant that flynn himself led against trump s democratic rival  hillary clinton  in vitriolic appearances on the campaign trail  mueller s team is also looking at whether members of trump s campaign may have sought to ease sanctions on russia in return for financial gain or because russian officials held some leverage over them  people familiar with the probe say  prosecutors said flynn and kislyak last december discussed economic sanctions that obama s administration had just imposed on moscow for allegedly interfering in the election  flynn asked kislyak to refrain from escalating a diplomatic dispute with washington over the sanctions  and later falsely told fbi officials that he did not make that request  court documents showed  prosecutors said flynn had earlier consulted with a senior member of trump s presidential transition team about what to communicate to the russian ambassador   flynn called the russian ambassador and requested that russia not escalate the situation and only respond to the u s  sanctions in a reciprocal manner   the prosecutors said in court documents  adding that flynn then called the trump official again to recount the conversation with kislyak  they did not name the senior official in the trump team but    u s  media reports identified former adviser k t  mcfarland as the person  reuters was unable to verify the reports  on dec      the day before prosecutors say the call between the trump aides took place  trump had publicly played down the need to sanction russia for allegedly hacking u s  democratic operatives   i think we ought to get on with our lives  i think that computers have complicated lives very greatly   trump told reporters at his mar a lago florida resort  ryan goodman  a professor at new york university law school  said flynn s plea deal shows mueller is scrutinizing the truthfulness of testimony given to his investigators  kushner is potentially liable for making false statements if his testimony is contradicted by flynn  goodman said  earlier on friday  abc news cited a flynn confidant as saying flynn was ready to testify that trump directed him to make contact with russians before he became president  initially as a way to work together to fight the islamic state group in syria   reuters could not immediately verify the abc news report     u s  stocks  the dollar and treasury yields fell sharply after the abc report  although they partially rebounded on optimism that a republican bill to cut taxes will be approved in the u s  senate  if trump directed flynn to contact russian officials  that might not necessarily amount to a crime  it would be a crime if it were proven that trump directed flynn to lie to the fbi  moscow has denied what u s  intelligence agencies say was meddling in the election campaign to try to sway the vote in trump s favor  trump has called mueller s probe a witch hunt                  in may  the president fired fbi director james comey  who later accused trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the russia allegations  comey also said he believed trump had asked him to drop the fbi s probe into flynn  comey on friday tweeted a cryptic message about justice   but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream   amos      he wrote  quoting the biblical book of amos      paul manafort  who ran trump s presidential campaign for several months last year  was charged in october with conspiring to launder money  conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as a foreign agent of ukraine s former pro russian government   manafort  who did not join trump s administration  and a business associate who was charged with him both pleaded not guilty
