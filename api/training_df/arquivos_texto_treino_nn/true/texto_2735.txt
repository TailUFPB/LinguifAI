 reuters    a lobbyist who was once a soviet counter intelligence officer participated last year in a meeting with senior aides to u s  president donald trump  including his eldest son  and a russian lawyer  nbc news reported on friday  adding to allegations of possible connections between moscow and the november election  nbc news  which did not identify the russian american lobbyist  said some u s  officials suspected him of still having ties to russian intelligence  something he denied to the network   the associated press said the lobbyist  whom it identified as rinat akhmetshin  confirmed that he had attended the june  meeting in new york s trump tower  a source familiar with the participants of the meeting confirmed to reuters that akhmetshin was in the room  the meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between trump s election campaign and russia  a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel  trump s son in law  jared kushner  and former campaign adviser paul manafort were also at the meeting  which the president s eldest son  donald trump jr   agreed to attend because he believed he could get damaging information about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  trump jr  did not mention akhmetshin s presence when he released a series of emails about the meeting earlier this week  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives intelligence committee  said the report about akhmetshin  if accurate  adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting   akhmetshin was not available for comment on friday  there was no answer at the door of his house in washington  the white house had no immediate comment about the nbc news report of a russian american lobbyist at the meeting  kushner s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment  and manafort s spokesman jason maloni said manafort had no comment on the meeting  a former trump campaign adviser  michael caputo  told reporters after he testified to the house intelligence committee in closed session on friday that he had no contact with russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign  talking with russians       accusations by u s  intelligence agencies that moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the trump campaign have dominated the republican president s first months in office  russia denies the allegations  and trump says there was no collusion  the agencies said earlier this year that russia sought to help trump win the election by hacking private emails from democratic party officials and disseminating false information online  to help the white house deal with russia related investigations  trump is hiring veteran washington lawyer ty cobb  a source familiar with the matter said on friday  cobb s role is separate from trump s outside legal team  led by new york lawyer marc kasowitz   akhmetshin has been accused in federal and state courts in the united states of engaging in hacking conspiracies  although the allegations were later withdrawn  according to court records   in   lawyers for the russian mining company international mineral resources claimed in the u s  district court of the district of columbia that akhmetshin helped organize the hack  theft and dissemination of private documents  that case was dropped  the same company filed a lawsuit against akhmetshin in the new york supreme court but withdrew it last year   u s  senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley described akhmetshin in a letter to the justice department in march as  a former member of the russian military intelligence services  gru   who was working to overturn the   magnitsky act  of congress  which blacklists russians for human rights abuses  the kremlin has often complained about the act      congressional records show that akhmetshin lobbied congress last year for the human rights accountability global initiative foundation  a washington based advocacy group that says it is working to lift laws that prevent u s  residents from adopting russian children  those laws were put in place by moscow in response to the magnitsky act  trump told reuters on wednesday that he did not know about his son s meeting last year until recently  but in a conversation with reporters later that day  trump said   in fact  maybe  the meeting  was mentioned at some point   adding that he was not told it was about clinton     trump jr  s lawyer  alan futerfas  said he had talked with a person who came to the meeting between russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya and trump aides         he told me specifically he was not working for the russian government  and in fact laughed when i asked him that question   futerfas told nbc news  it was not immediately clear if the person he referred to was akhmetshin  the lawyer said trump jr  knew nothing about the man s background at the time of the meeting  the russian lawyer in the meeting  veselnitskaya  has said she was not working for russian authorities  but she told the wall street journal in an interview on friday that she was meeting with russian authorities regularly  she said she shared information about a u s  born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the magnitsky act with the russian prosecutor general s office  including with prosecutor general yuri chaika  a top official appointed by the kremlin  the journal said
