 reuters    texas governor greg abbott has signed into law a more relaxed version of state voter identification requirements than a previously enacted measure struck down by u s  courts as racially discriminatory  the new measure was designed to remedy flaws the courts found in the original law by providing texans an alternative to the type of government issued photo id they had been required to present in order to vote at polling stations  voters will now be permitted to cast their ballots by furnishing some other documentation bearing their name and address  such as a bank statement or utility bill  if they also sign an affidavit attesting to having a  reasonable impediment  to obtaining a valid photo id  critics contend that the measure  passed by the republican controlled legislature last month and signed on thursday by abbott  a first term republican  is still aimed at discouraging racial and ethnic minorities  who tend to favor democrats  they particularly object to provisions carrying a prison sentence of up to  years for lying on a voter id affidavit  the list of valid photo ids accepted under both the previous law and the revised measure includes a driver s license  u s  military identification  u s  passport and concealed handgun permit  but not a student id card  texas ranks as the most populous republican dominated state  with the republican party winning every statewide race for elective office for more than  years  but shifting demographics have given hope to democrats that they can eventually turn the state to their column  the original voter id requirements were signed into law in  by then texas governor rick perry  a republican  considered one of the nation s strictest such measures  it has been subject to years of court challenges  with the law s opponents saying it could exclude up to   voters  supporters of such laws have countered they are necessary to protect the integrity of the election system  despite little evidence of actual voter fraud  the u s  supreme court declined in january to hear an appeal by texas seeking to revive the original law s requirements
