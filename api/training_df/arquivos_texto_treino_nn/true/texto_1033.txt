washington  reuters    president donald trump and the u s  house of representatives  top tax law writer reopened the door on wednesday to changes in the  k  retirement savings program  just days after trump seemed to rule out such a step under a broad republican tax overhaul project  trump told reporters he wants to protect the popular tax deferred savings program  but said it was possible it could be part of congressional negotiations over tax cuts   maybe we ll use it as negotiating  but trust me     there are certain kinds of deals you don t want to negotiate with   trump said on the white house south lawn as he prepared to depart on a trip to dallas  on capitol hill  representative kevin brady  the republican chairman of the tax writing house ways and means committee  said trump and lawmakers were discussing how to handle  k  plans  the employer administered plans have been used for four decades by millions of workers to save for retirement   no decision s yet been made on if there will be any changes   brady told reporters   we re simply considering ideas to help people save more and save early in life   if we can reach consensus on that  including with the president  in a good way  we ll move forward    but if not  we will keep things as they are   brady said   all the focus is on can we help people save more   currently  employees may contribute up to    a year to the tax deferred accounts  with those  and older able to contribute up to     savings are typically invested in mutual funds  brady was expected to introduce tax overhaul legislation next week  as trump has long promised  republican leaders want congress to approve the measure by the end of this year  it includes a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate  but many details are still being worked out  including how to offset revenue that would be lost to tax cuts  one way to do that might be to limit pre tax  k  contributions  which would help the government realize more revenue in the near term but would result in a decline in revenue generation down the road   earlier this week  after the wall street journal and the new york times reported that republicans were considering capping annual contributions at     trump wrote on twitter   there will be no change to your  k    tampering with  k  plans  which have largely replaced defined benefit pensions in the united states  would risk alienating tens of millions of workers  as well as the mutual fund operators which rely on the plans for much of their business  many companies match a percentage of their employees   k  contributions  changes to the tax deferred savings program could also provide ammunition to democrats  who have painted trump s plan  with its   trillion in tax cuts  as a gift to the rich and corporate america that would balloon the federal deficit
