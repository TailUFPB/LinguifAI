washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans on tuesday linked repealing a key component of obamacare to their ambitious tax cut plan  raising new political risks and uncertainties for the tax measure that financial markets have been monitoring closely for months  in comments that infuriated democrats and left some senior republicans unsure what comes next  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters   we re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful and that s obviously the view of the senate finance committee republicans as well   the finance panel  which had been in session for two days  abruptly adjourned on tuesday as democrats slammed the republicans  handling of their tax proposals  for which formal legislative language has still not been unveiled  ron wyden  the committee s top democrat  demanded more time for democrats to discuss the issue  because we were never told that healthcare was going to be part of it and this just flew in literally out of nowhere in the last  minutes   tying obamacare to the tax program introduces new risks for the republicans and for president donald trump  together  they have yet to score a major legislative win since trump took power in january  even with control of congress and the white house  the president  who has struggled in his relations with congress  suggested in a tweet on monday that the mandate repeal should be added to the tax plan  following up on a similar nov   tweet  no final decision on such a move was made at the senate republicans  weekly luncheon  senator susan collins told reporters afterward  she played a key role in july s collapse of a years long push by fellow republicans to gut obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law  formally known as the affordable care act   i personally think that it complicates tax reform to put the repeal of the individual mandate in there   collins said  asked if she would back the tax bill if a mandate repeal were added  she said   i m going to wait and see   senator john mccain  who was also central to his party s failed obamacare repeal earlier this year  was non committal on putting the mandate repeal in the tax plan  saying   i want to see the whole bill before i decide   the senate and house of representatives are developing separate tax cut packages they plan to reconcile eventually and send to trump s desk for enactment into law  an outcome republicans are eager to achieve so they can face u s  voters next year with at least one major legislative achievement  house speaker paul ryan  asked why the repeal of the obamacare mandate was not in the house version of the tax proposal  told fox news on tuesday   we didn t want to complicate tax reform  make it harder than it otherwise would be   the house had already agreed to eliminate the mandate in a healthcare bill it passed in may  he noted  adding   we want to see the senate go first and see if they can get that done and then we ll discuss whether or not it s included at the end   the trump administration strongly supports the house version of the tax legislation  saying its passage would be  an important first step in achieving comprehensive tax reform   the white house said in a statement on tuesday       u s  financial markets have been watching closely  with u s  stocks rallying in recent months  partly on hopes of business tax cuts  they showed little reaction to tuesday s developments  the individual mandate requires americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to washington  a provision that republicans have long opposed as government overreach  but the mandate plays a critical role in obamacare by requiring young  healthy people  who might otherwise go without coverage  to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older americans  underscoring the devastating consequences for obamacare if the mandate were repealed  the nonpartisan congressional budget office said last week that such a change would increase the number of americans without health insurance by  million by   the cbo added that  mandate repeal would raise the average insurance policy premiums in the obamacare marketplaces by about  percent annually over the next decade  repealing the mandate would also lower the federal deficit by   billion over the same time period  the cbo said  a finding that several republican senators said influenced the move  eliminating the individual mandate would lower the number of americans with health insurance  meaning the federal government would spend less on subsidizing coverage for lower  and middle income people  making that money available to pay for tax cuts  neither the senate nor the house tax plans now includes repealing the mandate  but both plan would add about    trillion over  years to the federal deficit and the national debt  which now exceeds   trillion  congressional republicans hope to pass tax legislation by the end of the year and are moving fast  despite uncertainties  they hold only a razor thin   majority in the senate  if democrats remain united in opposition  republicans could afford to lose no more than two senators from within their own ranks and still secure passage of tax legislation  democrats have dismissed the republican plans as deficit expanding giveaways to corporations and the wealthy  representative lloyd doggett  a senior member of the house tax committee  said in a statement that the house tax bill was  just a way to curry favor with washington special interests   awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations and the fortunate few that sit way atop the economic ladder
