washington  reuters    former cia director james woolsey pitched a   million contract to two turkish businessmen to help discredit a controversial u s  based cleric while woolsey was an adviser to donald trump s election campaign  three people familiar with the proposal said      just eight days after formally joining trump s campaign as an adviser on national security issues  woolsey met on sept     with businessmen ekim alptekin and sezgin baran korkmaz over lunch at the peninsula hotel in new york  they said       woolsey and his wife  nancye miller  proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting fethullah gulen  a turkish cleric who lives in pennsylvania      turkish president recep tayyip erdogan accuses gulen of instigating a failed coup in july  and wants him extradited to turkey to face trial  gulen has denied any role in the coup      in an email memo seen by reuters  woolsey and miller sketched a plan to  draw attention to the cleric s possible role in the coup attempt  and encourage an official investigation into his activities      alptekin  an ally of erdogan  had already agreed through one of his companies to a    contract with the consulting firm of michael flynn to research gulen  flynn was also a trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in february        woolsey was a member of flynn s firm  the flynn intel group  according to a justice department filing by the firm and an archive of the company s website  although a spokesman for woolsey disputed that characterization  saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was  loosely defined        at the sept   meeting  miller said she and woolsey were in a better position than flynn to influence decision makers about gulen s alleged role in the coup  according to alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion      bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal  and woolsey and miller did not win the contract in any event      but the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with alptekin  the deal with flynn is now being investigated by special counsel robert mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the trump campaign colluded with russians who tried to interfere in the  u s  presidential election    peter carr  a spokesman for mueller  declined to comment      jonathan franks  a spokesman for woolsey and miller  said his clients were not under investigation  flynn is a central figure in mueller s investigation because of conversations he had with then russian ambassador sergei kislyak last year and because he waited until march to retroactively register with the justice department as a foreign agent for the work he did for alptekin  in that filing  flynn s lawyer  robert kelner  said the work done for alptekin s company  could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of turkey         flynn was fired as national security adviser in february after misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations with kislyak      franks described the sept   meeting as  unremarkable  and said miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it      he also said woolsey had pursued with turkish interests an  economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that turkey was a safe place to do business  but that the project s focus was not on gulen       alptekin said woolsey and miller pursued his business at the sept   meeting  pitching the project to target gulen  but he decided to stick to his contract with flynn s firm       kelner declined to comment for this story      the white house did not respond to a request for comment  the disclosure in march of flynn s contract to discredit gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with flynn  including woolsey       shortly after  woolsey alleged in media interviews that flynn and others had  at a sept     meeting in new york  discussed with turkey s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting gulen out of the united states and to turkey       flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan  alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said woolsey s claim was  all the more astounding  because he had sought alptekin s business at a meeting the following day       his story is fiction   alptekin told reuters      franks said woolsey stands by his account of the meeting      woolsey first proposed the   million project to korkmaz  the second turkish businessman  at a meeting in california in august   the proposal was outlined in an email sent from miller to woolsey on aug    printed out and shown by woolsey to korkmaz  who then forwarded it on to alptekin   korkmaz  who had known woolsey for some years  invited woolsey to the meeting  according to two people familiar with the meeting  korkmaz told woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to gulen       korkmaz and alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a u s turkey trade group  according to two people with knowledge of their relationship  anil leylek  a spokeswoman for korkmaz s company  declined to comment      franks confirmed the august meeting but described it as  brief  and  not a pitch       woolsey and miller s proposal included getting washington insiders like then senator jeff sessions  who is now trump s attorney general  to co author articles on the situation in turkey  engaging with influential lawmakers such as republican senator bob corker  and getting woolsey on fox news and cnn  the memo said        the cost of this engagement will be       it said      woolsey  who led the cia for two years under former president bill clinton  joined the trump campaign in september  he was on the transition team after trump s election victory in november but he stepped down in january      franks said woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign  had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for turkish interests  and was now being smeared       with growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon  it s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room   franks added
