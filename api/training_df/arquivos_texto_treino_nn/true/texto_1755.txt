washington  reuters    two democratic senators said on wednesday they may hold up the confirmation of president donald trump s environmental protection agency nominee susan bodine until she explains her advisory role at the agency  which may violate federal law  senators sheldon whitehouse of rhode island and jeff merkley of oregon sent a list of questions to bodine  trump s pick to head up the epa s office of enforcement and compliance assistance  about her current role as special counsel to epa administrator scott pruitt while she waits out the confirmation process  whitehouse and merkley said by advising pruitt on enforcement matters before being confirmed by the senate  bodine may be violating the federal vacancies reform act that prohibits nominees from assuming the authorities of the office before being confirmed by congress   your appointment creates the appearance  and perhaps the effect  of circumventing the senate s constitutional advice and consent responsibility for the position to which you have been nominated   the senators wrote    this means that subjects of epa enforcement actions could potentially challenge the validity of these actions in court if her role in these decisions is deemed  improper   they said   pruitt is the only epa appointee to have been confirmed since trump took office in january  bodine is still awaiting a full senate vote after her senate confirmation hearing in july  while four other assistant administrator nominees are set for confirmation hearings on sept    democratic lawmakers have been at odds with pruitt since his narrow margin confirmation in february over his close ties to industry  his doubts about human caused climate change  planned drastic cuts of the epa s budget and workforce and ethics requirements for political appointees  the senators also asked bodine if she was involved in a recent epa decision to enforce an obama era rule to regulate methane leaks from new oil and gas infrastructure on a  case by case  basis rather than fully enforcing it  republican senator john barrasso of wyoming  chair of the senate environment committee  said bodine should get her full senate vote immediately   it is a shame that the critical post of the assistant administrator charged with leading enforcement at the epa remains unfilled   barrasso said through a spokesman   the epa was not immediately available for comment
