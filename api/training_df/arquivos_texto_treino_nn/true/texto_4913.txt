washington  reuters    it s not unusual for a newly minted white house to present what s known as a  skinny budget   a wish list of spending requests for congress and some basic economic projections  however  president donald trump s first crack at the budget  released on thursday  took  skinny  to a new  anemic level as he laid out his plans for boosting military spending  and cutting foreign aid and an array of domestic programs  spreadsheets are out  bullet points are in  weighing in at a mere  pages  and containing just four slender tables  trump s budget had little meat on its bones for experts hungry to dive into the details of the new administration s fiscal policy  that may make it the skinniest skinny budget  by far  compared with the  years of presidential budgets in transition years tracked by the congressional research service  crs   when president jimmy carter took office  his first budget document was  pages  the crs said  president george h w  bush s first take was  pages  and president george w  bush s was around the same length  at  pages  president bill clinton s first budget document was  pages  while president barack obama s initial take was a leaner  pages  the difference is in focus  trump s budget looks only at  discretionary  programs for the year ahead  accounting for only about a third of the overall budget  it makes no assumptions about  mandatory  spending on programs like social security or medicare  says nothing about spending beyond fiscal   and gives no projections about how promised tax cuts and infrastructure spending might affect the nation s bottom line   this is a budget blueprint  not a complete budget   said trump s budget director mick mulvaney  ahead of its release  promising a full buffet of data  forecasts  and details in the full budget in mid may  to be sure  budget experts were not expecting a hefty document  the trump administration had hinted it would be on the thin side of skinny   it could be emaciated   robert bixby  executive director of the concord coalition  a non partisan budget reform advocacy group  said in an interview on tuesday   at some point  you ve got to put your cards on the table  and show some numbers   bixby said  maya macguineas  head of the committee for a responsible federal budget  said there were too few details to fully understand the larger choices ahead   it is impossible to see the big picture when you only have a few pieces of the puzzle   kenneth baer  a former associate director in obama s office of management and budget  said an overly skinny budget would make it hard to interpret how the trump administration would spend taxpayers  money    it s sort of like building a house  but only putting up the front door   baer said   click here for a graphic on  winners and losers in trump s budget
