washington  reuters    president donald trump has neither a clear white house tax plan nor adequate staff yet to see through a planned tax reform  according to interviews with people in the administration  in congress and among u s  tax experts  in an echo of its attempt to roll back obamacare that ended in an embarrassing collapse in congress  the trump administration has vowed quick action on taxes  but it has yet to appoint people with the skills to evaluate complex tax laws  draft legislation and sell it to deeply divided lawmakers  burned by last week s failed healthcare measure largely authored by house of representatives republicans  trump is determined not to count on congress so much this time for handling the details on taxes  his second major legislative initiative  but that only underscores his need for a strong white house tax team  which the administration still lacks  many policy options are still being studied  from deficit funded tax cuts to a european style value added tax   they re still sorting out who s in charge  who s going to take the lead   said william hoagland  a longtime senate republican aide who worked on the last successful comprehensive tax reform effort in    you need someone who has the ear and support of the president who can sell a tax plan  and you need the technical support for that person   said hoagland  now senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center  a think tank  financial markets have been reassessing expectations of fast action on taxes that have helped fuel a trump stocks rally  members of trump s tax team are known  but not their exact duties  treasury secretary steven mnuchin and national economic council director gary cohn are senior team leaders  others include white house advisers steve bannon  jared kushner  chief of staff reince priebus and commerce secretary wilbur ross  trump huddled with mnuchin on thursday to discuss taxes   we are at the first stages of this process  beginning to engage with members of congress  policy groups  business leaders  industry  constituents from around the country  and other stakeholders   white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on thursday  trump s  day in office  when trump was elected in november  republican lawmakers enthusiastically joined his call to rewrite the tax code and dismantle obamacare in the first  days of his presidency  in early february  trump promised a  phenomenal  tax plan by early march that never appeared  mnuchin spoke on feb   of enacting tax reform by august  spicer acknowledged this week that the timetable could be slipping      another senior white house official said the administration had assumed it would still be working on healthcare at this point  not tax reform yet  the official  not authorized to speak publicly  spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity  so far  trump s tax campaign is a far cry from president ronald reagan s  effort  in which don regan  as treasury secretary and then white house chief of staff  spent many months developing legislation that won bipartisan support in congress   the process under reagan was much more developed  elaborate and long  and there was a strong bench of top rate technicians putting things together   said steven rosenthal  senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center  a think tank    under trump  he said   none of that is happening   during the  election campaign  trump issued a tax plan that partly resembled one developed by house speaker paul ryan  but trump does not now appear wedded to either  it is a safe bet he will not lean heavily on the plan from ryan  who drafted and championed the ill fated plan to gut obamacare   trump now desperately needs a policy victory     i would expect the president to play a much more activist role   said stephen moore  a fellow at the heritage foundation  a think tank  moore helped write the trump campaign tax plan  mnuchin last week talked about a middle class tax cut  he also said tax reform in many ways would be  a lot simpler  than healthcare  dismaying tax experts who said that is not so  comprehensive tax reform is so complex that it has defied congresses and presidents since reagan  tax law is riddled with loopholes embedded in the economy and defended by beneficiaries  some fundamental questions remain unanswered within the trump team  for instance  it is unclear if trump would support a plan that adds to the budget deficit  past tax reform efforts have tried to be  revenue neutral   trump also has sent mixed messages on ryan s proposed  border adjustment tax  that would end the corporate deduction for import costs and make export income tax free  aiming to boost exports and raise new tax revenues  the trump team is heavy on wall street experience  but short on tax expertise  at treasury  mnuchin is the only senate confirmed political appointee in place  the job of treasury assistant secretary for tax policy is unfilled  a person familiar with the hiring process for the job said   treasury needs more capable tax expertise asap  or the white house will yank total control for tax reform from the department for the rest of the year  maybe beyond     mark mazur  who held the treasury tax job under former democratic president barack obama  said mnuchin has too much on his plate to concentrate fully on taxes  mnuchin has praised treasury s  tax policy career staff  but they can only offer options to trump appointees  said mazur  now director of the nonpartisan tax policy center   the political appointees are the ones who need to turn the crank on the sausage making machine   mazur said
