washington  reuters    president donald trump repeatedly says his proposed tax cut would be the biggest in u s  history  but it will not even come close to the record  trump would be on target if he were talking only about corporate taxes  but he has included other taxes in his boast  the president and his fellow republicans in congress propose cutting the top corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  if they succeed  it would be the largest american corporate tax cut since the modern corporate tax began more than a century ago  as proposed by the republicans  the corporate rate would fall  percent  compared with the second largest such cut of  percent under republican president ronald reagan in the    but on individual taxes  trump s claim does not hold up  according to data on top personal income tax rates collected by the tax foundation  a washington think tank   for a graphic tracking u s  tax rates  see  tmsnrt rs   some republicans in congress are backing away from cutting the top individual tax rate  now   percent  but even if they did cut it as low as trump wants  to  percent  the president would not even come close to winning bragging rights     the reagan cuts lowered the top rate to  percent from  percent  that was an impressive  percent drop  but the huge tax cuts of president warren harding and president calvin coolidge  both republicans  take the prize  in   the top tax rate was  percent  by   it was only  percent  almost a  percent decline  coolidge alone was responsible for a  percent cut in taxes  under president john kennedy and president lyndon johnson  both democrats  the tax cuts of  and  cut the top rate to  percent from  percent  a decline of  percent  still  there are other ways to measure the size of a tax cut besides the rates themselves  one approach would measure how much tax revenue the federal government does not get and  taxpayers get to keep  that is the  cost  of a tax cut  but that number is disputed between those who favor tax cuts and those who do not  the trump administration argues its tax cuts will ignite the economy and tax revenue will increase  not decrease  that way  the cuts  pay for themselves   they say   the committee for a responsible federal budget  a bipartisan washington think tank  estimated the trump tax cut could be the fourth largest as a percentage of gross domestic product  or gdp  a measure of national economic output  the think tank favors that measure because it eliminates the effects of inflation  economic growth and the size of total federal revenue  by that measure  it agreed with a number of economists who said the reagan cuts were the largest in history  even larger than coolidge s    as for bragging rights to the all time biggest tax hike  the winner is democratic president woodrow wilson  during world war one  he increased the top individual rate to  percent from  percent and the corporate rate to  percent from  percent
