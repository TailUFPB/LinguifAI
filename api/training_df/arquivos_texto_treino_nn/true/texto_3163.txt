washington  reuters    president donald trump on friday will announce a plan to tighten rules on americans traveling to cuba and significantly restrict u s  companies from doing business with cuban enterprises controlled by the military  senior white house officials said on thursday  trump will lay out his new cuba policy in a speech in miami that will roll back parts of former president barack obama s opening to the communist ruled island after a  diplomatic breakthrough between the two former cold war foes  taking a tougher approach against havana after promising to do so during the presidential campaign  trump will outline stricter enforcement of an existing ban on americans going to cuba as tourists and will seek to prevent u s  dollars from being used to fund what the new u s  administration sees as a repressive military dominated government  the new policy will ban most u s  business deals with the armed forces business enterprises group  gaesa   a sprawling conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy  but make exceptions related to air and sea travel  the officials said  this will essentially shield u s  airlines and cruise lines now serving the island  but even as he curbs obama s d√©tente with cuba  trump will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off diplomatic relations restored in  after more than five decades of hostility  u s  officials said  he will also leave in place some other tangible measures implemented by his democratic predecessor  including the resumption of direct u s  cuba commercial flights  though trump s more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall  and  according to one white house official  the administration does not intend to  disrupt  existing business deals such as one struck under obama by starwood hotels  which is owned by marriott international inc  to manage a historic havana hotel  there are also no plans to reinstate the limits that obama lifted on the amount of the island s coveted rum and cigars that american can bring home for personal use  one white house official said  as a result  the changes   though far reaching   appear to be less sweeping than many pro engagement advocates had feared  trump will justify his partial reversal of obama s measures to a large extent on human rights grounds  his aides contend that obama s easing of u s  restrictions has done nothing to advance political freedoms in cuba  while benefiting the cuban government financially  saying that the aim was to repair what trump has called a  bad deal  struck by obama with havana  one u s  official said the new administration would leave the door open to improved relations if cuba undertakes democratic reforms such as allowing free and fair elections and the release of political prisoners  international human rights groups say  however  that reinstating a u s  policy of isolating the island could make the situation worse by empowering cuban hardliners  the cuban government has made clear it will not be pressured into political reforms in exchange for diplomatic engagement  at home  trump s critics have questioned why his administration is now singling out cuba for its human rights record while insisting that in other parts of the world it will not lecture other countries on the issue  trump will issue a presidential memorandum when he delivers his speech at the manuel artime theater in miami s little havana district  the heart of america s cuban american and cuban exile community  the venue is named after a leader of the failed u s  backed bay of pigs invasion of cuba in  against fidel castro s revolutionary government  republican senator marco rubio  who was played a key role in pushing for trump s changes  was expected to attend along with u s  representative mario diaz balart and other cuban american lawmakers  under trump s order  the treasury and commerce departments will be given  days to begin writing new regulations and they will not take effect until they are complete  under the revised travel policy  u s  officials say there will be tighter enforcement to make sure americans legally fit the  authorized categories they claim to be traveling under  which could spook many visitors  wary of receiving a hefty fine  while tourism to cuba is banned by u s  law  the obama administration had been allowing people to travel to cuba as part of  people to people  educational trips for visitors  a classification that a white house official said was  ripe for abuse  by those looking for beach vacations  trump s new policy will eliminate such visits by individuals while still allowing them to be done as group tours  and also retaining individual travel under other authorized categories such as religious  artistic and journalistic activities  the official said  but trump s planned rollback of obama s policy has drawn opposition from american businesses and the travel industry  which have begun making inroads on the island  as well as many lawmakers  including some of trump s fellow republicans  the new policy has come together after contentious meetings within the administration  some aides have argued that trump  a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash u s  business and create jobs  would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the cuban market  but other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to cuban americans whose support they considered significant in winning florida in the  election  miami is home to the largest cuban american community
