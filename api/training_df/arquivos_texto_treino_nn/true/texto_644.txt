washington  reuters    a u s  senate committee on tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president s authority to launch a nuclear strike  amid concern that tensions over north korea s weapons program could lead to war  senator bob corker  republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  held the hearing as president donald trump wrapped up a  day trip to asia largely dominated by concerns about pyongyang s nuclear ambitions  corker acknowledged that senators  including democrats and trump s fellow republicans  have raised questions about trump s authority to wage war  use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements  trump has traded insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un and used expressions like  fire and fury  to hint that any use of lethal force against north korea would be overwhelming  on sunday  he again insulted kim by calling him  short and fat   corker himself warned last month that trump might be putting the united states  on the path to world war three   but on tuesday corker said the hearing was not intended to target trump   this is not specific to anybody   he said  democrats made clear they were concerned about trump   we are concerned that the president of the united states is so unstable  is so volatile  has a decision making process that is so quixotic  that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with u s  national security interests   senator chris murphy said  during the hearing  retired general robert kehler  former commander of u s  strategic command  said the military can refuse to follow what it considers an illegal order  even a nuclear one  but it was not clear after questions from committee members how that process would work  some senators want legislation to alter the president s nuclear authority  corker said he did not now support that idea   i do not see a legislative solution today  but that doesn t mean that over the course of the next several months one might develop   he told reporters after the hearing  some senators seemed to bristle about the hearing s tone  warning against comments depicting trump as unable to strongly retaliate for any attack   every single word that has been uttered this morning at this hearing is going to be analyzed in pyongyang   said republican senator jim risch  who is in line to become chairman after corker retires next year
