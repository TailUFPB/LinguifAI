washington  reuters    aides to u s  president donald trump on sunday attacked the credibility of the nonpartisan agency that will analyze the costs of a replacement for obamacare  as the white house sought to quell opposition from many conservative republicans  the congressional budget office  which provides official estimates of the budget impact of proposed legislation  is expected to issue a report as soon as monday that will assess the healthcare legislation put forward by republican house of representatives leaders  the report could influence sentiment toward a bill already under fire from democrats and some republicans  especially if it suggests the legislation would reduce the number of americans with health coverage or worsen u s  budget deficits  republicans have long opposed obamacare  formally called the affordable care act  on the grounds it was government overreach and led to higher insurance premiums  the  law  democratic president barack obama s signature legislation  provided  million previously uninsured americans with health coverage  trump has called obamacare a  disaster  and made its repeal and replacement a key campaign pledge  several republican lawmakers said on sunday the replacement bill was unacceptable in its current form  including  conservative senator tom cotton of arkansas  who said the plan could not pass the senate and could put the republican house majority at risk in  congressional elections   i believe it would have adverse consequences for millions of americans and it wouldn t deliver on our promises to reduce the cost of health insurance for americans   cotton said  in a series of television interviews  white house budget director mick mulvaney and top white house economic adviser    gary cohn said the cbo was focusing on the wrong metrics with the estimates it will provide on the number of people who are insured  cohn and mulvaney said the cbo should instead should analyze whether patients can actually afford to go to a doctor   i love the folks at the cbo  they work really hard  they do  but sometimes we ask them to do stuff they re not capable of doing  and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isn t the   isn t the best use of their time   mulvaney told abc s  this week  program  speaking on fox news  gary cohn  director of the white house national economic council  said   we will see what the score is  in fact in the past  the cbo score has really been meaningless     they ve said that many more people will be insured than are actually insured  but when we get the cbo score  we ll deal with that   cohn said  the trump administration s criticisms of the cbo are unusual  prior administrations  both republican and democratic  steered clear of attacking the credibility of the agency  which many lawmakers regard as a neutral arbiter  the cbo s current director  keith hall  was appointed by republicans in   the credit rating agency standard   poor s has estimated  million to  million people could lose health insurance coverage under the republican plan  senator bernie sanders  who ran for president in  as a democrat  said it was  cowardly  for republicans to proceed with a healthcare bill without cbo estimates  telling cbs  face the nation show   this is a disgrace   in recent weeks  trump administration officials and republican lawmakers have criticized what they said were overly optimistic estimates from the cbo of the number of americans who would sign up for health insurance on government run exchanges  the cbo estimated in  that  million people would be purchasing insurance through the exchanges in   only   million were signed up for those plans by the middle of last year  according to department of health and human services data  the house republican legislation would scrap tax penalties for americans without health insurance  roll back an expansion of medicaid insurance for the poor  and replace obamacare s income based subsidies with a system of fixed tax credits to help people buy private insurance on the open market  cohn also disputed the notion that millions of people on  medicaid would become uninsured as obamacare s expansion of the program is rolled back over a period of years  he said many of these people would be transitioned into new private and employer sponsored plans that would become more affordable under the republican plan  house speaker paul ryan  the republican plan s top backer in congress  said he was  certain  the cbo would show a reduction in the number of americans with coverage   you know why  because this isn t a government mandate   ryan told nbc s meet the press  conservative republicans said  however  they could not support the plan without significant changes  republican representative jim jordan of ohio  a founder of the conservative house freedom caucus  said it did not go far enough to meet republicans  promise to kill obamacare   we told them we were going to replace it with something that would bring down the cost of insurance  that s what we told them   jordan told fox news sunday   this legislation that the speaker s brought forward doesn t do that
