 reuters    former president barack obama  back on the campaign trail on thursday for the first time since he left the white house  called on voters to reject a growing  politics of division  that he said was corroding american democracy  without mentioning republican president donald trump by name  obama told campaign rallies in new jersey and virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing democrats in nov   elections in the two states   what we can t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before  that dates back centuries   obama told a cheering crowd in newark  new jersey  that chanted   four more years    some of the politics we see now  we thought we put that to bed  that s folks looking  years back   obama said   it s the  century  not the  century   at a later stop in richmond  virginia  obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic american values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process   we ve got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry  to demonize people who have different ideas  to get the base all riled up because it provides a short term tactical advantage  sometimes that feels frustrating   obama said  many of obama s comments appeared to be thinly veiled swipes at trump  whose combative style and inflammatory rhetoric have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions  obama made the remarks just hours after former president george w  bush  a republican  also took an indirect swing at trump with a speech decrying  bullying and prejudice  while defending immigrants and trade   obama s appearances were aimed at driving up democratic turnout in new jersey and virginia  the only two states holding elections for governor this year  democrats hope obama can bring some of the young  minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the white house out to the polls in off year elections  the two contests will be closely watched to see if democrats can convert the grassroots resistance to trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections  the governor s races  and a special election in december for a u s  senate seat in alabama  could offer clues to the national political mood ahead of next year s congressional elections  when all  seats in the house of representatives and  of the senate s  seats will be up for grabs  republicans currently control both chambers  since leaving the white house in january  obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as trump and republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies  while he has rarely spoken out about politics in the past nine months  obama said it was critical that supporters get their friends and families to vote  in newark  he said no one should assume victory just because opinion polls show phil murphy  a former investment banker and u s  ambassador to germany  has a comfortable lead on republican opponent kim guadagno  the state s lieutenant governor   i don t know if you all noticed that  but you can t take any election for granted   he said in a reference to democrat hillary clinton s surprise loss last year in the presidential race  in the political battleground of virginia  polls show a close contest between democrat ralph northam  the state s lieutenant governor  and republican ed gillespie  a former republican national committee chairman who has been endorsed by trump  obama carried virginia in both  and   and democrat hillary clinton won the state over trump by  percentage points in
