washington  reuters    two u s  senators on thursday urged federal authorities to halt the planned expansion of a   billion airport facial scanning program  saying the technology used to identify travelers on some flights departing from nine u s  airports for international destinations may not be not accurate enough and raises privacy concerns  congress has approved the use of the program for non u s  citizens  but never expressly authorized its use for americans  the department of homeland security has said the system is needed to prevent travelers from leaving the country using someone else s identity and to prevent visitors to the united states from overstaying their visas  senators mike lee  a republican  and edward markey  a democrat  in a letter to department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen  raised concerns that too many travelers would be inconvenienced by faulty scan results and questioned why americans are being subjected to the screens  known as biometric exit detection technology   in the letter  they raised objections to expanding the program beyond the nine airports where it is already in use   we request that dhs stop the expansion of this program and provide congress with its explicit statutory authority to use and expand a biometric exit program on u s  citizens   the senators wrote   if there is no specific authorization  then we request an explanation for why dhs believes it has the authority to proceed  they cited a report released thursday by georgetown university law school s center on privacy   technology that found dhs is conducting the scans  without basic legal and technical safeguards   or any meaningful justification of its billion dollar cost   congress in  authorized spending up to   billion over  years on the facial scans  the u s  customs and border protection  cbp   on its website  says the program collects  facial images from all travelers from the united states  on a flight and uses the images to verify identities  it says the images are stored for no more than two weeks and says that  cbp is dedicated to protecting the privacy of all travelers   the government said thursday that u s  citizens may opt out of the facial screening and instead have a separate review of their id documents  a u s  customs and border protection spokeswoman said the government is working to establish the biometric exit program  in a way that s most efficient and secure for the traveler and that is least disruptive for the travel industry   airports using the system include boston  las vegas  miami  new york s john f  kennedy  washington dulles  both houston airports  chicago o hare and atlanta  the senators want dhs to provide data that the program will not unduly burden travelers  dhs said previously its goal is a  percent  true accept rate   meaning the technology can positively identify  percent of the faces it scans  the senators  however  said this meant  there would still be a false denial for one in  travelers  further there is evidence that certain face scans exhibit different error rate depending on the race or gender of the person being scanned   dhs has said travelers who cannot be verified are escorted to another area where customs and border patrol uses other methods to verify their identity  the georgetown law report also noted that dhs has not established any rules governing the program    it s as if dhs has hired a billion dollar bouncer to check ids but never checked how good he is at spotting a fake   said laura moy  deputy director of the center and co author of the report   they also don t know if he s biased against certain groups of people   the senators said dhs also needed safeguards to ensure facial data is not shared with other u s  agencies
