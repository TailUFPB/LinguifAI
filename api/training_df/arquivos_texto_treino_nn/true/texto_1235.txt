washington  reuters    for the moment  u s  president donald trump is going it alone  after weeks of seeing his agenda imperiled by republican divisions and infighting among his aides  trump has been a whirl of activity this week  reasserting his campaign priorities and trying to deliver wins for his fervent but frustrated base of supporters  trump took steps to dramatically undercut the obamacare health system  sent notice he was willing to scuttle the nuclear deal with iran  moved to roll back coal plant limits  and again demanded a wall along the mexican border    and on social media the republican president appeared to relish his feuds with the news media  senior republicans in congress  and national football league players who have protested during the national anthem  in a sense  it was the vintage  freewheeling trump  throwing red meat to his voter base  following his gut  and haranguing his critics  but by the end of the week  he had made more progress in undoing the policy accomplishments of his democratic predecessor  barack obama  than he had in some time    trump knows he has to make good on several of his campaign promises   said ford o connell  a republican strategist   the clock is ticking  congress is useless and portions of his base are growing frustrated   at the same time  there is still chaos and uncertainty in the white house  so much so much so that trump s chief of staff  john kelly  took the unusual step of telling reporters that he was not resigning  meanwhile  the job status of his secretary of state  rex tillerson  appears to remain tenuous   the timing of some of trump s measures this week was driven by external deadlines  especially in the case of the iran deal  and his administration has also been occupied by a spate of deadly hurricanes and the shooting spree in las vegas  which have hampered its ability to move forward on its policy agenda   but trump this week was also sending a clear message  that he plans on doing as much as he can without waiting for congress to act    the president campaigned on a bold agenda  and congress s inaction won t stop the administration s tireless efforts to boost the economy  improve healthcare  and protect the american people   said raj shah  the white house s principal deputy press secretary   when he sat in the oval office  obama defiantly declared that he would circumvent a hostile congress by using a  pen and a phone   issuing executive orders where possible   and when trump ran for president last year  he frequently said that only he  alone  could fix the nation s problems   but once he took office  trump attempted to follow the lead of republicans on capitol hill  and he watched with dismay how little movement was made on priorities such as healthcare  immigration  and national security  trump  too  remains bothered by another time he deferred to congressional republicans and supported incumbent senator luther strange in a divisive primary fight last month in alabama   strange lost to roy moore  an archconservative backed by trump s former adviser  steve bannon  with many of trump s core supporters voting for moore    the loss came after trump alarmed some conservatives by saying he could cut deals with democratic congressional leaders chuck schumer and nancy pelosi to advance his agenda  particularly on providing relief from deportation for  dreamers    immigrants brought to the country illegally as children  that led to speculation that he was going to chart a more centrist course  but there was little of that talk this week after the white house released a series of hard line immigration proposals that stand to threaten any bipartisan deal  pelosi called the proposals  trash   trump  too  rejected the advice of kelly  tillerson  defense secretary james mattis and other aides in decertifying the iran nuclear deal  according to two administration officials  intent on staying true to his fierce criticism of the deal during the campaign   sam nunberg  a former campaign aide to trump  said strange s loss served as a reminder to trump that he has to look after the interests of his political base    that was a big punch in the stomach   nunberg said  one that showed the president that  this is not a cult of personality  it s about deliverables   those deliverables are the fulfillment of the campaign promises that bannon once featured on a whiteboard in his white house office  said nunberg  who added that bannon s shadow  still hovers over the west wing   bannon has pledged to support primary challengers to republican senate incumbents in several states next year in a bid to unseat senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  whom he blames for impeding trump s policy agenda  a reuters ipsos poll released this week showed trump s approval slipping among the rural voters he so successfully courted in last year s election  in september   percent of people in rural areas approved of trump while  percent disapproved  the poll found  that was down from trump s first four weeks in office  when  percent said they approved of the president while  percent disapproved  the poll found that trump has lost support in rural areas among men  whites and people who never went to college  he lost support with rural republicans and rural voters who supported him on election day
