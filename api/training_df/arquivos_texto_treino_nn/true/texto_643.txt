washington  reuters    u s  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell led a chorus of establishment republicans on monday urging roy moore  the party s senate candidate in alabama  to quit the race as a fifth woman came forward with allegations moore had sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago  beverly young nelson said moore sexually assaulted her when she was  and he was a prosecuting attorney in his   at a new york news conference  the tearful nelson said moore groped her  tried to pull her shirt off and shove her head in his lap  then warned that  no one will believe you  if she told anyone   i was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop   said nelson  a waitress at an alabama restaurant where moore often ate when the incident occurred   i had tears running down my face   moore  a christian conservative and former chief justice of the alabama supreme court  has refused to withdraw from the race  his campaign released a statement denying  any sexual misconduct with anyone  and saying the new allegations were part of a  witch hunt   at a news conference in gallant  alabama on monday night  moore told reporters that nelson s accusations are  absolutely false   the birmingham news reported   i never did what she said i did   the newspaper quoted moore as saying   i don t even know the woman  i don t know anything about her   mcconnell told reporters in his home state of kentucky that party officials were considering whether a republican write in candidate could be found to challenge moore in the dec   special election   i think he should step aside   said mcconnell  who previously said moore should leave the race if the allegations were true   i believe the women   republican senators orrin hatch  susan collins  lindsey graham  todd young and cory gardner joined mcconnell in calling for moore to drop out   a move that could open the door for democrats to cut into republicans  narrow two seat senate majority  gardner  the head of the senate republican campaign arm  said moore was unfit to serve in the senate   if he refuses to withdraw and wins  the senate should vote to expel him  because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the united states senate   gardner said in a statement  senator john cornyn  the senate s no   republican  withdrew his endorsement but said alabama voters should make the final judgment on moore  another prominent conservative who had endorsed moore  senator ted cruz  said moore should either clearly refute the allegations or if they are true  drop out   i am not able to urge the people of alabama to support his candidacy so long as these allegations remain unrefuted   cruz told reporters in the capitol   moore    had been a heavy favorite to win the election against democrat doug jones  he has denied the allegations first raised in a washington post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers  including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a  year old girl when he was in his   he said on twitter that mcconnell was the person who should step down   he has failed conservatives and must be replaced   moore said  the state party and many other alabama republicans have not wavered in their support of moore  who scored a decisive republican primary victory in september over luther strange  strange  who drew the support of president donald trump in the primary  had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by jeff sessions when he became u s  attorney general earlier this year  the growing furor over moore sets up a confrontation between establishment republicans and moore s supporters in the party s populist movement led by former white house chief strategist steve bannon  a democratic win in alabama would be a blow to trump s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year s congressional elections  giving democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the senate  it is too late to remove moore s name from the ballot  but mcconnell told reporters he was  looking at  potential write in candidates who could mount a successful campaign  asked if strange might be a candidate again  he said   we ll see   but strange told reporters it was  highly unlikely  he would mount a write in campaign   now it s going to really be up to the people of our state to sort this out   he said  a special election victory had been a long shot for democrats in alabama  which has not elected a democratic senator in a quarter century  jones  a former federal prosecutor  was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls  moore  who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues  has survived controversy before  he was twice forced out of his position as chief justice  once for refusing to remove a ten commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the u s  supreme court decision legalizing same sex marriage  he threatened over the weekend to sue the post and said the allegations were a smear campaign by his political opponents  reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations  while making the new allegations  nelson showed reporters moore s signature in her high school yearbook  she said he had offered to give her a ride home one night  then pulled the car behind the restaurant and assaulted her   i was terrified   she said   i thought he was going to rape me   nelson said she told her sister about the attack two years afterward  and eventually told her mother and husband  she said she backed trump for president and was not coming forward because of politics but because she was inspired by the women who talked to the post
