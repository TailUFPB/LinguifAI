washington  reuters    two u s  senators on tuesday reached a bipartisan agreement to shore up obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies for health insurers that president donald trump planned to scrap  and the president indicated his support for the plan  the deal worked out by republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray would meet some democratic objectives  including reviving the subsidies for obamacare and restoring   million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans  in exchange  republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  the trump administration said last week it would stop paying billions of dollars to insurers to help lower income americans pay medical expenses  part of the republican president s effort to dismantle obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law  the subsidies to private insurers cost the government an estimated   billion this year and were forecast at   billion for   trump s move to scuttle them had raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets  trump hoped to make good on his campaign promise to dismantle the law when he took office in january  with republicans  who pledged for seven years to scrap it  controlling congress  but he has been frustrated with their failure to pass legislation to repeal and replace it  obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  extended health insurance coverage to  million americans  republicans say it is ineffective and a massive government intrusion in a key sector of the economy  the alexander murray plan could keep obamacare in place at least until the  presidential campaign starts heating up   this takes care of the next two years  after that  we can have a full fledged debate on where we go long term on healthcare   alexander said of the deal  it is unclear whether the agreement can make it through congress  chuck schumer  the top senate democrat  said it had  broad support  among senators in his party  but it was harder to gauge possible support among republicans   moderate republican senator susan collins  who helped sink earlier obamacare repeal legislation  voiced backing for the new plan  but conservative republicans may be less welcoming  senator bernie sanders  an independent who ran for the democratic presidential nomination in   threw his weight behind the effort  in an interview with reuters  sanders said alexander was a  well respected figure  known for bipartisanship and that the tennessee senator s reputation would help propel the legislation through the senate  the willingness of sanders  a liberal champion  to offer his support of a deal with republicans that could allow states to change some obamacare requirements provided a boost to the alexander murray effort   we are going to overturn what trump is trying to do   sanders said  schumer urged senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to bring the plan to a vote on the senate floor and urged the house of representatives to take it up then as quickly as possible so trump can sign it  trump still seeks long term solution trump  during comments at the white house  suggested he could get behind the alexander murray plan as a short term solution  in remarks later at the heritage foundation  a conservative think tank  trump commended the work by alexander and murray  but said   i continue to believe congress must find a solution to the obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies   trump said earlier he wanted lawmakers  once they completed a major tax reform effort  to again take up broader legislation that failed in the senate last month that would divvy up federal healthcare money as block grants to states  murray is the top democrat on the senate health  education  labor and pensions committee  and alexander is its chairman  she said the two were able to find common ground on the steps aimed at stabilizing the insurance markets created under obamacare and to  help protect families from premium spikes as a result of the sabotage we have seen from this administration   according to a document seen by reuters  the plan would make it easier for states to get waivers approved that would allow them to offer cheaper healthcare plans  including catastrophic health plans  which cover a limited set of benefits and are currently only available to those under   shares of u s  hospital operators  including tenet healthcare corp and hca healthcare inc  moved higher after news of the deal  tenet shares closed   percent higher  while hca rose   percent  shares of some u s  health insurers also extended their gains on the day  with anthem inc finishing up   percent and centene corp gaining   percent  analyst brian tanquilut of global investment banking firm jefferies  who focuses on hospital companies  said that if the deal is passed in congress  it should stabilize the obamacare insurance exchanges and improve their viability   hospitals will avoid a potential spike in bad debt and charity care next year   tanquilut said   this is obviously a good step  it s bipartisan and guaranteed for two years
