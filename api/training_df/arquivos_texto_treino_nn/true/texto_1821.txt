washington new york  reuters    jpmorgan chase   co  jpm n  chief executive jamie dimon is starting to look like corporate america s shadow president  the  year old banker has made more than a dozen trips to washington so far this year to press a broad agenda with a range of influential policymakers  people who attended the meetings or are familiar with his schedule said  dimon has already visited the nation s capital four times as much as he does in a typical year  his ramped up presence comes after taking the helm of the business roundtable  a lobbying group that represents ceos of large u s  companies  in december   we couldn t ask for a more engaged or more effective business roundtable chair   said joshua bolten  former chief of staff for president george w  bush  whom dimon installed as the organization s president and ceo  the frequency of his trips  and the wide range of policies he has been discussing  have started chatter among power brokers in washington and on wall street about how much energy dimon is devoting to issues beyond jpmorgan  at times  they said  dimon carries himself more like someone running the country than someone running a bank   if you re jamie dimon  you ve always had access   said tim pawlenty  ceo of the financial services roundtable  a wall street trade group   the difference is  now he wants it  he wants to play a role in policy more broadly than just representing his company   dimon has said in the past that the only big job he would want would be u s  president  but also said running for office would be impractical  associates told reuters he has abandoned the idea entirely  and only became more active in washington because he was worried about his bank  the economy and the future of the country  a jpmorgan spokesman declined to comment or make dimon available for an interview  reuters spoke to over a dozen people who have interacted with dimon in washington or were briefed on his meetings  most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss his activities  those who have met dimon recently include republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  democratic senators sherrod brown and mark warner  rep  patrick mchenry  who is a member of house republican leadership  national economic council director gary cohn and federal reserve chair janet yellen  he was around so much during the summer that washington regulars said it was no longer surprising to see dimon pop out of the capitol hill subway system or leave a lawmaker s office  he has joked with staff about getting a condominium in washington because of how often he travels there  one person said  although dimon s meetings typically center on topics like tax reform or financial rules  he is not shy about weighing in on issues ranging from immigration to education and criminal justice reform  those familiar with the discussions said  in meetings  he has been using an app he asked business roundtable staff to build  it allows member ceos to show how many voters in a district work for their companies  and how many facilities the companies have there  to persuade lawmakers that their priorities are aligned  during his interactions with lawmakers  dimon can be brash and expresses annoyance with congress s inability to advance legislation  people who attended the meetings said  sometimes he would show his lighter side  one day in july  dimon spotted his democratic senator richard durbin  an old foe who championed a rule that slashed debit card fees and which dimon has called  downright idiotic   durbin was withdrawing money from a non chase atm when dimon approached from behind and quipped   we welcome competition   a durbin representative confirmed the interaction  first described by a politico reporter in a tweet  took place but declined to elaborate  those who have followed dimon through his career are not surprised that the straight talking new york banker has become even more outspoken during donald trump s presidency  associates say he has been shocked by some of trump s actions  such as abandoning the paris climate accord  threats to tear up free trade deals  a call for a ban of transgender people from the military and ending a program that protects people who were brought into the united states illegally as children from deportation  dimon is not the only corporate boss venturing outside his usual terrain  goldman sachs group inc  gs n  ceo lloyd blankfein has criticized trump in tweets  while others including apple inc ceo  aapl o  tim cook and merck   co  mrk n  ceo ken frazier have condemned the president s actions in public statements  but dimon  who often refers to himself as a  patriot   differs in tone and demeanor  sources said  the table of contents for his april letter to shareholders includes categories such as  the united states of america is truly an exceptional country   and devoted more space to public policy prescriptions than in prior years  after trump said  both sides  were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left wing protesters in virginia  dimon offered unsolicited advice on how a president should carry himself   it is a leader s role  in business or government  to bring people together  not tear them apart   he wrote in an employee memo   the story changes headline to clarify dimon is not leaving his bank
