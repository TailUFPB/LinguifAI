 clearwater  fla   reuters    some of his supporters fret that president donald trump is backing himself into a corner with promises that can t be kept  others lament he is not pulling america from international conflicts as he vowed   or say he should  get off of twitter    those grumbles are early warning signs for trump as he marks his  day in office on saturday   they were heard in reuters interviews with trump supporters in  swing  counties that went for democrat barack obama in  and  but then flipped for trump last year   a slice of the electorate dominated by white voters that is crucial to the republican s re election hopes and that democrats want to win back   reuters visited the same four places   pinellas county in florida  northampton county in eastern pennsylvania  macomb county outside of detroit  michigan  and gates county in rural north carolina   right after the nov   election   what reporters found this time in more than two dozen interviews is that trump voters are largely standing with their man but with signs of restlessness  mainly over foreign policy  concerns over getting legislation through congress and some skepticism that he won t be able to follow through with promises   from building a wall along the mexican border to repealing obama s signature healthcare law   but rather than bash trump  many largely blamed democrats and republicans alike  a fractured congress  the federal judiciary  and what they see as a hostile news media    they showed a willingness to trust the president almost implicitly  saw him as a tireless worker  and appreciated his efforts to secure the border and curb immigration  they had little interest in the in fighting between his senior aides in the white house    maybe sometimes i question what s going on   said karen mayer    an attorney in clearwater  a west coast florida city in pinellas county  where the majority of its   voters went for obama in  and  but then flipped for trump last year  he prevailed over democratic challenger hillary clinton by slightly more than  percent of the vote there    but at the same time  i have faith that he has a strong team   mayer said   in a statement touting trump s record in the first  days  the white house highlighted  among other things  his attempts to streamline government by proposing a lean budget  and his aggressiveness in foreign affairs  particularly with regard to challenging russia and iran   if trump has reason to worry about his re election prospects  it should be because of supporters like brian mccann    who owns a real estate firm in northampton  pennsylvania   i think he s finding out that he can t follow through on all his talk   he said   internationally  i think he s creating more tensions than solutions    that was the main reason that holly peseski    a legal assistant in mt  clemens  michigan  graded trump s tenure as a  b minus  so far   i don t like the recent bombings he s done   peseski said  referring to u s  missile strikes on a syrian airfield and a huge bomb dropped on a militant hideout in afghanistan   he was a little too quick to act    peseski had another complaint about trump   i wish he d get off of twitter        the counties reuters visited reflect the rural  suburban and largely white coalition that carried trump to the white house   trump was able to flip these counties and dozens more like them powered by an enthusiastic voter base that included many people who had not cast ballots in years  as well as some democrats who crossed over largely because of their dislike of clinton   an analysis of reuters ipsos polling data shows slippage in trump s approval ratings  with lower enthusiasm among white men without a college degree  the core of his political base   in comparing trump s approval rating in the first  days of his tenure to a  day period in april  reuters also found a rise in disapproval among independents  college educated adults  people with below average incomes  white women and white millennials   those women voters were important to trump s victory  he beat clinton  percent to  percent among white women  who comprise  percent of the electorate  in pinellas county  for instance  white women are by far the largest demographic among its more than   registered voters  trump beat clinton there by a little more than   votes   david jolly  a former republican congressman who lost his pinellas based seat in november in part  he said  because of his criticism of trump  has seen few signs that the president s support is fading  but at the same time   he s not picking up new supporters    trump s overall approval rating in reuters ipsos polling has declined steadily over the past two weeks and is now at its lowest level since he took office  with  percent of americans now approving of his performance in office   some voters interviewed in the swing counties identified the struggling effort to replace obama s healthcare law as an early worry about trump   walter watson    a retired art teacher in gatesville  a town of about  people in rural gates county  north carolina  said he did not like the way trump and republicans tried to rush through a new healthcare plan without giving it what he thought was proper consideration    you got to be careful  because this is a life and death issue for a lot of people   watson said   his sparsely populated county backed obama with  percent of the vote in   but trump won it with  percent in    congress is the biggest hindrance to trump s success  many of those interviewed said    i don t think he s going to be able to do even half of what he claimed   said bob white    a retired finance worker in clinton township in michigan   i don t think congress is going to go along with him    but even as they express skepticism that trump can achieve all of his campaign promises  his supporters are sticking with him for now    i think he s trying   said watson   but he probably overstated what he could do  because even a president has limits
