springfield  mo   reuters    u s  president donald trump made his first major tax reform speech on wednesday  but in a long list of thank yous he did not mention gary cohn  the white house point man on taxes who traveled with trump to the event  at a manufacturing company in springfield  missouri  trump reiterated his longstanding call for slashing the u s  corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent at a time when lawmakers believe they could be lucky to bring it down to  percent  when asked about the omission of cohn s name  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters on air force one  en route to washington from missouri  that it was customary for trump to recognize cabinet members  but not advisers  in speeches  cohn traveled with trump on air force one for the missouri speech  in which trump called on democrats to join his tax overhaul effort  he said he would cut taxes and simplify the sprawling u s  tax code for the middle class  but he offered few specifics  and tax reform will be an uphill task in congress   we must reduce the tax rate on american businesses so they keep jobs in america  create jobs in america and compete for workers right here in america   trump said in his first presidential speech specifically on tax reform  one of his key  campaign issues  both congressional democrats and republicans say tax reform is needed but the republican goal of enacting legislation this year faces a battle in congress  which has already failed to deliver on healthcare reform sought by trump  during his speech  trump did single out cabinet members  including treasury secretary steven mnuchin  commerce secretary wilbur ross and small business administration head linda mcmahon  as well as members of congress   more than a dozen people in all  he asked his daughter ivanka trump  who is not a cabinet member but is a staff member  to stand and be recognized in his speech at a manufacturing company in springfield   anybody i forgot   trump asked   cohn  who stood next to the stage during the speech with sanders  has worked side by side for months with mnuchin developing trump s tax reform strategy   it s pretty standard practice for us not to specifically call out staff   sanders told reporters afterward   he regularly mentions cabinet members but very rarely mentions staff in speeches   asked if the oversight of cohn was significant  sanders said   well  look  gary is here  the president is here  they re both working hard and extremely committed to providing tax relief for middle class america  the president has made very clear this is a top priority for him  for his administration  and gary is one of the people leading the charge   cohn recently criticized trump for his comments about violence at racially charged protests in virginia earlier this month  trump blamed  both sides  for the violence in charlottesville  in which white supremacists and neo nazis battled anti racism protesters  trump s comments drew condemnation from both republicans and democrats  cohn told the financial times last week that the trump administration  can and must do better in consistently and unequivocally condemning  hate groups  the former goldman sachs executive  who is jewish  said he had come under  enormous pressure  to resign over trump s remarks  tax reform unlikely before year end independent analysts and lobbyists are increasingly pessimistic that congress can act by the end of   and some believe final tax legislation could be more like a straight tax cut than a reform   i don t want to be disappointed by congress  do you understand me   trump said to cheers  trump said business tax cuts would lead to higher wages for workers by boosting economic growth and making american companies more competitive  an argument democrats dismiss as more of the  trickle down  economics that they blame for leaving workers behind in recent decades   if president trump s previous tax plans are any indication  the wealthy and big corporations will be the ultimate winner   representative richard neal  the top democrat on the tax writing house ways and means committee  said in a statement                  there has been no comprehensive overhaul of the tax code since   trump singled out missouri s democratic senator claire mccaskill  telling voters to throw her out of office in the  midterm elections if she does not get on board with tax reform  mccaskill s office did not respond to queries from reuters about trump s remark   after more than seven months in power  trump and republican leaders who control both the u s  senate and the house are still far from agreement on a tax package  initially expected in the spring  tax reform legislation now may not emerge until as late as november  lobbyists say  trump will discuss a tax overhaul at a white house meeting next tuesday with the  big six  tax reform negotiators  house speaker paul ryan  mnuchin  cohn  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and the republican chairmen of two congressional tax committees
