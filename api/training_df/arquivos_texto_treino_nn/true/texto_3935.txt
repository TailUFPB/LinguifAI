 reuters    after months of internal discord  republicans in the u s  house of representatives on wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the affordable care act  known as obamacare  a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in   two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion  with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents  obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of americans  the first version of the republican bill  known as the american health care act  or ahca  would have left  million more americans without coverage  according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers  the house has recently added two amendments to the ahca to try to appease both conservatives and moderates  here are the latest versions of the bill s main provisions   the republican plan would maintain some of obamacare s most popular provisions  it would allow young adults to stay on their parents  health plan until age  and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage  an amendment introduced by moderate republican representative tom macarthur would let states opt out of obamacare s mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates  it would also allow states to opt out of obamacare s requirement that insurers cover  essential health benefits  such as maternity care and mental health treatment   the measure would provide states with   billion  largely to fund high risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients  an amendment added wednesday would provide another   billion over five years to help those with pre existing conditions pay for health insurance  the bill would let insurers mark up premiums by  percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more  insurers won another provision they had long sought  the ability to charge older americans up to five times more than young people  under obamacare  they could only charge up to three times more  the republicans want to end in  obamacare s income based tax credits that help low income people buy insurance  these would be replaced with age based tax credits ranging from    to    per year that would be capped at upper income levels  while obamacare s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes  the republican plan would be largely age based  the republican bill would abolish most obamacare taxes  including on medical devices  health insurance premiums  indoor tanning salons  prescription medications and high cost employer provided insurance known as  cadillac  plans  those taxes paid for obamacare  republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep  the bill would also repeal the obamacare financial penalty for the  tax year for not purchasing insurance  as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper income americans  it would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees   under obamacare  more than  states  including about a dozen republican states  expanded the medicaid government health insurance program for the poor  about half of obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion  the bill would allow the medicaid expansion to continue until january     providing states chose not to expand  after that date  expansion would end and medicaid funding would be capped on a per person basis  state medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some obamacare mandated essential health benefits  fulfilling a republican promise to return more control to the states
