washington  reuters    president donald trump s call to the u s  congress to pass protections for some undocumented immigrants is stirring interest among his fellow republicans in congress  despite the party s longstanding divisions over immigration that were on display on wednesday  trump  who fashioned his  presidential campaign around a pledge to clamp down on illegal immigration  has now turned the political landscape on its head  on tuesday  he angered business groups and democrats with his announcement that he was terminating former president barack obama s executive order protecting from deportation nearly   immigrants  known as dreamers  who were illegally brought to the united states as children  but he also urged legislative efforts to permanently protect those youth  despite long held opposition from some of the most conservative members of the republican party who comprise his base of supporters  democrats have long been united around major elements of a comprehensive immigration bill  while republicans have been divided over whether to embrace anything beyond narrow tweaks of current law   my challenge to the president   said republican senator lindsey graham  is to help congress get legislation passed within trump s six month deadline   work the phones  try to find a consensus   republican lawmakers on wednesday touted a slew of competing ideas on immigration that could lure votes from many pockets of the party but might doom any bill by alienating democrats or conservative republicans  one of trump s most vocal supporters in congress  republican representative chris collins  wasted no time in introducing legislation on tuesday to protect dreamers  in an interview on wednesday he went further  calling for comprehensive moves to put the  million undocumented people living in the united states on a pathway to citizenship if they qualify   our dairy farmers need it  our crop farmers  the hoteliers  the restaurateurs  the families need it  the kids need it   collins said of firms that employ foreign workers and the millions of undocumented  representative pete sessions  a senior republican who chairs the powerful house rules committee  said he favors allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for a  guest worker  program  but he said he would not support legislation that ultimately grants them citizenship   a major stumbling block for immigration advocacy groups  democrats and some republicans  attorney general jeff sessions also said republicans are not fully on board yet with effort  upon leaving a closed door meeting of house republicans  he was asked whether immigration legislation might emerge in early    i think that there s no decision  we listened carefully   he said  indeed  conservative republican representative mike burgess quipped   we ve got other things that are probably more pressing  than addressing the dreamers now  the immigration issue has vexed congress for years  raising doubts about whether trump and a republican congress could build a consensus around legislation   it may be difficult for republicans to address the daca  obama s executive order  issue within the six month time frame  because that s exactly when many of them are entering primary season  where candidates could outflank them on the right calling them weak on immigration   said ron bonjean  a political strategist who previously worked for house and senate republican leaders  meanwhile  senator tom cotton wants to reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed into the united states  a move that democratic senator dick durbin called  problematic   especially amid some republican opposition  in the meantime  lawmakers are expected to fine tune proposals to help farmers get easier access to temporary foreign workers  just as others work to help their home state high tech industries get more visas for skilled immigrants  more border security steps are likely too  although there is only weak support for trump s southwestern border wall  those measures could help house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell patch together the votes that would be needed   if they are so inclined  if the effort sputters  as it has so many times in the past  republican representative mike coffman has a plan b at the ready  a three year pause in deporting qualified dreamers to give congress yet more time to come up with a permanent fix
