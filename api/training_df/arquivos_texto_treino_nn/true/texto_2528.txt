washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to slap new sanctions on russia and force president donald trump to obtain lawmakers  permission before easing any sanctions on moscow  in a rare rebuke of the republican president  it was unclear how quickly the bill would make its way to the white house for trump to sign into law or veto  the bill still must be passed by the senate  which is mired in debate over efforts to overhaul the u s  healthcare system as lawmakers try to clear the decks to leave washington for their summer recess  the sanctions bill comes as lawmakers investigate possible meddling by russia in the  presidential election and potential collusion by republican trump s campaign  moscow has denied it worked to influence the election in trump s favor  and he has denied his campaign colluded  the white house said the president had not yet decided whether he would sign the measure  rejecting the bill   which would potentially hamper his hopes of pursuing improved relations with moscow   would carry a risk that his veto could be overridden by lawmakers   while the president supports tough sanctions on north korea  iran and russia  the white house is reviewing the house legislation and awaits a final legislative package for the president s desk   said spokeswoman sarah sanders  house members backed the bill  which also imposes sanctions on iran and north korea  by a near unanimous margin of    with strong support from trump s fellow republicans as well as democrats  despite objections from trump  who wanted more control over the ability to impose sanctions  the republican controlled senate passed an earlier version of the bill with near unanimous support  the house added the north korea measures after becoming frustrated with the senate s failure to advance a bill it passed in may  representative ed royce  the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  said the three countries  are threatening vital u s  interests and destabilizing their neighbors  it is well past time that we forcefully respond   but the combined bill has run into objections from some senators  who are unhappy that the house added the north korea sanctions after holding up the measure for more than a month  senate leaders have not said when they might consider the house bill  senator bob corker  the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  said he was not sure the bill would  fly through  his chamber   the only language we agreed to was iran and russia  so adding north korea on  i just don t know how we re going to deal with it yet   corker told reporters   the better route would have been to send over what had been agreed to   the bill had raised concerns in the european union  where u s  allies depend on supplies of russian gas  but house members said the bill was tweaked to try to alleviate the worries of europeans and the energy sector  the intense focus on russia  involving several congressional probes and a separate investigation by a justice department appointed special counsel  robert mueller  has overshadowed trump s agenda  the scrutiny has angered and frustrated the president  who calls the investigations a politically motivated witch hunt fueled by democrats who cannot accept his upset win in last november s election against democratic candidate hillary clinton  a former u s  secretary of state  without offering evidence  trump lashed out on twitter on tuesday about  ukrainian efforts to sabotage  his presidential campaign in order to aid clinton  the ukrainian embassy in washington denied the accusations  the senate judiciary committee had been set to compel trump s former campaign manager  paul manafort  to testify at a hearing on wednesday  but rescinded the subpoena late on tuesday as negotiations over his participation continued  manafort has started turning over documents to the committee and is negotiating a date to be interviewed  the panel said in a statement  the committee is looking at a june  meeting in new york with a russian lawyer organized by trump s eldest son  donald trump jr  trump jr  released emails this month that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information at the meeting about clinton  on friday  the panel had asked that manafort and trump jr  appear at the wednesday hearing  but a witness list released on tuesday evening included neither of their names   manafort met with senate intelligence committee staff on tuesday morning  his spokesman said  on tuesday  trump s son in law  jared kushner  spent three hours with the house of representatives intelligence panel  his second straight day on capitol hill answering questions about his contacts with russians during the campaign  kushner had a  very productive session  with the house intelligence committee  democratic representative adam schiff said after the meeting  republican representative michael conaway said kushner was  straightforward and forthcoming  he wanted to answer every question that we had   kushner  who is now a top aide in trump s white house  told reporters on monday he had no part in any kremlin plot   u s  house republicans on tuesday rejected a legislative effort by democrats to obtain treasury department documents that could show any ties between the finances of trump  his inner circle and the russian government
