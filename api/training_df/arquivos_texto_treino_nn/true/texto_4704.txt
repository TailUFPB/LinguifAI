washington  reuters    the partisan divide over the house intelligence committee s probe of russian interference in the u s  presidential election deepened on friday  when the committee s top democrat suggested  its republican chairman canceled a public hearing after pressure from the white house  panel chairman devin nunes said he had to cancel next tuesday s hearing with officials from former democratic president barack obama s administration in order to have a classified briefing with the directors of the national security agency and federal bureau of investigation   the committee seeks additional information     that can only be addressed in closed session   representative nunes told reporters  fbi director james comey and nsa head admiral mike rogers testified at a public hearing on monday at which comey confirmed for the first time that the fbi is investigating possible ties between republican president donald trump s campaign as moscow sought to influence the  election  representative adam schiff  the intelligence committee s top democrat  said the cancellation was not in the public interest   i think that there must have been a very strong pushback from the white house about the nature of monday s hearing  it s hard for me to come to any other conclusion about why an agreed upon hearing would be suddenly canceled   schiff told a separate news conference   the scheduled witnesses  former director of national intelligence james clapper  former central intelligence agency director john brennan and former deputy attorney general sally yates  were in office when the purported hacking and disinformation by russia to influence the election took place  russia has denied allegations by u s  intelligence agencies that it sought to influence the election  and trump  a republican  has said the controversy was cooked up by democrats and fanned by hostile media  nunes also said on friday that former trump campaign manager paul manafort s lawyers told the committee that he is volunteering to be interviewed  and that the panel would work with his lawyers to decide whether the interview would be open or closed to the public  the new york times reported last month manafort was one of several trump advisers whose contacts with russian operatives were monitored by u s  law enforcement and intelligence  manafort  who was trump s campaign chairman for several months last year  dismissed the report  the newspaper said  many democrats  including schiff  have questioned whether a committee led by nunes  a close trump ally who served on the president s transition team  can still be relied on to conduct a credible investigation  they have called for a special prosecutor or select committee  nunes apologized to the intelligence panel on thursday for announcing to the public and briefing trump that u s  intelligence may have swept up communications by trump associates before telling the committee  schiff said democrats had no intention of giving up on the investigation   from my point of view  that would be irresponsible of us  so  i think we re going to do our best to investigate this regardless of the obstacles we re encountering   schiff said  trump  who in early march tweeted without giving evidence that obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against democrat hillary clinton  said he was  somewhat vindicated  by nunes  statement about the surveillance
