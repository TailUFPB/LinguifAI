 reuters    former illinois governor rod blagojevich lost his latest bid for leniency as a federal appeals court refused to shorten his  year prison term in a vast public corruption case  including an effort to sell barack obama s u s  senate seat  the  u s  circuit court of appeals in chicago dismissed arguments that blagojevich deserved a lesser punishment because he had been a  model prisoner  in the five years he has already spent in prison and because some counts in his original  conviction had been thrown out  friday s   decision came three days after oral arguments  suggesting little or no disagreement  it likely ends blagojevich s chances at shortening his sentence  the one time contestant on donald trump s  celebrity apprentice  could ask the entire  circuit or the u s  supreme court to review his case  but both are long shots  leonard goodman  a lawyer for blagojevich  did not respond to requests for comment  he told the chicago tribune the decision was  incredibly sad and disappointing   the office of acting u s  attorney joel levin in chicago declined to comment  blagojevich    was convicted on charges including wire fraud  extortion and soliciting bribes while governor  he served from january  to january   when the illinois senate removed him from office  prosecutors said blagojevich solicited campaign contributions in exchange for raising pediatric reimbursement rates and legislation supporting illinois  horse racing industry  blagojevich also tried to sell or trade the senate seat that obama vacated after winning the  u s  presidential election  prosecutors said  the appeals court in  voided five of blagojevich s  convictions and ordered a resentencing  but u s  district judge james zagel in chicago reimposed the  year term last august  zagel acknowledged the pain blagojevich s family was suffering but said the punishment reflected federal guidelines and that  the fault lies with the governor   in friday s decision  circuit judge frank easterbrook said zagel acted within his discretion   blagojevich s treatment of fellow inmates may show that outside of office he is an admirable person  but the court was entitled to impose punishment that reflects how blagojevich behaved when he had a different menu of opportunities and to deter those who hold office today   easterbrook wrote  easterbrook also said the supreme court s voiding last june of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell s bribery convictions did not undermine blagojevich s conviction  blagojevich is housed in a low security prison in littleton  colorado  and eligible for release in may
