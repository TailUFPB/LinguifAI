washington  reuters    the pentagon will indefinitely delay a ban on the use of older types of cluster bombs due to take effect on jan      officials said  arguing that safety improvements in munitions technology failed to advance enough to replace older stockpiles  cluster bombs  dropped by air or fired by artillery  scatter bomblets across a wide area  but sometimes fail to explode and are difficult to locate and remove  that can lead to civilian deaths and injuries long after conflicts end  the u s  military had hoped to transition to cluster munitions that explode at least  percent of time  greatly reducing the risks   but with just over one year to go before the ban s slated implementation  a pentagon spokesman told reuters that safety technology had not progressed enough to replace existing stockpiles with safer weaponry   reuters has seen a copy of the memo changing u s  policy and confirmed the changes with pentagon officials   although the department seeks to field a new generation of more highly reliable munitions  we cannot risk mission failure or accept the potential of increased military and civilian casualties by forfeiting the best available capabilities   the pentagon memo says  the memo  which was expected to be signed by deputy defense secretary patrick shanahan on thursday  called cluster munitions  legitimate weapons with clear military utility   disclosure of the new policy met sharp criticism from congress and human rights groups  senator patrick leahy  a democrat who has helped lead efforts to restrict use of cluster bombs  said the pentagon was  in effect   perpetuating use of an indiscriminate weapon that has been shown to have high failure rates    senator dianne feinstein called the move  unbelievable   human rights watch disputed the idea that the u s  military needed the weapons  saying that with the exception of a single strike in yemen in  it had not used the weapons since  in iraq   we condemn this decision to reverse the long held us commitment not to use cluster munitions that fail more than  percent of the time  resulting in deadly unexploded submunitions   said mary wareham  arms division director at human rights watch  pentagon spokesman tom crosson acknowledged it has been years since the u s  military has used any significant amount of cluster munitions and the new pentagon policy puts emphasis on eventually shifting to safer cluster munitions  still  it was unclear at what point in the future the pentagon might be required to stop using its existing stockpiles  since there would also need to be not just higher tech weaponry  but sufficient quantities of new cluster munitions for u s  stocks       the new policy does not allow the pentagon to buy any additional cluster bombs that do not satisfy new standards that were outlined in the memo  the new rules broaden the definition of which types of munitions meet safety requirements beyond the  percent detonation rate  under the new policy  the pentagon says bombs that have advanced self destruct or deactivation technology would also be acceptable for future acquisition   such weaponry must meet a series of criteria  including having a way to render submunitions inoperable within  minutes of being armed  the pentagon policy also prohibited purchasing weaponry that is banned under the convention on cluster munitions   the convention strictly prohibits the use of cluster munitions  but it exempts certain types of munitions that the pentagon says it would nonetheless classify as cluster munitions
