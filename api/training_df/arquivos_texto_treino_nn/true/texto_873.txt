washington new york  reuters    jerome powell was not on president donald trump s early radar as a possible successor to federal reserve chair janet yellen  and was angling instead for a job as the u s  central bank s vice chair for supervision  but when he was passed over for that position last summer  it was one in a chain of events that set the stage for the  year old fed governor and former investment banker to take over as head of the world s most powerful central bank  trump on thursday nominated powell to replace yellen when her term expires in early february  saying at the white house that the  year old lawyer and former investment banker has the necessary  wisdom and leadership    other contenders for the job fell for different reasons  as trump soured on top white house economic adviser gary cohn  decided against renominating yellen despite largely approving of her policies and came to view two others as posing risks to the economy  according to current and former fed and government officials familiar with the decision   in the end it was powell  a maryland native  avid cyclist  and guitar hobbyist  who checked all the boxes that mattered but carried none of the negatives   if confirmed by the u s  senate  powell would become the first person without an advanced economics degree to hold the job since william miller in the late   powell  who lists personal assets of between   million and   million on government disclosure forms  has served on corporate boards as a managing partner at the carlyle group  a private equity firm  but he has also burrowed deep over the last five years into the nuts and bolts of central banking  and schooled himself on broader monetary policy issues      jay does not come with baggage    he has never been at the extremes   said steve bell  who worked with powell at the bipartisan policy center think tank and when powell was at the treasury department in former president george h w  bush s administration  when compared to other possible nominees  some of whom called for sweeping but ill defined changes at the fed  powell took  a straight tactical line  that offered a continuation of yellen s policies  a moderate approach to bank regulation and  perhaps most importantly  the prospect of no surprises  bell said  powell s private sector background appealed as well to trump s preference for business figures over those with phds  a senior white house official on thursday called his experience  unique  and  refreshing  at a central bank increasingly dominated by economists   stanford university economist john taylor  who developed the  taylor rule  for guiding monetary policy  and former fed governor kevin warsh  who resigned over the central bank s massive bond buying stimulus program credited by many with spurring the u s  economy after the   recession  were also interviewed for the fed job  they arguably had a head start  the backing of conservatives  and steady support from the wall street journal s influential editorial board   but they also carried the risk of financial market volatility  with investors regarding each as somebody who could tighten monetary policy at the central bank  that is something trump has indicated he wants to avoid  the first two names trump floated were yellen and cohn  but cohn fell out of favor after he criticized trump s response to violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in virginia in august  a former fed official  contacted over the summer as part of the white house s fed chief search  said it was clear the administration wasn t interested  for example  in taylor and his reliance on  rules  that generally call for interest rates to be higher than they currently are  the administration officials vetting fed candidates were  very much opposed to taylor type rules and systematic policy   said the former official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  warsh  meanwhile  became the target of an aggressive grassroots campaign that highlighted what some critics viewed as a history of bad calls on inflation during his tenure as a fed policymaker  portending a tough confirmation fight  powell also benefited from burgeoning relationships through his work on the technical aspects of markets  and his assumption of the role as the fed s regulatory point person after the resignation of former fed governor daniel tarullo in april  that prompted powell to initially set his sights on the job of vice chair for supervision  though it soon became clear he would not get it  according to a person who had discussions with white house and fed officials involved in the process   yet powell s close work with the treasury resulted in secretary steven mnuchin becoming a strong advocate of his nomination to the top job  fed and government officials said on condition of anonymity  fed governor randal quarles  a friend and colleague who got the vice chair job that powell had wanted  was an additional ally in the mix  but it was powell s support of the yellen fed s policies  often credited with paving the way for a   percent unemployment rate  steady economic growth and calm markets  that may have been his strongest advantage in the race    trump is savvy enough to look at the numbers and who is in the chair   said peter conti brown  an assistant professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania  powell solves the problem of a republican administration that wants  the yellen fed without yellen   conti brown said
