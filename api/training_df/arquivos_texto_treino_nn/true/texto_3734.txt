sochi moscow  reuters    vladimir putin said on wednesday that u s  president donald trump had not divulged any secrets during a meeting in washington with russian officials and offered to prove it by supplying congress with a transcript  but a leading u s  republican politician said he would have little faith in any notes putin might supply  two u s  officials said on monday trump had disclosed classified information about a planned islamic state operation to russian foreign minister sergei lavrov when they met last week  plunging the white house into a fresh controversy just four months into trump s tenure  trump  whose administration has been dogged by allegations that russia helped him win the white house and that he and his allies are too cozy with moscow  has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the russians after media reports of the meeting alarmed some u s  and foreign politicians  president putin deployed his trademark sarcasm on wednesday to make clear he thought the accusation that trump had divulged secrets absurd    i spoke to him  lavrov  today   a smiling putin told a news conference with italian prime minister paolo gentiloni in the russian black sea resort of sochi   i ll be forced to issue him  lavrov  with a reprimand because he did not share these secrets with us  not with me  nor with representatives of russia s intelligence services  it was very bad of him    putin  who still hopes moscow can repair battered ties with the united states despite a deepening political scandal in the united states related to trump s purported russia ties  said moscow had rated lavrov s meeting with trump highly  if the trump administration deemed it appropriate  putin said russia could hand over a transcript of trump s meeting with lavrov to u s  lawmakers to reassure them that no secrets were revealed  a kremlin aide  yuri ushakov  later told reporters that moscow had a written record of the conversation  not an audio recording  u s  republican senator marco rubio was unimpressed with putin s offer and alluded to alleged russian hacking of democratic groups during the u s  presidential election    i wouldn t put much credibility into whatever putin s notes are   rubio said on fox news   and if it comes in an email  i wouldn t click on the attachment   representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  which is among those probing alleged russian interference in the  u s  election  called putin s offer  quite amusing    the last person trump needs to vouch for him right now is vladimir putin   schiff said in an interview with cbs news   if they want to send something  you know  hats off  send it our way    it s credibility would be less than zero   russia has repeatedly denied interfering in the u s  election  trump is also under pressure over accusations he asked then fbi director james comey to end the agency s investigation into the russia ties of former white house national security adviser michael flynn  the allegation stems from a memo written by comey and seen by a source familiar with the contents of the memo  in washington  republican and democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the comey memo  u s  representative adam kinzinger joined a small but growing number of republican lawmakers who have said they would back some sort of independent investigation into russia s role in the  election   if in fact what was in the memo is true  it s very concerning and we need to get to the bottom of that   kinzinger said on cnn  complaining about what he said was  political schizophrenia  in the united states  putin said trump was not being allowed to do his job properly   it s hard to imagine what else these people who generate such nonsense and rubbish can dream up next   said putin  referring to unnamed u s  politicians    what surprises me is that they are shaking up the domestic political situation using anti russian slogans  either they don t understand the damage they re doing to their own country  in which case they are simply stupid  or they understand everything  in which case they are dangerous and corrupt       russia has repeatedly said that trump s opponents are trying to damage him and moscow by making what it says are false accusations about the billionaire president and the russian government which initially had high hopes of a rapprochement  officials have told reuters trump s alleged disclosure of classified information to russia s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with washington from cooperating  that view was reinforced on wednesday when british prime minister theresa may said her government had confidence in its relationship with the united states and would continue to share intelligence with britain s most important defense and security ally
