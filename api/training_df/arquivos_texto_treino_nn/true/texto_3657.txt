washington  reuters    the man who led president donald trump s transition team for the u s  environmental protection agency  myron ebell  told a conservative conference last month that the new administration is moving too slowly to unravel climate change regulations  in closed door remarks to members of the conservative jefferson institute in virginia on april   a recording of which was obtained by reuters  ebell said trump s administration had made a series of missteps  including delays in appointing key epa officials  that could hamper efforts to cut red tape for industry   this is an impending disaster for the trump administration   ebell  a prominent climate change doubter  said in the recording provided to the center for media and democracy and shared with reuters  ebell was chosen by trump s campaign to lead the epa s transition until the jan   inauguration  a choice that had reinforced expectations trump would follow through on promises to rescind obama era green rules and pull the united states out of a global pact to fight climate change  ebell had been seen as a candidate for the epa administrator job  a post that ultimately went to former oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt   ebell no longer works at the agency but remains influential within a faction of the u s  conservative movement with ties to the trump administration  his criticism reflects a broader disappointment by some conservatives about pruitt s focus and commitment to scrapping even more complex obama era regulations          since taking office  trump and pruitt have moved to unwind environmental regulations  including former president barack obama s clean power plan to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generators  but his administration has frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of remaining in the paris climate agreement  and hesitating to tackle the obama era  endangerment finding  that concludes carbon dioxide is a public health threat and underlies many u s  regulations governing emissions  lawyers have said challenging that scientific finding could be time consuming and legally complex   pruitt has said he does not want the united states to remain in the paris agreement but he has not yet decided to tackle the endangerment finding  at least three conservative groups have filed petitions asking the epa to overturn the finding   paris and the endangerment finding are the two big outstanding issues  it s the first wave of things that are necessary to turn this country around  particularly in the heartland states   ebell said at the conference  ebell cited the slow pace of key epa appointments  including deputy administrator and various assistant administrators  a lack of experienced personnel at the white house  deep ideological divisions between the president s close advisers  and an  imperfect choice  of epa administrator  as the main reasons trump was not acting more aggressively on climate rules  he said trump strategists should have allowed his transition team to roll out the full de regulatory agenda before trump took office  instead of delaying   the new president doesn t have long before inertia sets in   he said  he also found fault in trump s choice of pruitt to run the epa  saying the former state attorney is a  clever lawyer  but his  political ambition  may distract him from taking on time consuming efforts like challenging the endangerment finding        a spokesman for pruitt responded to ebell s assertions  saying pruitt had been implementing trump s executive orders and had spearheaded  about two dozen regulatory reform actions  since taking up his position  ebell also faulted trump for choosing advisers with broadly different political perspectives and backgrounds   something he said was triggering paralyzing debate  instead of action   he s got people on different sides and they are all fighting over who gets these jobs and nobody has the clout except the president to say   hey fix this  let s get this done    ebell said      in a statement given to reuters on saturday  ebell said he is still concerned about the white house log jam in nominating people for key epa posts and the delay in making the paris decision  but he said he supports pruitt as an administrator and is encouraged by his recent actions   pruitt was an excellent choice to head the epa  and minor disagreements aside  his recent actions have made me even more confident that he will be an outstanding administrator   he said  a white house official did not respond to a request for comment
