washington  reuters    the trump administration is exploring whether it can use an obscure ethics rule to undermine the special counsel investigation into ties between president donald trump s campaign team and russia  two people familiar with white house thinking said on friday  trump has said that deputy attorney general rod rosenstein s hiring of former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel to lead the investigation  hurts our country terribly    within hours of mueller s appointment on wednesday  the white house began reviewing the code of federal regulations  which restricts newly hired government lawyers from investigating their prior law firm s clients for one year after their hiring  the sources said   an executive order signed by trump in january extended that period to two years  mueller s former law firm  wilmerhale  represents trump s son in law jared kushner  who met with a russian bank executive in december  and the president s former campaign manager paul manafort  who is a subject of a federal investigation  legal experts said the ethics rule can be waived by the justice department  which appointed mueller  he did not represent kushner or manafort directly at his former law firm  if the department did not grant a waiver  mueller would be barred from investigating kushner or manafort  and this could  greatly diminish the scope of the probe  experts said  the justice department is already reviewing mueller s background as well as any potential conflicts of interest  said department spokeswoman sarah isgur flores  even if the justice department granted a waiver  the white house would consider using the ethics rule to create doubt about mueller s ability to do his job fairly  the sources said  administration legal advisers have been asked to determine if there is a basis for this   under this strategy  the sources said the administration would raise the issue in press conferences and public statements  moreover  the white house has not ruled out the possibility of using the rule to challenge mueller s findings in court  should the investigation lead to prosecution   but the administration is now mainly focused on placing a cloud over his reputation for independence  according to the sources  who spoke on the condition of anonymity       kathleen clark  a professor of legal ethics at washington university school of law  said the justice department can grant a waiver if concerns about bias are minimal   she said subjects of the investigation could later argue that its results cannot be trusted  but she believes the argument would not stand up in court    the white house did not respond to a request for comment on whether it is reviewing the ethics rule in order to undermine mueller s credibility   mueller s former colleagues at wilmerhale  james quarles and aaron zebley  are expected to join his investigation  according to a spokeswoman for the law firm  neither quarles nor zebley represented kushner or manafort   mueller will now lead the ongoing federal bureau of investigation probe into trump s associates and senior russian officials   unlike kenneth starr  the independent counsel appointed by a three judge panel to investigate bill and hillary clinton s real estate holdings in the   mueller depends on the justice department for funding and he reports to rosenstein  who was appointed by trump   when he announced mueller s appointment this week  rosenstein said mueller will have  all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation
