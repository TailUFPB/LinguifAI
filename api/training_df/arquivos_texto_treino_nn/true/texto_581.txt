new york reuters    in august  a dozen inventors gathered around a fire pit outside the headquarters of the u s  patent and trademark office in alexandria  virginia  and set alight patents they said had been rendered worthless by an overreaching federal government    it s time for us to make patents great again   michael caputo  an advisor to donald trump s presidential campaign  told those gathered  us inventor  the group behind the protest caputo now represents as a spokesman  is calling for the abolition of the u s  patent trial and appeal board  an administrative tribunal run by the patent office that reviews the validity of patents   the rallying cry marks an about face for some conservatives  who broadly supported the board s creation in  as a way to rein in trial lawyers and  patent trolls   who hold patents for the sole purpose of suing big companies for licensing fees    things have really flipped when it comes to the conservative perspective on patents   said charles duan  a lawyer with left leaning consumer group public knowledge  much of the credit goes to activists who have convinced many conservatives that the real problem is not out of control litigation but how the tribunal designed to speed up resolving patent disputes favors big business over smaller rivals   the change of positions has been aided by deepening right wing distrust of tech giants  such as apple inc and alphabet inc s google  which have benefited the most from ptab while embracing liberal causes like immigration or gay and transgender rights   graphic  tmsnrt rs   the u s  supreme court is due to rule sometime next year on whether the tribunal is an unconstitutional intrusion of the executive branch onto matters reserved for the courts and influential conservative groups are already weighing in  the heritage foundation  the cato institute  federalist society  and the american conservative union have published articles or submitted briefs arguing that ptab should be abolished  most legal experts expect it to survive  though  noting the supreme court has largely accepted the powers of executive branch courts in other areas  such as public employee benefits  the mounting criticism of ptab could still convince the court s conservative justices to vote for abolition  said q  todd dickinson  a lawyer with the firm polsinelli and a former director of the patent office   the advocacy effort by conservative groups could also convince the trump administration to curb the patent board s power  dickinson said  an anti troll weapon more than  percent of the republicans in congress backed  the legislation that created ptab  at the time  the u s  chamber of commerce said the law would  help reduce unnecessary litigation against american businesses   in february the same business lobbying group criticized ptab for creating  cost and uncertainty for patent owners   u s  representative thomas massie  a kentucky republican who holds patents relating to computer interfaces  was not in congress at the time the board was created  but said conservatives  initial intent to curb excessive litigation has gradually given way to fears that ptab is helping the wrong businesses    the board s creation was pushed by big tech companies  banks and retailers  who complained they were being inundated with  troll  lawsuits   successfully defending a patent case in federal court often takes years and costs millions of dollars  escalating pressure to settle  ptab offered a cheaper and faster alternative  the average cost of litigating a ptab petition to a final decision is about     according to patent risk management company rpx corp   there are no juries and limited live witness testimony in ptab proceedings  and its administrative judges apply a lower standard of proof than would be required in federal court   about  percent of the patents that ptab makes final decisions on are either partially or fully invalidated  according to a report issued in october by the patent office  but the agency also said  percent of patents challenged at ptab are upheld  in part because the court frequently declines requests to review patents   a spokesman for the patent office declined to comment   inventors say ptab has made it much harder to get patents licensed by big technology  which now routinely respond to patent infringement claims by initiating ptab proceedings    patents owners who don t have the wherewithal to withstand serial challenges to the validity of their patents just can t license them   said david pridham  chief executive of dominion harbor  a firm that owns and attempts to license former eastman kodak co patents   paul morinville  a cowboy hat wearing entrepreneur from indiana and the founder of us inventor  said it has become harder for him to get funding for his business based on software patents he holds   morinville has been speaking to republican lawmakers and their staffers for the past four years and many conservatives credit his group with raising alarm about the patent tribunal    they are as close to your iconic garage inventor as you can get  so their stories really resonate   said james edwards  a conservative lobbyist focused on patent law  while conservative groups have been most vocal  the debate transcends party lines  some republicans  such as representative darrell issa of california  keep supporting the ptab  while some democrats have joined republicans in calls to curb its powers   many trial lawyers whose case loads have fallen also oppose it  but many liberals have embraced ptab as a means of eliminating brand name pharmaceutical patents that keep drug prices high  generic drug makers and large tech companies are also among the board s supporters  arguing it has actually increased competition by weeding out low quality patents  the conservative backlash in part reflects how the right views tech giants like apple and google  which thanks to the tribunal have prevailed in hundreds of disputes with patent owners seeking hefty compensation    google  amazon  and apple and other big tech companies   you look at their power and it is really astounding  and they are generally left leaning companies   said matthew dowd  a conservative patent lawyer in washington d c  who has represented us inventor   those dynamics are definitely playing into the increasing willingness of conservatives to speak up about patents
