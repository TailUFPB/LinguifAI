washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration is preparing to release a wide ranging executive order to reduce the role that climate change plays in policy decisions  according to a trump administration official who reviewed a draft of the order  the move could alter how u s  agencies weigh regulations on  a broad array of industries  from drilling  coal mining and auto manufacturing to refining  the official on tuesday confirmed a bloomberg news report that the executive order will instruct the environmental protection agency and other agencies to overhaul their use of the  social cost of carbon   an obama era policy that seeks to quantify potential economic damage from climate change for the purposes of drafting regulation  white house spokeswoman kelly love declined to discuss the timing of an executive order on energy   we have nothing to announce at this time   she said  under rules put in by place by former president barack obama  the current cost of carbon in policy decisions is   per ton  which will rise to   by   the trump order would direct regulators to use a  discount rate  that would dramatically reduce  or eliminate  that cost  discount rates are used to come up with a net present value of something whose benefits and costs will be distributed over time  in the case of carbon  the impact of emissions on the earth s climate can take several years to appear  under some scenarios referenced in the executive order  carbon could have a zero or  negative value   the source said  the source said that the order may be an initial step to ultimately phasing out the carbon evaluation entirely  the executive order could be issued as soon as this week  the source said  and may include other energy specific measures  like a requirement for the epa to conduct a review of regulations that could harm energy production   reuters and others have reported previously that trump planned to target obama era green regulations  including a federal coal mining ban and an initiative forcing states to cut carbon emissions  the department of interior under obama had issued a moratorium on coal leasing on federal land in  as it sought to review the program and evaluate whether the government adequately priced the value of coal extracted from public lands on behalf of taxpayers  the clean power plan was obama s centerpiece initiative to combat climate change  requiring states to slash emissions of carbon dioxide  but it was never implemented due to legal challenges launched by several republican states  the new head of the environmental protection agency  scott pruitt  said last week he is not convinced that carbon dioxide from human activity is the main driver of climate change and said he wants congress to weigh in on whether  is a harmful pollutant that should be regulated  the obama administration s carbon cost estimates were first issued in  and have been used to analyze rules directly targeting carbon dioxide emissions  like car and truck emissions standards  they have also been used to cover rules on indirect emissions  like one to control mercury and other air pollutants from power plants
