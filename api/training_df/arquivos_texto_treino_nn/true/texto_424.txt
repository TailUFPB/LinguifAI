washington  reuters    if he becomes u s  secretary of state  mike pompeo would have three assets rex tillerson did not  experience in government  the confidence of president donald trump  and a defter touch with congress and the bureaucracy  but he still would suffer from problems that have afflicted tillerson  chief among them a boss who has shown little regard for diplomacy and no qualms about undermining his secretary of state with tweets  current and former u s  officials said  news media reports  first published by the new york times  that trump has a plan to replace his embattled secretary of state with pompeo  a former u s  congressman who now heads the central intelligence agency  drew mixed reviews from serving u s  officials  some argued that things at the state department can hardly get worse than they have been under tillerson  whose  month reign has been marked by an exodus of top diplomats  deep dismay at planned  percent budget cuts  and conflicts with trump   anybody could play the hand he s been dealt better than tillerson   said one u s  official on condition of anonymity  saying things can only get better  but others argued that any new secretary of state would face the same obstacles as tillerson  who was undercut this year when trump told his chief diplomat to stop  wasting his time  trying to negotiate with north korea   this is a hellish environment for a secretary of state   said one state department official on condition of anonymity  it was not clear whether trump plans to throw tillerson  who in october reportedly called the president a  moron   overboard  tillerson has not directly addressed whether he made the comment  though his spokeswoman denied it  asked on thursday if he wanted tillerson to stay  trump sidestepped the question saying   he s here  rex is here    there are no personnel announcements at this time   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders later said in a statement that left tillerson twisting in the wind  trump was alienated by the reported  moron  comment and tillerson positions that differ from trump s on north korea and the gulf standoff between qatar and saudi arabia and other arab nations  said another senior official  tillerson has embittered many in the state department by embracing the planned budget cut  failing to get top officials into key diplomatic jobs  relying on a handful of aides and keeping his distance from career diplomats  if trump went with pompeo  he would tap a former army armor officer and harvard law school graduate who was in his fourth term representing a kansas district in congress when he was chosen to lead the cia  where officials say he has enjoyed a less hostile relationship with career spies than tillerson has had with career diplomats  while some intelligence officers say pompeo tends to tell the president what he wants to hear rather than giving him their assessments  others say they have been impressed by his intellect  his willingness to listen and his advocacy of more robust covert operations   current and former officials said pompeo was likely to get along better with congress and with the white house  not least because of his conservative bent  however  they said pompeo would need to resist the planned budget cuts and find a way to grapple with trump s tweets   if the president undercuts what he is trying to achieve diplomatically  convinces people that whatever you agree to with the secretary of state will be overturned by the president     then he is basically neutered   said richard boucher  a former top u s  diplomat who now teaches at brown university   so the question is not whether pompeo can do the job but whether the president is going to let pompeo do the job
