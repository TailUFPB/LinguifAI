melbourne  reuters    lisa de vanna once had to wash her sports bras in the sinks of cheap hotels to save money but the footballer is now relishing the good times as a surge of investment transforms women s professional sport in australia   over the last few months  de vanna and her team mates in the  matildas  national soccer team have become the toast of the nation  playing to bumper home crowds even as their male counterparts struggle to qualify for the world cup  the   defeat of brazil in sydney last saturday drew some   fans  more than one of the weekend s playoff matches in the hugely popular men s australian football league and a rugby union international between australia and argentina  another victory over the brazilians on tuesday attracted an even bigger crowd and  on wednesday  victoria sports minister john eren proudly trumpeted that the state would host two matildas friendlies against china in november  the recent success of the matildas has played its part in the explosion of interest but it also echoes the development of women s professional leagues in cricket and australian rules football  the popular indigenous sport  the large swell of support for a once neglected outfit has been surreal for de vanna  who after playing the  world cup had to return to her job as a petrol station attendant  until quite recently  conditions were still  crap  for the country s top women players  the plainspoken de vanna told reuters  using a more profane term to describe her early playing days   i came in when they just had the  professional  contracts   the prolific  year old striker said in an interview   i was still wearing boy s clothes  still washing my undies and bras in the sink  we didn t have internet  we were staying in budget hotels   it was really tough back then but what we had was the love for the game and that hasn t changed   what s changed is that we ve got the proper support to be better athletes and it took a very long time for it to happen  but you ve seen the outcome   basic salaries for women footballers in the domestic w league remain modest  even if they are expected to double to a        next season  top internationals  however  can expect to earn a respectable a   a year  giving young girls hope of carving out a full time professional career   aspirations that were until recently only the province of talented boys  cricket is another sport with growing opportunities for women         under the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement  the average pay of international cricketers will more than double to a   in the   season  according to figures from governing body cricket australia  ca   state players  on average  can expect a   and will be able to top that up by playing in the third season of the women s big bash  league  underlining confidence in the women s game  tickets for this year s women s ashes cricket series against england will be sold for the first time rather than given away for free  ca has made significant investment in women s sport and chief executive james sutherland is  very confident  it will ultimately pay for itself   i m not under any illusions that success will come overnight   sutherland told reuters   that s not the case  beyond the economics of building demand and having the game pay for itself  either way  it s still good economics to be investing into women s cricket in the way that we do    it s  increasing the profile of the game and creating a clear and obvious pathway for young females to pursue as they have so many choices   another pathway that has opened up only recently is in the women s australian football league  aflw   which proved a roaring success in its inaugural season this year  the afl  the governing body of top flight australian rules football  had planned to launch the competition in  but took the plunge after huge crowds turned out at exhibition games    debbie lee  women s football operations manager at the melbourne demons club and a key architect of the aflw  had to pay to play her  odd games in the full contact sport but women players can now earn up to a   a season  free to air tv broadcasts of games have helped boost the tournament but its development is largely driven by a new wave of fans  lee said   there s a whole swell of support from a new generation of young people who are asking   why shouldn t women play football  why shouldn t have they have these opportunities  the same opportunities as men    new competition between the women s sports is welcomed across the board by national federations  who see a chance to tap into new markets while fulfilling pledges to boost equal opportunity  but the rivalry may eventually get heated as the battle for talent heats up  just like in the men s sports  where rival codes fight bitterly to retain and lure marquee players  the movements of top women athletes are now covered closely in major newspapers  former matildas goalkeeper brianna davey played domestic soccer for melbourne city last year but switched codes to play as a defender for carlton in the aflw   it s going to be really interesting   said lee   other sports will realize if they don t have a good deal  they ll lose their players
