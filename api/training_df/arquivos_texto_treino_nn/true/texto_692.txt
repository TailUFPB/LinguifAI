 reuters    a woman has accused roy moore  the republican nominee for the u s  senate in alabama  of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was  years old and he was   the washington post reported on thursday  prompting top republicans to say he should step aside if the allegations prove true  moore    the state s former chief judge  vehemently denied the allegations  calling them  completely false and a desperate political attack   u s  president donald trump would want moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true  white house press secretary sarah sanders said on friday   like most americans  the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation  in this case one from many years ago  to destroy a person s life   sanders said   however  the president also believes that if these allegations are true  judge moore will do the right thing and step aside   she said  as trump arrived in vietnam on his  day asia tour    in a series of twitter posts later in the day  moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to  silence and shut up christian conservatives like you and me   adding  i will never give up the fight   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell  working with a slim   majority  called on moore to drop out of the race  if these allegations are true   several other republicans  including texas senators john cornyn and ted cruz  and utah senator mike lee  all of whom endorsed moore  echoed that sentiment  at least two republican senators  john mccain of arizona and john thune of south dakota  said moore should step aside immediately  with mccain calling the accusations  deeply disturbing and disqualifying   leigh corfman  now   told the post she met moore at a courthouse in  when moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding  moore  at the time an assistant district attorney  asked for the girl s phone number and days later took her to his house  where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home  corfman said  the story also quoted three other women who said moore dated them when they were between  and  years of age and he was in his early   though none said they had sexual contact with moore   reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations  the moore campaign accused the post of colluding with democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations   the post said none of the women had donated to or worked for moore s democratic opponent  doug jones  or for his republican primary rivals  and that corfman said she had voted for republicans in the past three presidential elections  including for donald trump in    moore has consistently led in polls over jones  he was considered a heavy favorite in deeply republican alabama in the dec   special election to fill the seat of u s  attorney general jeff sessions  it remains to be see whether thursday s allegations can buoy jones  long shot bid  which would represent a major upset for democrats and narrow republicans  current edge in the senate   jones  campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the post story  no matter what happens  moore will remain on the ballot on dec   since a candidate s name cannot be removed within  days of the election  according to the office of alabama s secretary of state  if  however  the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee  or if moore himself decided to do so  election officials would not certify any votes cast for moore  write in candidates are also allowed under state law  alabama political strategist david mowery  who has worked for candidates of both parties  said the chance of moore bowing out of the race was  less than zero   and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last minute write in candidate  mowery cited moore s overwhelming popularity with alabama s republican voters  who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the post  nevertheless  he said democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund raising  moore  who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters  prevailed over several republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw trump  mcconnell and most senate republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to sessions  seat  luther strange  the race exposed rifts between the republican party s conservative base and its washington based establishment  moore s candidacy was heavily promoted by former trump strategist steve bannon  who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on republican incumbents  on several occasions  moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job  he has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some u s  communities are living under islamic religious law  he first became a national figure in the early   when he lost his position as alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a ten commandments monument from outside the courthouse  after winning his position back in   he was again forced out after defying the u s  supreme court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same sex couples  on his senate campaign website  moore said he was suspended  for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman
