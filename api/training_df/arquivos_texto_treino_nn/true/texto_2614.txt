washington  reuters    if president donald trump  who refers to the media as  fake news   wants his staff to use a more conciliatory approach with journalists  new communications director anthony scaramucci may be implementing such a shift   for now  the wall street financier and republican fundraiser walked into the white house briefing room on friday and immediately did what sean spicer  the outgoing press secretary  did not do on his first day in january  engage  in a friendly manner  with reporters  wearing a blue tie and an american flag pin on a dark suit  scaramucci bantered with correspondents  pledged to be transparent and even made respectful remarks about cnn  the cable network with which trump and spicer have sparred repeatedly  he made fun of himself  joking about his short stature and apologizing to trump from the podium for having called the new york businessman a hack politician in    he brings it up every  seconds  all right   scaramucci said to laughter  referring to the president   i should have never said that about him  so  mr  president  if you re listening  i personally apologize for the  time for saying that   trump was probably listening  reporters peppered scaramucci with questions on press related issues that have dogged the relationship between the trump presidency and the journalists that cover it  did he support having briefings televised   i obviously am committed to being transparent because i m standing here  but i d like to talk that over with the president   he said  he noted that cnn had apologized when it reported something false about him and that he had accepted the apology   there feels like there s a little bit of media bias  and so what we hope we can do is de escalate that and turn that around  and let s let the message from the president get out there to the american people   he said  he announced the new press secretary to take over from spicer  who resigned earlier on friday  would be sarah sanders   spicer s debut at the white house podium in january featured a long scolding of reporters for their portrayal of trump s inauguration day crowd numbers  asked on friday whether he agreed with trump s contention  for which there is no evidence  that  million people voted illegally in the  election  scaramucci answered carefully   so if the president says it  let me do more research on it  but my guess is that there s probably some level of truth to that   he said   i think what we have found sometimes the president says stuff  some of you guys in the media think it s not true or it isn t true  and it turns out it s closer to the truth than people think
