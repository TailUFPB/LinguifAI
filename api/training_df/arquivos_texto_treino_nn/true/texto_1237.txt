washington  reuters    in friday s speech laying out his strategy toward iran and his decision not to certify it is complying with the  nuclear agreement  u s  president donald trump made a series of statements that analysts questioned   trump said he might terminate the deal under which iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions  and laid out a more aggressive approach to counter iran s ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups  below are some of trump s controversial comments  along with analysis of their basis in fact  trump   the previous administration lifted these sanctions  just before what would have been the total collapse of the iranian regime  through the deeply controversial  nuclear deal with iran    several foreign policy analysts said there was no reason to believe that the government of iran  whose economy suffered from economic sanctions that targeted its oil industry  was close to falling apart   there is no evidence that i  aware of that would suggest that regime was on the verge of collapse   said michael singh  an expert with the washington institute for near east policy who served on republican president george w  bush s national security council staff   the sanctions were having a pretty strong impact on the iranian economy  especially because of the oil sanctions  you had a real contraction of iranian economy   he said   but saying anything beyond that is a matter of speculation   in fact  singh argued  the pressure brought on tehran from international sanctions  could actually help to unite factions within iran  and thereby strengthen its rulers  trump   the nuclear deal threw iran s dictatorship a political and economic lifeline  providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created  it also gave the regime an immediate financial boost and over   billion its government could use to fund terrorism        the   billion  in fact  already belonged to iran and represented foreign assets blocked by sanctions  it was unfrozen with the lifting of international sanctions under the deal  formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action  jcpoa   but  experts said that tehran would see only a fraction of that sum because of debts it owed  including   billion to china for infrastructure projects  various estimates put the actual amount tehran received at between   and   billion      in addition  roughly    billion was handed over to iran that stemmed from an uncompleted arms deal between the united states and the government of the late shah  which paid a   million deposit before being toppled in iran s  revolution   the remaining    billion represented interest owed on the   million  according to u s  officials  who used the money as leverage to obtain the release of five u s  citizens held in iran  the obama administration repaid the deposit with pallets of cash delivered by aircraft   on iran having made multiple violations of the nuclear deal trump   the iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement  for example  on two separate occasions  they have exceeded the limit of  metric tons of heavy water  until recently  the iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges    the international atomic energy agency  iaea   the u n  nuclear watchdog charged with monitoring the deal  says that tehran is in full compliance   a judgment the trump administration twice previously affirmed   and that  nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under the jcpoa are being implemented    at present  iran is subject to the world s most robust nuclear verification regime   iaea director general yukiya amano said in a statement after trump s speech   iran has exceeded the  metric ton cap on its heavy water stockpile and run more advanced centrifuges   the devices that purify uranium   than permitted by the deal and arguably exceeded the limits on its low riched uranium supply  but experts say that iran quickly corrected all of the infractions and  most importantly  argued that iran had not committed a deal rupturing  material breach    multiple violations is an exaggeration  there are very few actual violations   said robert einhorn  a nonproliferation expert who worked at the state department under former president barack obama and is now at the brookings institution think tank   they sought to exploit any ambiguity in the text  but when they did that the united states pushed back and a reasonable outcome was reached in every case   he said
