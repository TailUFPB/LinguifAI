washington  reuters    u s  senator john mccain said on friday he opposes the latest republican bill to dismantle obamacare  dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party s slim senate majority  with several other republicans still undecided on the measure  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the senate floor for a vote next week  though he did not promise to do so  a vote would set the stage for another dramatic capitol hill decision on the  law that brought health insurance to millions of americans and became former democratic president barack obama s signature domestic achievement  for seven years  republicans have hammered obamacare as an unwarranted government intrusion into american healthcare  president donald trump made repealing obamacare one of his top campaign promises in   democrats have fiercely defended it  the announcement by mccain  a republican who has often been at odds with trump and who cast a crucial  no  vote in july that helped defeat an earlier republican repeal bill  had the potential to up end mcconnell s plans  mcconnell s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment  at a rally in alabama  trump said mccain s decision was  totally unexpected  terrible   despite the setback  trump said   we still have a chance  we re going to do it eventually   republicans have only a narrow senate majority and cannot afford to lose many votes on the bill  they are also on a tight timetable  mcconnell has been trying to schedule a vote on the bill by sept    the last day on which the bill could pass with only a simple majority of  votes in the senate  a vote taken any later than that would have to garner at least  votes for passage  weeks after the humiliating defeat in july  when the obamacare repeal fight seemed to be over  the current bill was introduced by republican senators bill cassidy and lindsey graham  a close friend of mccain s  and seemed to gain momentum  but mccain on friday laid out his opposition in a statement   i cannot in good conscience vote for the graham cassidy proposal   he said he took no pleasure in announcing his opposition and noted that the bill s authors  are my dear friends   mccain complained about the rushed process republicans used to push the bill forward  he said he would consider supporting a bill like it if it had emerged from extensive hearings  debate and amendment   but that has not been the case   he said   mccain  who cast his  no  vote in july just days after being diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer  said he could not support the bill without knowing how much it would cost  how it would affect insurance premiums and  how many people will be helped or hurt by it   information that will not be available until the non partisan congressional budget office provides a full assessment at the end of september  the graham cassidy bill would take federal money spent on the medicaid program for the poor and disabled  as well as subsidies to help americans buy private insurance  and divvy it up to the states in block grants  advocates say that would give states more discretion to manage their own healthcare schemes  although the cbo has not yet fully assessed the bill s effects  independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money  generally with republican leaning states benefiting and democratic leaning states losing  largely because a majority of the states that opted to expand medicaid under obamacare were democratic leaning  a washington post abc news opinion poll said americans prefer obamacare to the graham cassidy alternative by  percent to  percent  graham said in a statement he was not giving up   we press on   he said  shares of health insurers turned up after mccain announced his oppositions  centene ended   percent higher while humana closed up   percent  reversing earlier losses   state by state impacts from graham cassidy would vary  the axios news website reported on friday  citing a study by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  cms   the unit of the department of health and human services that oversees medicaid and the obamacare program  the cms study found that by   alaska would lose  percent of its federal funding for insurance subsidies and medicaid  arizona would lose  percent  maine would gain  percent  ohio would lose  percent  and west virginia would lose  percent  axios reported  these states are home to republican senators who are under pressure on healthcare  both of alaska s republican senators  lisa murkowski and dan sullivan  are still on the fence over graham cassidy  the cms had no immediate comment on the axios report  besides mccain  kentucky s rand paul is the only other republican senator who has publicly said he opposes the bill  maine s susan collins said she was leaning against the bill  the portland press herald newspaper reported on friday  kansas  jerry moran is also undecided  no democrats support the bill  to pass graham cassidy  the republicans need at least  votes in the  seat senate  which they control    with vice president mike pence casting a potential tie breaking vote  the insurance industry  hospitals  medical advocacy groups such as the american medical association  american heart association and american cancer society  the aarp advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill  the center on budget and policy priorities  a liberal think tank in washington  estimated the bill would cause more than  million people to lose insurance
