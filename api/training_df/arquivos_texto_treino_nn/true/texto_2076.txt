washington  reuters    while president donald trump opened the door on monday to beefing up u s  forces in afghanistan  he provided few details on how sending more troops will hasten a conclusion to america s longest war   there is no quick fix to this problem   said bill roggio  an insurgency expert with the foundation for defense of democracies  a washington based policy institute  speaking before trump s speech   things will continue looking bleak for some time   in his approximately  minute nationally televised address  trump said he would  expand authority  for u s  commanders to target militant networks that  sow violence and chaos throughout afghanistan     that paves the way to an increase in the   u s  troop level in afghanistan and broader rules of engagement as part of his plan to end a military conflict that began in   u s  officials said  but he declined to say how many more u s  soldiers will be deployed or how long the u s  force will be there   conditions on the ground  not arbitrary timetables  would guide the duration of u s  military involvement  he said  his effective embrace of an open ended u s  deployment contrasts with the expectations of his political base that he would extract the united states from a war estimated to have cost more than   billion and claimed the lives of more than   u s  service members  but trump  who has railed against the war for years  finds himself boxed in  taliban advances are raising the specter of a repeat of   when islamist militants seized power and provided al qaeda with a sanctuary in which to plot the sept      attacks in new york and washington  moreover  the afghan government is plagued by ethnic and political rifts and corruption and controls less than  percent of the country  similar circumstances that paved the way for the  taliban s  takeover   the choice is between losing and not losing  winning really isn t an option   said james dobbins  who served as the u s  special representative to afghanistan and pakistan during the presidency of barack obama and is now a senior fellow at the rand corporation   he  trump  can lose quickly by withdrawing  he can lose slowly by standing pat  dobbins said  adding that trump  could not lose  by marginally increasing the u s  force   the ostensible goal of trump s strategy is to help afghan security forces reverse taliban advances and create a military stalemate that eventually would compel rebel leaders to agree to a diplomatic resolution of the conflict  yet trump indicated that diplomacy would take a back seat to military operations  saying that   some day  after an effective military effort  perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the taliban   sending more u s  troops could  buy time for the afghan government to increase its legitimacy and gain support for the afghans  which will help them negotiate an end of the conflict   said scott worden  an expert with the u s  institute for peace  but worden  also speaking before trump s speech  said more u s  troops  alone are not going to outright defeat the taliban  the military components of the strategy have to be coupled with an equal   if not greater   emphasis on managing the politics of afghanistan and the politics of the region   obama tried and failed with what basically was the same approach  he presided over a far larger effort that at one point involved some   u s  troops  considerable airpower  scores of cia drone strikes on extremist sanctuaries in pakistan  and billions of dollars for reconstruction and democratization programs  obama also dedicated enormous diplomatic energy to ending the war  appointing a special envoy to coordinate negotiations  not only has trump eliminated that post  but the administration has proposed slashing the state department budget by about  percent and has left scores of senior posts vacant  obama freed five taliban leaders from guantanamo bay and allowed the rebels to open an office in doha  the taliban freed captured u s  soldier bowe bergdahl  but they refused to be drawn into talks  trump signaled a tougher u s  approach to pakistan  warning that while it had  much to gain  by cooperating on afghanistan  it would have to immediately stop  harboring  islamist militants  who target  u s  troops and officials  but again  he provided no details of how he planned to convince pakistan to do so  u s  officials have long accused pakistan of failing to pursue top leaders of the taliban and the allied haqqani network and to end sanctuaries and support for the extremists from elements of the powerful military and army run intelligence agency  an allegation islamabad denies
