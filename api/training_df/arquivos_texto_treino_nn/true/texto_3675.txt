washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump was hit on friday by embarrassing leaks that a senior adviser was a  person of interest  in a probe of possible collusion with russia during last year s election campaign and that trump had boasted to russian officials of firing the man heading the investigation  the reports  emerging just as trump jetted off to saudi arabia on his first foreign trip as president  were likely to extend the turmoil engulfing his administration since the may  firing of former fbi director james comey  the washington post  citing sources familiar with the matter  did not identify the senior trump adviser except to say that the person of interest was close to trump  a republican who entered the white house four months ago  u s  law enforcement uses the term  a person of interest  to mean someone who is part of a criminal investigation but not arrested or formally accused of a crime  the person may be cooperating or have information of use to investigators  separately the new york times reported that trump boasted to russian officials at a white house meeting last week that firing comey relieved  great pressure  the president faced from a law enforcement probe into russian meddling in the  election    i just fired the head of the fbi  he was crazy  a real nut job   trump said  according to the times  which cited a document summarizing the meeting and read to it by an unnamed u s  official   i faced great pressure because of russia  that s taken off   trump met russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and russia s ambassador to washington in the oval office the day after trump fired comey  who was in charge of the russia election probe  the times said the document was based on notes taken from inside the oval office  reuters was not immediately able to verify the accuracy of that account  comey  who has not spoken publicly in the  days since he was fired  will testify in an open session of the u s  senate intelligence committee  which is investigating possible russian meddling in the  election   committee leaders said on friday he would appear sometime after the u s  memorial day holiday on may    i am hopeful that he will clarify for the american people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media   the committee chairman  republican richard burr  said in a statement announcing the appearance  public approval of trump has dropped to its lowest level since his inauguration  according to a reuters ipsos poll released on friday  the may   opinion poll found that  percent of adults approved of trump while  percent disapproved  the remaining  percent had  mixed feelings   u s  stocks immediately pared gains after the reports but still closed higher for a second straight day  earlier this week  investors dumped stocks in response to reports that trump in february had asked comey to stop investigating his former national security adviser  prompting accusations the president may have tried to hamper the probe   as the president has stated before   a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity   white house spokesman sean spicer said in a statement in response to the post report  after days of political tumult in washington  the justice department announced the appointment on thursday of a special counsel to look into russian interference in the  election and possible collusion by the trump campaign  the times report added to the impression given by trump himself in a television interview last week in which he said the russia issue was a factor in firing comey  the white house has given different versions of the reasons for the dismissal  asked about the times report  spicer said of the former fbi chief   by grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into russia s actions  james comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with russia    the investigation would have always continued  and obviously  the termination of comey would not have ended it   spicer said  adding that the real story was the leaks of  private and highly classified conversations   democrats  who have compared the widening scandal to the watergate break in and cover up that brought down republican former president richard nixon in   were quick to pounce on the latest reports  democratic senator edward markey called them  seismic revelations  and questioned whether the united states might be heading into a constitutional crisis    this is an inflection point in the entire russia collusion investigation   he told msnbc   it makes it very clear that what donald trump was trying to do was to end the russian investigation     this is what obstruction looks like   i faced great pressure because of russia  that s taken off    democratic senator patrick leahy said on twitter  republican representative scott taylor told cnn there was  no question  that trump had  some stumbles this week   but he added   i haven t lost my confidence in the president to be our president  i just haven t   before the latest reports  the white house had hoped to shift attention away from the political firestorm in washington to foreign policy as well as the president s ambitious pro business economic agenda in congress  trump s trip  which also includes stops in israel  italy and belgium next week  has been billed by the administration as a chance to visit places sacred to three of the world s major religions while giving him time to meet with arab  israeli and european leaders    trump  who has embraced what he describes as an  america first  approach to u s  foreign policy and international trade  is expected to be welcomed warmly by leaders in saudi arabia  and israel  lingering questions over his views on the iran nuclear deal  commitment to nato security and skepticism of the paris climate agreement  however  could generate tension at meetings with european counterparts in brussels and sicily
