washington  reuters    fresh off one foreign trip and preparing for another  donald trump was enjoying a period of relative calm   until the white house was rocked by a fresh controversy over contacts between the president s campaign and russia  for trump  who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making  this time the target was his eldest son  donald trump jr   whose meeting with a russian lawyer last year led to accusations that the president s son entertained working with russians to spread negative information about democrat hillary clinton   among trump s wide ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials  donald jr  s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on clinton was seen as problematic  a demonstration of the son s political inexperience  but not illegal   you can t shrug this off even though you know he s very likely going to be okay   said an outside trump adviser  who asked to remain unidentified   this is the president s namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president s son    there s no question in my mind that every person in the white house has some level of concern about this  otherwise it s malpractice   the adviser said  inside the white house  the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into russia s meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the trump campaign  benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then fbi director james comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor  white house officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president s agenda  the new incident erupted as trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm  his trip to warsaw and hamburg last week went fairly smoothly  although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his meeting with russian president vladimir putin  on wednesday  he is to depart to paris for talks with french president emmanuel macron and to participate in flag waving bastille day ceremonies  trump himself was described by the white house as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the russia investigation   he knows that he didn t do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do  and he doesn t like it when things get in the way   a senior white house official said  the president offered a restrained reaction  not resorting to twitter to launch a tirade against his critics  but issuing a brief statement praising his  high quality person  who showed  transparency  by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on tuesday   there was a sense among former campaign advisers that donald trump jr  had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting  they noted that it took place at a time when trump had a barebones staff and that his family members  initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign  were searching to carve out space for themselves   besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered  it s still not a smoking gun   said one former campaign adviser  among even republicans  there was dismay at the turn of events  conservative author quin hillyer wrote in a blog post that trump should step down for cozying up to russia   the blog link is here    the american people absolutely cannot trust trump s objectivity about russian intentions and russian actions   hillyer wrote   this is an utterly untenable situation  for the good of the country  trump must lance the boil  and resign   the outside trump adviser said the trump jr  case  unfortunately supports the narrative  advanced by trump s democratic opponents and propagated by what trump world feels is a left leaning news media   donald jr  is the nicest of nice guys  genuinely authentic   the adviser said   a lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody  why did it have to be don jr
