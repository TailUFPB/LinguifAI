washington  reuters    the u s  foreign service has seen its top ranks shrink under secretary of state rex tillerson  according to a letter written by the head of the union representing u s  diplomats and seen by reuters on wednesday  the number of career ambassadors  the foreign service s highest personal rank granted to only a handful of u s  diplomats  has dropped by  percent  according to the letter by american foreign service association  afsa  president barbara stephenson  the number of career ambassadors declined to two from five with this year s retirement of william brownfield  kristie kenney and victoria nuland  who held top state department jobs  the next rung down  with the rank of  career minister   has shrunk to  from   the letter said  and the one beneath  of  minister counselor   has dropped to  from  in early september and continues to decline   these numbers are hard to square with the stated agenda of making state and the foreign service stronger  were the u s  military to face such a decapitation of its leadership ranks  i would expect a public outcry   stephenson said in the letter to members of the union  since taking office on feb    tillerson has embraced the white house s proposal   rejected by key members of congress   to cut the state department budget by about  percent and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency s operations and deciding how to reorganize them  the state department did not dispute the numbers cited in the letter  but an agency spokesman who declined to be identified said that  suggestions that drastic cuts to our foreign service ranks are taking place are simply not accurate   the spokesman said the  percent reduction in the number of career ambassadors was misleading because there were only five at the start of the year and that tillerson  plans to nominate individuals for this role in the near future   the spokesman did not provide apples to apples comparisons on the number of diplomats with the rank of career minister and minister counselor  but did give figures for a broader set of senior u s  diplomats   as of october     the senior foreign service is comprised of  diplomats  with  waiting for congress to attest their promotion into the senior ranks   he said   once these promotions are attested  there will be   senior foreign service officers  a number nearly identical to the   senior foreign service officers at the same point in    according to stephenson s letter  the u s  diplomatic corps is also shrinking at the bottom rung  the letter said  intake into the foreign service at state will drop from  in  to around  new entry level officers joining     in    the number of people applying to take the competitive exam to enter the u s  foreign service is projected to be cut by more than half this year from over   people in   she said  an afsa spokesman said that figure was for calendar   the state department spokesman said   took the exam in fiscal   which ended on sept    down from   in fiscal  and   in fiscal    this trend corresponds with an improving economy and similar trends have been observed in the past   he said  in her letter  stephenson noted congressional support for state department funding and argued that tillerson was weakening the u s  foreign service   given this clear congressional intent  we have to ask  why such a focus on slashing staffing at state  why such a focus on decapitating leadership  how do these actions serve the stated agenda of making the state department stronger   she wrote   where then  does the impetus come from to weaken the american foreign service   where is the mandate to pull the foreign service team from the field and forfeit the game to our adversaries   she added  while not directly addressing those questions  the state department spokesman said   the goal of the redesign has always been to find new ways to best leverage our team s brains  ingenuity  and commitment to serving our nation s interests
