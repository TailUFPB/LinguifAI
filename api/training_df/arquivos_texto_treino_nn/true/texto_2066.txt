mattis would press massoud barzani  president of the autonomous kurdistan regional government  to call off a planned referendum on independence  iraq s kurds have said they will hold the referendum on sept   despite concerns from iraq s neighbors who have kurdish minorities within their borders and a u s  request to postpone it  however  a senior kurdish official said the kurds may consider the possibility of a delay in return for financial and political concessions from the central government in baghdad  the united states and other western nations fear the vote could ignite a new conflict
