washington hagerstown  md   reuters    president donald trump on friday fired his chief strategist steve bannon in the latest white house shake up  removing a far right architect of his  election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti globalization agenda  bannon s firing  a year and a day after trump hired him as his campaign chief  put an abrupt end to the rabble rousing political provocateur s tumultuous tenure in a white house riven with rivalries and back stabbing during which he clashed with more moderate factions  he was instrumental in some of trump s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several muslim majority countries  abandoning the paris climate accord  tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration  he was no friend of the republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president s hard line conservative supporters  white house officials said trump had told new chief of staff john kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting  and that bannon s fate was sealed by comments published on  wednesday in the american prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration  trump  seven months into his presidency  has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the virginia college town of charlottesville last saturday and his attacks on fellow republicans  some republicans had even begun questioning trump s capacity to govern  as trump came under fire from republicans including two former presidents  and from business leaders and u s  allies abroad  he faced mounting calls for bannon s ouster  critics had accused bannon of harboring anti semitic and white nationalist sentiments   white house chief of staff john kelly and steve bannon have mutually agreed today would be steve s last day   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement  bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right wing breitbart news on friday afternoon  the website said  prior to joining the trump campaign  he had spearheaded breitbart s shift into a forum for the  alt right   a loose online confederation of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites  bannon said his departure from the white house signals a major shift for the trump agenda   the trump presidency that we fought for  and won  is over   bannon told the conservative weekly standard    i just think his ability to get anything done   particularly the bigger things  like the wall  the bigger  broader things that we fought for  it s just gonna be that much harder   bannon said  he said he would use breitbart to attack opponents of the  populist and nationalist agenda he championed  including establishment republicans   i am definitely going to crush the opposition   bannon said  he became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a trump white house that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff  a national security adviser  two communications directors and a chief spokesman  trump s presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in congress and a special counsel named by the justice department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and russia  something both trump and moscow deny  bannon    is a former u s  navy officer  goldman sachs investment banker and hollywood movie producer  he had been in a precarious position before but trump opted to keep him  in part because he had played a major role in trump s november  election victory over democrat hillary clinton and was backed by many of the president s most loyal rank and file supporters  democrats cheered bannon s departure   steve bannon s firing is welcome news   said nancy pelosi  the top house of representatives democrat   the trump administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff  but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions   wall street indexes and the u s  dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in washington intensified doubts about trump s ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts  after a late morning boost following reports of bannon s ouster  the dollar and u s  equities lost ground  bannon felt a close ideological connection to trump s populist tendencies and  america first  message  like trump  he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing american military involvement in iraq and afghanistan  the decision to fire bannon could undermine trump s support among far right voters but might ease tensions within the white house and with party leaders  republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul  trump ran into trouble after saying anti racism demonstrators in charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests  and that there were  very fine people  among both groups  those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow republicans  top corporate executives and some close allies  bannon s departure removes a large source of friction on the white house staff  but does not herald a significant shift by trump toward the center on major policy issues  three administration officials said   a good deal of what was attributed to bannon  for example on china trade and restricting immigration  and the border wall  all came before bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him   said one white house official  speaking on the condition of anonymity  bannon has been a hawk on china  urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit beijing s help to rein in north korea  in his comments to american prospect  bannon said the united states was in an economic war with china      a second official said the biggest winners from bannon s departure are national security adviser h r  mcmaster  gary cohn  trump s chief economic adviser  and trump s daughter ivanka and her husband  jared kushner  bannon s departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the white house  such as sebastian gorka  some conservative activists expressed disappointment in bannon s ouster  republicans were largely quiet  though moderate republican congresswoman ileana ros lehtinen said she was glad bannon was out but that the administration  must work to build bridges  not destroy them   by the time trump had hired bannon as campaign manager  the real estate magnate had already vanquished his republican opponents for the party s presidential nomination  asked about bannon on tuesday  trump called him  a friend of mine  but downplayed his contribution to his election victory   mr  bannon came on very late  you know that  i went through  senators  governors and i won all the primaries  mr  bannon came on very much later than that  and i like him  he is a good man  he is not a racist   trump said
