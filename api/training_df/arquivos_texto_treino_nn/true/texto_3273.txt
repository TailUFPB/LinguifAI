washington  reuters    a group of republican lawmakers sent a letter to president donald trump on friday urging him not to reverse former president barack obama s opening to cuba even as white house aides moved closer to completing a plan that could tighten rules on trade and travel to the island  with the cuba policy review approaching its final stages  both sides of the issue have stepped up lobbying to sway trump s decision on how far to go in rolling back measures that obama implemented after a  breakthrough with america s former cold  war foe  in the letter  seven of trump s fellow republicans expressed  deep concern  that he is considering rescinding obama s policies and said that such a move would  incentivize cuba to once again become dependent on countries like russia and china   the warning reflected growing unease on capitol hill over returning to a more contentious approach to communist ruled cuba  even within a republican party that has traditionally hewed to a harder line against havana  senior officials at the national security council were meeting on friday to craft recommendations that will be sent to the principals committee   trump s top foreign policy advisers   and then to the president  people familiar with the matter said  though divisions remain within the administration  trump could make an announcement within weeks  possibly as early as mid  to late june in a speech in miami  u s  officials have said  speaking on condition of anonymity  trump s changes are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored two years ago after more than five decades of hostility  administration officials say  among the options under consideration are banning u s  companies from doing business with cuban enterprises tied to the military and tightening rules on americans traveling there  according to people familiar with the discussions   a white house official  asked about the latest meeting  said the cuba review is still under way and  not final   the u s  airline and travel industries have made clear they do not want to see reinstatement of cuba restrictions  but trump has come under heavy pressure from cuban american lawmakers  including senator marco rubio and representative mario diaz balart  to roll back obama s rapprochement   my hope is that when the administration is done with their review  they don t let one or two voices overwhelm what is in the interest of the united states   representative tom emmer  a signatory to the letter  told reuters  one of four pro engagement republicans who met with white house officials on thursday  emmer said they urged the administration not to go too far in rolling back obama s measures  trump threatened shortly after his election in november to  terminate  obama s approach unless cuba made concessions  something it is unlikely to do  obama implemented his normalization measures through executive actions  and trump has the power to undo much of it
