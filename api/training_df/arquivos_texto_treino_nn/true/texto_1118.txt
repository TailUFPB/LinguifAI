washington  reuters    when donald trump faced criticism from advocacy groups for not including more women and minorities in his cabinet last january  the incoming administration promised that the lower rungs of the bureaucracy would ultimately look more diverse   now  recently available government data on the ethnic and gender make up of the broader trump administration shows that with over   mid level political jobs filled by mid year the appointees look much like the top leadership  mostly white and male  office of personnel management numbers analyzed by reuters show that  percent of such appointees were non hispanic white and  percent were men   by comparison  in the final year of barack obama s democratic administration  non hispanic whites made up  percent of that group and men accounted for  percent   closer to what the u s  population looks like  non hispanic whites account for  percent and men make up  percent  according to  census data   graphic  tmsnrt rs    this administration so far has not in any direct sense prioritized diversity   said max stier  president of the partnership for public service  a non partisan group that tracks federal hiring  when presented with reuters  findings  out of the trump administration s  top cabinet level positions   are filled by white men   asked to comment on the mid level personnel data  white house spokeswoman lindsay walters said trump had a long history of promoting women and pointed to last week s nomination of kirstjen nielsen to lead the department of homeland security    he will continue to elevate and empower women to top posts in his administration   walters said  she declined to discuss trump s views on the ethnicity of political appointees  one day before trump took office on jan    his then spokesman sean spicer responded to criticism of the cabinet s lineup by saying that members were picked on their merits and  appointments across the broader federal bureaucracy would satisfy demands for more diversity    people  will  look at and respect the level of diversity throughout his entire administration   he told reporters  the mid level political positions  known as  schedule c  and  non career ses  posts  numbered   in june  according to most recent data published in late september  how many more of those jobs have been filled since and whether their demographics has changed will be known at the end of the year  when third quarter numbers are expected  the positions include office managers  aides  policy experts and schedulers who are hired by top appointees  such as cabinet secretaries and their deputies  the mid level bureaucrats act as a link between political leadership and over two million career civil servants who tend to work for multiple administrations   in recent decades  such jobs would account for about half of some   positions that get filled anew with every change of administration  the opm does not publish data on the more senior positions  the personnel office has published data sorted by gender that goes back to  and by ethnicity since   allowing comparisons with only two past administrations  some political analysts say the profile of the new group of mid level officials largely reflects a lower share of minorities among republican voters and the fact that the republican party has weaker ties to organizations that promote diversity and gender equality   it s just a smaller set of folks who organize around those things and are connected to the republican party   said david lewis  a political scientist at vanderbilt university who studies presidential appointments  in fact  this administration s numbers are similar to those under the previous republican administration of george w  bush  between    the only bush years covered by opm gender  race and ethnicity data  men made up  percent of mid level staff and  percent described themselves as non hispanic white  however  the united states has become more diverse over the past decade  making the numbers for this administration less representative of america s demographic makeup than was the case under bush  in   the last full year of the bush administration  non hispanic whites made up  percent of the general population  now that share is  percentage points lower  u s  census figures show   among republican registered voters  the share of those identifying themselves as non hispanic white has edged down from  percent in  to  percent just before the  presidential election  according to the pew research center  women also have a larger share of overall u s  jobs than during the bush years  their  percent share of mid level political jobs in the current administration is a notch below the  percent average they had in    in    the final years of bill clinton s presidency captured in the opm data  that share averaged  percent
