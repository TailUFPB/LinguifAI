washington  reuters    former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton says in her new book that donald trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage in a campaign debate and she wonders if she should have told him to  back up  you creep   in audio excerpts of the book  what happened  aired on wednesday on msnbc  clinton described her  campaign as  joyful  humbling  infuriating and just plain baffling  and acknowledged she failed her millions of supporters by losing to trump in the november election  in the excerpts  clinton described the oct   debate in st  louis in which trump followed her closely about the stage  lurking behind her as she fielded questions from a live television audience  the debate came two days after an audiotape emerged in which trump was heard bragging about groping women   this is not ok  i thought   clinton says   it was the second presidential debate and donald trump was looming behind me   we were on a small stage and no matter where i walked  he followed me closely  staring at me  making faces  it was incredibly uncomfortable  he was literally breathing down my neck  my skin crawled   clinton said   it was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching   well  what would you do   do you stay calm  keep smiling and carry on as if he weren t repeatedly invading your space  or do you turn  look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly   back up  you creep  get away from me  i know you love to intimidate women but you can t intimidate me    clinton says she chose the first option   i kept my cool  aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off   she says  but clinton questions whether she should have chosen the second option   it certainly would have been better tv   she says   maybe i have over learned the lesson of staying calm  biting my tongue  digging my fingernails into a clenched fist  smiling all the while  determined to present a composed face to the world   clinton says writing the book  due to be released in the coming weeks   wasn t easy    every day that i was a candidate for president  i knew that millions of people were counting on me and i couldn t bear the idea of letting them down  but i did   she says   i couldn t get the job done
