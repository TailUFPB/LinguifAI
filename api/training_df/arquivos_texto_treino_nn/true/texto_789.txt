seoul  reuters    president donald trump will wrap up his visit to seoul on wednesday with a major speech on north korea and then shift focus to china  where he is expected to press a reluctant president xi jinping to tighten the screws further on pyongyang   u s  officials say  trump s address to south korea s national assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach  threatening to use america s full military might against north korea if needed  but also offering it a diplomatic opening to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff  while trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge  his more conciliatory rhetoric toward north korea could help lower tensions between washington and pyongyang that have put much of the east asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict  it contrasted markedly with trump s earlier threats to  totally destroy  north korea if it threatened the united states  and the personal insults he exchanged with north korean leader kim jong un  it remains to be seen  however  whether the unpredictable trump  in his final day on north korea s doorstep  will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the north korean issue  trump s official  talking points  for his asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast south korea s  amazing rise  with north korea s  sad  backward  state  and to urge resolve against pyongyang  according to a confidential document reviewed by reuters  he is also expected to condemn pyongyang for its poor human rights record  trump will then fly to beijing where  according to senior administration officials  he will try to convince xi to squeeze north korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports  coal imports and financial transactions  previewing his beijing visit  trump told a news conference in seoul on tuesday that china and north korea s other giant neighbor  russia  were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting north korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs   president xi   has been very helpful  we ll find out how helpful soon   trump said  but it is far from clear if xi  who has just consolidated his power at a communist party congress  will agree to do more  china says its leverage over pyongyang is exaggerated by the west  and points to its support in the u n  security council for recent sanctions on north korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests   on this issue  china s position and stance is already very clear and staunch   chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said on monday   everyone can see clearly that we don t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing   but with trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with north korea   something that china has long urged   he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on north korea  which relies on beijing for more than  percent of its trade  north korean leader kim jong un  however  has seemed willing to risk snubbing china when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  at the same time  xi may be mindful that trump has held off on trade actions against china that he loudly threatened during the  presidential campaign to give beijing more time to make progress on north korea  for his part  xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when trump hosted him at the mar a lago estate in florida in april  the  bromance  is set to continue when xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for trump s visit starting on wednesday  trump is expected to go to the forbidden city  possibly guided by xi  and participate in an inspection of chinese troops  though china has released few other details
