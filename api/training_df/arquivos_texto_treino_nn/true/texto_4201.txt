detroit new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump s  buy american  hire american  executive order on tuesday left questions about how the government would enforce the order and whether it would make a real difference in output and employment  according to steel executives and analysts       buy american  provisions already exist in u s  law but policing them has been difficult because of waivers granted to foreign companies that undercut their u s  counterparts on pricing  earlier on tuesday  trump ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring american companies to see if they are actually benefiting  especially the u s  steel industry  trump s executive order promises to properly police those provisions  but avoided detail about how that will happen        bill hickey  president of chicago based lapham hickey steel  which has seven steel mills in the midwest and northeast  said he has heard talk of  buy american  for decades  but american or foreign contractors frequently find loopholes to use imported steel        politicians all talk the same  but at the end of the day it just doesn t work   hickey said  citing waivers to existing provisions       charles bradford of bradford research said focusing on  buy american  for u s  steel does not take into account that some steel products   including tin plate and semi finished products   are not made in the united states  so if enforced improperly  it could cause supply problems in a u s  market in which up to  percent of steel was imported in the first quarter of this year        the people who have pushed for this don t have a clue and they don t know math   said bradford  cutting off the supply of goods not made in the united states would create fresh problems for u s  companies  he said  in the construction industry  there also are concerns over  too strict a definition of what constitutes u s  made steel products   said kenneth simonson  chief economist of the associated general contractors of america   simonson cited concerns with steel that might have been melted down from scrap metal that could have come from outside the united states  for example  and tracing its origins before that point  trump s white house track record so far also helps fuel skepticism inside the industry  instead of bold action promised last year by then candidate trump on the north american free trade agreement  on china  and free trade agreements  the new administration has  not shown much evidence of doing so   said keybanc capital markets steel analyst philip gibbs       i m a lot less optimistic than i was three and a half months ago because so far what i ve seen coming out of the trump administration is the same as the prior administration   he added  as a result  gibbs said investors should dial back expectations that trump will do anything meaningful on trade  or on infrastructure which is where such an order could make a difference   investors seemed to shrug off tuesday s executive order    nucor corp shares closed up   percent at     ak steel holding corp gained a penny to end at    and united states steel corp closed down   percent at          ak steel did not respond to requests for comment  nucor and u s  steel both welcomed the president s executive order      the move was welcomed by labor unions  the united steelworkers said that under current practice   contractors often try to avoid the law through loopholes to buy cheap and often substandard foreign products like many from china   thomas gibson  chief executive of lobby group the american iron and steel institute  said in a statement that  buy american  provisions  are vital to the health of the domestic steel industry  and have helped create manufacturing jobs and build american infrastructure        veteran steel industry analyst michelle applebaum said while it remains to be seen how thoroughly the trump administration will police the steel industry  the executive order sends a clear message to steel importers      trump has just created more risk for anyone who wants to import steel   she said   if he puts money behind enforcement that will force people to play by the rules and that will be a good thing
