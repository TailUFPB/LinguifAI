washington  reuters    the trump administration briefed congressional staff this week on how the white house was considering non proliferation standards in a potential pact to sell nuclear reactor technology to saudi arabia  but did not indicate whether allowing uranium enrichment would be part of any deal  congressional aides said  non proliferation advocates worry that allowing saudi arabia to enrich fuel in a nuclear power deal could also enable it to one day covertly produce fissile material and set off an arms race with arch rival iran that could spread more broadly throughout the middle east   senate foreign relations committee staff members were briefed by state department and department of energy officials in a meeting on wednesday  the aides said  they learned the administration  is working to develop a position on non proliferation standards  should they begin talks with saudi arabia on a civilian nuclear cooperation pact known as a  agreement  a committee aide said   the administration is still mulling whether any agreement would allow uranium enrichment  the aide said   the race to build saudi arabia s first nuclear power reactors is heating up among u s   south korean  chinese and russian companies   u s  energy secretary rick perry visited saudi arabia last week  telling reuters then that new talks between the two allies on a  agreement would start soon  an agreement would allow u s  companies to participate in saudi arabia s civilian nuclear program  riyadh has said it wants to be self sufficient in producing nuclear fuel and that it is not interested in diverting nuclear technology to military use  in previous talks  saudi arabia has refused to sign an agreement with washington that would deprive it of enriching uranium  uranium fuel for reactors is enriched to only about  percent  lower than the  percent level for fissile material in nuclear bombs  some senators with proliferation concerns worry the administration is moving too quickly on talks about nuclear plants and enrichment with saudi without consulting congress  as required by a  law  the president is required to keep the committees in the house and senate that deal with foreign relations  fully and currently informed  on any initiative and talks relating to new or amended  agreements   we re frustrated by the lack of briefings and having to yet again learn about potential foreign policy developments from the press   a congressional aide said  a day before the senate briefing  a report by bloomberg citing sources said that the administration may allow uranium enrichment as part of an agreement  the congressional aide said there are concerns that plans for an agreement are only being conducted by a small number of people controlled by the white house   it also appears that this is policy being driven out of the white house  which makes congressional oversight that much harder   said the aide  if lawmakers oppose a civilian nuclear deal signed by the president they can try to fight it with legislation or other measures  the trump administration and the previous obama administration have pushed for selling nuclear power technology abroad  partly to keep the country competitive with russia and china in nuclear innovation  a state department official said the united states and saudi arabia have been in talks since  regarding a  agreement but declined to comment on the discussions  energy department officials did not immediately comment on the briefing  toshiba owned westinghouse is in talks with other u s   based companies to form a consortium for a bid in a multibillion dollar tender for two nuclear reactors in saudi arabia  winning a bid would be a big step for westinghouse  it went into chapter  bankruptcy this year and abandoned plans to build two advanced  reactors in the united states
