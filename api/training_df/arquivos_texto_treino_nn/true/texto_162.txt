washington  reuters    congressional republicans reached a deal on final tax legislation on wednesday  clearing the way for final votes next week on a package that would slash the u s  corporate tax rate to  percent and cut taxes for wealthy americans   under an agreement between the house of representatives and the senate  the corporate tax would be  percentage point higher than the  percent rate earlier proposed  but still far below the current headline rate of  percent  a deep tax reduction that corporations have sought for years  as they finalized the biggest tax overhaul in  years  republicans wavered for weeks on whether to slash the top income tax rate for the wealthy  in the end  they agreed to cut it to  percent from the current   percent  that was despite criticism from democrats that the republican plan tilts toward the rich and corporations  offering little to the middle class   i think we ve got a pretty good deal   senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters  the emerging agreement would repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax  set up to ensure profitable companies pay some federal tax  and expand a proposed    cap for state and local property tax deductions to include income tax  lawmakers and sources familiar with the negotiations said  it was also expected to limit the popular mortgage interest deduction to home loans of no more than    and provide the owners of pass through businesses  such as sole proprietorships and partnerships  with a  percent business income deduction   the deal would gut part of the obamacare health law by repealing a federal fine on individuals who fail to obtain health insurance  while authorizing oil drilling in alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge  both add on measures were part of nailing down sufficient votes for passage  moving the corporate tax target rate to  percent from  percent gave tax writers enough revenue to make the tax cuts immediate  republican senator ron johnson told reporters   news of the deal began circulating just before a formal house senate conference committee began debating it in public  leading democrats to decry the gathering as a sham  a final bill could be formally unveiled on friday  with decisive votes expected next week in both chambers  despite expressions of confidence about passage from party leaders  the path to a final vote in the senate could still be perilous  republicans  who hold a   majority in the  seat senate  can lose no more than two votes on the tax bill    republican senator john mccain  who has brain cancer  was in a military hospital to undergo treatment for the side effects of cancer therapy  at least three other senate republicans still seemed to be undecided  including arizona s jeff flake  who was not specific about his hesitation in brief hallway remarks to reporters  bob corker  a fiscal hawk  said he was undecided on whether to support the bill  he told reporters   my deficit concerns have not been alleviated   susan collins  who helped sink her fellow republicans  efforts to dismantle former democratic president barack obama s healthcare law earlier this year  said she would not make a final decision on which way to vote  until i see the bill   in a white house speech  trump said the internal revenue service had advised that if he signs the bill into law before christmas  the tax cuts would take effect in february  the irs had no immediate comment  but a trump administration official said the irs would have to readjust its paycheck tax withholding tables for employers and that new withholding levels would take effect in february  under the bill  tax returns being filed next year for  would not be affected  but returns filed in  for  would  trump appeared in the white house with several middle class families he said would benefit from the tax bill  the joint committee on taxation and the congressional budget office  both nonpartisan research units of congress  have forecast that wealthy taxpayers and businesses would gain disproportionately from the debt financed republican proposals  as drafted  the republican plan was expected to add as much as    trillion to the   trillion national debt in  years  with that in view  republicans have been urgently trying to finalize details of their package without increasing its estimated impact on the federal deficit and the debt  at a tax event held by democrats  moody s analytics chief economist mark zandi said the republican bill  if enacted  would cause interest rates to rise  meaning the benefits of a lower corporate tax rate would be  completely washed out   stock markets have rallied for months in anticipation of lower taxes for businesses  the benchmark dow jones industrial average index  dji closed up   percent at     with their defeat on tuesday in an alabama special u s  senate election  republicans were under pressure to complete their tax overhaul before christmas and before a new democratic senator can be formally seated in the senate   democrat doug jones  victory in alabama came hours ahead of the final tax deal  when jones arrives in washington  the republicans  already slim senate majority will narrow to    fast action by republicans on taxes would prevent jones from upsetting expected vote tallies since he will not likely be seated until late december or early january  senate democratic leader chuck schumer called on republicans to delay a vote on overhauling the tax code for the first time in  years until jones can be seated  but that was unlikely   who would ve thought they could have made the bill even less favorable to the middle class and more slanted towards the wealthy   schumer told a news conference
