chicago  reuters    a year long audit of the program overseeing u s  labs that handle lethal pathogens such as ebola and anthrax found overworked safety inspectors  an absence of independent review and weak biosafety protections that could expose lab workers and the public to harm  a government report will say on tuesday  the report by the government accountability office to congress followed a series of mishaps in which dangerous pathogens were inadvertently released  the report  seen by reuters  concluded that the federal select agent program needs an overhaul  the gao audited laboratory safety oversight following errors that could have exposed dozens of people to live anthrax bacteria and the deadly toxin ricin  its report will guide questioning of officials before the house energy and commerce committee s oversight subcommittee on thursday  the federal select agent program is jointly run by the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  and the animal and plant health inspection service  aphis  of the u s  department of agriculture  according to the report  a chief concern is that the program is too focused on physical security measures  such as preventing theft from labs  and needs to focus more on biosafety issues that could protect researchers and the wider public from errors  the gao report also noted that many of the labs using high risk pathogens for research belong to either cdc or the usda  and recommended that congress consider setting up a fully independent oversight body to remove potential conflicts of interest   the select agent program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight   the report stated  safety lapses in cdc labs captured headlines in  when scientists at a high level biosecurity lab did not properly inactivate anthrax bacteria before sending the material to labs with fewer safeguards  more than  scientists were exposed to potentially live anthrax  though no one fell ill   in the months that followed  the food and drug administration disclosed the discovery of decades old vials of smallpox in a storage closet  while a u s  army lab erroneously shipped live anthrax to nearly  labs worldwide  to address concerns of conflict of interest  cdc and aphis have made structural changes to increase the program s independence  but according to the gao report  the program has not undergone a comprehensive risk management review  even as problems with lab safety continue to come to light  as recently as last november  the department of homeland security found a private lab inadvertently shipped ricin   a lethal poison   to one of its training centers on multiple occasions in    considering the type of research we re talking about  we should have a much more robust  systematic oversight approach  that seems to be lacking   said an aide to the house committee who declined to be identified  to avoid conflicts of interest  inspections of aphis laboratories are supposed to be carried out by the cdc  and inspections of cdc labs are to be carried out by aphis  but the report revealed that at least three times in   aphis inspected its own laboratories  partly because there is no process in place to ensure compliance  the report also cited excessive workloads for inspectors  which delay inspection reports and make it harder to retain personnel  in some cases  inspectors have been assigned to tasks outside of their expertise  for example  the gao found that an aphis physical security expert was asked to inspect ventilation systems   a critical protection against the accidental release of dangerous pathogens   short of a move by congress to create an independent oversight agency  gao recommended that cdc and aphis officials conduct a risk assessment of the select agent program and how it handles conflicts of interest  it also recommended that program officials shift inspection priorities to focus on high risk activities in labs and develop a joint plan to train and hire inspectors   the health and human services department  which oversees cdc  and the usda  which runs aphis  agreed with many of these recommendations  according to the report  officials from the cdc and aphis will testify at the thursday hearing
