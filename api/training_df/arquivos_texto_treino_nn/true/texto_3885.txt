new york  reuters    former u s  secretary of state condoleezza rice said on monday she would prefer that president donald trump not criticize judges and the media but that u s  democratic institutions can withstand such comments  speaking in an interview  rice also described trump as having a somewhat  transactional  view of foreign relations but she broadly endorsed his approach of seeking to enlist china s help to get north korea to rein in its nuclear program  asked about trump lashing out at judges when rulings go against him and describing the media as  the enemy of the people   rice replied   it s language that i would prefer not to hear   but i don t think that you can erode the scaffolding of democracy in the united states   she added during a tour to promote her book  democracy  stories from the long road to freedom    rice  national security adviser and secretary of state under republican former president george w  bush  is now a professor at stanford university  she described u s  institutions as  very strong  and said trump  may have even found himself a bit surprised by how constraining that scaffolding really is   courts have blocked parts of two trump executive orders that sought to temporarily ban entry to the united states for people from six muslim majority countries  in a  minute interview  rice said the united states needed to find a way to punish russia for its alleged interference in the  u s  election but without engaging in  tit for tat  retaliation by meddling in russian elections  she suggested prosecuting anyone in the united states who took part in what intelligence agencies believe was a deliberate effort to sway the presidential election in trump s favor  and to consider putting sanctions  such as visa bans  on people who did so from abroad  rice  who has interspersed periods in public service with  academic posts  suggested trump  a new york real estate magnate  may see foreign policy more in terms of striking deals than finding common interests  before meeting chinese president xi jinping last month  trump suggested china might get better trade deals with the united states if it put more pressure on north korea to restrain its nuclear and missile programs   the president still has a kind of transactional view of international politics but  in fact  interests are more enduring than transactions   rice said  however  rice endorsed trump s policy of trying to enlist chinese help against north korea  which is believed to have conducted five nuclear tests since  and to be developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike the u s  mainland  china  the north s main trading partner and the closest thing it has to an ally  has historically been unwilling to tighten the economic screws on pyongyang for fear of triggering a collapse and sending millions of refugees across the border  rice said the u s  task was to convince the chinese that they had to choose between doing  really hard things to bring this regime into line or we will have to do harsh things   the former secretary of state also said north korea s current leader  kim jong un  is far less predictable than his father  kim jong il  and may not be fully rational   kim jong un is far more reckless than his father     i wonder if he is not a little unhinged   she said   i wonder if the chinese aren t beginning to reconsider their view that     a stable north korean regime  even if it is nuclear armed  is better than an unstable one
