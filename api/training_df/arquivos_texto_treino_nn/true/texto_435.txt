washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s push for a major military buildup suffered a setback on thursday when the house of representatives put plans on hold to fully fund the federal government through next sept   and instead resorted to temporary measures freezing spending at current levels  with a dec   deadline rapidly approaching for either extending federal funding in some way or triggering a partial government shutdown  the house next week will advance a temporary patch  according to a senior aide  and try to provide money through dec    that will give congress more time to craft a second patch  the aide said  to operate the government through january  while the moves  if successful  would keep the pentagon running at last year s levels  they are far from republican hopes of handing trump about   billion in fiscal  funding for the military s regular operations    billion above last year  for months  republican and democratic leaders in the house and senate have been working behind the scenes to broker a deal on overall spending levels for the current fiscal year  which already is two months old  democrats are demanding increases in non defense spending if military budgets are pumped up as trump has demanded  it is unclear whether republicans in congress and trump will allow unrelated controversial measures to be attached to either of the temporary spending bills  democrats  whose votes normally are needed in the republican controlled congress to pass spending bills  have been hoping to use their political leverage to win passage of an immigration measure by attaching it to an end of year appropriations bill  that bill would provide legal protections to  dreamers   the hundreds of thousands of undocumented people who came to the united states as children and have established roots  house speaker paul ryan  asked about the possibility of attaching the immigration provision to a spending bill  said he wanted to resolve the issue  but he noted that congress is under a march deadline to pass the dreamers measure  saying  we ve got other deadlines in front of that   referring to the spending bills
