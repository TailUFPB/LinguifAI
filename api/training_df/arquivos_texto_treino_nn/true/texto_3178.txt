washington  reuters    the white house has not settled on a plan for working with congress to raise the federal debt limit  u s  budget director mick mulvaney said on thursday  even as the deadline loomed for the government to increase its borrowing authority  the trump administration has urged congress to increase the debt limit before it heads out for its august recess  but mulvaney said officials had not decided what form the legislation should take   there are various thoughts about how to get something passed  but i don t think we ve settled on how to move forward yet   mulvaney told reporters at a briefing   will it be a clean debt ceiling vote  will it be a debt ceiling vote with some type of reforms attached to it  i don t think we ve settled on that    the u s  government has a legal limit on how much it can borrow  currently set at about    trillion  the limit can be increased only by a vote of congress  the white house has sent mixed signals on how the debt limit should be handled by lawmakers   treasury secretary steven mnuchin asked lawmakers to pass a bill without any measures attached to it  however  mulvaney  a conservative republican  was known to favor using the debt limit as leverage to get spending cuts during his time in congress  before he was tapped to be budget director       he downplayed any disagreements within the administration  saying it was not unusual for a treasury secretary and a budget director to have different views on the debt limit    it is not a source of division right now in the white house  nor is it a source of division in the party   he said  but on capitol hill  the house freedom caucus  an influential group of about three dozen conservative republican lawmakers to which mulvaney once belonged  has called for any increase in the debt ceiling to be linked to reforms that cut unnecessary spending and work toward balancing the u s  budget  freedom caucus leader mark meadows said on thursday he favored such a conditional raising of the debt ceiling by about    trillion  which he believes may be somewhat less than what the trump administration wants   there s a number of us who are talking about a    trillion range  as long as there are some structural reforms  some other things that could go along with that   meadows said in the house speaker s lobby  republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress  generally  conservative republicans have attempted to use the debt limit to push fiscal reform  while democrats and moderate republicans have opposed such ultimatums  lower tax revenues this year have forced the u s  treasury to borrow more money to cover the federal budget deficit  which may lead to the government hitting its legal debt limit sooner than expected  experts say  mnuchin said monday that the government would be able to pay its bills at least through early september
