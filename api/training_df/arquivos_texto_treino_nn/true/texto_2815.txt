washington  reuters    the u s  environmental protection agency is in the early stages of launching a debate about climate change that could air on television   challenging scientists to prove the widespread view that global warming is a serious threat  the head of the agency said  the move comes as the administration of president donald trump seeks to roll back a slew of obama era regulations limiting carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels  and begins a withdrawal from the paris climate agreement   a global pact to stem planetary warming through emissions cuts   there are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered  about climate change    epa administrator scott pruitt told reuters in an interview late on monday    who better to do that than a group of scientists    getting together and having a robust discussion for all the world to see   he added without explaining how the scientists would be chosen  asked if he thought the debate should be televised  pruitt said   i think so  i think so  i mean  i don t know yet  but you want this to be open to the world  you want this to be on full display  i think the american people would be very interested in consuming that  i think they deserve it   pruitt  one of the most controversial figures in the trump administration  has repeatedly expressed doubts about climate change   one of the main points of contention in his narrow confirmation by the senate   while acknowledging the planet is warming  pruitt says he questions the gravity of the problem and the need for regulations that require companies to take costly measures to reduce their carbon footprint   it is a question about how much we contribute to it  how do we measure that with precision  and by the way  are we on an unsustainable path  and is it causing an existential threat   he said in the interview  since taking up his role at epa  he has emerged as one of the more prolific trump cabinet appointees  taking steps to undo more than two dozen regulations  and influencing trump s decision to pull the united states from the paris climate change deal  agreed by nearly  countries in   pruitt rejected global criticism of the united states for pulling out of the climate deal  which trump has said would have cost america trillions of dollars without benefit   we have nothing to be apologetic about   pruitt said   it was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an america first strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue   pruitt said the united states had already cut its carbon output to the lowest levels in nearly  years without mandates  thanks mainly to increased use of natural gas   which burns cleaner than coal  pruitt said his desire for the agency to host an ongoing climate change debate was inspired by two articles published in april   one in the wall street journal by theoretical physicist steve koonin  who served as undersecretary of energy under obama   and one by conservative columnist brett stephens in the new york times   koonin s article made the case that climate science should use the  red team blue team  methodology used by the national security community to test assumptions  stephens  article criticized claims of complete certainty in climate science  saying that it  traduces the spirit of science   pruitt said scientists should not scoff at the idea of participating in these debates   if you re going to win and if you re so certain about it  come and do your deal  they shouldn t be scared of the debate and discussion   he said  pruitt said debate is not necessarily aimed at undermining the   endangerment finding   the scientific determination that carbon dioxide harms human health that formed the basis for the democratic obama administration s regulation of greenhouse gases  he said there may be a legal basis to challenge the finding but would prefer congress weigh in on the matter  in the interview  pruitt added that he intended to deal  very aggressively  with automakers that use devices to cheat emissions tests  and would also seek to boost accountability for companies to clean up polluted sites under the superfund program   he said epa was also not ready to decide yet on a change proposed by trump s special adviser carl icahn to the u s  biofuels program  that would shift the burden of blending biofuels like ethanol into gasoline away from refiners to companies further down the supply chain
