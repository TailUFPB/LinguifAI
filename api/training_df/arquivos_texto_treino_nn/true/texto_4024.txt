 washington  reuters    the united states issued about  percent fewer temporary visas in march to citizens of seven countries covered by president donald trump s temporary travel bans than it did in an average month last year  according to a reuters analysis of preliminary government data released on thursday   at the same time  the data showed that the total of u s  non immigrant visas issued to people from all countries was up by nearly  percent in march compared to the  monthly average   citizens of the seven muslim majority nations under the bans   iran  iraq  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen   received about   non immigrant visas in march   compared to about   on average per month during the  fiscal year and more than   on average per month in  and   trump s travel bans were later blocked by the courts        the state department released the data to comply with a directive from trump asking it to publish monthly breakdowns of the number of visas issued around the world   the department did not release data on the total number of all types of visa applications  so it is unclear whether the lower number of temporary visas for citizens of the seven countries is because of a higher rate of rejections or other factors  such as fewer applicants or slower processing times   a state department official noted that  visa demand is cyclical  not uniform throughout the year  and affected by various factors at the local and international level  visa issuance numbers tend to increase during peak travel seasons  such as during the summer and the winter holidays    the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment   march is neither a busy nor slow time for temporary visa issuances to people from the seven countries  several immigration lawyers said  therefore  the significant drops are notable  they said   the data is preliminary and numbers could be subject to minor revision  the state department said   previously  such data was only available in aggregate by fiscal year  and the department declined to break out march visa data from previous years   nevertheless  some immigration attorneys said the numbers released on thursday provide a glimpse into how trump s policies are affecting visa decisions    either there are many fewer people applying because they believe they will be denied  or a much higher rate of denials is already happening even though the executive orders have been blocked   said william stock  president of the american immigration lawyers association        trump  who has said the travel bans were intended to make americans safer from attacks by terrorists  signed an executive order on jan   barring people from the seven countries from entering the united states for  days   the order was blocked by federal courts and the trump administration replaced it with a revised  narrower travel ban effective march  which dropped iraq from the list  courts have also halted parts of the second order   the number of non immigrant visas issued to iranians dropped to   in march from   per month on average in  according to the data  iraqis received  such visas in march  compared to nearly twice that number per month on average in   the data showed   iranians also received fewer immigrant visas  which are granted to family members of u s  citizens or those with jobs in the united states  than the average in previous years    received immigrant visas in march  compared to  on average per month in  and nearly  on average per month in  and    although visitor visas were down across the board for the seven targeted countries  two of them saw the number of immigrant visas issued tick up slightly  forty one libyans received immigrant visas in march  compared to  per month on average in   somalians received  visas in march compared to  on average in     immigration lawyers said that although the travel bans have been halted by courts for now  the administration s vow to put stricter controls on immigration is likely to have changed how u s  consulates evaluate visa applicants   stephen pattison  a former state department consular official now working as an immigration attorney  said consulates  are going to probably err more on the side of denying some people that they d be on the fence about    anecdotally  several u s  based lawyers with iranian clients say their visa applications are taking longer to process and are being rejected more often since trump took office on jan     they cite shortages of interview appointments for iranians  interviews canceled at the last minute and longer  administrative processing  periods than they are accustomed to    if you can t get an interview  you can t get a visa   said babak yousefzadeh  a san francisco based attorney and member of the board of directors of the iranian american bar association   some iranians have decided that for now  it is not worth it to risk the expense and time of making u s  visa applications  said kiyanoush razaghi  a maryland based immigration attorney   in addition to paying a standard   visa application fee  iranians must typically travel to turkey  armenia or the united arab emirates for their interviews  since there is no u s  diplomatic presence in iran    that s a fundamental change that i am seeing  at least in the community and among the clients that i have   razaghi said   they have a general feeling that now is not a good time to apply for a visa
