washington  reuters    in the end  it was a simple hand gesture   senator john mccain pointing his right index finger in a downward motion to register a no vote   that ruined his party s seven year effort to repeal obamacare  but in that signal in the early hours of friday  the  year old mccain also delivered a political gut punch to u s  president donald trump  a fellow republican and a man he has clashed with repeatedly over the past two years  mccain  who just last week was diagnosed with an aggressive brain cancer  dropped a hint on tuesday that if his legislative demands were not met he was prepared to take on trump in the dispute over how to replace parts of obamacare with a republican healthcare program   we are not the president s subordinates  we are his equals   he said in an emotional speech to the senate   his first since being diagnosed  mccain s relations with trump have been frosty for some time  at an election campaign appearance in iowa in   trump responded to criticism from mccain by denigrating the senator s military service  which included    years as a prisoner of war in north vietnam  he was tortured while in captivity and is seen as a war hero by many americans   he s not a war hero   trump told a gathering of religious conservatives   he was a war hero because he was captured  i like people who weren t captured    the following day  trump said mccain s work on behalf of military veterans was  all talk no action   mccain  a leading republican voice on defense and security  has generally been restrained in his criticism of trump but has also at times let loose  including recent accusations that trump has weakened america s standing in world affairs and kowtowed to russian president vladimir putin  with his friday vote that brought the tally to   against a republican bill repealing parts of former president barack obama s affordable care act  mccain became the third senate republican to bolt  leaving no path for passage of the measure  the arizona republican  who was the republican presidential candidate in   also added another important chapter to his maverick   year senate career  stunning some of his fellow legislators and leaving senate majority leader mitch mcconnell with the worst defeat of his long political career  but most notably  mccain denied trump what could have been the first major legislative victory of his administration  and demonstrated to the businessman turned president that washington works in different ways from companies where ceos have freer hands in dictating outcomes  although trump was minimally involved in the process of crafting the legislation  he had made plain it was a priority  when the senate failed to push through bills drawn up by the republican leadership over the past few weeks  trump told republicans to get back to work and try again  he has been publicly urging them to get the job done  despite mccain s tensions with the white house  vice president mike pence was assigned the task of trying to convince him to vote for the so called skinny bill that aimed to pare away parts of obamacare  that  after it became apparent that trump s cheerleading tweet on thursday night was not working   go republican senators  go  get there after waiting for  years  give america great healthcare   pence spent  minutes  according to reporters watching inside the senate chamber  talking to mccain on the senate floor  mccain was not budging  even after taking a short phone call from the president  after the senate vote tally was announced in the senate  mccain was embraced by senators from both sides of the aisle  democrats were delighted he had helped kill the obamacare repeal effort and some republicans just wanted to show their respect for the man  mcconnell spoke bitterly of the defeat   i imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are celebrating  probably pretty happy about all of this   senate democratic leader chuck schumer again called for bipartisan work to fix obamacare s shortcomings  saying   i would suggest we turn the page    we are not celebrating  we are relieved   just three days ago  trump praised mccain as a brave  american hero  for coming back to washington from arizona  where he had been recuperating from surgery  to take part in the healthcare legislative effort   now the president was dejected    republicans and  democrats let the american people down  as i said from the beginning  let obamacare implode  then deal  watch    trump tweeted following his defeat  on friday  mccain advised a much different approach  an immediate  collaborative effort with democrats on healthcare  for mccain  who also hoped to shepherd a major defense bill through the senate  his political and legislative tussles could now be interrupted by the more pressing need to treat his cancer
