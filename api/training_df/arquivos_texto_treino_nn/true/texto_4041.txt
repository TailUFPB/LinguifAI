washington  reuters    ten democratic members of the u s  house of representatives said on thursday they want congress to vote on a formal authorization for the use of military force against al qaeda  the islamic state and the taliban  the group introduced an authorization  known as an aumf  that would last three years and replace authorizations passed in  and  that have been used by both republican and democratic presidents for military action against the groups  some members of congress have contended for years that those measures  approved in  to retaliate against al qaeda for the sept   attacks and in  to pave the way for the iraq war  were outmoded  those arguments intensified when president donald trump ordered air strikes against an airfield in syria this month  although republicans  who control congress  and many democrats said they did not feel that a single action like that required formal approval by congress  but a small  mostly democratic  group of lawmakers has argued for years that congress should stop abdicating its responsibility to consider an aumf that would govern u s  military action  whether against islamist militant groups or the government of syrian president bashar al assad   as deployments to iraq and syria increase  and with complicating factors like the recent cruise missile strike against the assad regime in response to the use of chemical weapons  congress cannot stand on the sidelines any longer and must debate and vote on any new war   said representative adam schiff  who introduced the bill with nine co sponsors  the measure would authorize trump to deploy combat ground troops against the three groups anywhere in the world  but also includes a mechanism to allow a motion to repeal or modify the authorization  it also would put in place new requirements for administration reports to congress and the public on how force was being used  without republican co sponsors  the measure stands little chance of passage  but if it picks up support  it could help pave the way for future legislation
