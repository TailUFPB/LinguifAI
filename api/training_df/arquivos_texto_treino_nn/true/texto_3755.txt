jerusalem  reuters    israeli intelligence experts are gravely concerned that u s  president donald trump s sharing of classified information with russia may have compromised an israeli agent  but don t expect any long term consequences for intelligence cooperation  trump has confirmed via twitter that during a meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov at the white house last week he shared information related to a potential airline plot by islamic state  thought to involve a laptop bomb  the new york times  citing a current and a former u s  official  reported on tuesday that the information trump divulged came from an israeli intelligence asset based in islamic state held territory in syria   israeli officials have declined to confirm whether they were the source of the information trump shared  but have been quick to say counter terrorism coordination with the united states is strong  on tuesday  trump called israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to discuss his visit to israel next week  but the two did not discuss the intelligence leak during their  minute conversation  the prime minister s office said    the security relationship between israel   our greatest ally the united states is deep  significant    unprecedented in volume   defence minister avigdor lieberman said on twitter  remarks that were echoed by the intelligence minister   ron dermer  israel s ambassador to washington  issued a similar statement  saying   israel has full confidence in our intelligence sharing relationship with the united states and looks forward to deepening that relationship in the years ahead under president trump   israeli intelligence experts said they could not confirm whether an israeli asset was the source  but they said israel had developed a deep network of human and signal intelligence across the region and it was plausible that it had managed to infiltrate islamic state as part of that long running effort   israeli intelligence agencies have shown that they can have such human sources   said aviv oreg  former head of the al qaeda and global jihad desk in the army s military intelligence department  who now runs a counter terrorism consultancy    it would take a lot to put someone inside isis  if there is an agent  i m sure it s the only one  if we have really lost a human source over there  it s a major loss and it will take years to regenerate another one   he said   israel will be furious about it   he added  highlighting that it was likely to have implications for how israel operates its human intelligence assets more broadly  and may make others unwilling to cooperate with it in the future  at the same time  he said israel understood that trump  as president and commander in chief  had the authority to divulge the information  even if in doing so he had shown that he  has no experience in how to deal with intelligence   kobi michael  a senior research fellow at the institute for national security studies and the former deputy director of israel s ministry of strategic affairs  described trump s leak as  very concerning  if there was a risk of having endangered an israeli asset  while there were good reasons to assume the compromised source was an agent  he said it was also possible it was a well placed piece of signal intelligence    when it comes to isis  they are very active in the social network world and on digital platforms  so who knows  all options are valid  even if as far as i understand the context  it looks like a human intelligence source   michael described israel as having far better intelligence capabilities in the region than the united states  making it a critical partner for washington  yet both sides have an interest in continuing to cooperate fully on intelligence   what happened is a problem  it shouldn t have happened  but mistakes do get made  not only by the americans  but sometimes by the israelis too   said michael    i assume that trump had other considerations in mind and was perhaps not aware of the consequences of what he was saying  but this should not change the level of cooperation  which needs to be constantly broadened and deepened   amnon sofrin  former head of mossad s intelligence directorate  said the issue was unlikely to be touched on when trump visits israel on his first foreign trip next week  handling the fallout from the leak would be dealt with through intelligence channels   between mossad and the u s  central intelligence agency   not diplomatic ones   cooperation between our two organizations is so solid that i don t believe that a special event will cause any big damage  it may cause local damage  but not a disaster   he said   none of us in israel s intelligence community likes this event  but i think it can be put aside and allow  trump s  visit to be very fulfilling and i hope very successful
