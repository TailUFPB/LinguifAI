washington  reuters    the u s  national security agency collected more than  million records of americans  phone calls last year  even after congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records  according to an annual report issued on tuesday by the top u s  intelligence officer  the report from the office of director of national intelligence dan coats was the first measure of the effects of the  usa freedom act  which limited the nsa to collecting phone records and contacts of people u s  and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism  it found that the nsa collected the  million records even though it had warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court to spy on only  terrorism suspects in   in addition to a handful identified the previous year      the nsa has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone  metadata   records of callers  and recipients  phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls   but not their content   since the september     attacks  the report came as congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  fisa   which permits the nsa to collect foreign intelligence information on non u s  persons outside the united states  and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year  privacy advocates have argued that section  permits the nsa to spy on internet and telephone communications of americans without warrants from the secret foreign intelligence surveillance court  and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements  the report said that on one occasion in   the fbi obtained information about an american in response to a search of section  data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence   the report did not address how frequently the fbi obtained information about americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter  however  on friday  the nsa said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant      the new report also came amid allegations  recently repeated by u s  president donald trump  that former president barack obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser susan rice asked the nsa to unmask the names of u s  persons caught in the surveillance  both republican and democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation  officials on tuesday argued that the  million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former nsa contractor edward snowden revealed the surveillance program in   because the  million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers  the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller  the officials said  they said they had no breakdown of how many individuals  phone records were among those collected   in all  according to the report  u s  officials unmasked the names of fewer americans in nsa eavesdropping reports in  than they did the previous year  the top u s  intelligence officer reported on tuesday  the report said the names of    u s  persons  were  unmasked  last year in response to specific requests  compared with   in   but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds  officials said in the report that u s  intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about u s  electronic eavesdropping   this year s report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency  providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law   said office of the director of national intelligence spokesman timothy barrett
