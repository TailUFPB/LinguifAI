rome  reuters    italy s preparations for hosting this year s group of seven major powers meetings have been hampered by the slow transition at the u s  state department  which has created decision making bottlenecks  european diplomatic sources said  the  draws together the united states  japan  germany  france  britain  italy and canada  with countries taking it in turn to draw up agendas that they see as of pressing concern  italy holds the  presidency and its objectives laid out this week appeared to put rome on a collision course with u s  president donald trump by promoting highly sensitive topics such as climate change  free trade and immigration initiatives  the  foreign ministers meet in tuscany on april    preparing for a leaders  summit in sicily at the end of may  however  officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue  said efforts to reach an agreement on statements and strategy ahead of time   a normal part of pre meeting  diplomacy   were going slowly  the immediate concerns lay with the state department  where new secretary of state rex tillerson has left vacant numerous positions seen as vital to drafting summit accords   it s very difficult to talk to someone who can give a straight answer because the ones who are there are  acting  head of something and they re not even very senior   said a senior italian government official involved in  diplomacy       the white house has yet to nominate candidates for either of the two deputy secretary of state slots  beneath tillerson  further down the chain  all six of the department s regional bureaus are led by acting assistant secretaries of state  while trump has yet to appoint ambassadors to italy or the vatican   this has made it extremely difficult for us to prepare for the meeting   the government official added   a state department official acknowledged that some positions had yet to be filled  but said that it was preparing for a  successful  series of  meetings   we continue to have a deep bench of experienced and capable staff members serving in key positions and working closely with their  counterparts  including our italian hosts   the official said  a diplomat in another european capital also involved in  preparations said the department heads beneath the secretary of state were vital for getting approval for agendas  scheduling and the often delicate wording of policy statements   we no longer know who to talk to  it is slowing everything down   he said  adding that any ambitious projects would struggle to take off given the confusion  a senior diplomat in a third eu capital said   since president trump took office  it has become very difficult to deal with the state department on planning and we are still learning to work with that    the senior italian diplomat leading behind the scenes  discussions  raffaele trombetta  said this week that africa would play a prominent role in italy s summit agenda  with seven african leaders invited to join the talks in sicily   however  in a sign that rome was lowering expectations for this year s event  the italian government was unlikely to launch any major funding initiative at a time when trump is looking to slash back on u s  foreign aid   usually the  sets aside money for a particular cause  but this time it doesn t look like there s the will to do it  it s not just the americans  the japanese don t want one either   said the italian government source  trombetta said  trust  was the presidency slogan   trust between governments and their citizens  and between countries    there is also a need of renewed trust between the leaders who will be attending the summit   he said  noting that the prime ministers of britain and italy and the presidents of france and the united states would be attending their first   eu leaders worry trump might undermine  years of strong trans atlantic ties and have been alarmed by his criticism of nato  his support for trade protectionism  his rejection of climate change policies  and his anti migrant rhetoric  flying into these headwinds  trombetta said italy wanted the  to reaffirm the importance of the  paris agreement  which obliges nations to curb global warming and which senior white house advisers have called on trump to renounce  rome was also eager for a commitment  to fighting all forms of protectionism   said trombetta  however  he acknowledged that this might be hard to achieve  with the united states this month already breaking with a tradition of endorsing open trade at a meeting of  finance ministers in germany   it is a highly political issue  i expect it will go up to the leaders  it will be dealt with by them at the taormina summit     it will be one of the main points of tension of our presidency   he said  italian prime minister paolo gentiloni is flying to the united states next month  in part to seek an understanding with trump on the  agenda ahead of the sicily summit  but if trump pushes back  he is unlikely to face strong resistance from italy  which has made good relations with the united states the cornerstone of its foreign policy    we can argue with france  germany and britain  but never with america   said another senior government official  who was not authorized to talk to the media   we will do with trump what we always do  with the americans   find a way to get along with him
