washington  reuters    a bipartisan senate proposal to shore up obamacare insurance marketplaces would cut the u s  deficit by    billion over the next decade and would not substantially change the number of americans with health insurance  a nonpartisan arm of congress said on wednesday  legislation introduced last week by republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray would restore for two years subsidies to private insurers to help lower income people buy insurance  president donald trump this month cut off those subsidies  the bill also would provide states more flexibility to change some rules in the  affordable care act  the signature legislative achievement of the republican trump s democratic predecessor  barack obama  the nonpartisan congressional budget office previously estimated that various republican proposals to repeal and replace obamacare would cause more than  million people to lose health insurance  in contrast  the cbo on wednesday said reinstating the subsidies  as called for in the alexander murray bill  would not substantially alter the number of insured  the cbo also estimated that the fix would not impact  health insurance rates because they are already set  health insurers said they raised premiums on average  percent to make up for the lost federal subsidies  the cbo said it expected  health insurance premiums to be lower with the insurer payments than without them  while the alexander murray legislation would reduce the federal deficit  the cbo previously found that eliminating the subsidies  called cost sharing reductions  would raise the federal deficit by   billion over a decade  because premiums would rise in the absence of the subsidies  the government would be compelled to spend more on financial assistance to low income americans  about  million americans obtained insurance through obamacare and the law helped drive the u s  uninsured rate to a record low  but republicans have called it an unwarranted government intrusion in a healthcare system that represents a fifth of the u s  economy  it is unclear whether the alexander murray bill will ever come to a vote in congress  trump has sent mixed signals about it  initially supporting it last week and then opposing it  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would not bring it up without trump s support  trump has derided the insurer payments as a  bailout  and has vowed to let obamacare  implode     it does not bail out insurance companies  it does benefit consumers  it does benefit taxpayers to the tune of    billion   alexander said on wednesday on the senate floor  insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people      trump  who as a candidate promised to get rid of obamacare  has been frustrated by the inability of a congress led by his own party to pass a bill to repeal and replace it  and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law  house of representatives speaker paul ryan has signaled his opposition and on wednesday said his chamber would not take up the matter or try again to pass broader republican legislation to repeal and replace obamacare this year  with broad democratic backing and the support of a dozen republican senators  the alexander murray bill has sufficient backing to exceed the  votes needed for passage in the  seat senate  if mcconnell allows it to come to a vote  two prominent republicans in the house and senate on tuesday announced a competing obamacare fix that is more conservative and appears to address many of the trump administration s objections to the alexander murray proposal   the proposal by republican senator orrin hatch  chairman of the senate finance committee  and republican representative kevin brady  chairman of the house ways and means committee  includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to buy health coverage under obamacare  ryan told reuters in an interview he favored the hatch brady proposal
