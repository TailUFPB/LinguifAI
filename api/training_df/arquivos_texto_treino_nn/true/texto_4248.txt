washington  reuters    president donald trump on thursday signed a resolution that will allow u s  states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent  a move cheered by anti abortion campaigners   this is a major pro life victory   said the most powerful republican in the house of representatives  speaker paul ryan  adding that a regulation enacted under democratic former president barack obama had forced states to fund planned parenthood  a national non profit that provides contraception  health screenings  and abortions  under the congressional review act  which allows lawmakers to repeal newly minted rules  both the house and senate had passed a resolution killing obama s regulation that had protected federal grants for clinics in states wanting to block the funding  states such as texas in recent years have kept the grants from going to clinics as part of the country s longstanding fight over abortion  broadly  many republicans seek to restrict abortion or make it illegal while democrats have fought to keep abortion legal  the resolution had narrowly passed the u s  congress  with vice president mike pence called to the senate on march  to break a tie vote in the chamber  where republicans hold a slim majority  the federal government can never again create a  substantially similar  regulation under the review law  the grants  known as  title x  funds  were already barred from going directly to abortion services but under the now null regulation planned parenthood clinics were assured they could receive money even in the face of state objections         allowing states to withhold title x funding from family planning clinics won t make anyone safer or healthier   it will instead place essential services out of reach   said diane horvath cosper  a medical doctor and fellow at physicians for reproductive health  adding that for many people the clinics are the only place where they can receive affordable health services such as disease testing
