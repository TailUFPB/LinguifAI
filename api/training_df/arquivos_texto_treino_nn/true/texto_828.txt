washington seoul  reuters    saddled with the toughest job in american diplomacy  the chief u s  negotiator with north korea stands between a u s  president who insists he doesn t want to talk and an enemy who shows no interest in listening  while veteran state department asia hand joseph yun might be washington s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a  devastating war on the korean peninsula  he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle pyongyang      on the other side  north korea s young leader  kim jong un   shows little interest in negotiating either  at least not until he has developed a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  despite the daunting obstacles  south korean born yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand off  according to reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former u s  officials and south korean diplomats  most were deeply skeptical about his chances       he s such a dreamer   a white house official said  with a note of sarcasm       we don t think this is going anywhere   said another u s  official  although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the north koreans as long as yun does not appear to be undermining president donald trump s public rejection of direct negotiations  trump has told aides that his military threats will drive north korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs  four white house officials said  a view not shared among most u s  intelligence agencies  yun  however  is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with north korean officials at the united nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of u s  citizens  a senior state department official told reuters this week  in june  he secured the release of u s  student otto warmbier  who returned to the united states in a coma and died days later   trump headed to asia on friday as a senior aide warned the world is  running out of time  on the north korea crisis  behind the scenes  yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict  further aggravating tensions  two u s  strategic bombers conducted drills over south korea on thursday  that followed word from south korea s spy agency that north korea may be preparing another missile launch  u s  officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration  though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks  in the midst of this is yun  a soft spoken   year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago  near the end of the obama administration  he is grappling with trump s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president s top aides over whether saber rattling will force kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be  according to several u s  officials who spoke on condition of anonymity   concern about yun s difficulties has surfaced in seoul  where he visits regularly and where trump will travel next week on the second stop of his asian tour  several south korean officials expressed worry that yun s diplomatic efforts with north korea lack any real underpinning of support from the white house       things are clearly not easy for him   one south korean diplomat said   yun is precisely that person  to talk to north korea   but trump is killing the whole process   secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters on sept   the united states was probing for a diplomatic opening  only to be slapped down by trump  who told him via twitter this was a waste of time  at the same time  cia director mike pompeo  who regularly briefs trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on north korea in the president s inner circle  has apparently gained stature      several officials familiar with those discussions say pompeo is feeding trump assessments that u s  military threats will force kim to bow to u s  demands for nuclear disarmament  a position that some u s  intelligence officers privately contest      the cia declined comment  a u s  official who spoke on condition of anonymity said yun  has become diplomatically  untethered   not fully connected to a core u s  approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy      the one tangible achievement of yun s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of  year old warmbier in secret talks with north korean officials in oslo and new york  yun flew to pyongyang in june to medically evacuate warmbier  when choe son hui  head of the north korean foreign ministry s north america bureau  met yun in oslo  she was unaware of how serious warmbier s condition was  a source in washington knowledgeable about the matter said   but once she learned about it she was  shocked  and yun was summoned urgently to meet a north korean diplomat in new york  which quickly led to warmbier s return home  the source said  warmbier s death complicated yun s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of u s  north korean contacts around that time  the state department official said      despite trump s threats of military action against pyongyang  the state department official said yun s view was  the less you engage diplomatically  the more likely you are in the dark   even so  trump s rhetoric has raised questions among allies  and possibly even in north korea  about how serious  if at all  his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate yun may have to pursue it      trump  personalized  the conflict   deriding kim as  little rocket man     against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts  some of whom warned it could be counterproductive  a senior national security official said      another official pointed out  however  that trump  who in may said he would be honored to meet kim  had not hurled any fresh insults at kim in recent days  raising hopes for an altered approach  a south korean official in seoul said it was necessary for washington to have someone in contact with north korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold  but trump s national security adviser  h r  mcmaster  told japan s nhk television this week   what we cannot afford to do is enter into these long  drawn out negotiations that allow north korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs   former u s  negotiators sympathize with yun  whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug of war between a white house breathing fire and a state department pushing a peaceful solution       nobody doubted my authority   said wendy sherman  one of the lead u s  negotiators who achieved the  deal under which iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions   all of this undermines our ability to do the job   robert gallucci  who was chief u s  negotiator during the north korean nuclear crisis of  and has had recent contact with yun  said the envoy is  realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere  including the tone set by the president  but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism
