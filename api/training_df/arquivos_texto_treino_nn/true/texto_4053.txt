washington  reuters    u s  chief justice john roberts took issue on wednesday with the trump administration s stance in an immigration case  saying it could make it too easy for the government to strip people of citizenship for lying about minor infractions  roberts and other supreme court justices indicated support for a deported ethnic serb immigrant named divna maslenjak over her bid to regain her u s  citizenship after it was stripped because she falsely stated her husband had not served in the bosnian serb army in the  after yugoslavia s collapse  roberts seemed particularly concerned that the government was asserting it could revoke citizenship through criminal prosecution for trivial lies or omissions  he noted that in the past he has exceeded the speed limit while driving  if immigrants failed to disclose that on a citizenship application form asking them to list any instances of breaking the law  they could later lose their citizenship  the conservative chief justice said   now you say that if i answer that question  no    years after i was naturalized as a citizen  you can knock on my door and say   guess what  you re not an american citizen after all    roberts asked justice department lawyer robert parker  roberts described the administration s interpretation as inviting  prosecutorial abuse  because the government could likely find a reason for stripping citizenship from most naturalized citizens   that to me is troublesome to give that extraordinary power  which  essentially  is unlimited power  at least in most cases  to the government   roberts added  president donald trump has sought to restrict immigration and deport people who have entered the united states illegally  maslenjak entered the united states with her husband and two children in   granted refugee status over a claimed fear of ethnic persecution in bosnia at the hands of muslims  they settled in ohio  she became a u s  citizen in   at issue is her concealment of her husband ratko s service in a bosnian serb army brigade that participated in the notorious  massacre of   muslims in the bosnian town of srebrenica  maslenjak s citizenship was revoked  she and her husband were deported to serbia last october  liberal justice stephen breyer shared roberts  concern  noting he had once walked into a government building with a pocketknife on his key chain in violation of the law   it s  to me  rather surprising that the government of the united states thinks that congress is interpreting this statute and wanted it interpreted in a way that would throw into doubt the citizenship of vast percentages of all naturalized citizens   breyer said  conservative justice anthony kennedy also rebuked parker  saying   it seems to me that your argument is demeaning the priceless value of citizenship   there are around  million naturalized u s  citizens  according to the migration policy institute  the legal question is whether maslenjak s false statements had a material effect on the u s  decision to grant her refugee status  the government argued it only matters that she made a false statement  not whether it had any impact on its decision to grant refugee status  at a  hearing to help her husband avoid deportation after he was convicted of making a false statement by concealing his military service  she admitted that when she had applied to be a refugee she had not revealed that from  to  the family lived in bosnia and her husband served in the military  she was later convicted of lying on her citizenship application  this was the last oral argument of the court s current term  a ruling is due by the end of june
