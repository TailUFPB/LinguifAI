washington  reuters    when president donald trump scolded u s  lawmakers on thursday for clamping down on moscow with new sanctions  his message clashed with the one that vice president mike pence pushed during a four day trip this week to eastern europe  as he toured estonia  georgia and montenegro  pence said the sanctions passed overwhelmingly by congress would send a unified message to russia that it must change its behavior  trump  by contrast  took to twitter to complain that the sanctions legislation  which he grudgingly signed  would send u s  russia relations to  an all time   very dangerous low   while some republicans played down the divergence  critics said it exemplified an incoherent policy that would unsettle allies and fail to placate moscow   there are some policies where a good cop bad approach can work   said michael mcfaul  a u s  ambassador to russia under former democratic president barack obama  but mcfaul added that in the case of the trump administration s policy toward russia  moscow was likely to view the mixed signals as a sign of policy disarray  if the republican president continues to want improved relations with russia   he s not achieving his goal   mcfaul said  the white house s two track approach is mirrored in moscow   after trump signed the new sanctions into law on wednesday  russian prime minister dmitry medvedev  the no   in the russian ruling hierarchy  launched a blistering attack on the white house  yet russian president vladimir putin   who has tried to cultivate a personal rapport with trump in phone conversations and face to face meetings at a summit in germany   has not uttered a word in public about the sanctions since trump approved them  trump has repeatedly said he wants better ties with russia  but the country has loomed large over the first six months of his administration as a special counsel and u s  congressional panels investigate allegations moscow meddled in the  u s  election to help trump and also examine any potential role by trump aides  moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign      after congress passed the sanctions legislation with a large enough margin to override a presidential veto  trump signed it on wednesday but criticized it as infringing on his authority and said he could make  far better deals  with governments than congress could  as a countermeasure to the sanctions  putin called for reducing the staff of the u s  diplomatic mission by  people and for the seizure of two properties near moscow used by american diplomats  jarrod agen  deputy chief of staff to pence  insisted that trump and pence were  completely aligned  on russia   it was the president s decision to send the vice president to the region  it was the president s decision to deliver the message that the vice president delivered   agen told reuters  he added that pence and trump spoke every day during his trip and sometimes multiple times a day  the disconnect between pence and trump on russia is an anomaly  pence usually goes to lengths to emphasize his loyalty to his boss and to downplay any differences  their different tone on russia dates back to the u s  presidential campaign  while trump often praised putin  pence called the russian president a  small and bullying leader  during a vice presidential debate last october  during his trip this week  pence condemned russia for its  occupation of georgia s soil  as he spoke to u s  and georgian troops engaged in joint exercises only  miles   km  away from russian troops in south ossetia  in montenegro  pence accused russia of trying to  destabilize  the western balkans   a message criticized by moscow  russia s foreign ministry said it was  regrettable to note that washington is sliding ever deeper into the primitive ideology of the cold war era  which is completely detached from reality   traditional republican conservatives   who favor a hard line on moscow   have taken some comfort in pence s message  as have foreign leaders concerned about the impact of a rapprochement between trump and putin   what he  pence  is saying is good and helpful and should be the policy of the trump administration   and so for those of us who want it to be that way  we re happy to embrace it   said danielle pletka  senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the american enterprise institute   none of us know what donald trump thinks in his heart of hearts about russia   pletka said  but she added   if  trump  were not comfortable with pence making this trip  pence would not be making this trip   republican bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  said he would not  read a lot  into the different tones struck by pence and trump  although he welcomed pence s trip to the european countries  corker described pence as the administration s  ombudsman  on policy and said defense secretary jim mattis  secretary of state rex tillerson and trump s national security adviser  h r  mcmaster  were key to developing trump s foreign policy  a former u s  official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  was at pains to explain the disconnect between pence and trump on russia   we are dealing with a major  open split between the president and basically the rest of his administration with the possible exception of tillerson   the former official said
