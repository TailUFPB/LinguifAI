washington  reuters    president donald trump s firing of fbi director james comey on may  renewed attention to allegations by u s  intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the  election campaign to benefit trump  the following describes what is publicly known and not known about u s  investigations into meddling and possible collusion between russia and members of the trump campaign  how did the investigations begin  former president barack obama ordered u s  intelligence agencies to assess whether russia tried to intervene in the  election after a cyber attack on the democratic national committee in july  and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from hillary clinton s campaign manager in the month before the nov   election  obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the white house in january   what did the intelligence agencies find   the central intelligence agency  the federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency concluded in a report declassified in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the u s  electoral system but to affect the outcome  the agencies said putin and the russian government had a  clear preference  for trump to win the white house  putin s  associates hacked information  paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by russian government agencies and state funded media to sway public opinion  the agencies said   the report stopped short of assessing whether russia succeeded in swaying the election result  putin and other russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the u s  election  what has trump said about russia s role in the election  trump has not taken a clear public position    i will tell you this  russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   trump said at a july  news conference  in reference to a fbi probe into clinton s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted  trump subsequently dismissed reports  including from u s  intelligence officials  that russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf     the first time trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a jan   news conference ahead of his inauguration   as far as hacking  i think it was russia   trump said  although he then added   it could have been others also   earlier this month  trump said china may have hacked the emails of democratic officials to meddle with the election  offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials  how many u s  probes are there into russia s election meddling   committees in the house of representatives and the senate  along with the u s  department of justice and the federal bureau of investigation  are all known to be investigating  some democrats and trump critics have also called on the justice department to appoint a special counsel  has there been any fallout for trump associates over contacts  with russia before  during or after the election campaign  michael flynn  trump s national security adviser  was fired  in february  the white house said he had misled vice president mike pence about the contacts he had with russia s ambassador to the united states  sergei kislyak  before trump took office  on may   federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with flynn when he was a private citizen  on may   the senate intelligence committee issued the  first subpoena in its russia investigation  demanding documents from flynn after he declined to voluntarily comply with an earlier request  attorney general jeff sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in russia related probes at the justice department because he had not told congress of his own contacts with kislyak in   will the fbi probe continue after comey s dismissal  comey told the house intelligence committee on march  that the fbi was investigating moscow s role in the election  including possible collusion with trump s campaign  it was the first time he publicly acknowledged the agency was investigating the matter  comey s departure does not necessarily mean the fbi s russia investigation will be disrupted or ended as the career fbi officials comey put in charge of it will likely continue working on the matter even as the search for a new director begins  the leaders of the senate intelligence committee had raised concerns about the pace of the fbi inquiry before comey s firing  the congressional probes are dependent on the intelligence produced by the fbi and other agencies  fbi acting director andrew mccabe  who will lead the agency until a new director is hired  promised the senate intelligence committee that comey s firing will not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it  why was comey fired  attorney general sessions sent trump a may  letter attaching a memo from deputy attorney general rod rosenstein on  restoring confidence in the fbi  that recommended comey s dismissal  rosenstein s memo said comey erred in july  by announcing the fbi had been examining clinton s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution  rosenstein s view was that comey s decision to make a public statement on the matter broke with longstanding fbi precedent and should have been handled by the then u s  attorney general loretta lynch  trump called comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with nbc news on may   saying he was going to fire comey regardless of rosenstein s recommendation   did comey s firing have anything to do with the russia probe  the white house says comey was dismissed because of his handling of the clinton email investigation  but many democrats challenged that and some republicans have expressed skepticism given the delay between trump taking office on jan   and comey s dismissal  trump aides have told reuters that top justice department officials wanted a heads up from comey about what he would say during a may  congressional hearing about the fbi s investigation of clinton s private email system   the hearing was just days after clinton said at a new york event that announcements by comey in october   a week before the election that he had re opened  and then re closed  the email probe had swung the election for trump  comey told the congressional panel the idea that he may have affected the election result made him  mildly nauseous   just days before his firing  comey asked rosenstein for a significant boost in resources to fund the agency s russia probe  according to media reports  the justice department has denied this request was made  is trump being investigated by the fbi   in the short letter trump sent to comey dismissing him from the fbi  he thanked comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation  comey has never stated publicly whether or not the fbi was investigating trump and it would be unorthodox for him to say such a thing to the president  the white house has offered no proof to back trump s claim  trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the russia investigations have run their course and should be closed   the russia trump collusion story is a total hoax  when will this taxpayer funded charade end   he wrote on twitter on
