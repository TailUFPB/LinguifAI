washington  reuters    an overhaul of fannie mae and freddie mac is highly unlikely to make it into this year s legislative calendar  congressional staffers say  possibly shifting the new administration s immediate focus to allowing the mortgage financing institutions  to rebuild depleted capital  fannie and freddie stocks soared late last year when president donald trump s pick for treasury secretary steve mnuchin said the companies that have been in government conservatorship since the  financial crisis should be privatized  hedge funds and other investors have been lobbying for the removal of government controls over the mortgage giants  profits  which since  have been transferred to the treasury  and their eventual privatization  the shares dipped when mnuchin seemed to backpedal on the privatization pledge during his january confirmation hearing and suffered another setback last month when a court rejected investors  suit against the dividend transfers  congressional staffers say the senate banking committee has begun weekly bipartisan staff briefings on freddie and fannie reforms  but it is starting from scratch  the house financial services committee is focused on other legislation  such as renewing the flood insurance program and rolling back parts of the dodd frank financial reform  pushing the mortgage giants  revamp down the to do list  they say   instead  investors  focus is shifting to how mnuchin and federal housing finance agency director mel watt  an obama administration holdover  will manage the dividends transfers   analysts expect the two institutions to make a full   billion dividend payment for the fourth quarter on march    but investors will be looking for any indication from watt or mnuchin about whether they plan to allow the mortgage firms to retain profits later on and begin the slow recapitalization process  though rebuilding an adequate capital buffer would take years   as long as two to three presidential administrations  according to one analyst   it would eventually allow fannie and freddie to leave government conservatorship  returning value to their investors   watt has warned the mortgage giants have a dangerously thin capital buffer  mnuchin said during his confirmation hearing he favored finding a  bipartisan fix   the two will likely wait for congressional inaction to become a de facto impasse before letting freddie and fannie hold on to their profits  analysts said  estimating a decision could be made two or three quarters out   mnuchin has been out there talking about a bipartisan agreement   heights securities analyst edwin groshans told reuters   that process will have to play out until it in essence fails  when that process fails  that would open the opportunity for mnuchin and watts to act   tim pagliara  an investor who founded investors unite  a coalition of more than   fannie and freddie investors  told reuters he did not expect an imminent legislative fix and called the situation in congress  fluid    the focus is going to continue to be on the court cases and what the administration is going to do   and what they ve said they re going to do   pagliara added   president donald trump s administration generally supports transferring government programs to the private sector  trump donor john paulson runs three hedge funds in which the president has invested and which held stakes in the mortgage institutions  mnuchin  under the terms of a government ethics agreement  divested between   million and   million he had in paulson s funds  fannie and freddie provide stability to the u s  housing market by buying mortgages and bundling them into government backed securities  during the financial crisis  they received   billion in government aid and by now have repaid   billion via dividend payments to the treasury  fhfa s watt has warned the payments have depleted the companies  capital buffer and that by january  they will have  no ability to weather quarterly losses   fannie was required by law to keep a minimum capital reserve of about   billion and freddie   billion headed into the  bailout  which suspended those requirements  industry analysts  shareholders and advocacy groups   both conservative and liberal   all believe that the same  bailout law gives watt the authority to allow the companies to begin rebuilding capital  without waiting for congress
