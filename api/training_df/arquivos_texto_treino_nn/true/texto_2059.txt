washington  reuters    rolling back territorial gains by the taliban and strengthening the afghanistan army s ability to fight will be two key objectives of president donald trump s new strategy for the country  a senior administration official said on tuesday  trump  in a televised speech on monday  promised a stepped up military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground against the u s  backed afghan government  in outlining his strategy to give the u s  military more authority to make battlefield decisions  trump did not provide a timetable for determining whether the mission is a success or how commanders would be able to judge progress  the senior administration official said  however  that one general measure of progress was assessing how much and what territory is controlled by the afghan government or by the taliban and other extremist groups such as islamic state s afghan affiliate   it s also the estimated number of fighters  the presence of al qaeda and isis  how strong are they  how many fighters do they have  how are their training camps  what are their finance networks like   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  also key will be the effectiveness of the afghan army and whether u s  led armed forces can help it seize control of some territory held by the taliban  the official added   trump  who was reluctant to approve a deeper engagement in afghanistan after  years of war  wanted to keep a close eye on whether progress is being made  the official said   i think we re going to be taking the temperature continuously   the official said   i don t think we expect to see any real gains materialize for at least six months  but from that point on  it s going to be something that we essentially never stop evaluating   u s  backed afghan forces overthrew the taliban s hard line islamist government in late  because it sheltered al qaeda chief osama bin laden  architect of the sept   attacks on new york and washington that year   u s  forces have been bogged down since in a war that has vexed three american presidents  about   u s  troops have died there in america s longest military conflict     three u s  officials said on tuesday the administration had yet to settle on specific metrics to measure progress in afghanistan and assess the contributions of the afghan government  pakistan  india and america s nato allies  one of the officials said there was no point  in setting specific targets  much less making them public  because that would risk making our partners think that once they had met those marks  they didn t have to do more    what we re after is a progressive process   the official said   so for example the afghan security forces keep improving their capabilities until they don t need us anymore  the government in kabul keeps improving its record on eliminating corruption and improving local  regional and national governance   but representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  struck a critical tone on tuesday   while a  conditions based  approach is appealing to military leaders because it gives the taliban less certainty about how long it will take to wait us out  it also diminishes pressure on the afghan government to reform itself and give the afghan people something worth fighting for  since it indicates a willingness to bail them out indefinitely   schiff said in a statement
