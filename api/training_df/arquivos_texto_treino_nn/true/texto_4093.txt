washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump indicated an openness on monday to delaying his push to secure funds for his promised border wall with mexico  potentially eliminating a sticking point as lawmakers worked to avoid a looming shutdown of the federal government  trump  in a private meeting with conservative media outlets  said he may wait until republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on oct   to seek government funds for building a wall along the u s  mexico border  the white house confirmed  trump  whose approval ratings have slid since he took office  is facing a friday deadline for congress to pass a spending bill funding the government through september or risk marking his  day in office on saturday with a government shutdown   now the bipartisan and bicameral negotiators can continue working on the outstanding issues   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a statement on monday night  earlier on monday  schumer reiterated an assertion made last week that bipartisan negotiations in congress were going well until the white house began demanding money for the wall as a condition for accepting a funding bill  although republicans control both chambers of congress  a funding bill will need  votes to clear the  member senate  where republicans hold  seats  meaning at least some democrats will have to get behind it  if no spending measure covering april  to sept   is in place before   a m    gmt  on saturday  government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country s several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off  those in jobs deemed essential such as law enforcement are expected to keep working in the hope they will receive back pay  non essential sectors such as national parks are liable to be closed and programs such as federally funded medical research will grind to a halt  failure to approve a government funding bill could also throw new doubts over republicans  ability to fashion a budget blueprint for the next fiscal year or to succeed in a major effort to cut corporate and individual taxes that trump has touted  congressional leaders will likely have to decide by late on tuesday whether negotiations are progressing enough to try to pass a spending bill funding the government through september  senator roy blunt  a member of the republican leadership and senate appropriations committee  told reporters on monday  if negotiations have slowed or stalled  congress could pursue a short term extension of existing spending levels to avoid a government shutdown  giving lawmakers more time to reach a deal  leading democrats have said they would support such a measure only if talks are progressing  short term funding measures  known as continuing resolutions that cover periods of days  have been used to avert government shutdowns in the past  but in   conservative republicans forced a  day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal former president barack obama s affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  a republican effort to repeal and replace obamacare imploded in congress last month and the white house said on monday that another vote could not come for weeks  but trump has dangled the prospect of funding some elements of the law  which enabled millions more americans to secure healthcare coverage  in exchange for democrats  support in the spending talks  the white house had offered to include   billion in obamacare subsidies that allow low income people to pay for healthcare insurance in exchange for democratic backing of    billion in funding to begin construction of a barrier on the u s  mexico border  it was unclear on monday whether delaying wall funding until later spending negotiations would invalidate the white house pledge to include obamacare subsidy funding for low income people in the current proposal funding the government through september  trump has argued that a wall along the u s  mexico border is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the united states  in a twitter message on monday  trump wrote   if    the wall is not built  which it will be  the drug situation will never be fixed the way it should be   earlier on monday  white house spokesman sean spicer said trump s demand that congress include funds for the construction of the wall remained a white house priority   the president has made very clear that he s got two priorities in this continuing resolution  no    the increase in funding for the military and no    for our homeland security and the wall   spicer told reporters  the white house is confident in the direction of the talks and an announcement is expected soon  spicer said  although he declined to say specifically whether trump would sign a bill that did not contain money for border security and the wall  trump has said mexico will repay the united states for the wall if congress funds it first  but the mexican government is adamant it will not provide any financing and trump has not laid out a plan to compel mexico to pay  department of homeland security internal estimates have placed the total cost of a border barrier at about    billion   aside from inflaming relations with a major trading partner  the planned wall has angered democrats  they showed no sign of softening their opposition on monday and sought to place responsibility for any shutdown squarely on trump and congressional republicans
