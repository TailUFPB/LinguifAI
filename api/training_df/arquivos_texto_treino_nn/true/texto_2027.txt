washington  reuters    a u s  court on thursday rejected a bid by republican voters to throw out congressional districts drawn by democratic lawmakers in maryland  the three judge panel sitting in baltimore  divided    also put any further action in the case on hold pending the u s  supreme court s upcoming decision in a similar case from wisconsin that could set a new test for how courts nationwide handle such claims  at the heart of the maryland case was the decision to redraw the state s sixth congressional district  previously held by a republican and now held by a democrat  the challengers say the move was a partisan gerrymander in violation of the u s  constitution because it intentionally diluted the republican vote  gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral boundaries to gain a political advantage   after the new map was introduced  republican representative roscoe bartlett lost in the  election to democrat john delaney  democrats now hold seven of the state s eight congressional seats  the state s governor  larry hogan  is a republican   the widespread nature of gerrymandering in modern politics is matched by the almost universal absence of those who will defend its negative effect on our democracy   judge paul niemeyer  a republican appointee  wrote in his dissenting opinion   indeed  both democrats and republicans have decried it when wielded by their opponents but nonetheless continue to gerrymander in their own self interest when given the opportunity   he added  the other two judges are democratic appointees  on oct    the u s  supreme court will hear oral arguments over republican line drawing in wisconsin  which democrats say diluted their votes  the case gives the court an opportunity to issue a ruling saying whether or not challenges to gerrymandering can be brought over maps drawn solely on partisan grounds  the court has previously thrown out maps when there is evidence the state had sought to dilute the vote of a racial minority  the high court s decision could dictate whether the maryland case can move forward
