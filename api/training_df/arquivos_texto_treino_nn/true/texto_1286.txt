washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  congress  long the staunchest opponents of the iran nuclear deal  may be the best hope for preserving it if president donald trump declines on friday to certify that tehran is complying with the pact  every republican in congress opposed the international accord reached under democratic former president barack obama two years ago  joined by several democrats  they nearly passed legislation to kill the deal in which iran agreed to curb its disputed nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief  however  with the agreement in place and strongly supported by co signers britain  france  germany  russia and china  many republicans who still abhor the pact nevertheless do not want to blow it up for fear that doing so would erode u s  credibility  they want to find other ways to clamp down on tehran  meeting with officials from the trump and obama administrations  european diplomats and among themselves  they have been preparing strategies to save it  including pushing for tougher inspections  changing the law requiring trump to certify tehran s compliance and setting new sanctions over iran s non nuclear activities   as flawed as the deal is  i believe we must enforce the hell out of it   representative ed royce  the republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  said on wednesday  on friday  trump is expected to unveil a broad strategy for iran  including announcing that he will decertify the agreement ahead of an oct   deadline  although he could always change his mind  if the republican president goes ahead  that would open a  day window in which congress could reimpose sanctions  a step toward an unraveling of the deal  however  trump is not expected to call on lawmakers to revive those sanctions  if he stops short of recommending that  it gives republicans room to stand pat for now  daniel kurtzer  a former u s  ambassador to israel who is now a professor at princeton university  said the political pressure could be intense   there will be an onslaught of phone calls and letters and visits to senators to  do something  about iran   he said  israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has urged washington to either fix the iran deal or  nix it   on wednesday  h r  mcmaster  trump s national security adviser  discussed iran with the republican chairmen of house of representatives national security committees  on thursday  intelligence officials scheduled a classified briefing for members of the house foreign affairs committee  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  a key player in the iran debate  has suggested changing the iran review act he co authored to eliminate the requirement that trump recertify iran s compliance with the deal every  days  several congressional sources said  trump  who pledged during his campaign to rip up the iran deal  has recertified it twice since taking office in january and hates having to do so  a twitter feud that erupted this week between trump and corker could complicate the efforts by the influential republican to broker a deal that would likely require both democratic and republican support   congress and the administration need to be on the same page  and a major breakdown in the working relationship between one of the very few key republicans on the hill who works with democrats and the president on iran policy bodes very poorly   said elizabeth rosenberg  a former treasury department official now at the center for a new american security  to win over some conservative republicans and iran hawks  corker and other leaders are considering proposing sanctions on iran s non nuclear activities and broader inspections  particularly of iranian military facilities  on thursday  the house foreign affairs committee approved sanctions targeting iran s ballistic missiles development  it could come up for a vote in the full house well before the end of the  days congress has to react to trump s announcement
