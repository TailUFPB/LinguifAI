washington  reuters    the top republican on tax policy in the house of representatives rejected the possibility of cutting taxes without fundamental changes to the u s  tax code on thursday  as the main actors in the tax reform debate prepared to meet for a fourth time  with the window for tax reform narrowing  lobbyists and analysts say congress could abandon comprehensive tax reform for simple tax cuts to reduce the u s  corporate tax rate from  percent to  percent  well above the  percent advocated by president donald trump  but house ways and means chairman kevin brady  one of six principals involved in closed door efforts to agree on legislation  told cnbc that such a measure would not meet the republican goals of bolstering economic growth and enhancing u s  business competitiveness overseas     it s not acceptable to me  i don t think it s acceptable to the house or anyone else  for that matter  look  that won t make us competitive   brady said   just doing low rates is a little like putting supercharged fuel in an old clunker of a tax car  there s no question it ll go faster  it can t keep up with the newer models on the road   he added   we ve got to go after a competitive design    brady spoke as principals prepared to meet later on thursday  members of the group have vowed to make good this year on a top republican campaign pledge to overhaul the u s  tax system  but while the principals have met three times  the discussions have major issues to resolve   how low we can get these rates  how do we stop businesses from continuing to leave the u s   and more importantly  how do we bring those supply chains back  how we deal with issues like full and unlimited expensing   those are still parts of this discussion   brady said   brady and house speaker paul ryan are pushing for changes outlined in the  a better way  agenda released a year ago  including a border adjustment tax that would tax imports but exempt export revenues from federal tax  the measure could raise more than   trillion in revenue to help pay for tax cuts and effectively resolve the problem of corporations shifting profits overseas  but it is opposed by some industries and unpopular with republicans in the house and senate who fear it would raise consumer prices
