washington  reuters    the u s  senate on wednesday took a step toward passage of tax legislation that is a top white house priority  setting up a likely decisive vote later this week even though it was unclear if the bill had enough republican support to become law republicans spent the day scrambling to reformulate the  bill  which aims to cut taxes on corporations  other businesses and many individuals and families  to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would balloon the u s  budget deficit  stocks rallied on optimism it could pass  but obstacles remained  including attempts to address the estimated    trillion that the bill would add to the united states    trillion national debt over  years  lawmakers voted   to begin formal debate  a step that could lead on thursday and friday to a full vote on the bill  republicans are eager to pass the legislation  wanting something to show for their control of the white house and both houses of congress  republicans have a   majority in the  member senate  giving them enough votes to approve the bill if they can hold together  without democratic support  republicans can afford to lose no more than two of their own votes  president donald trump in a speech in missouri on wednesday  implored members of his own party to get behind the effort  which would be his first significant legislative achievement since taking office in january   a vote to cut taxes is a vote to put america first again   trump said  adding the bill could  cost me a fortune  and that his wealthy friends were not happy   my accountants are going crazy right now  it s all right  hey look  i am president  i don t care  i don t care anymore   democrats say the tax cuts are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working americans  some democrats have said trump and his children would gain from the bill  which would repeal the estate tax on inherited wealth    among americans aware of the republican tax plan   percent said they were opposed  up from  percent in october  according to a nov    reuters ipsos poll released on wednesday  the latest online poll of   adults found  percent supporting the plan and  percent saying they  don t know   the sweeping tax package was developed over several months behind closed doors by a small group of senior congressional and trump administration figures  with little input from many republican lawmakers and no involvement from democrats  a major sticking point in the senate is how the bill deals with the federal deficit and the national debt  senator bob corker  one of the few remaining fiscal hawks in the republican party  wants to add a tax snap back provision to the bill that would raise taxes automatically if economic growth targets are not hit in the future to offset a higher deficit  that trigger proposal has become a target of growing criticism among conservative republicans and lobbyists  including interest groups aligned with the billionaire industrialists charles and david koch  who say the prospect of tax hikes could undermine future economic growth   i d prefer not having it there  we re probably going to have one  but i d prefer not having it   republican senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters  republican senator david perdue  a businessman from georgia  said lawmakers could find common ground on a measure that delays any tax hike for at least five years and spreads the prospective burden among those who benefit from republican tax cuts  senator rob portman  an ohio republican on the tax writing senate finance committee  suggested such an approach may be gaining ground   it looks like the idea is part way through the first  years  there d be an opportunity to see if the economic growth numbers are performing as expected  and if not  there would be a trigger mechanism over a  year period   portman said  democrats and independents were trying to persuade nonpartisan senate officials to disqualify parts of the bill  including one to allow drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge  as impermissible under senate rules  an aide said  while some republicans signaled determination to get the bill passed  they still did not have the votes   it s time for us to saddle up and ride  and i m ready to go   republican senator john kennedy of louisiana told reporters  corker declined to say whether he would vote for the tax bill even if senate republican leaders agree to the kind of trigger mechanism he wants   i don t do conjecture   he told reporters  saying he could have other concerns about the final legislation   there are also qualitative issues like the bill not getting any worse  that it doesn t get more expensive
