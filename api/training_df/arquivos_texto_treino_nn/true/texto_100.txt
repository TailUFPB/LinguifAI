washington  reuters    democratic senator elizabeth warren is taking aim at budget chief mick mulvaney s plan to fill the ranks of the u s  consumer financial watchdog with political allies  according to letters seen by reuters  the latest salvo in a broader battle over who should run the bureau  president donald trump last month appointed mulvaney as acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   though the decision is being legally challenged by the agency s deputy director  leandra english  who says she is the rightful interim head  mulvaney told reporters earlier this month he planned to bring in several political appointees to help overhaul the agency  but warren warned in a pair of letters sent monday to mulvaney and the office of personnel management  opm   which oversees federal hiring  that doing so was inappropriate and potentially illegal  the cfpb is meant to be an independent agency staffed primarily by non political employees  hiring political appointees could violate civil service laws designed to protect such employees from undue political pressure and discrimination  warren said   your naked effort to politicize the consumer agency runs counter to the agency s mission to be an independent voice for consumers with the power to stand up to wall street banks   warren  who helped create the cfpb  wrote to mulvaney  in a separate letter  warren asked the opm to review mulvaney s  unprecedented and unjustified  plans  in a third letter sent to mulvaney and english  warren asked for information about a review of ongoing enforcement actions at the cfpb  reuters reported earlier this month that a potential multimillion dollar settlement with wells fargo is among the enforcement actions under review amid the change in cfpb leadership  spokespeople for mulvaney and the opm did not immediately respond to requests for comment  mulvaney  who also serves directly under trump as the head of his office of management and budget  omb   said in the long term he would like to see professional staff alongisde political appointees  mirroring an arrangement in place at the omb    we will be staffing up with more permanent political people so the professional staff here have a better feel for where the administration wants to take the bureau   mulvaney said   but warren said such an arrangement  though understandable for bureaus like the omb which sit directly beneath the white house  was not suitable for independent financial regulators  the leadership of the cfpb has been in question since the agency s first director  richard cordray  resigned in november
