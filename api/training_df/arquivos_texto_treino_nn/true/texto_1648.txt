new york  reuters    former president barack obama used a rare public appearance on wednesday to question republicans  latest effort to repeal his signature healthcare law  saying it would inflict  real human suffering  on americans  in his speech at a bill and melinda gates foundation event in new york city  obama also laid out an optimistic vision of the world s future while implicitly criticizing republican president donald trump s  america first  philosophy  the remarks were one of the few times that obama  a democrat  has spoken publicly since he left office in january   it is aggravating   obama said of the republican attempt to eliminate obamacare   it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents   but obama said the healthcare fight was a good example of the way that advancement is often made  through fits and starts  with backward steps tempering every success   progress is never inevitable   he said   it can often be fragile  it s in need of constant renewal   the true test  he said  was in how people respond in times of difficulty  when their efforts to make the world better run into resistance   your response has to be to reject cynicism and reject pessimism and to push forward with a certain infectious and relentless optimism   he said   not blind optimism  not one that ignores the scale and the scope of challenges  but that hard earned optimism that is rooted in the stories of very real progress that have occurred throughout human history   the speech came a day after trump addressed the united nations general assembly for the first time as president  offering a full throated defense of nationalism and expressing skepticism about multilateral foreign policy  during a question and answer session with bill and melinda gates after his speech  obama said the united states cannot hope to solve the world s biggest problems  such as climate change or mass migration  on its own  as he has largely done since leaving office  obama did not mention trump by name  but he made it clear that he disagreed with the president s viewpoint   you don t have to cede your sovereignty or it doesn t make you less patriotic to believe that   obama said   you just have to have some sense   and read
