washington  reuters    a top u s  regulator for wall street took the unusual step on monday of directly asking president donald trump to veto a resolution that allows financial companies to block customers from banding together to sue  a request likely to be ignored  the consumer financial protection bureau  an independent regulator headed by democrat richard cordray  finalized a rule in july barring banks  credit card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits  known as class actions  and only take potential disputes to closed door arbitration  congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that trump  a republican  is expected to sign into law soon   you alone now have the power to safeguard people s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged   cordray  expected to resign soon to run for ohio governor  wrote to trump  white house officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter  in class actions  individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs  trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in january  but he has frequently criticized both cordray  appointed by former democratic president barack obama  and the cfpb  established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending  cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to trump  but that  many have told me     your mind is made up  about the resolution  shortly after the senate passed the resolution last tuesday  the white house released a statement saying the cfpb rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers  the administration has also said the cfpb used faulty research to write the rule  the cfpb says its five year study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data  rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies  which hire the mediators  and that the right to trial is enshrined in the constitution  on friday  military veterans also asked for a veto  regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes  let alone release their requests publicly   cordray has a strained relationship with republicans  who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired  for cause   a strict standard nearly impossible to meet  trump has gone as far as arguing in court filings that the cfpb is unconstitutional and he should have the power to fire its director
