washington  reuters    president donald trump s son in law  jared kushner  emerged from behind the scenes on monday to tell senate investigators he had no part in any kremlin attempt to meddle in the u s  election despite having met russians four times last year   all of my actions were proper and occurred in the normal course of events of a very unique campaign   kushner later told  reporters outside the white house   i did not collude with russia  nor do i know of anyone else in the campaign who did   kushner    a senior white house adviser  met senate intelligence committee staff behind closed doors for about two hours  two sources with knowledge of what kushner told them said the session was pleasant and conversational  in an  page written statement kushner made public before the meeting  the real estate businessman portrayed himself as new to politics when he became a top adviser to trump s  campaign  the letter was his fullest account to date of contacts with russian officials  a businessman married to trump s eldest daughter ivanka trump  kushner has rarely spoken in public since his father in law launched his presidential campaign in mid    i am not a person who has sought the spotlight   he wrote in the letter  trump prevailed over his democratic rival hillary clinton in november  because he ran a  smarter campaign  and to suggest otherwise  ridicules those who voted for him   kushner said at the white house  he took no questions  the congressional committee is one of several investigating the conclusion of u s  intelligence agencies that russia  under president vladimir putin  engaged in a hacking and propaganda campaign to try to tilt the november election in trump s favor  russia denies the accusation and trump denies his campaign colluded with moscow  special counsel robert mueller is leading a separate probe into the russia matter   a steady drip of information  much of it leaked to the news media  about contacts that trump aides had with russians has raised questions about possible collusion with moscow  viewed by many of trump s fellow republicans and rival democrats as a hostile power trying to undermine u s  interests around the world  trump  who has called the russia probes politically motivated  lashed out at the investigations in twitter messages on monday   kushner did not initially disclose any meetings with russians on forms he filed to get a government security clearance for his work in the white house  he has since revised those forms several times  according to the sources with knowledge of monday s meeting  kushner told the investigators that his lawyers and staff had not handled his security clearance form properly but they informed the fbi immediately when they realized it had been sent before it was complete  and then submitted a complete version  he said in his written statement that the initial form omitted not just russian contacts but also all foreign contacts  in his written statement kushner said he first met russian ambassador sergei kislyak in washington in april  and they shook hands   he said that in a dec   meeting with kislyak  the russian ambassador asked if there was a secure line in trump s transition office to facilitate a discussion with russian generals about syria  and kushner replied there was not   kushner said he asked if there was an existing communications channel at the russian embassy that could be used  but kislyak said that was not possible and they agreed to follow up after the inauguration   nothing else occurred  i did not suggest a  secret back channel    kushner said  kushner said he met on dec    with sergei gorkov  the head of russian state owned vnesheconombank  because of kislyak s insistence and because the russian had a  direct relationship  with putin   he introduced himself and gave me two gifts   one was a piece of art from nvgorod  the village where my grandparents were from in belarus  and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village   kushner said  he said that neither sanctions imposed by democratic former president barack obama s administration nor kushner s business activities were discussed  vnesheconombank has been subjected to u s  economic sanctions since mid  over russia s annexation of crimea from ukraine  relations between the united states and russia deteriorated under obama and trump has said he wants to improve ties with moscow  at times expressing admiration for putin  u s  lawmakers have said they want to hear about a june  meeting involving russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya and trump s eldest son  donald trump jr  the younger trump has released emails that showed he welcomed the prospect of receiving damaging information from the russian government about clinton  kushner and former trump campaign manager paul manafort were also at the meeting but kushner described it as a waste of time and said there was no discussion about the campaign during the time he was there   i actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after i had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote  can u pls call me on my cell  need excuse to get out of meeting    kushner is scheduled to address the house intelligence panel on tuesday
