washington  reuters    a bill proposed in congress on wednesday would require the u s  national security agency to inform representatives of other government agencies about security holes it finds in software like the one that allowed last week s  ransomware  attacks  under former president barack obama  the government created a similar inter agency review  but it was not required by law and was administered by the nsa itself  the new bill would mandate a review when a government agency discovers a security hole in a computer product and does not want to alert the manufacturer because it hopes to use the flaw to spy on rivals  it also calls for the review process to be chaired by the defense oriented department of homeland security rather than the nsa  which spends  percent of its budget on offensive capabilities and spying  republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin and democratic senator brian schatz of hawaii introduced the legislation in the u s  senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee   striking the balance between u s  national security and general cyber security is critical  but it s not easy   said senator schatz in a statement   this bill strikes that balance   tech companies have long criticized the practice of withholding information about software flaws so they can be used by government intelligence agencies for attacks  hackers attacked   in more than  countries last week using a microsoft windows software vulnerability that had been developed by the nsa and later leaked online  microsoft president brad smith harshly criticized government practices on security flaws in the wake of the ransomware attacks   repeatedly  exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage   smith wrote in a blog post  agencies like the nsa often have greater incentives to exploit any security holes they find for spying  instead of helping companies protect customers  cyber security experts say    do you get to listen to the chinese politburo chatting and get credit from the president   said richard clayton a cyber security researcher at the university of cambridge   or do you notify the public to help defend everyone else and get less kudos   susan landau  a cyber security policy expert at worcester polytechnic institute  said that in putting dhs in charge of the process  the new bill was an effort to put the process  into civilian control   the new committee s meetings would still be secret  but once a year it would issue a public version of a secret annual report   the nsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment
