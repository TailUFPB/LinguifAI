cranford  new jersey  reuters    appearing at a town hall in upscale cranford  new jersey this week  five term republican congressman leonard lance got a barrage of complaints from constituents about president donald trump   this administration is the most foul administration i have ever seen in my life  the stench that comes from washington can be smelled in my hometown   said martin carroll of watchung  new jersey  who drew a standing ovation  another man  who identified himself as alan  lambasted what he called the  criminality  of the trump administration   when will you call them out   he asked lance  lance  a mild mannered  year old  is one of many centrist republicans who are feeling voter heat over trump and are vulnerable to a backlash in next year s congressional elections  democrats hope to make the  mid term elections a referendum on trump  any path they have for capturing the republican led house of representatives runs through areas such as lance s  one of  republican districts that voted for democrat hillary clinton in the  presidential election  in lance s district  anger has risen over proposed cuts to domestic programs  republican efforts to roll back obamacare  president barack obama s healthcare overhaul  and allegations of collusion between trump s campaign team and russia  despite the president s denial of any such contacts  at the cranford town hall  the congressman made clear he has differences with trump on issues such as the budget and a special counsel investigation into any links between trump s campaign and russian officials  while trump has called the russia probe a  witch hunt   lance said he believes it is necessary and that he will  let the chips fall where they may  when the findings come in  lance also questioned the economic assumptions underpinning trump s budget and said he opposed its proposed cuts for the arts and environmental programs  of the  republicans in districts that voted for clinton  lance has been among the more vocal in distancing himself from trump  but there are others  republican representative barbara comstock of virginia has said she could not defend trump s decision to fire fbi director james comey  comstock and lance were among  republicans who voted against the trump backed republican healthcare bill in may  nine of those dissenters hailed from the  republican districts where clinton beat trump in november  in california  republican representative darrell issa has faced weekly protests in his district since trump s inauguration in january  issa says he backs robert mueller  the special counsel in charge of the russia investigation  and like lance  he opposes trump s proposed cuts to the environmental protection agency  but issa infuriated trump opponents with his backing of the healthcare bill   we saw your vote   some chanted outside issa s office  while others displayed the message  repeal   replace issa  on a california bridge  still  the  districts  which have a majority of white voters and tend to be moderately well educated and well off  do not make easy targets for democratic congressional candidates  republicans have triumphed repeatedly in these districts during the past  years  winning  races to democrats     and republicans have won every u s  house election in  of those districts since   for graphic on the districts   tmsnrt rs    in lance s district  a collection of well heeled bedroom communities outside new york city  registered republican voters outnumber democrats  but  unaffiliated  voters outnumber both categories  lance is rated a slight favorite to keep his seat by the cook political report  a non partisan election tracker  speaking after the cranford town hall  lance said he thought the crowd had been less contentious than those that had confronted him at recent constituent meetings  he thought his rejection of the healthcare bill was one reason   i guess i had to prove my bona fides   lance said   i vote with the president when i think he s right and i don t vote with him when i don t agree with him   but democrats note lance had earlier backed trump s  healthcare bill in a house committee  lance should have  tried to convince his colleagues to do the right thing  and he didn t do that   said linda weber  a  year old bank executive who is one of four people already seeking the democratic nomination to take on lance next year  ed harris  a retired attorney who attended the cranford town hall  said lance s rejection of the healthcare bill was a step in the right direction  harris  an unaffiliated voter  said he voted for clinton in   though not enthusiastically   i thought the bubonic plague was better than trump   harris said   i will support anybody who is opposed to trump   voters like harris pose a conundrum for lance and other republican moderates as they prepare for the mid term elections  differing with the president may help them win over centrists or independents  but then they run the risk of alienating trump supporters  trump backer wells pikaart  a sales manager from westfield  new jersey  said he understands lance s predicament but was nonetheless disappointed that the congressman did not vote in favor of the republican healthcare bill   i think that he needs to use his time now to advance the president s agenda   pikaart said
