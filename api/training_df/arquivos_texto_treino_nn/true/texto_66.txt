atlanta  reuters    the two democratic candidates running for governor in georgia are both lawyers and former state legislators  both are women  and on many policy issues it s hard to tell them apart  both even share the same first name   stacey  but they sharply disagree on the path to victory     stacey abrams    wants to become the first african american female governor in the united states by mobilizing solidly democratic black voters  who vote sporadically in elections  to form a winning coalition with white liberals  stacey evans    thinks the math does not add up without also appealing to white moderates  many of them outside urban areas  who voted for president donald trump last november  she is highlighting her crossover appeal as a white suburban mother with country roots  their divergent strategies mirror a wider debate within the democratic party that has grown louder after strong turnout by minority voters helped to power recent democratic victories in alabama and virginia  as the party prepares for the  congressional elections  there is disagreement over which voters to spend more time and money on   minority voters who are a fast growing share of the electorate but do not reliably cast ballots  or blue collar and suburban whites who swing between parties   graphic  tmsnrt rs   reuters interviews with liberal activist groups  some donors and an examination of campaign finance records show that many on the left are betting on abrams  strategy as the best shot at turning a republican state   underscoring the stakes in georgia is the unusual attention from national groups seeking to push the party farther left  their level of early support for abrams is largely unparalleled among other  gubernatorial and many congressional races  a dozen liberal groups have already thrown support behind abrams  according to a reuters tally  even though the democratic primary  or nominating contest  is still months away  the breadth of that support has been little reported  abrams  who rouses audiences to near religious fervor describing her struggles growing up poor and black in the south  argues that democrats have wasted resources on swing voters    we have left too many voters untouched   she said in an interview  noting that she refuses to tone down her support for abortion  gay rights and labor unions to appeal to republican leaning voters   her opponent does not discount the importance of black voters and also embraces liberal views  but  you are going to have to persuade some moderate republicans to vote for you  if you are going to win in georgia   said evans  who tears up before crowds when she recounts a childhood spent moving from one rural trailer home to another  after losing the white house last year  the democratic party found itself powerless in washington  some in the party faulted their presidential nominee  hillary clinton  for her lack of outreach to minority voters in key states  others blamed her inability to connect with working class white voters who were once democratic  minorities supported the democratic ticket by wide margins in   but turnout was flat among hispanics and sharply lower among african americans  according to the pew research center  only half of georgia s black voters cast ballots in   compared to more than two thirds of whites  a reuters review of state records showed  the democratic national committee said the recent wins in alabama and virginia  show that democrats are a force to be reckoned with when we invest early in the communities that represent who we are as a party    jennifer duffy  a political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report  said boosting democratic turnout could work as a strategy  but she urged caution   focusing too narrowly on specific demographic groups risks alienating moderate democrats  and swing voters  especially in suburban areas  also played a role in the recent democratic victories  she noted  university of georgia political science professor charles bullock agreed the numbers are there if democrats do not lose more white voters      at the abrams campaign headquarters  a poster titled  how we win  points out that democrats in georgia have lost recent elections by some   votes  more than  million black voters did not cast ballots during the last governor s race in   state data shows        they don t vote because we don t ask  and this is a campaign that is going to keep asking   abrams said  speaking  on a recent evening to an audience of three dozen volunteers      abrams  a tax attorney and romance novelist who led democrats in the state legislature  said her campaign has already reached out to more than   voters with door knocks  phone calls and text messages       she hosted summer events with music and barbecue in a dozen smaller cities   places like macon  a predominately african american community  and tiny dalton in the rural northern state       national liberal activists are lining up endorsements  money and manpower behind abrams  who is seen as starting with an advantage in a democratic primary dominated by black voters  democracy for america  moveon political action and the working families party call her campaign a model of how to engage the nation s increasingly diverse electorate        politics is changing in america  and abrams  path to victory reflects the changing demographics and enthusiasm   said dan cantor  national chairman of the working families party       moveon  whose recent endorsement of abrams marked its first in a  governor s race  said it would mobilize its   georgia members as volunteers for her campaign       democracy for america is similarly engaging nearly   members in the state  officials said the group has already raised nearly    for abrams  an unusually high sum for an election still a year away   a group called powerpac is organizing a   million get out the vote effort with plans to hire people to contact minority voters and use targeted radio  phone and digital campaigns       individual donors from outside georgia have contributed more than half of the    in larger donations that abrams has reported  according to a reuters analysis of campaign finance records  billionaire george soros  one of the democratic party s biggest financial backers  and two sons donated    each      by contrast  evans is not receiving many donations from outside of georgia  nor national endorsements  her campaign is focused on restoring cuts to a state college scholarship called hope  most of her money has come from in state donors  who have fueled almost all of her reported    in major donations      she has support from georgia s last democratic governor  as well as a big name democratic strategist  paul begala  who worked for the governor who created the scholarship       the georgia contest reflects divisions between those who want to broaden the democratic electorate by bringing back voters who have shifted away  and those who want to drill deeper into the party s base to increase turnout  said begala  calling it  an utterly false choice    it is like a football team saying   do you play offense  or defense    begala said   you have to do both        at a recent barbecue luncheon in athens  evans pointed out that she outperformed clinton last year in her district by  percentage points  picking up moderate voters       you can win in areas where you might not think you are going to have support  if you show up and talk to people   she told lawyers lunching on pulled pork served on paper placemats      evans is not knocking on voters  doors just yet  but she is traveling the state talking to local democratic organizations and african american churches          lukis newborn  an undecided rural voter  recently heard abrams speak in a suburban atlanta sports bar  he found her exciting  but he also connects with evans  having been raised in a household where dinner was rice and beans or peanut butter and jelly   both are a part of me   said newborn    from paulding county   it s an internal struggle of a georgia democrat like no other
