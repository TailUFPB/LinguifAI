washington  reuters    in washington  the chatter about a deepening  watergate style crisis has engulfed the white house   and those conversations are echoed in big cities across the country and in a succession of headlines that seem to suggest almost certain doom for the young trump administration  but for many americans  including president donald trump s staunchest supporters  the  crisis in washington  is not about possible missteps by trump or questions over whether his campaign colluded with russia  for them  it s the latest egregious example of mainstream media bias and of washington insiders desperate to preserve their status taking revenge on the new york celebrity businessman  in such an intensely polarized political environment that distrust of mainstream media will make it less likely that trump supporters   and the republican officeholders who rely on their votes   will abandon the president any time soon   the more negativity  the more we re for him  it s backfiring on them   arizona resident nadia larsen said of media reports about possible collusion with russia or trump s conversations with then fbi director james comey  reports from the washington post and new york times that trump shared classified information with russia s foreign minister and pressured comey to end an inquiry into former national security adviser michael flynn have been met with skepticism by larsen and many other trump supporters  more credible  they say  is news from prominent conservative media outlets  from the trump friendly airwaves of fox news to websites such as breitbart  those outlets have cast the allegations as an ideological attack by obama administration holdovers or the revenge of the  deep state   a term used by the far right to refer to what they see as a deeply entrenched bureaucracy opposed to trump   the only news i watch is fox  but the only news i watch and believe is whatever comes out of the president s mouth and whatever he tweets   said larsen  an israeli born immigrant who has lived in tucson  arizona  for  years  several trump supporters decried what they described as baseless news from anonymous sources and said they have not seen any concrete evidence to support the allegations against trump   this is what i expected   said jeff klusmeier  an insurance agent in louisville  kentucky   i expected the media to attack trump  i expected the democrats to attack him and call for impeachment  so it s par for the course for me   conservative media outlets have developed their own theories about the recent spate of negative headlines  the breitbart news network  once headed by trump chief strategist stephen bannon  reported that some of the recent accusations were driven by associates of comey  who was fired by trump last week  in a story headlined  comey strikes back   among the headlines on the drudge report  a popular conservative news aggregator  were  media reach peak meltdown  and  sabotage in dc    the anti trump press believes it smells blood in the water   said fox news commentator sean hannity  a staunch trump supporter who accused the mainstream media of  hyperventilating breathlessness   hannity tweeted on wednesday that five groups were trying to destroy trump  the media  democrats  deep state intelligence operatives  establishment republicans and  never trumpers    this effort  this plan  this desire to upend and stop the trump presidency got going probably on election night and certainly within  hours  and now we re seeing it manifest itself   radio talk show host rush limbaugh said  on wednesday  the justice department appointed former fbi head robert mueller as a special counsel to investigate possible ties between trump s  presidential campaign and russia  trump has fed the theory that the media is out to get him  saying  no politician in history  has been treated more unfairly  on thursday he tweeted that the probe of russian collusion was  the single greatest witch hunt  in u s  history   the overwhelming majority of conservatives and republicans believe that whatever you may think of donald trump  this is clearly being driven by many quarters of the media that chose sides in the election and were very upfront about it and haven t changed   republican consultant keith appell told reuters  trump s approval ratings have been low for a new president  remaining mired in the high  to low   but  percent of republicans approve of trump s performance  according to the most recent reuters ipsos survey  a figure that has stayed relatively steady since his inauguration  bradd bostick  a reynoldsburg  ohio  resident who started a bikers for trump group after the president s inauguration in january  said he was not concerned about the recent controversies because  most of us do not believe anything we hear in the mainstream media    the media thinks it s about trump  and it s not   said steve deace  an iowa based commentator for conservative review and a former talk radio host who has been critical of trump   it s not about trump s credibility  it s about the media s credibility
