warsaw  reuters    one day before his first meeting with russian president vladimir putin  u s  president donald trump said on thursday that no one knows for sure whether moscow intervened in the  u s  election but that he suspected russian involvement  speaking to reporters in poland  trump played down the assessment of his own intelligence agencies that russia meddled in the election by hacking democrats  emails and distributing online propaganda       i think it was russia  but i think it was probably other people and or countries  and i see nothing wrong with that statement  nobody really knows  nobody really knows for sure   trump told a news conference   investigations by a special counsel  robert mueller  and several u s  congressional committees are looking into whether russia interfered in the election and colluded with trump s campaign  those probes are focused almost exclusively on moscow s actions  lawmakers and intelligence officials say  and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries   moscow has denied any interference  and trump says his campaign did not collude with russia  trump  who defeated democrat hillary clinton in the november election  will meet putin on friday at a  summit in the german city of hamburg for their first official encounter   it was not clear whether the republican president would bring up the issue of election interference when the two men meet   in a speech in warsaw  trump affirmed u s  commitment to the defense of nato allies and gently criticized russia  trump frequently praised putin as a strong leader during the election campaign and called for better u s  relations with moscow but he has since tempered that rhetoric  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives  intelligence committee  said trump s remarks in poland about the election only propagated  his own personal fiction         the president s comments today  again casting doubt on whether russia was behind the blatant interference in our election and suggesting   his own intelligence agencies to the contrary   that nobody really knows  continue to directly undermine u s  interests   schiff said in a statement              trump cast doubt at his news conference over media reports that all  u s  intelligence agencies concluded in january that russia had meddled in the election       let me just start off by saying i heard it was  agencies   i said  boy  that s a lot  do we even have that many intelligence agencies  right   let s check it  and we did some very heavy research  it turned out to be three or four  it wasn t    trump said             the u s  intelligence report in january accusing russia of meddling in the u s  election was issued by the office of the director of national intelligence  which oversees the  u s  intelligence agencies   but the report acknowledges that it is based on an assessment by the cia  the federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency  which held the key classified information on russian activities  trump said the cia told his predecessor  democratic president barack obama  last august about russian interference in the election but he did nothing to stop it       i think what happened is he thought hillary clinton was going to win the election  and he said let s not do anything about it  had he thought the other way  he would have done something about it   trump said
