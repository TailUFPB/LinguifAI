washington  reuters    a bipartisan group of u s  senators introduced legislation on wednesday that would lessen prison sentences for non violent drug offenders  reviving a similar effort that failed to become law last year  the bill would narrow the scope of mandatory minimum drug sentences so they would apply only to violent criminals or serious drug offenders  it also contains provisions that aim to help non violent inmates become rehabilitated so they can re enter society  senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley  who rolled out the bill with a group including senior judiciary committee democrat dianne feinstein and republican lindsey graham  said it represented  the product of much thoughtful deliberation    this bipartisan compromise ensures that these consequences fit their crimes by targeting violent and career criminals who prey on the innocent while giving nonviolent offenders with minimal criminal histories a better chance to become productive members of society   grassley said  lawmakers failed last year to pass criminal justice reform  an issue that had been central to former democratic president barack obama s efforts to overhaul the system and reduce prison overcrowding  it is unclear whether the bill will get support from attorney general jeff sessions  who has made cracking down on violent crime  drugs and illegal immigration a focus since taking office this year under republican president donald trump   the department of justice s mission is to prevent crime and maintain public safety and the longstanding practice of the department is to fulfill that mission by charging the most serious readily provable offenses supported by the facts of the case   justice department spokesman ian prior said in a statement  sessions opposed last year s reform effort while he was a republican senator  he issued a memo in may that reversed course from the obama administration by telling u s  attorneys they were now required to  charge and pursue the most serious  readily provable offense   the policy shift is expected to trigger mandatory minimum sentences under laws passed in the  and  that critics say can wrongfully criminalize drug addicts and disproportionately affect low income and minority communities  sessions is scheduled to announce an initiative to reduce violent crime at a news conference on thursday morning
