 reuters    u s  senate republicans were expected to vote on tuesday for opening debate on a healthcare bill without knowing what is in it  but the potential components of the legislation were clear   approaches hammered out by republicans in recent months were expected to be in the mix  with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell making key choices about what is in and what is out  based on how much support a given combination can attract  one bill he could introduce would repeal much of obamacare with no replacement plan  another bill could repeal and replace the  law while also overhauling medicaid  the federal health insurance program for the poor and disabled  both bills have faced criticism from the health industry   the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  extended insurance to  million americans and was democratic former president barack obama s signature domestic achievement  for seven years  republicans have promised to repeal and replace it  but have struggled to do so  even though they now control both chambers of congress and the white house  another path open to mcconnell would be to develop an entirely new bill on the senate floor through amendments  here are summaries of bills that could be in play  a shortened version of obamacare repeal  called a  skinny repeal   could end obamacare s individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax  said a senate aide and a lobbyist  senate republicans would likely go for a bare minimum  skinny repeal  only if other approaches  such as those below  cannot win approval  mcconnell has said he could introduce a bill that republicans passed in  that was subsequently vetoed by obama  called the obamacare repeal reconciliation act  it would repeal most obamacare taxes and end funding for obamacare s medicaid expansion  as well as tax credits that help low income people buy health insurance on the individual insurance market  it would abolish a penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance  as well as a penalty on certain employers who do not provide employees insurance  but the legislation does not include a replacement plan  if signed into law  congress would have two years to craft and pass a replacement  the nonpartisan congressional budget office  cbo  estimated the law would increase the number of uninsured americans by  million in   and by  million in   the senate has spent months negotiating a bill  called the better care reconciliation act  that would repeal and replace much of obamacare  while also drastically cutting medicaid  the latest version would repeal many obamacare taxes  but retain two taxes on the wealthy  it would unwind obamacare s medicaid expansion over three years  then slash spending on medicaid beginning in   as well as overhaul the law s tax credits  it would also eliminate penalties on individuals for not purchasing insurance and employers who do not provide it  the bill includes an amendment from senator ted cruz that would let insurers sell bare bones policies that fall short of broad benefits mandated under obamacare  such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs  the cbo estimated the bill would result in  million more people losing their insurance by  and  in a separate report  estimated that medicaid would be cut by  percent come    house passed legislation in may  the house of representatives passed its own version of healthcare legislation  called the american health care act   it would repeal most obamacare taxes  including taxes on the wealthy  replace the law s income based tax credits with flat age based credits capped at upper income levels and end funding for the medicaid expansion beginning in    like the senate legislation  it would eliminate the penalty on individuals who do not purchase insurance and employers who do not provide it to employees  controversially  the house bill would eliminate the obamacare mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates  the cbo found it would result in  million more uninsured americans by  and destabilize the individual insurance market in much of the country
