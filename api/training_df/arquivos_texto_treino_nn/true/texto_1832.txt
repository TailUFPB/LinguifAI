washington san francisco  reuters    u s  legislation may be needed to require social media companies to disclose more about how their platforms are used for political advertising  a senior democratic lawmaker said on thursday  after new signs of russian efforts to influence the  election  facebook inc said on wednesday that an operation likely based in russia had placed thousands of u s  ads with polarizing views on topics such as immigration  race and gay rights on the site during a two year period through may    the world s largest social network was already under fire for how little transparency it provides about digital political ads  voters  researchers and journalists cannot see many of the ads politicians and interest groups run on facebook to target certain groups  nor can they discover who paid for them  senator mark warner said congress may need to update laws in order to make them consistent with rules governing television advertising   an american can still figure out what the content is being used in tv advertising  you can go look at the ad   warner  of virginia  said at a security conference    but in social media there is no such requirement  so  you know  we may need a legislative solution   he said  a second democratic senator  martin heinrich of new mexico  said on thursday that he supported regulating social media ads like tv ads   u s  intelligence agencies say there was an extensive russian cyber influence operation during the  election campaign aimed at helping donald trump  a republican  defeat democrat hillary clinton  russia has repeatedly denied the allegations  watchdog group common cause on thursday filed a complaint with the u s  justice department and the federal election commission alleging that unknown foreign nationals made expenditures during the election in violation of american election law   warner  the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee  said he believed what facebook disclosed was  the tip of the iceberg  and that twitter inc and other tech companies should also examine the issue  twitter declined to comment  google  the search engine which also owns video sharing website youtube  said on thursday it had seen no evidence of an ad campaign like the one facebook disclosed   warner s committee is among those investigating alleged russian meddling and whether members of trump s campaign colluded with moscow  facebook s disclosure about russian advertising created more questions than it answered  such as which candidates the ads supported and how savvy the targeting was  said david lazer  a northeastern university political scientist    does it reflect sophistication and coordination  or did they throw    at this just to try a bunch of stuff   he said   u s  election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to advocate the election or defeat of a candidate  although non citizens may advertise on issues  other ads fall into a legal gray area   television has been the backbone of political advertising for decades  and local u s  broadcasters are required to disclose a wealth of details about the cost and schedules of commercials  the ads can be seen by anyone with a television provided they are aired in their markets  online advertising offered by facebook and other platforms such as twitter and alphabet inc s google  though  often targets narrow  carefully constructed audiences based on factors such as age  political preference or interests  facebook is especially valued by advertisers due to its targeting capabilities  facebook and google have  so far  declined to make political ads more transparent  they said on thursday they were both open to reviewing specific congressional proposals   facebook also said it was continuing its investigation into possible nefarious activity   facebook briefed u s  lawmakers on wednesday and turned over information about the ads to robert mueller  the special counsel leading his own investigation into alleged russian interference  a source familiar with the matter told reuters  facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said after the november election that it was a  pretty crazy idea  to think false news stories on the network tilted the election   since then  though  the company and other tech firms have taken a series of steps to address deliberately false stories or manipulation of traffic by bots  facebook in april released a report on  information operations  on the site  including some aimed at influencing the french election this past spring  the report on wednesday expands on that and  for the first time  shows how paid advertising may have played a role in russian influence efforts in the united states    much of the advertising on facebook and google is self serve and can be easily ordered up through their websites   you can  from anywhere in the world  advertise to the entire world through the platform   said nathan persily  a stanford university law professor   it s incredibly empowering  but it doesn t have all the regulatory trappings that a medium like television has
