washington  reuters    internet giants  including alphabet s google  googl o  and facebook  fb o   are moving to compromise on several major policy issues as they adjust to an abrupt shift in the political winds in washington   just last week  the u s  senate took a big step toward advancing legislation that would partially strip away the internet industry s bedrock legal protection  a  law that shields companies from liability for the activities of their users  at the same time  democratic senators are writing legislation that would create new disclosure rules for online political ads after facebook this month revealed that suspected russian trolls purchased more than    worth of divisive ads on its platform during the  election cycle  the u s  federal election commission is considering bringing in facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing  unlike in europe  where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion dollar fines  internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the united states  even as their market power continues to grow  amazon  amzn o   for example  controls more than a third of u s  online commerce  while google and facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the u s  digital ad market  internet firms have from their inception urged u s  politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections  these firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the democratic administration of former president barack obama  which saw several officials go to work for google upon leaving the white house  but some democrats  still bitter over russia s alleged meddling in the  election  are now expressing alarm at the industry s power  virginia senator mark warner  the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee  this month compared political ads on social media to the  wild  wild west  and is working on legislation to require more disclosure  on the republican side  president donald trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks  google and facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook  now  the internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation  according to congressional aides  industry lobbyists and company sources    tech is no longer the golden goose   said one technology industry source  who spoke on condition of anonymity   maybe it s a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy   silicon valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown  in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry  notably the federal trade commission  remain severely understaffed  but the shift in tone is palpable  on thursday  facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg said the company  for the first time  would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on facebook  which  unlike television ads  do not fall under u s  law requiring disclosure of who pays for them  requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads  the company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by russian entities during and after the  u s  presidential election  the moves marked an about face for zuckerberg  who after the november election said it was a  crazy idea  to think that activity on facebook swayed the vote  facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies  formally known as section  of the  communications decency act  the legislation  which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking  has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet   but after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex trafficking victim   which followed two big tech companies  oracle  orcl n  and hewlett packard enterprise  hpe n   breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue   facebook and google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill  according to congressional aides and industry sources  in a statement  erin egan  facebook s vice president of u s  policy  said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to  address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens   the tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of congress that it perceived as threatening  including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report  terrorist  activity to the government  but the effort to amend section  is seen as different  the fast progress of legislation  introduced in august  has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked congress   the bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage com  which is used for sex advertising  the measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks  advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms   republican senator rob portman of ohio  the lead architect of the section  legislation  said in an interview with reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term  with or without silicon valley s cooperation   the bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the senate  a companion measure has similar backing in the house of representatives  portman said he had met with trump s daughter and advisor  ivanka trump  who expressed strong support   frankly  i am disappointed  that  more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort   portman said   it is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem
