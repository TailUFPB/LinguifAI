washington  reuters    saudi arabia hailed a  historical turning point  in u s  saudi relations after a meeting between u s  president donald trump and deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman highlighted the two leaders  shared view that iran posed a regional security threat  the meeting on tuesday appeared to signal a meeting of the minds on many issues between trump and prince mohammed  in a marked difference from riyadh s often fraught relationship with the obama administration  especially in the wake of the  iran nuclear deal   this meeting is considered a historical turning point in relations between both countries and which had passed through a period of divergence of views on many issues   a senior adviser to prince mohammed said in a statement   but the meeting today restored issues to their right path and form a big change in relations between both countries in political  military  security and economic issues   the adviser said  saudi arabia had viewed with unease the administration of u s  president barack obama  whom they felt considered riyadh s alliance with washington less important than negotiating the iran nuclear deal  riyadh and other gulf allies see in trump a strong president who will shore up washington s role as their main strategic partner and help contain riyadh s adversary iran in a region central to u s  security and energy interests  regional analysts said  the deputy crown prince viewed the nuclear deal as  very dangerous   the senior adviser said  adding that both leaders had identical views on  the danger of iran s regional expansionist activities   the white house has said the deal was not in the best interest of the united states  iran denies interference in arab countries  the meeting was the first since trump s jan   inauguration with the prince  who is leading the kingdom s efforts to revive state finances by diversifying the economy away from a reliance on falling crude oil revenues  under the plan  which seeks to promote the private sector and make state owned companies more efficient  riyadh plans to sell up to  percent of state oil giant saudi aramco in what is expected to be the world s biggest initial public offering  the two leaders  who discussed opportunities for u s  companies to invest in saudi arabia  kicked off their talks in the oval office posing for a picture in front of journalists  u s  vice president mike pence  trump s senior adviser and son in law  jared kushner  chief of staff reince priebus and strategist steve bannon were also present at the oval office meeting with prince mohammed  the meeting also appeared to illustrate support for some of the most contentious issues that trump has faced since taking office on jan    on a travel ban against six muslim majority countries  the adviser said prince mohammed did not regard it as one that was aimed at  muslim countries or islam   earlier this month trump signed a revised executive order on banning citizens from yemen  iran  somalia  syria  sudan and libya from traveling to the united states but removed iraq from the list  after his controversial first attempt was blocked in the court trump s travel ban has come under criticism for targeting citizens of several mainly muslim countries  the senior adviser said prince mohammed  expressed his satisfaction after the meeting on the positive position and clarifications he heard from president trump on his views on islam   the senior adviser said the leaders discussed the  successful saudi experience of setting up a border protection system  on the saudi iraq border which has prevented smuggling  trump has vowed to start work quickly on the barrier along the nearly   mile u s  mexico border to prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from crossing to the north  obama late last year suspended the sale of u s  made precision guidance munitions to the saudis  a reaction to thousands of civilian casualties from saudi led air strikes in yemen  u s  officials said trump was considering ending that ban and approving the sale of guidance systems made by raytheon co  the state department has approved the move  which awaits a final white house decision  the officials said  a source close to the issue  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said a main topic of the meeting would be saudi investment in the united states  which could help the u s  president fulfill his promises of job creation   it s the creation of jobs through investments   president trump wants results and statistics matter for him   said ingrid naranjo  an expert in u s  saudi relations   it makes a lot of sense for the diversification strategy of saudi to invest abroad and especially in the u s   gregory gause  a gulf expert at texas a m university  said that while saudi arabia might find the  atmospherics  of its relations with trump better than those with obama  it might find less change than it hopes on key issues   for example  he said  trump is unlikely to mount a major  costly effort to counter iranian influence in iraq  or to launch a full scale campaign to oust syrian president bashar al assad  as riyadh might wish   i think they re going to find rhetorically that the new administration says things and uses language they like more   said gause   but i think on the ground  we re not going to see an enormous difference
