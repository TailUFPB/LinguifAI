united nations moscow beirut  reuters    russia warned on friday that u s  cruise missile strikes on a syrian air base could have  extremely serious  consequences  as president donald trump s first major foray into a foreign conflict opened up a rift between moscow and washington  the warships uss porter and uss ross in the mediterranean sea launched dozens of tomahawk missiles at the shayrat air base  which the pentagon says was involved in a chemical weapons attack this week   graphic locator map on attack   tmsnrt rs    it was trump s biggest foreign policy decision since taking office in january and the kind of direct intervention in syria s six year old civil war his predecessor barack obama avoided  the strikes were in reaction to what washington says was a poison gas attack by the government of syrian president bashar al assad that killed at least  people in rebel held territory  syria denies it carried out the attack  they catapulted washington into confrontation with russia  which has advisers on the ground aiding its close ally assad   we strongly condemn the illegitimate actions by the u s  the consequences of this for regional and international stability could be extremely serious   russia s deputy u n  envoy  vladimir safronkov  told a meeting of the u n  security council on friday  russian prime minister dmitry medvedev charged that the u s  strikes were one step away from clashing with russia s military  u s  officials informed russian forces ahead of the missile strikes and avoided hitting russian personnel   graphic explaining kind of missile used

groups   trump has frequently urged improved relations with russia  strained under obama over syria  ukraine and other issues  was hosting chinese president xi jinping at his mar a lago resort in florida on thursday night when the attack occurred      treasury secretary steve mnuchin  in florida with trump  said on friday the united states would announce additional sanctions on syria in the near future but offered no specifics  russia s defense ministry responded to the attack by calling in the u s  military attache in moscow to say that at midnight moscow time   p m  edt  it would close down a communications line used to avoid accidental clashes between russian and u s  forces in syria  interfax new agency said  u s  warplanes frequently attack islamic state militants in syria and come close to russian forces  u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said on friday the trump administration was ready to take further steps if needed   we are prepared to do more  but we hope that will not be necessary   she told the u n  security council   the united states will not stand by when chemical weapons are used  it is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons   secretary of state rex tillerson  who also was in florida with trump and is scheduled to go to moscow next week  said he was disappointed but not surprised by the russian reaction because it showed continued support for assad  iran  which supports assad and has been criticized by trump  condemned the strike  with president hassan rouhani saying it would bring  only destruction and danger to the region and the globe   u s  officials called the intervention a  one off  intended to deter future chemical weapons attacks and not an expansion of the u s  role in the syrian war   u s  allies from asia  europe and the middle east expressed support for the attack  if sometimes cautiously  the action is likely to be interpreted as a signal to russia  and countries such as north korea  china and iran where trump has faced foreign policy tests early in his presidency  of his willingness to use force  the united states is now likely to be more aggressive in pursuing intelligence about syria s suspected chemical weapons program  the pentagon has also signaled interest in determining any russian complicity   at a minimum  the russians failed to rein in the syrian regime activity   a senior u s  military official told reporters  speaking on condition of anonymity  the official also said the united states had been unable to determine if a russian or syrian aircraft bombed a hospital that was treating victims of the chemical attack  russia joined the war on assad s behalf in   turning the momentum in his favor  although moscow supports opposing sides in the war between assad and rebels  the united states and russia say they share a single main enemy  islamic state  tillerson said the strike took out about  percent of the seventh wing of the syrian air force and hit a fueling facility  the base s runway was still in use  assad s office said syria would strike its enemies harder  damascus and moscow denied syrian forces were behind the gas attack but western countries dismissed their explanation that chemicals leaked from a rebel weapons depot after an air strike  the syrian army said the u s  attack killed six people and called it  blatant aggression  that made the united states a partner of  terrorist groups  including islamic state  there was no independent confirmation of civilian casualties  u s  lawmakers from both parties on friday backed trump s action but demanded he spell out a broader strategy for dealing with the conflict and consult with congress on any further action  the u n  security council had been negotiating a resolution  proposed by the united states  france and britain on tuesday  to condemn the gas attack and push the syrian government to cooperate with international investigators  russia said the text was unacceptable and diplomats said it was unlikely to be put to a vote  russia expects tillerson to explain washington s stance when he visits moscow next week  interfax news agency cited a russian foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying  washington has long backed rebels fighting assad in a multi sided civil war that has killed more than   people and driven half of syrians from their homes since   the united states has conducted air strikes against islamic state  which controls territory in eastern and northern syria  and a small number of u s  troops are helping rebel militias  asked whether the strikes set back any efforts to work with russia to defeat islamic state  sometimes known as isis  white house spokesman sean spicer said   there can be a shared commitment to defeat isis and also agree that you can t gas your own people   tuesday s attack was the first time since  that syria was accused of using sarin  a banned nerve agent it was meant to have given up under a russian brokered  u n  enforced deal that persuaded obama to call off air strikes four years ago   chart of cumulated reported deaths from chemical gases in syria   tmsnrt rs    video depicted limp bodies and children choking while rescuers tried to wash off the poison gas  russian state television blamed rebels and did not show footage of victims                      the u s  strikes cheered assad s enemies  after months when western powers appeared to grow increasingly resigned to his staying in power  but opposition figures said an isolated assault was far from the decisive intervention they seek  neither the trump administration nor its predecessor has laid out a policy aimed at ending the syrian conflict
