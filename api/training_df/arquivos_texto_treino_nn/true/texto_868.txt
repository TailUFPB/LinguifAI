washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on thursday agreed to expand the use of disaster aid to help rebuild puerto rico s power grid and other infrastructure wrecked by hurricane maria  the white house said  in a unique agreement recognizing both the massive devastation on the island and its dire financial problems  aid from the federal emergency management agency  fema  for infrastructure projects will be released in a faster  more flexible way than is typical after disasters  a senior white house official told reuters  the plan  agreed to with puerto rico governor ricardo rossello  will also provide for third party advisers to estimate how much money is requires for big ticket projects  and how it is spent   a provision aimed at protecting taxpayer dollars in what is expected to be a massive  long term effort to rebuild the island   we re doing it in a way that grants flexibility  but also imposes a mutually agreed upon set of controls   the official said in an interview  the new agreement will see fema cover  percent of the costs for rebuilding public infrastructure  up from the typical level of  percent  puerto rico   home to   million americans   is in bankruptcy  struggling with   billion in debt  its finances were put under federal control last year  six weeks after hurricane maria hit  only about  percent of puerto rico s power grid has been restored  private sector estimates of total damage from maria have ranged as high as   billion  the white house is expected to deliver a new request for disaster aid to the u s  congress in mid november to help defray costs from maria and two other major hurricanes   harvey and irma   as well as damage caused by wildfires in the western united states  it is not yet clear how big the federal tab for puerto rico will be   obviously it s going to be a big dollar figure   the official said   i know there won t be any balking at the amount of money needed from the administration   even with fema covering  percent of the costs  it could be difficult for the territorial government to put up its  percent  on top of its fiscal constraints  the storm has ground its economy   and tax revenues   to a halt  the federal government provided a   million loan in an aid package approved by congress last month that can be used to help cover its share  the official said           we didn t want to create the precedent of giving  percent in the grant program and then disincentivizing good stewardship   the official said  the federal government will also use relatively new procedures created in  after hurricane sandy known as  section   in the stafford act  the law that provides for federal disaster aid   it s not been used on this scale before   the official said  the procedures will allow puerto rico to estimate the costs of big projects up front   with help from third party advisers   and draw down from approved grants  eliminating the slow and cumbersome process of being reimbursed for upfront spending on each segment  the agreement will also allow puerto rico to access hazard mitigation grants   normally tapped only outside of disasters   while rebuilding the creaky power grid and other infrastructure so that the structures are more resilient to future hurricanes   we re going to build them back smarter   the official said
