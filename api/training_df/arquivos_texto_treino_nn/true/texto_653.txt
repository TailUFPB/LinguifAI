washington  reuters    a year after donald trump was elected president on a promise to revive the ailing u s  coal industry  the sector s long term prospects for growth and hiring remain as bleak as ever  a reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year   much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for u s  coal rather than presidential policy changes  u s  utilities are shutting coal fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas  along with wind and solar power  and domestic demand makes up about  percent of the market for u s  coal   we re not planning to build any additional coal facilities   said melissa mchenry  a spokeswoman for american electric power  one of the largest u s  utilities   the future for coal is dictated by economics   and you can t make those kinds of investments based on one administration s politics    coal plants now make up  percent of aep s capacity for power generation  a figure it plans to shrink to  percent by    for a graphic on coal production  demand and employment  see  tmsnrt rs   the situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends  as some energy experts have said all along  the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the oval office  a white house official did not respond to a request for comment  trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry  said luke popovich  a spokesman for the national mining association  which represents major u s  coal companies    the government is no longer against us   he said   we now only have market forces to contend with   trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election  the president started the process of killing former president barack obama s clean power plan  meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants  ended an obama era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands  ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams  and started withdrawing the united states from the paris climate agreement  now trump s energy secretary  rick perry  is attempting to push a rule through the independent federal energy regulatory commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a  day supply of coal on site  the goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants  a move perry says will make the electric grid more reliable  while the full impact of trump s coal policy could take years to understand  the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand  energy analysts and utility officials said  trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation  the industry has lost more than  percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since   its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in    we re going to bring the coal industry back  percent   trump said at a rally in virginia in august of   so far  progress has been limited  u s  coal production is on track to rise more than  percent in  over the previous year  to  million tons  according to the energy information administration  but  output is expected to decline  the number of coal miners has also risen slightly to   in october  up about   since november    but down about  percent from a  peak  according to the labor department  on november   trump cited the modest production increases in a tweet  saying   it is finally happening for our great clean coal miners   but these increases are largely attributable to demand for u s  coal from asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in australia  according to james stevenson  a coal analyst at ihs markit  during the first six months of   asian countries took in   million short tons of u s  coal  up  percent over the same period in   according to the eia  that demand will soon fade  stevenson said   we are not going to get a repeat of    he said of the spike in exports  forecasts from utilities and the u s  government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound  utilities are expected to shut down more than   megawatts of coal plant capacity in   that follows a loss of nearly   mw this year and   mw in   according to eia and thomson reuters data   by   coal fired power plant capacity will dip to   mw  down about  percent from   according to eia  three texas coal plants owned by vistra energy corp subsidiary luminant are among the latest to close  bringing the number of plants that shut  or plan to  to  since    a figure higher than the  plants that remain  according to the sierra club  which has campaigned against coal  vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power   and not by environmental regulations  duke energy  one of the country s largest utilities  has shut down more than   mw of coal capacity since  and plans to shed another   mw by   over the next decade  duke plans to invest   billion in new natural gas and renewable power   and nothing in new coal fired generation  said spokesman rick rhodes  a nov   report by the federal reserve bank of st  louis   which has two of the largest coal producers in its district  peabody energy corp and arch coal inc   said coal fired power plants  may eventually become obsolete   coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook  peabody expects a  modest number  of coal power plant retirements in the coming years  with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output  spokesman vic svec said  arch spokeswoman logan bonacorsi offered a similar forecast    robert murray  the chief executive of privately held murray energy corp   one of america s biggest underground miners   said trump could do more for the industry  the administration  murray said  should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an epa finding that carbon emissions endanger human health  but trump s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives  which have bi partisan backing  and the epa has so far steered clear of the so called  endangerment finding  on emissions that is the basis of many fossil fuel regulations  given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it  murray energy  meanwhile  announced on oct   it will buy a   percent stake in a coal mining partnership in utah called canyon consolidated resources  llc  the deal might help the companies cut costs  but it s unlikely to help workers  murray said about  of   jobs in utah could be lost
