forward looking agenda to our relations   trump accepted modi s invitation to visit india  the white house said in a statement  but no time frame was given for the trip  modi harked back to trump s

s vision for making america great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation   he said  trump did not mention u s  differences with india on immigration and the paris climate accord   the future of our partnership has never looked brighter   trump said as both leaders underscored the importance of the defense and security relationship  as they met  a pentagon agency said the u s  state department has approved the possible sale to india of a boeing c  transport aircraft with an estimated cost of   million  the united states also has offered to sell a naval variant of the predator

from the same cloth   if the chemistry is good  everything else gets sorted   said an indian official   the only way is up  how much up we go depends on the leaders  if they click  we go up higher

investment and had not deterred india from imposing new ones  indian officials reject suggestions that modi s  make in india  platform is protectionist and complain about the u s  regulatory process
