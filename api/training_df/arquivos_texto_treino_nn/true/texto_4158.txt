his efforts on north korea on trying to persuade china to put more pressure on its ally and could view any unusual chinese military movements as supportive of this  he told a news conference with the visiting prime minister of italy on thursday that the united states was  in very good shape  on north korea and that china s xi  whom he met this month for a summit in florida  was working hard to help   we don t know whether or not they re able to do that  but i have absolute confidence that he will be trying very very hard   trump repeated a past comment that he had told xi in florida that china would make much better deal on trade with the united states  if you get rid of this menace or do something about this menace of north korea    super mighty preemptive strike   the rodong sinmun

intention to provoke us       william perry  who served as u s  defense secretary from  to  and negotiated with north korea  said he did not believe pyongyang was planning a surprise attack  despite
