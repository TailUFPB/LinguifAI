washington  reuters    from pataskala  ohio  to conroe  texas  local government leaders worry that if republican tax overhaul plans moving through the u s  congress become law  it will be harder for them to pave streets  put out fires  fight crime and pay teachers  a tax plan approved by the house of representatives on thursday would sharply curtail a federal deduction that millions of americans can now claim for tax payments to state  county  city and town governments  ending that deduction  the local leaders say  could make their taxpayers  especially in high tax communities  less likely to support future local tax increases or even tolerate local taxes at present levels  the proposed repeal of the state and local tax  salt  deduction is part of an  assault on local governments  by republicans in washington  said elizabeth kautz  the republican mayor of burnsville  minnesota  near minneapolis   my hope is that we look at being thoughtful about what we re doing and not ram something through just to get something done before the year is out   kautz said of the plan being rushed through congress by her own party  in the united states  local governments run schools  operate police and fire departments and maintain streets  parks and libraries  among other essential services  the federal government s role at that level is limited  cities  towns  counties and states collect their own property  sales and income taxes  under existing law  payments of those taxes can be deducted  or subtracted from federal taxable income  lowering the amount of federal tax due  the house tax bill just approved would eliminate the deduction for individuals and families of state and local income and sales tax  while capping property tax deductions at     a bill being debated in the senate  with republican president donald trump s support  would kill the salt deduction entirely for individuals and families  although businesses would keep it  the fate of that bill is uncertain  ending the salt tax break is part of a package of changes to deductions that would help republicans raise more than    trillion in new federal tax revenues over  years  that increase would help offset the    trillion in revenue that would be lost from cutting the corporate tax rate  another part of both the senate and house plans  chuck canterbury  president of the fraternal order of police  which represents   law enforcement officers nationwide  wrote a letter to congressional leaders on tuesday   the fop is very concerned that the partial or total elimination of salt deductions will endanger the ability of our state and local government to fund these  law enforcement  agencies   said the letter  distributed to reporters  emily brock  a director at the government finance officers association  said if salt deductions were killed by congress  voters could revolt   can you blame an individual taxpayer   she asked   they try to minimize their individual tax liability   those who want to curb the century old salt deduction argue it only motivates local governments to seek more tax increases and spend more money   maintaining the deduction encourages government overspending and taxation   argues the american legislative exchange council  a nonprofit group of conservative state legislators and private activists   various other groups are fighting on capitol hill to defend the salt deduction  such as the national association of realtors and the u s  conference of mayors  steve williams  chief financial officer for conroe  texas   said its rapid growth demanded new fire stations  schools  roads and public safety services  conroe is near houston and in the congressional district of republican representative kevin brady  chairman of the house tax committee and a champion of restricting the salt deduction   tax reform comes with picking winners and losers and i think in the final analysis  the people in  congressional  district  will be losers   williams said  conroe is part of montgomery county  which voted  percent to   percent for trump over democrat hillary clinton in the  presidential election  in pataskala  ohio  near the state capital  columbus  city finance director jamie nicholson said the local police department needed a new station  it now works out of an early  building with no holding cell for suspects who are under arrest   they get handcuffed to a chair   he said  given the past difficulty pataskala has had convincing taxpayers to approve new taxes  he said  eliminating or paring back the salt deduction might trigger demands for chopping local taxes and blow a huge hole in his budget  greg cox  a republican member of the san diego county  california  board of supervisors  echoed similar concerns about the impact on his community  he said the republican plan was unfair partly because it let businesses keep the salt deduction  while taking it away from individuals and families
