washington  reuters    u s  republicans in congress are grappling with a thorny question about corporate taxes as they work to reconcile competing tax bills from the senate and house of representatives into a unified measure that they hope president donald trump will sign into law before the end of the year  the senate bill that squeaked through on a   vote last week jettisoned a long held republican goal of repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax  amt  to help pay for last minute deals that secured the republican votes for passage  that puts senate republicans on a collision course with republicans in the house of representatives  whose own tax bill repeals the corporate amt and who are already calling for the tax to be eliminated in final legislation   house and senate republicans also face potential sticking points over how their bills treat so called pass through enterprises  top earners  the estate tax on inheritances and international tax policy for corporations  but the corporate amt could be the biggest challenge  because removing it could require lawmakers to cover a   billion revenue loss over a decade  possibly by scaling back their plan to cut the corporate income tax rate to  percent from  percent  the  percent corporate amt is an alternative to the regular corporate income tax in computing taxes owed  it is designed to limit the ability of corporations to reduce their tax bills through various deductions and credits  such as a credit for research and development that is especially popular with silicon valley technology companies  corporations must compute taxes using both methods and then pay whichever rate is higher  with the top corporate rate now at  percent  few wind up paying the amt  because both the house and the senate bills would reduce the corporate tax rate to  percent  the same as the corporate amt  there is concern that corporations would not be able to use the r d credit   i think that has to be eliminated   house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california said of the corporate amt in a cnbc interview on monday   the house voted   on monday to go to conference with the senate on tax legislation  setting up formal negotiations that could take weeks to complete  a similar senate vote could come later this week   the decision to retain the corporate amt in the senate bill helped keep the legislation s overall revenue loss within an agreed upon limit of    trillion   there would need to be some sort of alternative to raise that revenue and there isn t a lot of latitude to make further trades   said jared walczak  senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan tax foundation  a washington think tank  senator john cornyn  the no   republican in the senate called that  the    question   the money s got to come from somewhere   cornyn said   that s one of the things we ll have to explore if  house republicans  want to make some changes   trump has already signaled flexibility on the corporate tax rate  saying on saturday that it could end up at  percent rather than  percent in both bills  his comments could help justify a bump up in corporate taxes to cover the cost of eliminating the corporate amt  but republicans worry that increasing the corporate income tax rate above  percent could make the u s  economy less attractive in a global marketplace where national tax rates have fallen   i would hope that we would not change the corporate rate   cornyn said   i hope we don t undermine our own message
