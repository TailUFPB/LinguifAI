washington new york  reuters    internal state department instructions to implement president donald trump s temporary travel ban on citizens of six muslim majority nations help demonstrate that the ban violates the constitution  the american civil liberties union argued in court filings late on thursday  the aclu made the argument as part of its lawsuit in federal court in the northern district of california on behalf of three student visa holders against trump s march  executive order barring travelers from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen from entering the united states for  days and refugees for four months  the lawsuit  which seeks class action status  says the order discriminates against muslims  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson issued instructions to implement trump s order in a series of four cables to consular officers worldwide last month  which were first revealed by reuters  the aclu pointed to language from one of the cables that directs consular officers to assess whether applicants from the six countries  found otherwise eligible  for u s  visas could still be denied visas based on trump s order  the aclu said the guidance  amounts to an unconstitutional amendment of existing law   tillerson issued the cable on march   and followed it with another set of instructions on march   the day before the ban was supposed to go into effect  after federal courts blocked the central tenets of trump s order  tillerson issued two other cables that rescinded many of his previous instructions but left some tighter visa vetting procedures in place  a state department official declined to comment on the litigation or the cables  the department of justice also declined to comment  the trump administration has said that the travel ban and increased screening of foreigners are crucial to protecting the united states from terrorist attacks  the government is arguing in court that the president has broad authority under the law to make immigration decisions when there are concerns about national security  the march executive order replaced a more sweeping travel ban that trump signed on jan    which sparked chaos and protests at airports and was challenged by more than two dozen lawsuits  the original ban had covered citizens of iraq  as well as the six countries also included in the revised ban  iraq was dropped from the revised order  as was an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria  the revised ban aimed to overcome legal hurdles by excluding legal permanent residents and allowing for waivers for people with ties to the united states  the aclu  in its claims that the order discriminates against muslims  points to calls by trump on the campaign trail for a  muslim ban  and to a speech he made last month calling the new ban a  watered down  version of the first
