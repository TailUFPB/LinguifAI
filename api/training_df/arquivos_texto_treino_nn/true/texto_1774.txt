washington  reuters    u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin cast doubt on president donald trump s chances of cutting the corporate tax rate to  percent  while trump met with six senators including three democrats who set clear conditions for future cooperation with him on taxes  the president is cranking up a publicity campaign to build public support for his general goals of lower and simpler taxes  but no detailed tax plan has been completed or proposed by the white house or the republicans in control of congress  even after months of discussion within the party  basic questions are unanswered  such as whether tax cuts should be designed so they don t add to the federal deficit and debt  and how deeply business and individual rates should be cut  mnuchin told a conference in new york hosted by cnbc on tuesday that trump  as the president has said for months  would like to cut the corporate income tax rate to  percent from  percent  then mnuchin  a top tax adviser to trump  said   i don t know if we ll be able to achieve that  given the budget issues  but we re going to get this down to a very competitive level   later in the day  trump held a dinner at the white house with the six senators  reflecting his new willingness to engage with the political opposition  three democrats attended the dinner  in contrast  republican leaders in congress have been trying for most of the year to write a tax bill while ignoring the democrats  also attending were vice president mike pence  white house economic adviser gary cohn and mnuchin  pennsylvania republican senator pat toomey  one of the attendees  said on a conference call later that trump talked about competitive business taxes  ending taxation of u s  corporations  foreign profits  and a middle class tax cut  after the meal  trump took some of the senators on a tour of the west wing  later  the democrats expressed an openness to working with trump on taxes  but stressed certain conditions  west virginia democrat joe manchin said in a statement he would continue to fight for a simpler tax code  but  we must do this without adding to our staggering debt   north dakota democrat heidi heitkamp said in a statement the dinner was a  good discussion  and that she told the president any tax package must support working families and farmers  overhauling the tax code was one of trump s main campaign promises in   but he has made little progress toward it  after nearly eight months in office  he has yet to win passage in congress of any major domestic policy legislation  besides manchin and heitkamp  others at the dinner were indiana democrat joe donnelly and three republicans  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch and fellow tax panel republicans john thune and toomey  donnelly said in a statement   tax reform should include measures to support companies that invest in our workers and penalize companies that ship american jobs to foreign countries   a major concern on tax cuts is the federal budget deficit  it would balloon if tax rates were cut too deeply without providing offsetting federal spending reductions and closure of tax loopholes  both politically difficult tasks  white house budget chief mick mulvaney told fox news on tuesday that he hoped tax reform would not be revenue neutral  suggesting he is not overly concerned about the deficit and the national debt  now about   trillion   we need as big and as a dramatic tax reduction and tax reform as we possibly can get   mulvaney said  mnuchin declined to say what business tax rate was achievable  he said he was  incredibly hopeful  a tax plan could be enacted this year  adding it could be retroactive to january  asked if trump would hold out for a  percent corporate rate  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said   the president is prepared to push for as low of a rate as we can get   republican paul ryan  the republican speaker of the house of representatives  said last week that  the numbers are hard  to make trump s  percent corporate tax rate target work  ryan set his own goal at around   percent  trump s legislative affairs director  marc short  said at a christian science monitor event   we think that what s best for the american people is a  percent corporate rate right now   financial markets rallied after trump s election victory last november in anticipation of rapid tax cuts  especially for corporations  but those expectations have faded   the likelihood of passing sweeping corporate reform has diminished   jack ablin  chief investment officer at bmo wealth management  said in a research note  democrats  who generally oppose tax cuts for the wealthiest americans  will have negotiating clout in congress in early december to resist tax changes they oppose  also potentially including a corporate rate cut  trump may visit as many as  states to sell his planned tax cuts to voters in coming weeks  the white house said  the u s  senate will begin tax overhaul hearings this week  republican senator john kennedy  a budget committee member  told reuters he wanted tax plans  with specificity  and expressed frustration at the slow pace of the tax debate   no more platitudes  let s see some meat on the bone   kennedy said   and i m tired of screwing around      the american people are tired of screwing around
