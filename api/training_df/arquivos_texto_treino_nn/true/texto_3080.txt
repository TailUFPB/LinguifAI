washington  reuters    frustrated democrats pondered the party s future and questioned its campaign messaging on wednesday after a demoralizing defeat in a georgia congressional race widely seen as a referendum on president donald trump s young administration  in the most expensive congressional election in u s  history  republican karen handel  a former georgia secretary of state  defeated political newcomer democrat jon ossoff by  percentage points on tuesday in a suburban atlanta district that republicans have held since the   the special election  to fill the seat vacated by tom price after trump appointed him health and human services secretary  did not change the balance of power in washington where republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress  but it was a demoralizing blow to democrats hoping georgia would be a breakthrough for a party trying to harvest electoral victories from the grassroots anti trump activism seen in marches on washington and boisterous crowds at town hall meetings around the country  the district was seen as within reach to democrats because trump won there last november by only  percentage point  democrats also lost a special election in south carolina on tuesday in a race republicans were widely expected to win  democrats lost two other contested special elections earlier this year for republican held seats in conservative kansas and montana  that makes the party  for  in this year s races for republican held congressional seats   ossoff race better be a wake up call for democrats   business as usual isn t working   tweeted representative seth moulton of massachusetts   we need a genuinely new message  a serious jobs plan that reaches all americans  and a bigger tent   several prominent democrats said the party needed to rethink its approach heading into next year s congressional elections  when democrats need to pick up  seats to regain control of the house of representatives  senator chris murphy of connecticut told msnbc that democrats needed to focus on economic growth and  get back to being a big tent party   the outcome also raised questions about the future of house democratic leader nancy pelosi  republican groups spent millions on television ads linking ossoff to pelosi  portraying him as a captive of the party s liberal wing despite ossoff s efforts to present a more moderate image  in south carolina  charleston attorney and democratic political newcomer joe cunningham said on wednesday he would seek the house seat now held by republican mark sanford  but that if elected he would not back pelosi as the democratic leader   the democratic party needs new leadership now   cunningham tweeted   the road to a democratic house majority runs through dozens of districts similar to the affluent  well educated northern suburbs of atlanta where ossoff was defeated  and the outcome there is likely to reassure republicans already nervous about their chances of holding control under trump next year  the win in georgia also could strengthen the political will of republicans in congress evaluating their next steps on a tax package and what opinion polls show is a deeply unpopular replacement of president barack obama s signature healthcare law  trump was quick to celebrate the georgia win and accused democrats of standing in the way of a legislative agenda bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether his campaign colluded with russia in last year s presidential election  at a rally in cedar rapids  iowa  on wednesday night  trump said   if karen handel had lost  they would have blamed it on me    and don t forget  this happened in montana  in kansas   he added   they don t get it  they haven t figured it out yet  you know they re still trying to figure where all those voters came from   he said of democrats   despite the string of losses in special elections  some democrats said there were reasons to be encouraged  in all four states  democrats bolstered their historical performance in districts they lost by double digit margins last year  the unpopularity of trump and the republican healthcare bill   along with the historic trend that the party holding the white house loses seats in midterm elections   gives democrats hope for capturing the house in   democrats have a target rich environment next year  starting with  republican held districts where democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton won a majority of the vote
