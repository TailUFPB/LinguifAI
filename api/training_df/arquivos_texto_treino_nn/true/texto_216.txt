washington  reuters    the u s  treasury department on monday released a one page analysis of the economic and fiscal impact of a republican tax overhaul plan that was swiftly criticized by a number of tax experts and attacked as  fake math  by democrats  treasury said the tax plan would more than pay for itself in  years  basing its forecast on a   percent annual economic growth assumption  a level well above most economists  expectations  as well other changes on which the white house has made little progress   we are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the administration s economic agenda   treasury secretary steven mnuchin  a former goldman sachs  gs n  banker  said in a statement  the committee for a responsible federal budget  a conservative fiscal watchdog in washington  said the mnuchin analysis  makes a mockery of dynamic scoring and analysis   referring to methods for forecasting the impact of tax changes on the economy  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said the treasury analysis was  nothing more than one page of fake math    it s clear the white house and republicans are grasping at straws to prove the unprovable and garner votes for a bill that nearly every single independent analysis has concluded will blow up the deficit and generate almost no additional economic activity to make up for it   he said in a statement      the sparring over economic forecasts came as republicans resumed efforts to reconcile two tax overhaul bills  one approved by the senate and one by the house of representatives  president donald trump wants a single tax bill on his desk soon so he can sign it into law before the end of the year  in what would be his first major legislative achievement since taking office in january  the republican president will deliver a speech on wednesday  to the american people on how tax reform will lead to a brighter future for them and their families   the white house said in a statement  republicans are driving toward approval of a debt financed package of deep tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy and a mixed bag of results for middle class americans  although the republicans see the effort as crucial to their prospects in november  s congressional elections  nearly half of americans oppose the plan  according to reuters ipsos polling  the treasury analysis was meant to help bolster long standing promises from republicans  including mnuchin  that their proposed tax cuts would super charge an already growing economy and raise more than enough new tax revenue to offset a large federal deficit increase  congressional researchers have estimated the republican plan would add    trillion to the   trillion national debt over  years  before any projected positive effects on the economy  or   trillion after such effects  in its analysis  treasury said its projected   percent annual growth over the next decade would result not only from tax cuts but  a combination of regulatory reform  infrastructure development  and welfare reform as proposed in the administration s fiscal year  budget   the trump administration sent a budget to congress earlier this year that lawmakers largely ignored  while the white house has rolled back some regulations  it has made no substantial progress on infrastructure development or welfare changes  growth of   percent would produce    trillion in new tax revenues over  years  more than enough to offset the revenue that the tax plan would lose  the department said   we acknowledge that some economists predict different growth rates   it added in a statement accompanying its analysis  which focused on the tax plan as approved more than three weeks ago by the senate finance committee  the full senate on dec   approved a somewhat different plan  which would boost gross domestic product by   percent in  and have little effect on gdp in the decade ahead  said the tax policy center  a nonpartisan think tank  in a report on monday  wharton business school at the university of pennsylvania also issued a report on monday finding the plan approved by the full senate would add    trillion to the national debt over  years   even with assumptions favorable to economic growth
