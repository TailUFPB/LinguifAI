 reuters    u s  president donald trump disbanded two high profile business advisory councils on wednesday after corporate ceos quit in protest at his remarks blaming violence in charlottesville  virginia  not only on white nationalists but also on the protesters who opposed them  the move came after more corporate chief executives who had been members of the panels said they would no longer serve on them  john doyle  director of markets  tempus consulting  washington   this calls into question the ability of the trump administration to get anything done in terms of tax and infrastructure reforms  it s another piece of evidence of the administration s mounting problems   brian battle  director of trading  performance trust capital partners  chicago   guys have been resigning from that council for a couple of days now  it doesn t appear to me that s the cause  disbanding the ceo council won t diminish the president s ability to find out what the ceos think    he said the move was all about anticipation of the fed minutes   there s tension  janet yellen says there s inflation  it s just that we can t see it right now because transitory causes are keeping it down    that has been her public commentary  what the minutes are going to reveal is if there s consensus in the committee that s true  we have to watch the minutes to see if there s inflation and if they have to start heading it off   andrew frankel  co president of stuart frankel   co in new york  the market should definitely care about trump and these industry defections  and yet every day i come to trade  the overall tape appears averse to what goes on in dc and all its negativity   steven chiavarone  portfolio manager  federated investors  new york   our view is that the market rally has been driven by earnings and nothing to do with washington  which is why the market has been as patient as it has  the question becomes does any of this impact earnings  in of itself  no   you are still going to have a congress that doesn t want to walk into the  midterms with nothing to show or else they will get slaughtered  so there is still a chance for fiscal reform  but whether we get to policy discussion is now a fair question    as an american you can have all kinds of feelings about what the president has and has not said  but as a market participant we aren t pulling in the horns here  if you get to the point where we see republican members of congress actively talking about impeachment  then that changes  we re not there yet but we could be   david schiegoleit  managing director of investments  u s  bank private wealth management  newport beach  california   the market movement seemed to be dovetailing with things hitting the wire out of washington  it looks like ceos are resigning from these councils  and the white house is trying to do some damage control  that throws a little bit more doubt into the president s abilities to push his policies through   walter todd  chief investment officer at greenwood capital associates in greenwood  south carolina   i don t see any other news that would account for what we re seeing    there s no denying that the policy risk has increased with the last  to  hours    you have got tax reform  we need to pass the budget and debt ceiling increase in next  days or so  this was already a very difficult environment to get stuff done  this has made it more so    it s a distraction from pursuing meaningful legislation and things that could help the economy   mary ann hurley  vice president in fixed income trading  d a  davidson  seattle   i think it s due to all of this turmoil going on in the white house  the manufacturing council has been disbanded  or everybody has quit  depending on whose version you want to believe    mike pence is coming back from an overseas trip early  the white house just seems to be in chaos and trump is losing support right and left from republicans and democrats alike and his one core area  the business community  are all abandoning him  too  which certainly calls into question the ability to get anything accomplished whatsoever in this term unless he takes actions to right the ship  i think it s  the rise in treasury prices  a flight to  quality bid     art hogan  chief market strategist  wunderlich securities  new york  it is not corporate ceos distancing themselves  from the president  what will have economic impact  it will be congress distancing itself  we should tie this to the difficulty to get legislation passed    i m surprised the  stock  market is up at all  on a combination of terrible communication and an administration that is working us into a constitutional crisis at the very worst  and  at the very least  one that is going to be ineffective in legislating anything in the near term that would be beneficial to the economy   we re not going to have stimulative  pro business legislation getting passed with a president who continues to distance himself from his party   blake gwinn  u s  rates strategist  natwest markets  stamford  connecticut   he was election partly because he is a business friendly president  this is the flip side  it s a move away from that  the disbanding of these groups doesn t mean all that much  but the market is looking at it as not a business friendly move   kathy lien  managing director  bk asset management  new york   right now it seems like  the dollar s slide  is coinciding with trump s announcement that he s disbanding the council  another hit to administration  weighing on market sentiment and leading investors to sell more dollars because dollar has had a very difficult time extending gains ahead of the fomc  federal open market committee   the timing seems to indicate this is the primary driver   chris zaccarelli  chief investment officer  cornerstone financial partners  in huntersville  north carolina   people are reacting to the news headlines out of washington as it come across the tape     it s a little bit of a confidence story  these moves are tiny  i think its waxing and waning investor confidence with what s happening in dc   stocks  s p  index  spx dropped from near the day s high before the news  initially shedding about   percent from its level beforehand  the index remains about   percent higher on the day  bonds     rr and  year  rr treasury yields tick lower  yield curve flattens slightly forex  the dollar index  dxy drops about   percent  led by small gains in euro eur  and yen jpy
