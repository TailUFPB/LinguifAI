washington  reuters    a republican tax bill in the u s  senate stalled on a procedural problem late on thursday  forcing lawmakers to weigh new options to an amendment sought by a leading fiscal hawk to address a projected large expansion of the federal deficit under the measure  senators said  senator bob corker had wanted to add a provision to the bill that would trigger automatic tax increases in years ahead if the tax cuts in the bill failed to boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion  but the senate parliamentarian barred corker s  trigger  proposal   we just got the realization from the parliamentarian that that s probably not going to work   said republican senator david perdue  in response  republicans were considering building future tax increases into their bill   it s not a threshold anymore  it s just a tax increase      the only thing that s come off the table is the trigger concept   perdue said
