washington  reuters    president donald trump on thursday tapped fed governor jerome powell to become head of the u s  central bank  breaking with precedent by denying janet yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies  powell    a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the fed board in  by then president barack obama  emerged as trump s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift  in an announcement at the white house  trump described the soft spoken powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on yellen s achievements in steering the u s  economy after the recovery from the   financial crisis   if we are to sustain all this progress  our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight   trump said as powell looked on   we need strong and steady leadership at the u s  federal reserve     he will provide exactly that     powell has worked alongside yellen for the past five years  backing her direction on monetary policy and  in recent years  sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates  yellen s four year term as fed chief ends in early february   she will be the first u s  central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since   trump on thursday lauded yellen s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term  the republican president said he was impressed by powell s experience in the private sector and  real world perspective  to government    he understands what it takes for our economy to grow   trump said  powell  who in the last  years has done a prototypical washington circuit of government  private  and think tank jobs  pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the fed has on average americans  he will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a    year low    monetary policy decisions matter for american families and communities  i strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence   powell said in brief remarks after trump s announcement  his nomination now goes to the republican controlled senate for confirmation   i m encouraged by president trump s choice   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement that pledged  timely  consideration of the nomination  there was little apparent market reaction to powell s nomination  which had been expected  investors were largely focused on the release of details of a republican plan to broadly change the u s  tax code  by setting benchmark short term interest rates  the fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy  since the crisis  the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector  while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality  yellen  a fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system  said in a written statement that she would work with powell  to ensure a smooth transition   trump s decision  after a broad and very public search  offers what analysts said was a classic compromise  allowing him to select his own fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the yellen run central bank   the kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting powell   trump  has all but selected yellen   said sarah binder  a political science professor at george washington university and author of a recent book on fed politics   there is not really much daylight  if any   in june  powell laid out both a defense of the fed s gradualist path and a critique of those  including some of his competitors for the fed job  who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems  trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low  a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list  particularly stanford university economist john taylor and former fed governor kevin warsh  top white house economic adviser gary cohn also was a contender  powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by yellen on the policy setting federal open market committee  and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and u s  stock markets near record highs  the fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month  but powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis  also important to trump  powell can now pursue that end along with trump appointee randal quarles  the fed s new vice chair for supervision  though he will be the first fed chief since the late   without an advanced degree in economics  powell brings market insights  fed board experience and republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition  under president george h w  bush  powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the treasury  from  to  he was a partner at the carlyle group  a private equity firm  and focused on public debt dynamics while at the bipartisan policy center think tank  yellen is entitled to remain as a fed governor until   though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place
