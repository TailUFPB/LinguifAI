washington  reuters    secretary of state rex tillerson has declined a request to host an event to mark islam s holy month of ramadan  two u s  officials said  apparently breaking with a bipartisan tradition in place with few exceptions for nearly  years  since   republican and democratic secretaries of state have nearly always hosted either an iftar dinner to break the day s fast during ramadan or a reception marking the eid al fitr holiday at the end of the month  at the state department           tillerson turned down a request from the state department s office of religion and global affairs to host an eid al fitr reception as part of ramadan celebrations  said two u s  officials who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly   according to an april  memo seen by reuters  the office   which typically initiates such events   recommended that tillerson hold an eid al fitr reception   his rejection of the request suggests there are no plans this year for any high profile ramadan function at the state department  the month of fasting and prayer for muslims gets under way in many countries on saturday  when asked by reuters to comment on tillerson declining a request to host an eid al fitr event in july for ramadan  a state department spokesperson said   we are still exploring possible options for observance of eid al fitr  which marks the end of the month of ramadan  u s  ambassadors are encouraged to celebrate ramadan through a variety of activities  which are held annually at missions around the world    muslim activists have accused president donald trump s administration of having an unfriendly attitude toward islam     encapsulated by its attempts to ban citizens of several muslim majority countries from entering the united states          the administration says that while it strongly opposes islamist militants  it has no quarrel with islam  aides point to trump s visit this month to saudi arabia  the birthplace of islam where he addressed the leaders of more than  muslim countries  as evidence of that  members of congress  muslim civil society and community leaders  diplomats from muslim countries and senior u s  officials usually attend the state department ramadan event  a symbol of the u s  government s diplomatic efforts with muslim countries and people  if tillerson avoids hosting one this year  that could send a message  that it is not as important to this administration to engage with muslims   said former u s  diplomat farah pandith  who served in the bush and obama administrations and helped plan ramadan events at the white house and state department      tillerson issued a statement on friday to mark the start of ramadan  which he called  a month of reverence  generosity  and self reflection    most importantly  it is a cherished time for family and friends to gather and give charity to those who are less fortunate   he said            former secretary of state madeleine albright started the tradition  years ago of america s top diplomat hosting a public event for ramadan  a lunar month  the secretary of state of the time usually gives remarks there on the meaning of ramadan  in april  the state department s office of religion and global affairs made a request to tillerson s office that he deliver remarks at an eid al fitr reception this year  and suggested a two week range of dates in july  the event would serve to  highlight state department initiatives and the importance of muslim engagement   the memo said  it noted that by hosting a reception just after ramadan  rather than an iftar   an often sumptuous dinner at sunset   a state department event could be held any time of the day  thus preventing  a very late evening for the secretary    several weeks later  that office and other offices at the state department were alerted that tillerson declined the request  the officials said   reuters was told of the request being declined but did not see tillerson s reply  an official with the office of religion and global affairs did not respond to a request for comment         several prominent muslim american groups in the washington area who are normally invited to the ramadan event told reuters this week that they had yet to receive an invitation from the state department  which they said was unusual   if they re having one  we haven t been invited   said rabiah ahmed  spokeswoman for the muslim public affairs council in washington  a representative for her group has been invited to the state department event in the past  she said  trump s administration has had a fraught relationship with muslims  as a presidential candidate  the republican urged a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states  called for more surveillance of mosques and warned that radical muslims were  trying to take over our children   trump has since toned down his rhetoric and courts have halted his temporary travel ban on people from six mostly muslim countries  white house officials did not respond to a request for comment on whether they would continue the tradition this year of hosting a ramadan related event at the white house      the state department celebrates other religious traditions though some of those commemorations are not as well established as the state department s ramadan event  in   then secretary of state john kerry hosted the first ever celebration at the state department marking diwali  the hindu festival  the white house also traditionally hosts annual christmas and easter events as well as a seder dinner to mark the jewish passover  the top u s  diplomat has personally hosted a ramadan event every year since   often in the state department s grand benjamin franklin room  apart from three years  in  and   deputies of the secretary of state at the time hosted either an iftar dinner or an eid al fitr reception     in   kerry hosted a reception for eid al adha  another important muslim holiday
