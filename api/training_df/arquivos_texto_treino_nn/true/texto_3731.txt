washington  reuters    members of the u s  congress on wednesday generally approved of the appointment of former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel to investigate possible connections between president donald trump s  campaign team and russia  committees in the house and the senate will continue their own investigations while mueller leads the justice department s probe  mueller s appointment comes after the administration was rocked by reports that trump asked federal bureau of investigation director james comey to drop an investigation of mike flynn  who resigned amid allegations of contacts with russia  trump fired comey last week  below are reactions to the mueller appointment   as i have stated many times  a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity  i look forward to this matter concluding quickly     trump in a statement  a special prosecutor is the first step but it cannot be the last  director mueller will still be in the chain of command under the trump appointed leadership of the justice department  he cannot take the place of a truly independent  outside commission that is completely free from the trump administration s meddling     democratic representative nancy pelosi in a statement  i don t think they should have appointed someone     where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute      what i worry is democrats are going to politically exploit this on a daily drumbeat     republican representative jason chaffetz  chairman of the house oversight committee investigating russian influence  in a fox news interview in which he also praised mueller s  impeccable credentials    i think the president ought to now back off and let the justice system proceed as it proceeds in all cases  i think tweeting about the process of the investigation is not helpful and again  i think if he has done nothing wrong there will be no problem     democratic representative elijah cummings to reporters  this had gotten too political  any news comes out  those on the left yell impeach  some on the right say it s fake  so this hopefully detoxes some of the politics      republican representative adam kinzinger to reporters  it s fine but there s absolutely no need for it   in watergate  there was a crime  in the  monica  lewinsky case  there was a crime  there s no crime here     republican representative peter king to politico  hopefully  he  mueller  will be seen as someone that both democrats and republicans can support  i think it s a prudent move  and it certainly means that the administration is taking it seriously     republican representative mark meadows to reporters  this must only be a first step  no doubt this investigation should extend to the circumstances that led to the president s abrupt dismissal of james comey and to other critical matters that arise     democratic senator patrick leahy  i would hope that the people here  in congress  will believe if a special prosecutor tells them that there s no indication that the russians have done anything here  that they will finally open their eyes  and say   there s no there  there      republican representative dana rohrabacher to reuters  the appointment of former fbi director and respected lawyer robert mueller     is a positive development and will provide some certainty for the american people that the investigation will proceed fairly and free of political influence     republican richard burr and democrat mark warner  leading members of the senate committee investigating russian influence  in a statement
