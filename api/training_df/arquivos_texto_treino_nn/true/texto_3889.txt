washington  reuters    former acting u s  attorney general sally yates said on monday she warned the white house in january that then national security adviser michael flynn had been compromised and could have been vulnerable to blackmail by russia  yates testified at a senate judiciary subcommittee hearing that focused primarily on flynn  and did not shed much light on other aspects of investigations of allegations that russia meddled in the  u s  election and whether there was collusion between president donald trump s campaign and moscow  yates repeatedly declined to discuss details of the investigation in a public forum  former director of national intelligence james clapper  who also testified  said he stood by past assertions that he had not seen evidence of such collusion but also declined to comment on classified matters  yates briefly led the u s  justice department until trump fired her on jan   for declining to defend his travel ban on seven muslim majority countries  she told white house counsel don mcgahn on jan    less than a week into trump s presidency  that flynn had not been telling the truth about his contacts with russia s ambassador to washington  making her first public statements about the issue  yates said she feared moscow could try to blackmail flynn because it also knew he had not been truthful about conversations he had with ambassador sergei kislyak about u s  sanctions on russia  flynn  a retired general once seen as a potential trump vice president  has emerged as a central figure in the russian probes  russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia                   yates told the hearing she had been concerned that  the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the russians    logic would tell you that you don t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the russians have leverage over him   she said  trump  who continued to praise flynn  waited  days after yates  warning before flynn s forced resignation for failing to disclose the content of his talks with kislyak and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations   several democratic senators questioned trump s delay  yates said that in her meetings  mcgahn  demonstrated that he understood this was serious     if nothing was done  certainly that would be concerning   during that section of the hearing  clapper described as accurate a report in the guardian newspaper that british intelligence officials became aware in late  about suspicious interactions between trump advisers and russian agents  and that the information was passed on to u s  intelligence agencies   yes  it is  accurate   and it s also quite sensitive   clapper said  yates was a holdover from the administration of president barack obama  obama had warned trump  then president elect  not to give the post of national security adviser in his administration to flynn just after the republican s surprise victory in the nov   election  a former obama aide said      the warning  first reported by nbc news  came up during a discussion of white house personnel  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters obama had communicated concerns about flynn  it  shouldn t come as a surprise to anyone  given that general flynn had worked for president obama  was an outspoken critic of president obama s shortcomings   spicer said      obama pushed flynn out in  from his job as director of the military s defense intelligence agency  or dia  congressional committees began investigating after u s  intelligence agencies concluded that russian president vladimir putin ordered hacking of democratic political groups to try to sway the election toward trump  the main investigations are being conducted by congressional intelligence committees  although democrats have clamored for a special prosecutor or independent committee  they argue that congressional committees are too partisan to conduct credible probes  after monday s hearing  trump took to twitter to bash the media and deny any collusion   director clapper reiterated what everybody  including the fake media already knows  there is  no evidence  of collusion w  russia and trump   he said  and in another tweet  the president seemed to denounce the hearings   the russia trump collusion story is a total hoax  when will this taxpayer funded charade end   he asked  fbi director james comey testified in the house on march  that the agency was investigating potential links between trump associates and moscow s attempts to tilt the election  trump had also used twitter before the hearing to insinuate that yates had leaked information on flynn to the media  yates and clapper both swore under oath that they had never leaked classified information  questioning on monday often broke along party lines      some republicans veered away from russia to focus on issues such as whether the obama administration had improperly revealed the names of trump associates contained in surveillance records   senator john cornyn  the no   republican in the senate  was one of a handful who grilled yates about her objections to trump s travel ban  trump fired yates after she defied the white house on the travel ban  a policy that trump said would help protect americans from islamist militants
