washington  reuters    congressional republicans took important steps on thursday toward the biggest u s  tax code overhaul since the   with the house of representatives approving a broad package of tax cuts  and a senate panel advancing its own version of the legislation sought by senior lawmakers and president donald trump    the house vote shifted the tax debate to the senate  where a tax writing panel finished debating and approved a bill late thursday evening  that measure has already encountered resistance from some within the republicans ranks  full senate action is expected after next week s thanksgiving holiday  four republican senators   enough to derail the legislation   have been talking privately about opposing the bill because it would balloon the federal deficit  according to a time magazine report  trump  who is still seeking his first major legislative win since taking office in january  went to the u s  capitol just before the house vote to urge republicans to pass the tax bill  which democrats call a giveaway to the wealthy and businesses   a simple  fair and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy  and it s within our reach  now is the time to deliver   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said after the largely party line house vote of     congress has not thoroughly overhauled the sprawling u s  tax code since republican ronald reagan was president  the house measure is not as comprehensive as reagan s  package  but it is more ambitious than anything since then  the path forward for the tax plan in the senate  where republicans have a narrow majority  is fraught with obstacles about concerns over the deficit  healthcare and the distribution of tax benefits  republicans can lose no more than two senate votes if democrats remain united in opposition  senate republican tax writers earlier this week made the risky decision of tying their plan to a repeal of the requirement for people to get healthcare insurance under former president barack obama s affordable care act  that exposed the tax initiative to the same political forces that wrecked republicans  anti obamacare push earlier in july  the house bill  estimated to increase the federal deficit by nearly    trillion over  years  would consolidate individual and family tax brackets to four from seven and reduce the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent   it also would scale back or end some popular tax deductions  including one for state and local income taxes  while preserving a capped deduction for property tax payments   democrats have pointed to analyses showing millions of americans could end up with a tax hike because of eliminated deductions  repealing or shrinking some deductions is a way to offset the revenue lost from tax cuts   it s a shameful piece of legislation  and the republicans should know better   house democratic leader nancy pelosi told lawmakers before the vote  senate democratic leader chuck schumer warned republicans that by increasing the deficit  the tax bill would imperil other important priorities such as military spending  thirteen house republicans opposed the bill  all but one from new york  new jersey or california   states with high taxes where residents would feel the pinch from eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes   this fight is not over  i look forward to continuing negotiations to improve this proposal for my constituents   said republican representative lee zeldin of new york  who voted against the bill  investors have cheered the prospect of a tax overhaul  u s  stocks rose and the dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on thursday after the house vote  brian battle  director of trading at performance trust capital partners in chicago  said stocks  strong gains on the day were helped by the house vote   it s helping stocks now and the bond market s turned around   he said   the tax plan isn t a foregone conclusion  but it passed the lowest hurdle in the house  the even higher hurdle is to have something pass in the senate   republicans have long promised tax cuts and see enacting them as critical to their prospects of retaining power in washington in the november  congressional elections  particularly after failing to meet their promise to repeal the affordable care act  better known as obamacare  but it will be a challenge in the  seat senate  where republicans have only a   majority  senators jeff flake and james lankford are among the four republicans considering opposing the plan  time reported  a lankford spokesman said he was  eager to work with colleagues to pass tax reform   flake  who often clashes with trump and has announced he will not seek re election next year  told reuters on thursday he was  more worried about the fiscal problem  than other issues  several other senators  including ron johnson and susan collins  who helped sink the republican effort to repeal obamacare  have expressed concerns  johnson announced his opposition because of what he said were unequal rates for small businesses and non corporate enterprises known as  pass throughs   versus corporations  he is working with the white house to fix the issue  he told reuters  senator john mccain  a republican who also voted against the healthcare overhaul effort this summer  and his colleagues bob corker and lisa murkowski  are also considered critical votes   nonpartisan congressional analysts say the provision to repeal the health insurance mandate in the senate version would drive up premium costs and cause some  million americans to lose coverage   the senate plan also sets individual tax rate cuts to expire while reductions for corporations are permanent   if the full senate approves its measure  it will have to be reconciled with the house version before legislation can be sent to trump s desk for his signature  republican representative tom cole said that should not be a problem   there s no issue here that can t be ironed out and settled between us   cole told reporters
