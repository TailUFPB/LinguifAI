washington  reuters    the united states might ban laptops from aircraft cabins on all flights into and out of the country as part of a ramped up effort to protect against potential security threats  u s  homeland security secretary john kelly said on sunday    in an interview on  fox news sunday   kelly said the united states planned to  raise the bar  on airline security  including tightening screening of carry on items    that s the thing that they are obsessed with  the terrorists  the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight  particularly if it s a u s  carrier  particularly if it s full of u s  people   in march  the government imposed restrictions on large electronic devices in aircraft cabins on flights from  airports  including the united arab emirates  qatar and turkey  kelly said the move would be part of a broader airline security effort to combat what he called  a real sophisticated threat   he said no decision had been made as to the timing of any ban   we are still following the intelligence   he said   and are in the process of defining this  but we re going to raise the bar generally speaking for aviation much higher than it is now   airlines are concerned that a broad ban on laptops may erode customer demand  but none wants an incident aboard one of its airplanes   whatever comes out  we ll have to comply with   oscar munoz  chief executive officer of united airlines  ual n   told  the company s annual meeting last week  airlines were blindsided in january when president donald trump issued an executive order banning entry for  days to citizens from iraq  syria  iran  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen  sending airlines scrambling to determine who could board and who could not  the order was later blocked in the courts   in the case of laptops  the administration is keeping the industry in the loop  delta air lines  dal n  said in a statement it  continues to be in close contact with the u s  department of homeland security   while munoz applauded the administration for giving the company a  heads up     we ve had constant updates on the subject   he said   we know more than most  and again  if there s a credible threat out there  we need to make sure we take the appropriate measures    more scrutiny of carry ons among the enhanced security measures will likely be tighter screening of carry on items to allow transport security administration agents to discern problematic items in tightly stuffed bags  kelly said that in order to avoid paying fees for checking bags  people were stuffing them to the point where it was difficult to see through the clutter    the more stuff is in there  the less the tsa professionals that are looking at what s in those bags through the monitors can tell what s in them   the tsa has begun testing certain new procedures at a limited number of airports  requiring people to remove additional items from carry on bags for separate screenings  asked whether the government would expand such measures nationwide  kelly said   we might  and likely will
