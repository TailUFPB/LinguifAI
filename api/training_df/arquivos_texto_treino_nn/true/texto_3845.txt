washington  reuters    president donald trump s dismissal of federal bureau of investigation director james comey has raised questions about the future of the agency s probe into russian attempts to sway the  presidential election and possible collusion with trump s campaign  democrats are worried comey s firing on tuesday could jeopardize the ongoing fbi probe and have renewed calls for an independent investigation  some republicans have said that could undermine concurrent investigations underway in the u s  senate and house of representatives  here is what could happen next    the investigations already underway could continue  comey s firing does not necessarily mean the fbi s investigation into moscow s role in the  election will be disrupted or end  legal experts told reuters  the career fbi staffers comey put in charge of the probe will likely continue it  even as the search for a new director begins  the parallel inquiries underway in senate and house committees could likewise progress    the justice department  other federal agencies or the u s  congress could conduct independent investigations  the justice department could conduct a criminal investigation  but other federal agencies and departments have the power to conduct fact finding inquiries  according to university of southern california law professor sam erman  congress could also create a special commission or appoint a special master separate from the committee probes  erman said    the justice department could appoint a special counsel  most democrats have said they prefer the appointment of a special counsel at the justice department to oversee the probe since it is the only agency that can bring a criminal case  a law related to the appointment of a special prosecutor lapsed in the  but department regulations provide that the attorney general can appoint a special counsel from outside the federal government  if the attorney general ignores the recommendations of a special counsel  the rules specify that a report must be sent to congress  according to justin levitt  a professor at loyola law school in los angeles  the attorney general can hire staff to do the job of a special counsel without triggering department rules  this occurred in  when a special counsel investigated the disclosure of the identity of intelligence officer valerie plame    deputy attorney general rod rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel  attorney general jeff sessions has recused himself from involvement in russia related probes after misstating his own contacts in  with russia s ambassador in washington  rosenstein would likely appoint a special counsel  some democrats  however  have already raised questions about sessions  role in advising rosenstein on comey s firing and called for a nonpolitical appointee at the justice department to make the special counsel decision    the appointment of a special counsel would not end the congressional probes  senate republicans  including some from leadership  have said a special counsel should not be appointed because it would imperil ongoing congressional probes but a special counsel would not have the authority to demand congress halt a probe  criminal probes can at times complicate congressional matters  particularly with witness testimony  but an investigation undertaken by a special counsel would be no different than the one already underway at the fbi   it wouldn t interfere any more or any less if a special counsel were appointed   levitt said
