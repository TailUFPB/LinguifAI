washington  reuters    senate republicans on thursday crushed a democratic blockade of president donald trump s u s  supreme court nominee in a fierce partisan brawl  approving a rule change dubbed the  nuclear option  to allow for conservative judge neil gorsuch s confirmation by friday  with ideological control of the country s highest court at stake  the republican led senate voted   along party lines to change its long standing rules in order to prohibit a procedural tactic called a filibuster against supreme court nominees  that came after republicans failed by a   tally to muster the  vote super majority needed to end the democratic filibuster that had sought to deny gorsuch confirmation to the lifetime post  the senate s action cleared the way to confirm gorsuch by simple majority on friday  with a final vote expected by late morning  republicans control the senate    the rule change was called the  nuclear option  because it was considered an extreme break with senate tradition  trump had encouraged republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to  go nuclear   confirmation of gorsuch would represent trump s first major victory since taking office on jan    after setbacks on healthcare legislation and the blocking of his order that sought to ban travelers from several muslim majority countries from entering the united states  senate confirmation of gorsuch  a colorado based federal appeals could judge  would restore the nine seat court s   conservative majority  enable trump to leave an indelible mark on america s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the republican president  gorsuch    could be expected to serve for decades   this will be the first and last partisan filibuster of the supreme court   mcconnell said on the senate floor  accusing democrats of trying to inflict political damage on trump and to keep more conservatives from joining the high court   in  or  or  years  we will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the senate and the supreme court  a day when we irrevocably moved further away from the principles our founders intended for these institutions  principles of bipartisanship  moderation and consensus   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor  schumer ridiculed mcconnell s contention that the democratic action was unprecedented  he noted that the republican led senate refused last year to consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland for the same seat that trump selected gorsuch to fill  with three of the court s justices  or older  trump told reporters he hoped to appoint as many as four supreme court justices  a move likely to make it overwhelmingly conservative   in fact  under a certain scenario there could even be more than that   trump said aboard air force one en route to a meeting with china s president in florida  adding that the senate rule change would not alter how he picks court nominees  a conservative majority court is more likely to support broad gun rights  an expansive view of religious liberty  abortion regulations and republican backed voting restrictions  while opposing curbs on political spending  the court also is likely to tackle transgender rights and union funding in coming years  a  vote threshold giving the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments  in the final procedural vote that paved the way for  confirmation  three democratic senators up for re election in  in states won by trump last year   indiana s joe donnelly  west virginia s joe manchin and north dakota s heidi heitkamp   broke with their party and voted with republicans to bring about a confirmation vote  although they opposed the rule change  a fourth democrat  michael bennet  who represents gorsuch s home state of colorado  voted with republicans on thursday s first procedural vote to bring debate to a close  but he stuck with fellow democrats in opposing the final vote to end the filibuster  the one that succeeded following the rule change  republicans have called gorsuch superbly qualified and one of the nation s most distinguished appellate judges  democrats accused him of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream  favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions  and displaying insufficient independence from trump  what republicans did to obama s nominee garland was worse than a filibuster  schumer said  schumer said republicans denied  the constitutional prerogative of a president with  months left in his term    the nuclear option was used by senator mcconnell when he stopped merrick garland   democratic senator richard durbin said  on the senate floor   what we face today is the fallout   mcconnell blamed the escalation of fights over judicial nominees on the democrats and their opposition starting three decades ago to nominees made by republican former presidents ronald reagan and george w  bush  experts said eliminating the filibuster for supreme court appointments could make it more likely that presidents  with little incentive to choose centrist justices who could attract support from the other party  will pick ideologically extreme nominees in the future  ending the filibuster also would make it easier for future supreme court nominees to be confirmed when the president and senate leadership belong to the same party  the filibuster in one form or another dates back to the  century but assumed its current form in the    while democrats opposed the rule change and accused republicans of a power grab  it was their party that first resorted to the nuclear option when they controlled the senate in   in the face of republican filibusters of obama appointments  they barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices but still allowed it for supreme court nominees and legislation  the republican backed rule change maintains the ability to filibuster legislation
