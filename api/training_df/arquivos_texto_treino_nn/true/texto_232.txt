 washington  reuters    in late october  president donald trump lifted a temporary ban on most refugee admissions  a move that should have cleared the way for more people fleeing persecution and violence to come to the united states  instead  the number of refugees admitted to the country has plummeted  in the five weeks after the ban was lifted   percent fewer people were allowed in than in the last five weeks it was in place  according to a reuters analysis of state department data  that plunge has gone almost unnoticed  as he lifted the ban  trump instituted new rules for tougher vetting of applicants and also effectively halted  at least for now  the entry of refugees from  countries deemed as high risk  the latter move has contributed significantly to the precipitous drop in the number of refugees being admitted  the data shows that the trump administration s new restrictions have proven to be a far greater barrier to refugees than even his temporary ban  which was limited in scope by the supreme court  the state department data shows that the kind of refugees being allowed in has also changed  a far smaller portion are muslim  when the ban was in place they made up a quarter of all refugees  now that it has been lifted they represent just under  percent   admissions over five weeks is a limited sample from which to draw broad conclusions  and resettlement numbers often pick up later in the fiscal year  which began in october  but the sharp drop has alarmed refugee advocates   they re pretty much shutting the refugee program down without having to say that s what they re doing   said eric schwartz  president of refugees international   they ve gotten better at using bureaucratic methods and national security arguments to achieve nefarious and unjustifiable objectives   trump administration officials say the temporary ban on refugees  and the new security procedures that followed  served to protect americans from potential terrorist attacks  supporters of the administration s move also argue that the refugee program needed reform and that making it more stringent will ultimately strengthen it   the program needed to be tightened up   said joshua meservey  a senior policy analyst at the heritage foundation  a conservative think tank  who formerly worked in refugee resettlement in africa   i m all for strengthening the vetting  cracking down on the fraud  being really intentional on who we select for this  because i think it protects the program ultimately when we do that   a state department official attributed the drop in refugee admissions to increased vetting  reviews aimed at identifying potential threats  and a smaller annual refugee quota this year of    the lowest level in decades   refugee admissions rarely happen at a steady pace and in many years start out low and increase throughout the year  it would be premature to assess  the  fiscal year s  pace at this point   the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  trump has made controlling immigration a centerpiece of his presidency  citing both a desire to protect american jobs and national security  during the  presidential campaign he said syrian refugees could be aligned with islamist militants and promised  extreme vetting  of applicants  the white house did not respond to a request for comment  after the ban was lifted the new rules imposed included a requirement that refugees provide  years of biographical information  rather than five years  a pause in a program that allows for family reunification  and a  detailed threat analysis and review  of refugees from  countries  a department of homeland security spokesman said that  day review began on oct    the day after trump lifted the ban  officials have said that during the review period  refugees from egypt  iran  iraq  libya  mali  north korea  somalia  south sudan  sudan  syria and yemen will be allowed in on a case by case basis  but they have also said priority will be given to other applicants  for each of the last three years  refugees from the  countries made up more than  percent of u s  admissions  while nine of the  countries are majority muslim  it is often their religious minorities  including christians and jews  who seek asylum in the united states  and in practice  of the  countries only iran  iraq  somalia  south sudan  sudan and syria produce refugees who resettle in the united states in meaningful numbers  trump administration officials have said the  day review does not amount to a bar on refugees from the  countries  but just as the review launched  the number of refugees coming from those countries ceased almost entirely  in the five weeks before the ban was lifted   refugees from the  countries were allowed in  despite tough eligibility rules  according to the reuters review of the state department data  in the five weeks after trump lifted the ban  just  refugees from those countries were allowed in  from all countries    refugees were admitted to the united states in the five weeks between oct   and nov    according to the state department data  that was  percent lower than during the final five weeks of the ban  when nearly   refugees gained entry  just  percent of refugees admitted to the united states between oct   and nov   were muslim  and  percent were christian  in the five weeks prior   percent were muslim and  percent were christian  more refugees were allowed in during the period the temporary refugee ban was in place because the supreme court  in okaying the ban in june  required refugees with  bona fide  ties to the united states be exempted  the new rules have been challenged in court  but no rulings have yet been issued  each twist in u s  refugee policy has left alireza  a gay iranian refugee living in turkey  confused  desperate for information  and less hopeful he will ever make it to the united states  alireza    had already been interviewed by u s  officials and was on track for resettlement when trump issued his first refugee ban in january  he declined to share his last name because his family does not know he is gay  but he shared documents with reuters on his case to confirm his identity and refugee status  when trump s ban was initially blocked by federal courts  alireza was able to continue the vetting process and was close to the point of being resettled  then came the supreme court ruling reinstating the ban  and then the new restrictions replacing the ban  as a refugee from one of the  countries targeted for additional scrutiny  he is once again in limbo  alireza questions the national security logic of the new review  he and his boyfriend of  years fled to turkey in  after facing harassment  beatings and extortion in iran  human rights groups say that discriminatory laws in iran against sexual minorities put them at risk of harassment and violence  in turkey  he said  they scrape by with unstable part time work and feel threatened by what they see as a rise in anti gay sentiment in turkish society   we ourselves have been hurt by the islamist system in iran   he said in a recent telephone interview from eskisehir  in northwestern turkey   why would we suffer for three years  in turkey  so that we could come to america and commit terrorism
