 reuters    the republican controlled u s  house of representatives approved sweeping  debt financed tax legislation on tuesday  sending the bill to the senate  where lawmakers were due to take up the package later in the evening  story    the biggest overhaul of the u s  tax system in more than  years could be signed into law by president donald trump as soon as wednesday  if both chambers of congress approve it  the bill passed the house by a vote of    overcoming united opposition from democrats and  republicans who voted against it   the bond market today is reassessing the whole thing now that it looks like it s going to pass  we ve had a pretty significant rise in yields   we re back up close to the highs for the quarter   stocks on the other hand have been in front of this for a long time  i think initially because lower taxes means more earnings are retained and then companies can distribute those to shareholders or not  but either way  it s likely to be beneficial to stock prices   jack ablin  chief investment officer  bmo private bank  chicago  the tax rate we ve certainly priced in  in stocks   though i certainly expected smallcaps to do a little bit better coming into this vote  what i think is not priced in yet is the economic impact of the incentives  it still remains to be seen what businesses will actually do  will they buy equipment  invest in technology  hire more workers    the assumption right now is financial engineering  buybacks  dividend increases  is where the incentives will go  redeploying cash  recapitalizing balance sheets  maybe debt repayment    i do think there s a fair amount of skepticism these benefits will ultimately result in expansions  i m getting a sense investors are pricing in the one time tax pop  we ll see if there s any follow through next year   on the rise in treasury yields   it s been a monetary policy led expansion  now we get a fiscal boost and some may be concerned  that  the boost on the fiscal side  may  be offset by monetary tightening    the big question  for the dollar  is how other central banks will respond to this  u s   fiscal stimulus package  that s probably what s weighing on investors  minds right now   celebrating the tax package but recognizing that what central banks have given us in the last years they could begin to take away   jim paulsen  chief investment strategist  the leuthold group  minneapolis  as we look back on this a little bit  i really think it might be buy the rumor sell the news  wall street has had long enough to vet this thing  and it has been known for a long time that something was going to pass here  at least for the last    days  whether it was going to be  percent rate or  percent rate is not that significant  it s more the general parts of it were pretty much known and vetted and i think implemented into the market    if you look at the relative performance in the market today  it s fairly clearly more of a shot towards better economic growth or even inflation    i think the biggest move today of anything is bond yields  that s the big story   aaron kohli  interest rate strategist  bmo capital markets  new york  they seem to have locked up all the necessary votes    i think the markets are still trying to figure out how much should we expect  will people react right away  what will be the second order effects    there are a lot of questions that still haven t answered  the first one is  assuming it goes into effect jan    when is the first time people start seeing any changes in their pay checks  and the answer is it could be a couple of months  even then for most of middle america you aren t going to see the savings until tax time  which means you may not see it until april   i m not sure that s early enough to help midterms and i think that s really where the markets  are going to start to focus next  how do we handicap what it does for republicans in the midterms  does it help them  does it do nothing for them  or it may even hurt them   brian peery  portfolio manager  hennessy funds in novato  california  the market is taking kind of a breather  digesting the news  the market is off a little bit  maybe because the bill is not as popular as the gop hoped it would be in the public opinion  the overall market looks still really strong and healthy    looking at companies in our portfolio   the tax bill  will be great for domestic small  and mid cap companies paying a    percent effective tax rate  a lot of them do not have the ability to move profits offshore    i ll wait and see how much  but i can see another  percent rise  in the market  in the next few months as the tax bill kicks in   alicia levine  director of portfolio strategy at bny mellon investment management  new york    the effects of the tax cuts will be immediately accretive to corporate earnings which will support equity markets  also  the tax package will be positive for growth in the real economy   the tax cuts add   to baseline s p earnings for  putting  expected earnings at   or a  percent growth rate over  earnings    this is supportive of equity markets  sectors to focus on would be small caps  value and financials     paul nolte  portfolio manager at kingsview asset management in chicago   it s pretty much along party lines  the takeaway is more buy the rumor  sell the news  the market has been rallying over the last week or so in anticipation of this vote  we re  now  going to be looking toward the government funding bill    it s going to take time to see how the general population reacts to it  tax   the expectation is companies are going to bring back a lot of dollars back to the united states and put it into plant and equipment  it very well may go into stock buybacks and dividend increases  there s no certainty we re going to get the promised economic gain everybody s been talking about   chuck carlson  chief executive officer  horizon investment services  hammond  indiana  i think the market had been pretty well expecting this  i don t think there s any     surprise here to the market  the momentum had been pretty strong in the last two weeks in terms of getting this done  and i think the market has pretty well anticipated getting it done    you may see some reactions going forward in certain sectors and subcategories  maybe you see smallcaps pick up a little bit more  maybe you see the transports  which have lagged large caps  start to do a little bit better  but in the main  the market had already been factoring this in    it has a lot of potential ramifications  it s going to certainly play a role in the midterm elections next year  and people are going to have some time to try to evaluate whether their plight in life is better because of it before they go to the voting booth next year  so from a political standpoint it has impact   omair sharif  senior u s  economist  societe generale  new york  this seems like it s a done deal especially if corker and collins end up on board on the senate side  they will get across the finish line by christmas after moving the goal post a number of times    i think for more than a few days now  this was likely going to pass  this has been baked in the cake with the markets  they have been expecting this for a long time  it s a few days before christmas  so trading is quite thin  i wouldn t read too much into any market reaction  the real telling thing for this is the second half of next year  whether this actually lifts growth above  percent on any sustained basis on capital spending and consumer spending  it s more a political achievement than an economic achievement   stocks trimmed losses slightly  but then dipped back  the s p  index was last down   percent  treasury yields hovered near session highs and the dollar held its gains against the yen
