 reuters    maine s two most prominent republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance  which some insiders said could risk the party s stature in the northeastern state  u s  senator susan collins won praise from democrats for saying she would not vote for a white house backed healthcare reform bill while governor paul lepage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts  the move by collins  a four term moderate  was in keeping with maine s reputation for producing independent minded legislators willing to buck their party s leadership in washington  that tradition was challenged by lepage  who first ran for office in  on a wave of populist tea party support and won two three way races with less than a majority of the vote   what you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the republican party in maine   said david farmer  a democratic political consultant who worked on the  campaign of lepage s democratic challenger   is it going to be the belligerent  angry governor lepage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative senator collins   republican lobbyist and political operative lance dutson largely agreed   it s an ideological tipping point   said dutson  who worked on collins   reelection campaign  which she won with  percent of the vote  maine has a tradition of successful third party candidates  notably independent u s  senator angus king  and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either democrats or republicans   in the long run  the collins model has proven itself   dutson said   you can t be an orthodox republican and talk only to republicans like lepage and win as much support   collins and lepage have publicly disagreed over president donald trump  whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the maine governor s  lepage was an early supporter of trump s white house campaign  when collins said last year that she would not vote for the new york real estate developer  lepage told local media he was  not a susan collins fan   the chair of the state s republican party saw no downside to the diverging style and politics of the two  saying the wide gap represented by the two was an illustration of the party s wide appeal in maine   we re an inclusive party  we have strong conservatives  libertarians and we have our moderates  but we re a party  we re a party of reform and we are going to stick together   said demi kouzounas  a dentist who was elected as the party chair in january   we support both of them strongly   the gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance  collins said she had  serious concerns  about the senate bill backed by trump as a replacement to the affordable healthcare act  known as obamacare  after the congressional budget office estimated that the measure would cause  million americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade  collins became one of a handful of senate republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form  leading to tuesday s decision to delay the vote  also on tuesday  lepage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists  if democratic lawmakers would not agree to   million in spending cuts in the state s next two year budget of roughly   billion   i m the worst guy in the world to play chicken with  because i don t veer either way   lepage told wmov radio   if there s a collision to be had  it s coming   the democrats and republicans blame each other for the state s budget impasse  which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools  a government shutdown could further expose republican rifts and turn more moderate republicans against lepage s tactics  suggested phil bartlett  a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the maine democratic party   he s been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses   bartlett said   but we re now seeing that he and the house republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government
