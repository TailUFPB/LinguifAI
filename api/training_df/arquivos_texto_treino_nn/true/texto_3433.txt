 new york  reuters    massachusetts institute of technology officials said u s  president donald trump badly misunderstood their research when he cited it on thursday to justify withdrawing the united states from the paris climate agreement   trump announced during a speech at the white house rose garden that he had decided to pull out of the landmark climate deal  in part because it would not reduce global temperatures fast enough to have a significant impact    even if the paris agreement were implemented in full  with total compliance from all nations  it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree celsius reduction in global temperature by the year    trump said     tiny  tiny amount    that claim was attributed to research conducted by mit  according to white house documents seen by reuters  the cambridge  massaschusetts based research university published a study in april  titled  how much of a difference will the paris agreement make   showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal  global warming would slow by between   degree and   degrees celsius by    more from reuters  world pledges to save environment despite trump  musk  iger to quit trump advisory councils  trump administration asks supreme court to revive travel ban  we certainly do not support the withdrawal of the u s  from the paris agreement   said erwan monier  a lead researcher at the mit joint program on the science and policy of global change  and one of the study s authors    if we don t do anything  we might shoot over  degrees or more and that would be catastrophic   said john reilly  the co director of the program  adding that mit s scientists had had no contact with the white house and were not offered a chance to explain their work   the paris accord  reached by nearly  countries in   was meant to limit global warming to  degrees or less by   mainly through country pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels   under the pact  the united states   the world s second biggest carbon emitter behind china   had committed to reduce its emissions by  percent to  percent from  levels by    a senior administration official defended trump s use of the findings   it s not just mit  i think there is a consensus  not only in the environmental community  but elsewhere that the paris agreement in and of itself will have a negligible impact on climate   the official told reporters at a briefing   the dispute is the latest round of a years long battle between scientists and politicians over how to interpret facts about the effects of burning fossil fuels on the global climate  and translate them into policy   trump has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change and once called it a hoax perpetrated by china to weaken u s  business
