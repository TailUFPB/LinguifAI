washington  reuters    president donald trump has won the first major battle in his war on illegal immigration  and he did it without building his wall  the victory was announced last week by the department of homeland security  dhs   which released figures showing a  percent drop since december of parents and children caught trying to cross the mexico border illegally   in december    parents and children were apprehended  in march  a month in which immigration typically increases because of temperate weather  the number was just over     it was a remarkable decline   steeper than the  percent drop in overall apprehensions   but for eight dhs officials interviewed by reuters it was not surprising   trump has spoken about the need to crack down broadly on all illegal immigrants  but  internally  according to the dhs officials familiar with the department s strategy  his administration has focused on one immigrant group more than others  women with children  the fastest growing demographic of illegal immigrants  this planning has not been previously reported   in the months since trump s inauguration  dhs has rolled out a range of policies aimed at discouraging women from attempting to cross the border  including tougher initial hurdles for asylum claims and the threat of prosecuting parents if they hire smugglers to get their families across the border  the department has also floated proposals such as separating women and children at the border  dhs secretary john kelly told a senate hearing on april  that the sharp drop in illegal immigration  especially among women and children  was due to trump s tough policies  to date  it has been the threat of new policies rather than their implementation that has suppressed family migration  mothers and children aren t being separated   and dhs has shelved the plan  parents haven t been prosecuted  and there is no wall along most of the border  yet the number of migrants trying to cross   especially women and children   has dropped drastically   asked to comment on the policy of targeting women with children  dhs spokesman jonathan hoffman referenced the march drop  saying   those were   women and children who did not put themselves at risk of death and assault from smugglers to make the trip north     the white house declined to comment and referred reuters to dhs  for months  central americans had heard about trump s get tough policies  and public service announcements on radio and television presented bleak pictures of what awaited those who traveled north  some of the ads were funded by the united states  others by united nations agencies and regional governments  one radio ad in honduras featured a mother  saying   it s been a year and i don t know if she is alive or dead  i d do anything to have her here with me  curse the day i sent her north   the possibility that mothers and children might be separated at the border caused particular alarm  honduran deputy foreign minister maria andrea matamoros told reuters  that worries any mother that wants to go to the united states with their kid  and being separated drastically changes their plans   she said   the policies targeting women and children have their roots in a working group consisting of capitol hill staffers and others called together by trump s transition team in the weeks after the nov   election  the group was asked to develop policies to discourage illegal border crossings and more quickly expel illegal immigrants after they crossed the border  according to two of the dhs officials and a congressional aide   one goal was to help trump fulfill a major campaign promise  ending so called  catch and release   the practice of apprehending illegal immigrants but then freeing them to live in the united states while their asylum or deportation cases were resolved    the group quickly identified a major obstacle   the large numbers of women and children continuing to cross the border  said the dhs officials and the aide   because a federal court ruling bars prolonged immigration detention of juveniles  the obama administration generally released mothers and children to live in the united states while awaiting resolution of their asylum or deportation cases  the incoming trump administration viewed that policy as providing encouragement for women to make the dangerous journey north with their children in tow  but the new administration was bound by the same court ruling  after kelly s confirmation as homeland security chief in late january  several members of the original working group stepped into key roles at dhs  gene hamilton  who had worked for then republican senator jeff sessions  became senior counselor to kelly  and dimple shah  who had been staff director of the house national security subcommittee  became deputy general counsel   kathy nuebel kovarik  formerly a staffer for republican senator chuck grassley  became policy chief at u s  citizenship and immigration services  julie kirchner left her position as executive director of the conservative federation for american immigration reform to become a top policy adviser at u s  customs and border protection  none of the group s members agreed to be interviewed by reuters  several dhs officials said that in their new roles they continued to focus on the issue of women and child migrants  soon  they had the bare bones of a plan  since the court ruling on children was an obstacle to prolonged detention  why not separate them from their mothers  sending children into foster care or protective federal custody while their mothers remained in detention centers  the two dhs officials and congressional aide said  the group also advocated two other policies directly affecting mothers and children  raising the bar for asylum and prosecuting parents as human traffickers if they hired human smugglers  the thinking was that  if they can just implement tough policies for eight weeks   or even threaten to do that   they would see the numbers of families crossing just plummet   said one dhs official familiar with the planning  on jan    five days after taking office  trump issued an executive order ending  catch and release    a u s  immigration and customs enforcement official said the agency still releases most women and children in compliance with the federal court order    a week later  in a town hall with u s  customs and immigration services officers  chief asylum officer john lafferty outlined the possibility of separating women and children in a semi public setting for the first time  according to notes of the meeting seen by reuters  for more than a month after that meeting  the proposal did not leak  but after reuters broke news of it in early march  kelly confirmed that it was under consideration  democratic members of congress blasted the proposal  and within days it had made headlines across mexico and central america   that month  the number of children traveling with guardians apprehended at the border fell to one third of what it had been in february   when kelly and his advisers saw the numbers dropping  they announced they were shelving the idea of separating women and children   at least for now  asked whether it may be revived  dhs spokeswoman jenny burke said   families caught crossing the border illegally  generally will not be separated unless the situation at the time requires it
