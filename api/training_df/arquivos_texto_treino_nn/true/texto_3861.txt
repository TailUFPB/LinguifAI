washington  reuters    the newly appointed second in command at the u s  justice department faced a weighty task just two weeks after taking office   writing the rationale for firing fbi director james comey  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein argued the case for comey s sacking in a three page memo to attorney general jeff sessions on tuesday  president donald trump acted swiftly to dismiss the director later that day  rosenstein cited comey s controversial public statements about the bureau s investigation into democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state   it is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do   rosenstein wrote of comey s public comments  spokespeople for the department of justice and the fbi did not return calls seeking comment late tuesday  comey s firing will likely be seen as further evidence of washington s hyper partisan upheaval  rosenstein has drawn fire from democrats who allege political motives in the white house decision to dismiss comey   and particularly  its timing   why did it happen today   asked senate democratic minority leader chuck schumer  of new york   we know the fbi has been looking into whether the trump campaign colluded with the russians     were those investigations getting too close to home for the president   the rationale for canning comey  however  came from a  year justice department veteran who is widely viewed by his peers and many lawmakers as uncommonly nonpartisan  named as maryland s top prosecutor by president george w  bush  rosenstein stayed in office through the obama administration   rosenstein was the longest serving u s  attorney when he was nominated by trump last january  when he was confirmed by the senate  he enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support   a  to  vote   despite the deeply divided culture of today s washington  bonnie greenberg  a federal prosecutor in maryland told reuters in march that rosenstein was admired as a rare career prosecutor who could insulate himself from political pressure   he only does something if he thinks it s right   said greenberg  who worked with rosenstein for  years   many in the justice department saw rosenstein s appointment as a counter balance to the extreme partisanship surrounding accusations of russian interference in last year s election  and he was immediately swept into that fray   before rosenstein was confirmed for the position by the u s  senate  some democratic lawmakers asked him to pledge he would appoint a special independent prosecutor to investigate allegations of collusion between the trump campaign and russian officials   he was easily confirmed despite rebuffing those demands  some republicans have been angered by comey s public statements about the fbi investigation into possible ties between the trump campaign and russia   but rosenstein s criticism of comey focused on actions seen to have damaged democratic candidate clinton  rosenstein focused in particular on comey s news conference last july  when the director announced his conclusion that clinton should not be prosecuted   while at the same time publicly bashing her use of a private email server for sensitive u s  government business  that day  rosenstein wrote  comey usurped the authority of the u s  attorney general   who has authority over whether prosecutions should proceed  based on the quality of fbi investigations  comey also violated longstanding practice by  gratuitously  releasing damaging information about clinton   even as he acknowledged the evidence against her was insufficient to warrant continued investigation  rosenstein wrote   we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation   rosenstein wrote  adding that comey  laid out his version of the facts for the news media as if it were a closing argument  but without a trial    u s  senator mark warner of virginia  the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee  said the timing of comey s firing was suspect   coming so long after the election of trump and comey s alleged mishandling of the case  he directly criticized rosenstein    i am very disappointed with this deputy attorney general  who i was told had a good reputation   he said   but signing this letter saying that he recommends firing comey because of comey s actions with hillary clinton nine months ago  or  months ago  that doesn t pass any smell test   rosenstein  in his letter  cited broad  bipartisan agreement on comey s errors in judgment  last summer  comey defended his decision to speak publicly about the clinton investigation  saying  the american people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest   last week  before a senate committee  comey defended his decision in october   two weeks before the presidential election   to publicly announce the bureau had discovered new emails that might be related to the closed investigation into clinton   to not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view   comey said  rosenstein wrote that he was perplexed at comey s continued defenses of his handling of the probe   i do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken   rosenstein wrote   it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives
