washington  reuters    senator marco rubio said on thursday he has urged u s  president donald trump to create a high level task force to provide ideas and advice for helping puerto rico to rebuild after hurricane maria  and that the president was receptive to the idea  rubio  a republican from florida who has been deeply involved in discussions over the response  told reuters that the task force could be a sounding board for trump  as we move beyond the initial recovery phase to the broader long term recovery phase   hurricane maria slammed into puerto rico three weeks ago  killing at least  people and leaving much of the caribbean island  a u s  territory  without electricity or safe drinking water  disaster costs are expected to run into the tens of billions of dollars  prior to the hurricane  puerto rico was already struggling with   billion in debt  a flight of residents to the u s  mainland and aging infrastructure  including a decrepit power grid that was incapacitated by the storm  rubio said he suggested forming an advisory group during a conversation with trump on sunday   he was asking me   what do we need to do next    rubio told reuters   my argument to him was  i have some ideas  but there are people who have even more  better ones  because they live or lived in puerto rico  they understand its politics  its economics  its pre existing challenges and its long term opportunities   he said   he seemed to like the idea  and said they would follow up and see what that would look like   rubio said  the white house did not respond to a request for comment on the discussions  trump came under fire on thursday for a series of tweets about the island s economic problems  he said federal responders could not stay in the territory  forever   rubio said federal responders would likely be on the island longer than during a  conventional  disaster on the mainland but agreed they would not be there forever   i m not sure the timing is ideal given the fact that they re in the midst of this challenge that continues to evolve   he said  rubio  who visited puerto rico on sept   to survey hurricane damage  said he was confident the island would get the help it needs in the short term through emergency legislation   the bigger concern is in the long term   he told reuters in a  minute telephone interview as the house of representatives moved ahead with a    billion loan for puerto rico as well as billions more in disaster relief  the house easily passed the bill  with the senate expected to do so later month and send it to trump for signing into law  puerto rico s economy ground to a halt in the storm  its government is poised to run out of money for payroll and essential services at the end of october  that left congress with little choice but to help fill the gap  rubio said   businesses aren t functioning  taxpayers aren t generating any sort of revenue or income to be paid to their coffers  so yeah  i think there s a big question about whether that s a loan that will ever be repaid  but what s the alternative   he said  puerto rico s governor  ricardo rossello  also has asked for    billion in block grants and other types of funding  the white house is looking at how to address the long term needs  including how to rebuild the power grid  the lack of electricity has been the biggest problem for puerto rico s   million residents   they re basically three weeks now living in the  century   rubio said  puerto ricans  who are u s  citizens  are likely to continue to flee to the mainland united states unless conditions improve  with florida one of their top destinations  rubio said it is up to the oversight board charged with resolving puerto rico s debt crisis to determine how to address the island s debt  noting that private debt owed to investors with legal recourse cannot simply be  forgiven  by the federal government    i don t think there s going to be a federal bailout in which billions of dollars are spent to bail out puerto rico  quite frankly i ve never had anyone in puerto rico s government ask for that   rubio said  the island is also running out of money for medicaid  the u s  health insurance program for the poor  which about half its residents counted on even before the storm threw many people out of work  the exodus to the mainland could accelerate unless the perennial funding gap is addressed  rubio said  in the meantime  he said he thinks congress will find money to help puerto rico avert the cliff  on healthcare and many other structural issues  the hurricane could be the turning point  for better  or for worse   rubio said  the nation could  rally  to focus on puerto rico s long neglected economic problems   or it could be one of those moments when you have this horrible storm and it took so long that things never really got better  and a lot of people left and never came back   he said
