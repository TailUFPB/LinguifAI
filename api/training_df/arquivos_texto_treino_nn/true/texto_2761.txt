washington  reuters    senate republican leaders released on thursday a revised plan to dismantle the obamacare law  but it drew criticism from senators on both sides of the political divide within the republican party  indicating a treacherous path for the bill  the bill played to the party s disparate factions by letting insurers sell cheap  bare bones policies while retaining taxes on the wealthy   but the immediate outcry illustrated the difficult political terrain that u s  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell must navigate  he is under pressure by president donald trump to pass a healthcare bill and make good on republicans  seven year mission to gut democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement   the american people deserve better than the pain of obamacare  they deserve better care  and the time to deliver that to them is next week   mcconnell said  in addition to the criticism from some senators  a major hospital association and one large insurer said the measure falls short in critical areas  with democrats united against it  mcconnell cannot afford to lose more than two republican senators to win passage  but moderate susan collins and conservative rand paul voiced opposition to even bringing the new plan up for debate  several senators said they had concerns about the legislation  particularly its medicaid cuts  including shelley moore capito  rob portman and john mccain  and two other republican senators  lindsey graham and bill cassidy  complicated matters by announcing an alternative plan  mcconnell  a skillful tactician who was forced two weeks ago to scrub a planned vote on an earlier version opposed by both moderates and hard line conservatives in his party  has planned for a vote on the retooled bill next week  the continuing lack of consensus among republicans on what to do with obamacare after calling for its demise since  shows that it is no sure thing that trump s party will be able to get the job done  healthcare is trump s first major legislative initiative  failure would call into question his party s ability to govern despite controlling both chambers of congress and the white house  the measure represents a retreat from long standing republican aspirations to dump obamacare related taxes  it retains two taxes on the wealthy that helped pay for the obamacare law that the previous version would have repealed  and also keeps obamacare s limits on corporate tax deductions for executive pay in the health insurance industry  the bill included a provision allowing insurers to offer stripped down  low cost healthcare plans   a measure proposed by senator ted cruz to try to win over holdout conservatives  these  skinny plans  would not have to cover the broad benefits mandated under obamacare like maternity and newborn care  mental health services and addiction treatment  outpatient care  hospitalization  emergency room visits and prescription drugs  insurer groups  including the national blue cross blue shield association  have derided the skinny plans  saying they would raise insurance premiums  destabilize the individual insurance market and undermine protections for pre existing medical conditions  moderate senators could balk at the provision for the same reasons  the new bill provides an additional   billion to help stabilize the individual insurance market on top of the   billion in the original bill to help insurers slow growth in premium costs and help lower income insurance holders cover out of pocket medical expenses  the bill would phase out the obamacare expansion of the medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled  and includes sharp cuts to federal medicaid spending beginning in   moderate republicans were spurned in their desire to see a reduction in medicaid cuts in the revised version  critics said despite some changes to coax wavering senators  the revised bill s core remains unchanged  restructuring and cutting the critical medicaid social safety net program  taking away insurance from millions of americans and driving up healthcare costs for millions of the most vulnerable americans  especially older people and the sick  the revamped bill contains a provision that appears to be aimed at winning over senator lisa murkowski of alaska  a moderate who had opposed the original bill  it would funnel additional money to states that have higher insurance premiums   at least  percent above the national average  alaska is the only state with premiums that high  senate aides said  hospital and insurer groups have spoken out against the senate republican approach  particularly proposed medicaid cuts  the cuts would result in lower revenues for hospital companies like community health systems inc and medicaid insurance specialists like molina healthcare and centene corp   molina healthcare  which has more than  million customers on the obamacare individual exchanges and manages medicaid health programs  said the changes would leave insurers competing for the least risky customers and would make plans for sick people unaffordable   the american hospital association said the new version of the bill retained the  unacceptable flaws  of the previous version   instead of merely putting forth an update  we again call on the senate to put forth an upgrade   rick pollack  president of the association  said in a statement  healthcare stocks were mostly unmoved by the announcement  as wall street analysts described the core of the revised bill as largely unchanged from the earlier one  the new bill includes another   billion for fighting the opioid addiction epidemic  on top of the   billion in the earlier version  the nonpartisan congressional budget office  which forecast that the previous version would have increased the number of americans without health insurance by  million by   is due to evaluate the new bill in coming days  the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  expanded health insurance coverage to some  million people  in large part by expanding medicaid  the house of representatives on may  passed its own version of healthcare legislation  republicans have a   senate majority  with vice president mike pence able to cast a potential tie breaking vote  any bill passed by the senate would have to go back to the house for approval  repealing and replacing obamacare  which republicans fault as a costly government intrusion into the healthcare system  was a top campaign promise for trump  who was monitoring the senate developments during his visit to paris   i d say the only thing more difficult than peace between israel and the palestinians is healthcare   trump told reporters on his flight to paris   corrects  paragraph to show the bill applies to states with premiums at least  percent above the national average  not  percent of the national average
