washington new york  reuters    lawyers for former national security adviser michael flynn have halted communications with u s  president donald trump s legal team  a potentially critical step in the probe into contacts between trump s election campaign and russia  sources familiar with the investigation said on friday  flynn s lawyer  robert kelner  called john dowd  trump s private lawyer  on wednesday to say the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer could discuss it  two people familiar with the call told reuters on friday  the new york times first reported that the two sets of lawyers had stopped communicating   flynn  a retired army general  is a central figure in a federal investigation led by special counsel robert mueller into whether trump aides colluded with alleged russian efforts to boost his  presidential campaign  it was not clear whether kelner made the call because he had negotiated a plea agreement with mueller for flynn to cooperate in the probe  or because flynn had decided to engage with mueller  said two other sources   no one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about general flynn cooperating against the president   jay sekulow  another attorney for trump  said on thursday      dowd on friday declined to comment on the matter  as did peter carr  mueller s spokesman  kelner also declined to comment  white house officials also have declined to comment  the cooperation of flynn  who was a top campaign adviser before becoming trump s national security adviser in the white house  would be a major asset in mueller s investigation  in march  as he unsuccessfully sought immunity for his client to testify to house and senate investigations into the issue  kelner said   mr  flynn certainly has a story to tell  and he certainly wants to tell it  should the circumstances permit    two sources familiar with mueller s investigation said flynn may be able to provide insight into three major areas of inquiry  these are  any collusion between the trump campaign and russia in the  campaign  money laundering and other possible financial crimes by trump aides  and whether trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired former fbi director james comey in may  as comey was probing the trump campaign s dealings with russia  russia has denied interfering in the election  trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with russia by his campaign and has called the inquiry a witch hunt  two congressional officials involved in separate probes into the trump campaign s contacts with russia said one key area of investigation is whether flynn or other advisers to trump ever suggested u s  economic sanctions on russia could be lifted in exchange for favorable business deals  possible deals include a proposed commercial nuclear power project involving russian firms that flynn in recent years worked to promote to potential clients in the middle east  sources familiar with the project told reuters   at this point  there is no evidence of an effort to negotiate that kind of deal  but flynn is near the top of the list of people who probably would know if there was any such effort   said one of the congressional officials  also speaking on the condition of anonymity  trump fired flynn on feb    after disclosures that flynn had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with then russian ambassador sergei kislyak in december  the month before trump took office  and later misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  flynn has acknowledged contacts with kislyak dating back to   but beyond saying they covered a variety of subjects has said nothing about the content of their conversations during trump s campaign and after his election  flynn has been under scrutiny by the special counsel in a number of areas  sources familiar with the investigation have said  mueller has been investigating whether flynn knowingly made false statements to the government about his foreign travels  income  and contacts on his security clearance form  flynn also has come under scrutiny for work on behalf of russian clients  and over whether his work for a businessman with ties to turkish president recep tayyip erdogan was lawful   mueller has been investigating flynn s son  michael flynn  jr  s  involvement in some of his father s business dealings in russia  turkey  and elsewhere  the sources said  and that could provide a potent additional incentive for flynn to cooperate  barry coburn  a lawyer for flynn s son  declined to comment
