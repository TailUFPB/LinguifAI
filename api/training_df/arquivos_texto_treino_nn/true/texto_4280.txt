washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump does not like the  border adjustment  tax cooked up by u s  house speaker paul ryan and other republicans in the house of representatives  at least  he does not like the term   i don t like the word  adjustment   because our country gets taken advantage of  to use a nice term  by every other country in the world   trump told fox business news in an interview that aired on wednesday   adjustment means we lose  we lose    let s call it an import tax  let s call it a reciprocal tax   he added   nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax   trump was talking about a provision in ryan s house republican tax blueprint that has polarized the tax reform debate  as the white house tries to score a much needed legislative victory by overhauling the u s  tax code for the first time since the reagan era  the proposal would exempt u s  corporate export revenues from federal taxes  while requiring u s  companies to shoulder the same flat  percent tax rate on supplies and other purchased products  whether produced overseas or domestically  but the president appeared to favor an import tax that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origin s tax rate for u s  products  he said such an approach could take the form of trade policy rather than tax policy   there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it   the president said   the other countries  if they re charging you a  percent tax  you say   o k   whatever you charge  we re charging    the house border adjustment tax  or bat  would help trump keep his campaign pledge to create manufacturing jobs  advocates say  by exempting u s  export revenue from tax while subjecting imports to the same  percent corporate tax imposed on domestic products  but the measure has been angrily denounced by import dependent industries and rejected by enough senate republicans to call its political viability into question  in his fox interview  trump lamented the inequalities of the international tax system  saying u s  products face high tax rates overseas while foreign made goods enter the u s  market tax free  treasury secretary steven mnuchin floated the idea of a  reciprocal  tax in february  but administration officials have offered few details and lobbyists have suggested that it could strongly resemble the house bat proposal   i love the idea of reciprocal   trump said   you can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mirror tax  there are numerous terms  but the reciprocal tax is very important
