washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration has begun returning to congress copies of a voluminous  report describing the cia s harsh detention and interrogation programs  u s  officials said on friday  the trump administration s move means it could be more difficult for the full    page report to be made public  because documents held by congress are exempt from laws requiring government records to eventually be made public  the white house made the move in response to requests by sen  richard burr  the senate intelligence committee s current republican chairman  officials said  in a statement emailed to reuters  burr said   i have directed my staff to retrieve copies of the congressional study that remain with the executive branch agencies and  as the committee does with all classified and compartmented information  will enact the necessary measures to protect the sensitive sources and methods contained within the report   sen  dianne feinstein  the democrat who chaired the committee when the report was produced  had asked that it be distributed to multiple executive branch agencies  a move designed to make it eventually releasable to the public under the freedom of information act law  feinstein said in a statement that she was  concerned and disappointed  that burr requested that the document be returned  calling it a departure from the committee s normal bipartisan nature   no senator  chairman or not  has the authority to erase history  i believe that is the intent of the chairman in this case   she said   sen mark warner  who succeeded feinstein as the committee s top democrat  said in a twitter post he was  disappointed  with burr s decision  and that the report  must be preserved so we can learn from past mistakes   ensure that abuses are never repeated   a declassified executive summary of the report was made public in december   it concluded that the cia s interrogation programs  using techniques such as waterboarding that most observers consider torture  were more brutal and less effective than the cia had told policymakers  the report said that not a single terrorist attack was foiled as a result of the use of harsh interrogation techniques  the american civil liberties union had filed litigation to have the full report released  but u s  courts ruled that because the document was created by congress  it was exempt from the freedom of information act  at least one copy of the report  however  will not be returned to the committee  that s because a copy has been preserved in former president barack obama s presidential archive  according to a dec     letter written to feinstein by obama s top white house lawyer at the time  w  neil eggleston  the cia declined to comment  burr s move was first reported by the new york times
