islamabad  reuters    outlining a new strategy for the war in afghanistan  u s  president donald trump chastised pakistan over its alleged support for afghan militants   an approach analysts say will probably not change pakistan s strategic calculations and might push it in directions washington does not want it to go  trump s call for india to play a greater role in afghanistan  in particular  will ring alarm bells for pakistan s generals  analysts said   trump s policy of engaging india and threatening action may actually constrain pakistan and lead to the opposite of what he wants   said zahid hussain  a pakistani security analyst  trump criticised pakistan for providing  safe havens to terrorist organisations  and warned islamabad it had much to lose by supporting insurgents battling the u s  backed kabul government   it is kind of putting pakistan on notice   said rustam shah mohman  pakistan s former ambassador to kabul  predicting a bumpy road ahead for relations  trump did resist some advisers  calls to threaten to declare pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism unless islamabad pursued senior leaders of the afghan taliban and the allied haqqani network   pakistan should not be reassured by this speech  but it could have gone a lot worse for them   said joshua white  a national security council director under former president barack obama    there were voices within the administration who wanted to move more quickly and aggressively to declare pakistan not just a problem  but effectively an enemy   in washington  a senior administration official said on tuesday that significant measures were under consideration  including possibly sanctioning pakistani officials with ties to extremist organizations  the official spoke on condition of anonymity  pakistan s powerful military has not commented on trump s speech  but the day before it denied any militants had havens in the country      the pakistani government said foreign minister khawaja asif met with the u s  ambassador on tuesday and would speak in coming days with u s  secretary of state rex tillerson  on the state of play in the bilateral relationship as well as the new u s  policy on south asia    successive u s  administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan  washington fumes about inaction against the taliban  but pakistan has been helpful on other counterterrorism efforts  including against al qaeda and islamic state militants  the united states also has no choice but to use pakistani roads to resupply its troops in landlocked afghanistan  u s  officials worry that if pakistan becomes an active foe  it could further destabilise afghanistan and endanger u s  soldiers  daniel feldman  a special representative for afghanistan and pakistan under obama  said the obama administration found it more effective to pressure islamabad over safe havens  in private than in public  and to keep the long standing indo pak rivalry from playing out in afghanistan   hussain  the security analyst  said trump on monday  crossed a red line  as far as pakistan was concerned when he implored india to deepen its involvement in afghanistan  relations between pakistan and the united states have endured strain during the  year war in afghanistan  especially after al qaeda chief osama bin laden was killed by u s  special forces inside pakistan in     the obama administration had already begun trimming military aid to pakistan  last year  the pentagon decided not to pay   million in pledged military funding  and congress effectively blocked a subsidised sale of f  jets to pakistan  analysts say trump is likely to further curtail military aid  to pressure pakistan  but any effort to isolate pakistan would face problems from china  which has deepened political and military ties to islamabad as it invested nearly   billion in infrastructure in pakistan  china on tuesday defended pakistan after trump s remarks  saying its neighbour was on the front line in the struggle against terrorism and had made  great sacrifices  and  important contributions  in the fight  mohman  the former ambassador  said if the united states kept putting pressure on pakistan  then islamabad would drift farther from the american sphere of influence   we have options   he said   we can go to china and russia  and i think the u s  can t afford that
