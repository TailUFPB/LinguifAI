washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump came to office promising that he would produce so much winning that americans would be sick of it  as he struggles to produce wins  some signs of frustration are starting to appear  democrats  gleeful declarations that they outsmarted republicans in a battle over a spending bill that avoided a government shutdown drew the ire of the president  democrats were happy that funding for trump s mexico border wall was not included   trump tweeted on tuesday that maybe a government shutdown would not be so bad and that republicans should consider changing senate rules to make it easier to pass spending and other bills without any democratic support    our country needs a good  shutdown  in september to fix mess   he wrote   his comment frustrated some of his fellow republicans in  congress  who chafed at the suggestion that the white house could dictate senate rules  or send a message that a shutdown  which costs the economy millions  was desirable   i think it would be a good thing at this point if the iphone was put in a safe  locked away and maybe returned in four years   republican senator bob corker  who was once on the short list to be trump s vice president  told reporters   that s just not constructive  those are the kinds of things that should never happen  and    it s damaging to our credibility  it s damaging to trust here within the  capitol  building   corker said  trump marked his  day in office on saturday and used last week to argue that he has made major progress in rolling back federal regulations and improving the climate for job creation  but with his healthcare reform effort flagging  trump has been unable to get a major piece of legislation through a congress controlled by his own republican party  leaving him without a signature victory  with democrats celebrating concessions they extracted in the spending bill  trump used a rose garden ceremony honoring the air force academy s football team to declare he and republicans got more from the legislation than might appear   after years of partisan bickering and gridlock  this bill is a clear win for the american people   trump said  white house budget director mick mulvaney gave three news briefings to promote trump gains from the bill  the first on monday night and the second on tuesday morning in a conference call for reporters  the conference call was marred by technical issues at times  with mulvaney straining to be heard over orchestra music that mysteriously began playing   all right   mulvaney told reporters at one point   i ll try to answer it one more time  and clearly we re having a lot of background noise here   later  in the white house briefing room  mulvaney said he understood trump s frustration  accusing democrats of trying to  spike the football  by publicly celebrating the budget deal as a democratic victory in an effort to make the president look bad after he negotiated in good faith  he said democrats were thwarted by republicans in their attempt to add bailout money for puerto rico   we ve got a lot to do between now and september  i don t anticipate a shutdown in september  but if the democrats aren t going to behave any better than they have in the last couple of days  it may be inevitable   mulvaney said  democrats quickly denounced trump s musings about closing the federal government   here we saw democrats and republicans working together in the best traditions of the senate  and the president disparages it in a way that s destructive   democratic senate leader chuck schumer said    senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said the senate would debate the funding bill this week and that most republicans did not favor a change in the rules to make it easier to pass legislation without democratic support  trump said his fellow republicans had to acquiesce to democratic demands in spending bill because the party s majority was too slim to win the  senate votes needed to advance the legislation without them  republicans hold  of the senate s  seats   the reason for the plan negotiated between the republicans and democrats is that we need  votes in the senate which are not there  we either elect more republican senators in  or change the rules now to     trump wrote on twitter  republicans last forced a government closure in  for  days  democrats said trump would shoulder the blame for any shutdown now
