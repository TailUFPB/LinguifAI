washington  reuters    former cia director john brennan said on tuesday he had noticed contacts between associates of donald trump s presidential campaign and russia during the  election and grew concerned moscow had sought to lure americans down  a treasonous path   brennan  who headed the agency until trump became president in january  also told a congressional hearing that he personally warned the head of russia s fsb security service in a phone call last august that meddling in the election would hurt relations with the united states  separately  the top u s  intelligence official  dan coats  sidestepped a question on a washington post report that trump had asked him and the national security agency chief to help him knock down the notion there was evidence of such collusion  but coats did say he has made clear to trump s administration that  any political shaping  of intelligence would be inappropriate  the comments by brennan and coats  the director of national intelligence  added fuel to a controversy that has engulfed trump since he fired fbi director james comey two weeks ago amid the agency s investigation into possible collusion between people associated with his presidential campaign and russia   i encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between russian officials and u s  persons involved in the trump campaign   brennan s said in testimony to the house of representatives intelligence committee  brennan said that he cannot say definitively there was actual collusion  brennan s testimony was the first public confirmation of the worry at high levels of the u s  government last year over suspicious contacts between trump campaign associates and moscow  it was also the most complete account to date of the cia s thinking at a time when intelligence agencies were putting together evidence that russia was interfering in the heated u s  presidential race to help businessman trump  a republican  defeat democratic party candidate hillary clinton  comey was heading the federal bureau of investigation probe into russian interference and possible collusion with trump s campaign  leading to accusations by trump critics that he has sought to curtail the fbi inquiry  in another development  trump has retained marc kasowitz  a new york based trial lawyer who has represented trump in the past  as his private attorney for special counsel robert mueller s investigation into the russia matter  a fox business network reporter said on twitter  u s  intelligence agencies concluded in january that moscow tried to tilt the election campaign in trump s favor  including by hacking into the emails of senior democrats  russia has repeatedly denied the allegation  trump has denied any collusion but the fbi and congressional probes into the russia matter have dogged the early months of his presidency   it should be clear to everyone russia brazenly interfered in our  presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so   brennan said  brennan said he worried that russians tried to recruit americans during the presidential campaign to work for moscow  brennan said it was possible for someone to be helpful to the russian cause without realizing it   they  the russians  try to suborn individuals and they try to get individuals  including u s  persons  to act on their behalf either wittingly or unwittingly   he said  adding that  individuals going on a treasonous path often do not realize it until it is too late   republican representative trey gowdy asked brennan   did you see evidence of collusion  coordination and conspiracy between donald trump and russian state actors    i saw information and intelligence that was worthy of investigation by the bureau  fbi  to determine whether or not such cooperation or collusion was taking place   brennan replied  but declined to elaborate  reuters reported last week that trump s fired former national security adviser michael flynn and other advisers to trump s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least  calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race  flynn was forced out in february for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  and misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations   brennan said he believed he was the first u s  official to raise the matter of election interference with the russians  citing an aug     phone call he had with the head of russia s fsb  alexander bortnikov  he said he raised media reports of russian attempts to meddle in the election with bortnikov  who denied any involvement by moscow  and told him if russia pursued this course it would destroy prospects for improved u s  russia relations  trump s public approval ratings dropped to a new low in reuters ipsos poll data released on tuesday  with  percent of u s  adults surveyed approving of the president while  percent disapproving  support for trump appears to have dropped among americans of all political stripes  at a senate armed services committee hearing  coats sidestepped questions about a washington post report that trump had asked coats and admiral michael rogers  director of the national security agency  to help him knock down the notion that there was evidence of such collusion  but coats did not deny trump had made such a request  coats said that  i don t feel it s appropriate to characterize discussions and conversations with the president   the post reported coats and rogers declined the request  democratic senator richard blumenthal told coats that the fact he had not denied the post report should lead to  even more intensive investigation of the alleged effort by the president to enlist you in shutting down  or stifling that investigation    this evidence  if true  goes to criminal intent and constitutes mounting evidence of obstruction of justice   blumenthal added  the leaders of the u s  senate intelligence committee said they will subpoena two of flynn s businesses after he declined to comply with a subpoena for documents in the panel s russia probe
