washington  reuters    president donald trump on sunday slapped new travel restrictions on citizens from north korea  venezuela and chad  expanding to eight the list of countries covered by his original travel bans that have been derided by critics and challenged in court  iran  libya  syria  yemen and somalia were left on the list of affected countries in a new proclamation issued by the president  restrictions on citizens from sudan were lifted  the measures help fulfill a campaign promise trump made to tighten u s  immigration procedures and align with his  america first  foreign policy vision  unlike the president s original bans  which had time limits  this one is open ended     making america safe is my number one priority  we will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet   the president said in a tweet shortly after the proclamation was released  iraqi citizens will not be subject to travel prohibitions but will face enhanced scrutiny or vetting   the current ban  enacted in march  was set to expire on sunday evening  the new restrictions are slated to take effect on oct   and resulted from a review after trump s original travel bans sparked international outrage and legal challenges  the addition of north korea and venezuela broadens the restrictions from the original  mostly muslim majority list  an administration official  briefing reporters on a conference call  acknowledged that the number of north koreans now traveling to the united states was very low   rights group amnesty international usa condemned the measures   just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government sanctioned discrimination   it said in a statement    it is senseless and cruel to ban whole nationalities of people who are often fleeing the very same violence that the u s  government wishes to keep out  this must not be normalized   the american civil liberties union said in a statement the addition of north korea and venezuela  doesn t obfuscate the real fact that the administration s order is still a muslim ban   the white house portrayed the restrictions as consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas  those requirements were shared in july with foreign governments  which had  days to make improvements if needed  the white house said   a number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen  others did not  sparking the restrictions  the announcement came as the u s  supreme court prepares to hear oral arguments on oct   over the legality of trump s previous travel ban  including whether it discriminated against muslims   trump has threatened to  destroy  north korea if it attacks the united states or its allies  pyongyang earlier this month conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test  the president  has also directed harsh criticism at venezuela  once hinting at a potential military option to deal with caracas  but the officials described the addition of the two countries to trump s travel restrictions as the result of a purely objective review  in the case of north korea  where the suspension was sweeping and applied to both immigrants and non immigrants  officials said it was hard for the united states to validate the identity of someone coming from north korea or to find out if that person was a threat   north korea  quite bluntly  does not cooperate whatsoever   one official said    the restrictions on venezuela focused on socialist government officials that the trump administration blamed for the country s slide into economic disarray  including officials from the bolivarian national intelligence service and their immediate families  trump received a set of policy recommendations on friday from acting secretary of homeland security elaine duke and was briefed on the matter by other administration officials  including attorney general jeff sessions and secretary of state rex tillerson  a white house aide said  the rollout on sunday was decidedly more organized than trump s first stab at a travel ban  which was unveiled with little warning and sparked protests at airports worldwide     earlier on sunday  trump told reporters about the ban   the tougher  the better        rather than a total ban on entry to the united states  the proposed restrictions differ by nation  based on cooperation with american security mandates  the threat the united states believes each country presents and other variables  officials said   somalis  for example  are barred from entering the united states as immigrants and subjected to greater screening for visits        after the sept   bombing attack on a london train  trump wrote on twitter that the new ban  should be far larger  tougher and more specific   but stupidly  that would not be politically correct        the expiring ban blocked entry into the united states by people from the six countries for  days and locked out most aspiring refugees for  days to give trump s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of u s  vetting procedures for foreign visitors       critics have accused the republican president of discriminating against muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law  breaking existing u s  immigration law and stoking religious hatred      some federal courts blocked the ban  but the u s  supreme court allowed it to take effect in june with some restrictions
