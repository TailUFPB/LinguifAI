washington  reuters    deeply divided republicans squeezed their u s  healthcare overhaul  backed by president donald trump  through a key house of representatives panel on thursday despite defections by three conservatives who consider it too similar to the obamacare law it is intended to replace  trump s first major legislative initiative still faces an uphill battle in the full house and later the senate despite ongoing efforts by the white house and republican leaders to satisfy conservative opponents  the budget committee vote was  to   with republican representatives david brat  gary palmer and mark sanford   all members of the conservative house freedom caucus   joining the panel s democrats in voting against it  the committee brought provisions approved last week by two other panels into a single bill  helping pave the way for a later vote on the house floor  republicans  who control congress and the white house  could not afford to lose more than three from their ranks on the committee for it to pass   i don t think we are anywhere near passage   brat said after the vote  noting that republican conservatives as well as moderates had problems with the bill  the  affordable care act  the signature legislative achievement of former president barack obama  enabled about  million previously uninsured americans to obtain medical coverage  about half of those were through the law s expansion of eligibility and increased funding for the medicaid government health insurance program for the poor   the close vote illustrated the problems republican leaders may encounter in corralling enough votes in their party to win passage on the house floor amid unified democratic opposition  the measure now goes to the rules committee before reaching the house floor  the congressional budget office  a nonpartisan congressional agency  forecast on monday that the legislation would increase the number of americans without health insurance by  million by   while cutting   billion from federal budget deficits over the same period  the bill faces opposition from leading healthcare providers  including doctors and hospitals   we are on track and on schedule   house speaker paul ryan  who unveiled the legislation last week and is its chief champion in the house  said after the committee s vote  he added that while the main parts of the bill  are going to stay exactly as they are   republicans were making unspecified  improvements and refinements   ryan told a news conference that trump was  deeply involved  and  helping bridge gaps  among republican lawmakers to get a consensus plan  conservatives were unmoved   there s no natural constituency for this bill   said republican representative raul labrador  another freedom caucus member   the left is really mad about it  the right is really mad about it  the middle is really mad about it  and so far it just seems to be a constituency of one  which is washington insiders  people that are just trying to get something passed so they can get to the next issue    trump administration officials and house republican leaders have said they hope to get the bill to the house floor by the end of the month so it can go to the senate before lawmakers  mid april recess  conservatives want a quicker end to the obamacare medicaid expansion  which the bill has set for   and want to add work requirements for some medicaid recipients  they also call the age based tax credits to help people buy insurance on the open market an unwise new entitlement  the white house said it was discussing changes with house republican leaders  trump told a fox news interviewer on wednesday that much of the bill would still be negotiated  especially as it moves from the house to the senate  conservative advocacy groups praised the republicans who voted  no   club for growth president david mcintosh said it makes no sense for ryan and budget committee chair diane black to force republicans  to walk the plank and vote for a bad bill that they ve already admitted needs to be changed   black asked fellow republicans who had doubts not to  cut off the discussion  by voting no  after approving the legislation  the panel adopted four non binding republican recommendations for changes before it moves to the house floor  including one by the conservative palmer on adding work requirements for able bodied  childless medicaid recipients  the other recommendations called for no longer encouraging people to sign up for insurance through medicaid  giving states more flexibility in designing medicaid programs  and changing the bill s tax credits to help lower income people more  democrats have called the republicans  plan a blow to the elderly and the poor while giving tax cuts to the rich  representative john yarmuth  the committee s top democrat  said the legislation was  not a healthcare bill  it is an ideological document   he said the bill imagined a  fantasy land where young people don t get sick  and apparently they don t grow old either  because they don t have to worry about being priced out of the market
