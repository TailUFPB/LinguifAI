washington  reuters    u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said on thursday that a national security review of the u s  steel industry will be completed  very shortly  and will seek to protect the interests of both domestic steel producers and consumers  ross told a senate appropriations subcommittee hearing that he believes there is  a genuine national security issue that must be considered in this case   the second major signal in two days that the trump administration is preparing new steel import restrictions    in a speech in cincinnati on wednesday  trump said   wait until you see what i m going to do for steel and for your steel companies  we re going to stop the dumping  and stop all of these wonderful other countries from coming in and killing our companies and our workers  you ll be seeing that very soon   the steel review under a cold war era trade law would result in a  thoughtful  set of recommendations for trump to consider for action  ross said  he has previously said he expected to complete the study by the end of june  ross identified three kinds of actions that could be recommended  imposing tariffs above the current  country specific anti dumping and anti subsidy duties on steel products  imposing quotas limiting the volume of steel imports  and a hybrid  tariff rate quota  option that would include quotas on specific products with new tariffs for imports above those levels  choosing the latter option would help mitigate concerns over steel price inflation from tariffs  ross said  some steel users have voiced concerns that import limits would cause price increases that would make them more vulnerable to foreign competitors   the overall impact on inflation  were that to be the route  should be relatively modest   ross said   so we re very mindful of the need both to protect the domestic steel producers from inappropriate behavior on the part of foreign dumpers  but also to protect the steel consumers  the steel fabricators  the auto companies and everybody else who uses steel
