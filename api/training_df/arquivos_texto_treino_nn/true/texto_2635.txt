washington  reuters    if john mccain s illness requires a long absence from the u s  senate  his colleagues will be deprived of a dealmaker and leading voice on national security  while america s allies will lose one of the few republican critics of president donald trump s foreign policy  the  year old lawmaker and  republican presidential nominee  who was elected to a sixth senate term last november  has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer  he is vowing a quick return to the senate  mccain  a former u s  navy pilot who spent    years as a prisoner of war in vietnam  is outspoken on a range of issues  from defense spending to immigration to demanding a thorough investigation of alleged russian meddling in the  u s  election   asked how the senate was different without mccain  his close friend senator lindsey graham said   it s quieter  john is a fighter and john s into every cause no matter how hard it might be   a russia hawk  mccain has expressed deep skepticism of trump s effort to improve ties with moscow  and emerged  with graham  as perhaps the most vocal republican critic in congress of the president s foreign policy  he chairs the influential senate armed services committee  mccain has traveled the globe on trips some analysts say are efforts to soothe the concerns of u s  allies that fear trump s  america first  policy means a retreat from international engagement   i realize that some of president trump s actions and statements have unsettled america s friends   mccain said in a speech in australia in may   they have unsettled many americans as well   mccain is also known for an independent streak and a willingness to work with democrats  he has participated in almost every major bipartisan legislative effort in the senate in recent years  such as the  gang of eight  immigration push in    in   mccain  who was tortured while a pow  worked with democratic senator dianne feinstein to pass legislation banning torture  this week  he called for a bipartisan effort to overhaul the u s  healthcare system   while mccain has made clear his desire for more spending on defense  he has criticized what he sees as inefficiencies in u s  weapons programs  some analysts said defense contractors might have an easier time with another armed services chairman   mccain is mccain  and he has needled people and programs that he does not think are performing   said mark cancian  of the center for strategic and international studies international security program  mccain has criticized defense programs like the littoral combat ship made by lockheed martin co  lmt n  and australia s austal ltd  asb ax    lcs has been one thing that has been in his sights  and arguably there has been an effect   cancian said  to carry out trump s goal of repealing and replacing former democratic president barack obama s signature affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell needs the backing of at least  of the  u s  senators  republicans control the senate by a narrow majority of  to   as mccain weighs treatment options in his home state of arizona  his absence makes it more difficult for mcconnell to muster the support he needs to advance healthcare legislation expected to come to a vote next week   obviously  i think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math  but you know  you understand the math   republican senator bob corker told reporters   obviously  it makes things difficult   sarah binder  a scholar at the brookings institution  said that with the slim republican majority  the absence of any senator could be potentially  catastrophic  for the party s effort to pass its agenda  she said the problem was compounded by mccain s absence   his colleagues perceive him as a  giant  of the senate  whose expertise and perspective on foreign and military affairs is arguably irreplaceable   binder said
