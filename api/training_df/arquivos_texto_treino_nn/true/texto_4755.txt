tel aviv  reuters    two months after stepping down as barack obama s ambassador to israel  dan shapiro sees some good in the initial peace efforts by the new administration of donald trump  even as he voices his grievances against it   so far the approach on the israeli palestinian issue has been more cautious and more responsible than almost anything else   shapiro told reuters    i can t quite explain why on this one issue they re closer to the norm than they ve been on other issues   shapiro has gained a following of thousands on his new personal twitter account  sharing insights gleaned from nearly six years in the tel aviv embassy and face to face contacts with prime minister benjamin netanyahu  and correcting misconceptions he perceives on social media about obama s diplomacy  in the interview  he said trump has surprised him by calling for a slowdown in israeli settlement construction on occupied land palestinians seek for a state  the former envoy praised the republican president s chief negotiator jason greenblatt for meeting a cross section of israelis and palestinians during a visit last week that has led to u s  israeli discussions on limiting settlement building  still  shapiro cautioned  trump s government is inconsistent and unpredictable    i m not sure how comfortable the israelis should be with an administration that s hard to read  that s far from fully staffed  that has a very undeveloped policymaking apparatus and has very divergent voices within it   he said  on other diplomatic fronts  shapiro said  the trump administration has been cozying up dangerously to russia  backtracking from free trade agreements and international organizations and calling into question washington s nato obligations  when news broke earlier this week that secretary of state rex tillerson planned to skip a nato meeting  shapiro pointed on twitter to a failure to fill staff vacancies   that s ok  he ll just send his dep     i mean  that s ok  he ll send the underse     i mean  that s ok  he ll send an assistan     oh  never mind   he wrote   now an adviser at a hedge fund and a distinguished visiting fellow at israel s institute for national security studies  shapiro took the unorthodox course of staying in israel after leaving his diplomatic post so that a daughter could finish high school exams  the decision to delay his family s return  shapiro said in an interview with reuters  also allows him to avoid what he described as the  bleak  mood in washington following donald trump s election as president  shapiro has avoided wading into israel s domestic politics on twitter  saying that as a guest in the country  it would be unseemly to do so  looking back on the failures of the obama administration s israeli palestinian peace efforts  he suggested that former secretary of state john kerry may have been too idealistic in pursuing talks that collapsed in    we might have adjusted our approach had we taken a very realistic assessment whether we had the leadership dynamics to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations   said shapiro  the united states  he said  had been aware after efforts during obama s first term  of the deep personal mistrust between israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and palestinian president mahmoud abbas   and so it s a fair question about whether it was realistic at the beginning of the second term that with a concerted effort we could achieve an appreciably different result   shapiro said   the story is refiled to drop extraneous word in lead
