washington new york  reuters    president donald trump s administration on friday undermined requirements under the obamacare law that employers provide insurance to cover women s birth control  keeping a campaign pledge that pleased his conservative christian supporters  new rules from the department of health and human services will let businesses or non profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law s mandate that employers provide contraceptives coverage in health insurance with no co payment  conservative christian activists and congressional republicans praised the move  while reproductive rights advocates and democrats criticized it  it was unclear how many employers would actually drop birth control coverage on religious grounds  and there were significant doubts that many big ones would   within hours  the american civil liberties union sued the administration in federal court in san francisco to try to halt the rule  claiming among other things that it violated the u s  constitution s requirement for separation of church and state  the states of massachusetts and california also sued  and democratic state attorneys general in another  states threatened legal action   this is a landmark day for religious liberty  under the obama administration  this constitutional right was seriously eroded   republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan said   the trump administration just took direct aim at birth control coverage for  million women   planned parenthood federation of america president cecile richards said   with this rule in place  any employer could decide that their employees no longer have health insurance coverage for birth control   richards added  trump  who criticized the birth control mandate in last year s election campaign  won strong support from conservative christian voters  the republican president signed an executive order in may asking for rules that would allow faith based groups to deny insurance coverage for services they oppose on religious grounds  the contraception mandate was implemented as part of the  affordable care act  democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement  trump and republicans in congress campaigned against obamacare  as the law is known  but could not get enough votes to repeal it as they had promised  in its reasoning for the move  the administration said among other things that mandating birth control coverage could foster  risky sexual behavior  among teens and young adults  it overturned the obama administration s view that the birth control requirement was necessary to meet the government s  compelling interest  to protect women s health   this administration s contempt for women reaches a new low with this appalling decision   top house democrat nancy pelosi said  the administration broadened narrow existing religious exemptions to include an exception  on the basis of moral conviction  for non profit and for profit companies  federal rules implemented under obamacare required employers to provide health insurance that covers birth control  but religious houses of worship were exempted  some private businesses sued regarding their rights to circumvent such coverage  and the supreme court ruled in  that they could object on religious grounds  case western reserve university school of law professor jonathan adler said it was unlikely publicly traded companies would seek exemptions   why would a publicly traded company risk alienating potential shareholders by taking such a step   adler said  ellen kelsay  chief strategy officer at the national business group on health  a lobbying group for large companies  said   most large employers have provided coverage for birth control prior to any mandates and we expect most will continue to do so irrespective of any exemptions that may become available   according to one estimate  only  percent of nonprofit groups offering health benefits have objected to contraceptives coverage   hhs has issued a balanced rule that respects all sides   it keeps the contraceptive mandate in place for most employers and now provides a religious exemption   said mark rienzi  one of the lawyers for the little sisters of the poor  the order of roman catholic nuns  which runs care homes for the elderly  had challenged the mandate in court  the little sisters and other christian nonprofit employers objected to a  compromise offered by the obama administration that allowed entities opposed to providing contraception insurance coverage to comply with the law without actually paying for the required coverage   the justice department released two memos that will serve as the government s legal basis for justifying the rule and laying out a framework for how apply religious liberty issues in legal opinions  federal rules and grant making   in another decision popular with trump s evangelical supporters  the justice department on wednesday reversed federal policy and declared that federal law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not protect transgender employees  trump also has removed protections for transgender students and moved to ban transgender people from the military  trump s support among evangelical voters  a major force in his  election victory  remains strong  but has been slipping in line with his overall approval ratings  according to recent reuters ipsos poll results
