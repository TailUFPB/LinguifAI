washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday rejected new hampshire s bid to revive a state law barring voters from taking  selfie  photos with their ballots during elections that a lower court struck down as a violation of free speech rights  new hampshire banned such selfies in   saying the photos could set the stage for a return of the kind of vote buying or voter intimidation that was rampant in the  century   the supreme court declined to hear the state s appeal of a ruling by the boston based  u s  circuit court of appeals last september that the law ran afoul of the u s  constitution s first amendment  which guarantees free speech  the state cannot curtail speech based on a hypothetical danger  the appeals court stated  ballot selfies have become a popular way for voters to show support for favored candidates through postings on social media platforms such as twitter  facebook and snapchat   three new hampshire residents who were under investigation for violating the law  including a man who wrote in the name of his dog to express dismay at his choices in the  republican primary for the u s  senate  sued the state that year claiming the measure violated the first amendment  the  circuit agreed last year  noting that new hampshire had no complaints of vote buying or evidence that people were being coerced to vote a certain way  new hampshire s secretary of state  william gardner  appealed to the supreme court  noting that  states had laws that in some form prevented voters from displaying their ballots   digital photography and social media could allow an invasion of the sanctity of the voting booth and  eliminate the anonymity of the secret ballot   gardner said   with recent advances in technology  one s right to vote freely without fear of retaliation is in jeopardy   gardner added  some states  including nearby rhode island  have passed laws explicitly allowing ballot selfies  reasoning in part that the trend has helped younger voters show their enthusiasm for the democratic process
