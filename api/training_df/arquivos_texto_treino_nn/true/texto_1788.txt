washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump will not necessarily insist on including funding for a border wall with mexico in legislation to address protections for children brought to the united states illegally  a senior aide said on tuesday  white house legislative director marc short  speaking to reporters at a christian science monitor breakfast  said the administration will lay out its priorities for a fix for the deferred action on childhood arrivals  daca  program in the next couple of weeks  while trump remains committed to his campaign promise to build the wall along the u s  border with mexico   whether or not that is specifically part of a daca package or a different legislative package  i am not going to prejudge here today   short said   i don t want to bind ourselves into a construct that makes reaching a conclusion on daca impossible   short said  short s comments were the latest signal that the republican president wants to see if he can engage democrats as well as republicans in trying to enact his agenda  on tuesday evening  he is scheduled to have dinner with a bipartisan group of senators whose support he hopes to win on legislation to overhaul the tax code  democrats welcomed short s daca comments  saying they cleared away a major stumbling to legislation to help daca recipients  known as dreamers  democrats have insisted they will not allow border funding to be part of any legislation and would likely have the votes in the senate to block a provision to which they objected   that s an important position because we cannot make a   mile    km  wall a condition for passing the dream act and we ve been very clear from the start   said senator dick durbin  a senior democrat who has been working for the past  years to legislate protections for the dreamers  democrats are willing to work with the white house and congressional republicans on other border security measures as part of the legislation  durbin added  but mark krikorian  executive director of the center for immigration studies  which seeks to limit legal and illegal immigration  criticized the potential shift on daca  saying the white house forfeited leverage it needs to tighten border enforcement  krikorian said the administration seemed to be looking for an  escape hatch  on the controversial daca program   it does suggest how much trump wants this daca issue to go away   he said  trump said last week he was ending an obama era program that protects from the deportation of immigrants brought illegally into the united states as children  but he gave u s  lawmakers six months to act on the issue  the move put the onus on congress to address the nearly   dreamers now facing uncertainty about their status in a country that for many is the only one they have known
