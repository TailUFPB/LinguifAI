washington aboard air force one  reuters    president donald trump forged a surprising deal with democrats in congress on wednesday to extend the u s  debt limit and provide government funding until dec    embracing his political adversaries and blindsiding fellow republicans in a rare bipartisan accord  trump  living up to his reputation for unpredictability  met at the white house with congressional leaders from both parties and overruled republicans and u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin  who wanted a longer term debt limit extension rather than the three month democratic proposal the president embraced   we could have done a one year deal today   mnuchin told reporters aboard air force one later in the day en route back to washington from an event in north dakota where trump spoke about taxes  mnuchin said trump chose a short term deal to keep his options open on possibly raising military funding later this year  suggesting a longer term government funding deal might have blocked that  trump is very focused on military spending   particularly with what s going on in north korea and other parts of the world today   mnuchin said   the president wasn t willing to give up his need for additional military spending   if passed by the republican led congress  the three month agreement would avert an unprecedented default on u s  government debt  keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning oct   and provide aid to victims of hurricane harvey   it was a really good moment of some bipartisanship and getting things done   top senate democrat chuck schumer said  less than an hour before the meeting  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan had called the democratic proposal that trump later embraced a  ridiculous and disgraceful  idea that would  play politics with the debt ceiling   even with the three month extension of the debt limit  a senate republican aide told reporters that nothing in the tentative deal would stop the treasury department from using its powers to extend the deadline  depending on revenue flow  in the past  the debt limit deadline has been extended for several months under those powers  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  overridden by trump during the meeting  said he would bring the deal to the senate floor for a vote   the president can speak for himself  but his feeling was that we needed to come together  to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis   mcconnell told reporters  the agreement was an uncommon instance of bipartisan compromise since trump took office in january  washington has suffered through bitter partisanship that has at times left the u s  capital dysfunctional under trump and his democratic predecessor  barack obama  trump had tangled repeatedly with schumer and top house democrat nancy pelosi   we had a very good meeting with nancy pelosi and chuck schumer   trump  a wealthy businessman who as a candidate touted his deal making skills  told reporters aboard air force one  without mentioning mcconnell or ryan  with whom he has had fraught relations   we agreed to a three month extension on debt ceiling  which they consider to be sacred  very important  always we ll agree on debt ceiling  automatically because of the importance of it   trump said  conservative groups were aghast  accusing trump of caving in to the democrats rather than insisting on spending cuts to accompany the debt ceiling increase  and some hard line republicans expressed opposition to it  republican leaders and mnuchin pushed in the meeting for an  month debt limit hike  then floated six months  but pelosi and schumer held firm to their three month proposal and trump sided with them  according to people familiar with the meeting  the party in power  in this case republicans  often argues for the longest debt limit increase as possible for two reasons  first  it protects members of congress from casting multiple votes on the politically unpopular legislation over a short period of time  especially in the run up to the  congressional elections  second  it helps stabilize markets   for minority democrats  whose votes are needed to pass debt ceiling increases  they could potentially use the debt limit vote later in the year as leverage to win concessions on a tax overhaul package that trump badly wants to advance  even though republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress  trump has yet to win passage of any major legislation  with democrats typically united against him  the house on wednesday approved roughly   billion in initial emergency aid for relief and rebuilding after hurricane harvey  which tore into texas on aug    with the measure now going to the senate      our no   priority was getting funding for harvey   mnuchin said   to get the funding for harvey  we needed to extend the debt limit   u s  shares rose and the dollar gained against the safe haven japanese yen as word of the deal helped mitigate investor concerns about north korea and a major hurricane barreling toward florida  the news also lifted the yield on benchmark  year u s  treasury notes  rr after it had fallen to a near  month low at   percent  the treasury department has said the ceiling must be raised in the next few weeks  if not  the government would be unable to borrow more money or pay its bills  including its debt payments  that could hurt the u s  credit rating  cause financial turmoil  harm the economy and possibly trigger a recession  representative kevin cramer  a republican from north dakota  was aboard air force one when he heard about the short term deal  he told reporters on the plane   i will tell you that i gasped when i heard it   he said the deal would be a  tough sell  for house republicans but that some would  warm up to the idea  when they learned more about it
