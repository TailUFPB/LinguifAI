somerville  mass   reuters    u s  senator bernie sanders brought his strategy of trying to reenergize the democratic party by lending his star power to lower level races to a small city just outside boston on monday  with a stop to endorse candidates for alderman and city council  sanders  an independent who ran for the democratic party nomination in the  presidential election  announced his support for a dozen candidates backed by  our revolution  a group formed by supporters of sanders  campaign to boost progressive  liberal candidates  it is unusual for a politician with sanders  profile to weigh in on races with no serious republican contenders  political observers said     the local level  more than any other level  is a way to involve people in the political process   sanders said in  somerville  massachusetts  a city of   people  sanders last week pointed to the appearance as one of a series to try to build enthusiasm for lower level elections  sanders served four terms as mayor of burlington  vermont  before being elected to the senate  his remarks on monday mirrored his  stump speeches  without directly addressing the candidates he was supporting in somerville and neighboring cambridge  political observers said sanders  and the candidates he endorsed  will face a challenge in translating the enthusiasm his campaign generated into votes for lower level races  in the city s last municipal election that followed a presidential race  one in four registered voters  some   people  cast ballots  three out of four who voted in last year s hillary clinton donald trump presidential matchup   sanders envisioned his candidacy as a launching pad for nothing short of a revolution within the democratic party   said jeffrey berry  a professor of political science at nearby tufts university   the energy is more around  how do we fight trump  than it is  how do we create a democratic party in the image of bernie sanders    sanders may not need to tip too many voters to influence the typically low turnout city races  in the  ward races  just two candidates secured more than   votes and the four closest races were decided by an average of  votes   it s definitely a draw and i think it s important that he is supporting local candidates   said ellora derenoncourt  a  year old graduate student who was out to show her support for alderman candidate j t  scott  a gym owner in his first race  the event did attract some undecided voters who said sanders  endorsement would sway their picks among fields of democratic candidates   our country has moved so far to their right since the mid  that just being a democrat doesn t necessarily qualify you as a liberal or progressive   said pamela massey    of cambridge  nina turner  a former ohio state senator who serves as president of our revolution  acknowledged that the group faced a challenge in drumming up enthusiasm for down ticket races   we have to try   turner said   we have to remind people that they have an obligation to participate and so often the level of vitriol that is put out the national level can have a negative effect
