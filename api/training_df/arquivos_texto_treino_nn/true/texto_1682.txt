united nations  reuters    france made a new plea on monday for the united states to preserve the  iran nuclear deal and suggested its provisions expiring after a decade could be strengthened  as u s  president donald trump again criticized the agreement as  deeply flawed   the pact between tehran and six world powers  which calls for iran to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions  is under threat as trump must decide by oct   whether to certify iran is keeping its end of the bargain  if trump  who as recently as thursday accused iran of violating  the spirit  of the deal  chooses not to certify  the pact could unravel  possibly triggering a regional arms race  the republican president  who has called the agreement struck under his democratic predecessor  barack obama   the worst deal ever negotiated   made no secret of his views during a meeting with french president emmanuel macron   the president believes that the jcpoa is deeply flawed  and he did share his views with president macron about how he believes the deal is flawed   brian hook  director of policy planning at the u s  state department  told reporters  the pact is formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action   the president was very candid with him about what he thinks are the shortcomings      he told him that it is under review and that they are taking a hard look at the oct   decision and more broadly how to fix the iran deal   hook said  hook said the two also discussed an integrated strategy against iran that would take into account what he described as iran s support for terrorism  its ballistic missile program  its destabilization in the middle east and other aggressions  asked if he planned to stick with the pact  trump earlier told reporters as he began a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday   you ll be seeing very soon  israeli officials have said changes israel wants in the jcpoa include lengthening the  year freeze on iran s nuclear development program or even making that suspension permanent and destroying centrifuges rather than just halting their operation   the deal was negotiated with iran by the united states  russia  china  britain  germany and france  the six will meet with iran at the ministerial level on wednesday           the prospect of washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the u s  allies that helped negotiate it  especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis  north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development   it is essential to maintain it to avoid proliferation  in this period when we see the risks with north korea  we must maintain this line   french foreign minister jean yves le drian told reporters   france will try to convince president trump of the pertinence of this choice  keeping the accord   even if work can be done to complement the accord after    he said  a senior french official said trump had not given macron an indication on whether he had made up his mind during their monday bilateral   however  the official said macron had put on the table the prospect of new nuclear negotiations after  during his bilateral with iranian president hasan rouhani and warned him that tehran should stop provoking the united states with its regional activities   we feel the post  subject is a red line  but our president put it on the table because it s a concern and a legitimate request that we must make   the official said    will arrive quickly and we have to be ready before jan     so he asked that we think together how to work on this question    if trump does not certify that iran is complying with the agreement  the u s  congress will have  days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal  iran supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei warned on sunday that tehran would react strongly to any  wrong move  by washington on the nuclear deal  paris took one of the hardest lines against tehran in the negotiations  but has been quick to restore trade ties and macron has said repeatedly there is no alternative to the deal   french officials say iran is respecting the jcpoa and that  were the international atomic energy agency  iaea  to say otherwise  a mechanism exists to reimpose sanctions  the iaea is the body ensuring the accord is carried out  but the united states and iran quarreled over how tehran s nuclear activities should be policed at an iaea meeting on monday after a u s  call last month for wider inspections  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson argued on friday that washington must consider the full threat it says iran poses to the middle east when crafting its new policy toward tehran  a senior french diplomat underlined that the nuclear deal was achieved in large part because it was not linked to all the other grievances the united states may have had with iran  with europeans not on the same page as the trump administration  iranian officials say they have an opportunity to divide the   group that negotiated the deal with iran  a senior iranian diplomat and a former nuclear negotiator said he believed the europeans had no intention of following trump s overtly aggressive iran policy   they are wise  look at the region  crisis everywhere  from iraq to lebanon  iran is a reliable regional partner for europe  not only a trade partner but a political one as well   the diplomat said   european powers have been committed to the deal  the iaea has repeatedly confirmed iran s commitment to the deal  trump s insistence on his hostile policy towards iran will further deepen the gap among the   countries   the diplomat said
