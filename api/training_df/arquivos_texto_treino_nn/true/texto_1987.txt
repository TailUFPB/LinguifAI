washington  reuters    president donald trump is unlikely to win congressional support for funds he wants for a proposed u s  mexico border wall before an oct   deadline  meaning he may have to choose between backing down on a key campaign promise or shutting down the government  the second option was a politically dangerous one before  hurricane harvey tore through southern texas over the weekend and it now looks even riskier  at a campaign style rally in phoenix last week  trump  doubled down on his earlier demands that congress fund a mexican border wall in government spending legislation  adding a clear threat   if we have to close down our government  we re building that wall   he told supporters  since then  lawmakers who were already struggling to hammer out a stop gap federal spending bill before oct   to avoid a shutdown have had to factor in trump s threat as well  during his election campaign  trump insisted mexico would pay for the construction of the wall  which experts said could cost about   billion and take more than three years to complete  with mexico refusing to pay  trump has said since taking office in january that the wall will initially need u s  funding but that he will find a way to make mexico ultimately pay for it  a government shutdown would result if congress is unable to agree on a spending deal or if trump does not like the package and vetoes it  a veto would put trump in a dangerous position of rejecting a bill approved by his own party   shutting down the government would be a self destructive act  not to mention an act of political malpractice   republican representative charlie dent said in an interview  republicans firmly control the house of representatives  but have only a narrow majority in the senate  where at least eight democratic votes will be needed to pass a spending bill  democratic leaders firmly oppose the border wall and appear to be in no mood to do trump a favor by including funding now   democrats aren t feeling the heat over this   democratic strategist jim manley said  adding that  no democrat is going to be cowed  by trump s threat to shut down the government  without democratic support  current and former congressional aides from both parties said they expected senate republican leader mitch mcconnell  who has been sharply criticized by trump in recent weeks  to opt for a spending bill without wall funding to get legislation to the president s desk  dent said he expected the senate would  strip out     billion that had been set aside to start building the wall in a spending measure already passed by the house  and send it back to that chamber for another vote   dent voted for the wall funding the first time but said he would approve the spending measure without the wall money if that is what it takes to keep the government open  asked what congress would do if trump vetoes a spending  bill  dent said   we ll have to determine what our next steps will be  but i m hopeful he ll sign the bill   short term fix a stop gap spending bill would keep the government open for several months with no major changes to spending programs while lawmakers work out a longer term deal  the u s  congress has relied heavily on those short term fixes   known as continuing resolutions   for many years  federal assistance for those affected by devastating floods triggered by harvey could be attached to a new continuing resolution   but trump said on monday the hurricane recovery effort had not caused him to reconsider the option of a government shutdown   i think it has nothing to do with it  really  i think this is separate   he said at a news conference  he said he hoped a government shutdown would not be needed but declined to rule it out   if it s necessary  we ll have to see   if trump signs a short term extension without wall funding  it could delay the battle until december  when that legislation would likely expire  trump also said on monday that the border wall was  imperative  in order to tackle drug trafficking and crime as well as illegal immigration  the budget debate is also complicated by the need to finance support for victims of harvey  the worst storm to hit texas in more than  years  and find a deal on increasing the federal debt ceiling  which limits how much money the u s  government can borrow  one possible escape route for trump could be separate legislation for funding the wall  john cornyn  the no   republican in the senate  has introduced legislation that would authorize   billion over four years for border security  that would still need the support of at least eight senate democrats
