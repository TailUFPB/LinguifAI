san francisco  reuters    a bipartisan harvard university project aimed at protecting elections from hacking and propaganda will release its first set of recommendations today on how u s  elections can be defended from hacking attacks  the  page guidebook shown to reuters ahead of publication calls for campaign leaders to emphasize security from the start and insist on practices such as two factor authentication for access to email and documents and fully encrypted messaging via services including signal and wickr  the guidelines are intended to reduce risks in low budget local races as well as the high stakes congressional midterm contests next year  though most of the suggestions cost little or nothing to implement and will strike security professionals as common sense  notorious attacks including the leak of the emails of hillary clinton s campaign chair  john podesta  have succeeded because basic security practices were not followed  the ongoing effort is being led by the belfer center for science and international affairs  based at the harvard kennedy school of government  and is drawing on top security executives from companies including google  facebook and the cyber security firm crowdstrike  the guidebook will be available online  here    we heard from campaigns that there is nothing like this that exists   said debora plunkett  a  year veteran of the national security agency who joined the belfer center this year   we had security experts who understood security and election experts who understood campaigns  and both sides were eager to learn how the other part worked   plunkett said the goal was a digestible outline that was both realistic and helpful  and that leadership buy in was critical  the handbook is the first effort from the belfer center s four month old defending digital democracy program  whose leadership includes top campaign officials from both the republican and democratic parties  belfer co director eric rosenbach said another guidebook  scheduled for spring  will aim at state election officials  who oversee the actual vote counting and might also have to deal with propaganda intended to mislead or dissuade voters or sow suspicions about election integrity   deterring information operations is inherently a government responsibility  and the technology firms will decide how to act on their platforms  but state organizations are the victims   rosenbach said   the belfer center is also sending students out to the states to understand various voting technologies and procedures  the idea is to recommend best practices for each type of set up  which could include mandated software updates  paper back ups and audits  thus far  the project has offered no advice for the internet companies that are under fire for allowing russian advertising and false claims to polarize americans  that could come later  as could a broader program for quick sharing of threat information
