 reuters    in september   gilberto velasquez  a  year old house painter from el salvador  received life changing news  the u s  government had decided to shelve its deportation action against him   the move was part of a policy change initiated by then president barack obama in  to pull back from deporting immigrants who had formed deep ties in the united states and whom the government considered no threat to public safety  instead  the administration would prioritize illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes   last month  things changed again for the painter  who has lived in the united states illegally since  and has a u s  born child  he received news that the government wanted to put his deportation case back on the court calendar  citing another shift in priorities  this time by president donald trump   the trump administration has moved to reopen the cases of hundreds of illegal immigrants who  like velasquez  had been given a reprieve from deportation  according to government data and court documents reviewed by reuters and interviews with immigration lawyers   trump signaled in january that he planned to dramatically widen the net of illegal immigrants targeted for deportation  but his administration has not publicized its efforts to reopen immigration cases   it represents one of the first concrete examples of the crackdown promised by trump and is likely to stir fears among tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who thought they were safe from deportation   while cases were reopened during the obama administration as well  it was generally only if an immigrant had committed a serious crime  immigration attorneys say  the trump administration has sharply increased the number of cases it is asking the courts to reopen  and its targets appear to include at least some people who have not committed any crimes since their cases were closed   between march  and may   prosecutors moved to reopen   cases  according to a reuters  analysis of data from the executive office of immigration review  or eoir  the obama administration filed  similar motions during the same period in     jennifer elzea  a spokeswoman for u s  immigration and customs enforcement  confirmed the agency was now filing motions with immigration courts to reopen cases where illegal immigrants had  since been arrested for or convicted of a crime    it is not possible to tell from the eoir data how many of the cases the trump administration is seeking to reopen involve immigrants who committed crimes after their cases were closed   attorneys interviewed by reuters say indeed some of the cases being reopened are because immigrants were arrested for serious crimes  but they are also seeing cases involving people who haven t committed crimes or who were cited for minor violations  like traffic tickets    this is a sea change  said attorney david leopold  former president of the american immigration lawyers association   before  if someone did something after the case was closed out that showed that person was a threat  then it would be reopened  now they are opening cases just because they want to deport people    elzea said the agency reviews cases   to see if the basis for prosecutorial discretion is still appropriate    after obama announced his shift toward targeting illegal immigrants who had committed serious crimes  prosecutors embraced their new discretion to close cases   between january  and trump s inauguration on jan    the government shelved some   cases  according to reuters  data analysis  these so called  administrative closures  did not extend full legal status to those whose cases were closed  but they did remove the threat of imminent deportation   trump signed an executive order overturning the obama era policy on jan    under the new guidelines  while criminals remain the highest priority for deportation  anyone in the country illegally is a potential target   in cases reviewed by reuters  the administration explicitly cited trump s executive order in  separate motions as a reason to put the immigrant back on the court docket   for a link to an excerpted document  tmsnrt rs    since immigration cases aren t generally public  reuters was able to review only cases made available by attorneys   in the  reopened cases examined by reuters     involved immigrants who  according to their attorneys  had not been in trouble with the law since their cases were closed    two of the cases involved serious crimes committed after their cases were closed  domestic violence and driving under the influence    at least six of the cases involved minor infractions  including speeding after having unpaid traffic tickets  or driving without a valid license  according to the attorneys   in velasquez s case  for example  he was cited for driving without a license in tennessee  where illegal immigrants cannot get licenses  he said    i respect the law and just dedicate myself to my work   he said   i don t understand why this is happening    motions to reopen closed cases have been filed in  states  with the highest numbers in california  florida and virginia  according to reuters  review of eoir data  the bulk of the examples reviewed by reuters were two dozen motions sent over the span of a couple days by the new orleans ice office   sally joyner  an immigration attorney in memphis  tennessee said one of her central american clients  who crossed the border with her children in   was allowed to stay in the united states after the government filed a motion to close her case in december    since crossing the border  the woman has not been arrested or had trouble with law enforcement  said joyner  who asked that her client s name not be used because of the pending legal action   nevertheless  on march   ice filed a two page motion to reopen the case against the woman and her children  when joyner queried ice  an official said the agency had been notified that her client had a criminal history in el salvador  according to documents seen by reuters   the woman had been arrested for selling pumpkin seeds as an unauthorized street vendor  government documents show u s  authorities knew about the arrest before her case was closed   dana marks  president of the national association of immigration judges  said that revisiting previously closed matters will add to a record backlog of   pending immigration cases    if we have to go back and review all of those decisions that were already made  it clearly generates more work   she said   it s a judicial do over
