 reuters    the rollout of a tax cut plan being promoted by u s  president donald trump and senior congressional republicans was delayed on wednesday as groups of lawmakers and special interests dug in on key provisions  insisting on changes  here are some of the most contentious issues in the tax debate  which likely will play out over the coming weeks and months before it can garner enough support to pass congress and be sent to trump to sign into law   k   republicans are eyeing new limits on how much money americans can pump each year into their  k  retirement accounts on a pre tax basis  lower limits for tax free contributions would produce new revenue to help republicans pay for tax cuts they have proposed for high income earners  corporations and wealthy families  inheritances  taxpayers now can channel    of income tax free into  k s  republican tax writers initially proposed lowering that cap to    and  after pushback  that number has been in flux  firms that manage  k  plans  wall street firms that execute trades for them and the  million americans who have  k  accounts could be hurt by such a change  mortgages  americans can now deduct mortgage interest from their incomes if they itemize deductions  the plan does not call for changing that directly but it does call for doubling the standard deduction  a separate tax return line that determines eligibility for itemizing  doubling that would mean fewer americans itemizing   and fewer deducting mortgage interest  critics say doubling the standard deduction would make the mortgage interest deduction a benefit for only higher income taxpayers  the national association of home builders has declared opposition to the republican plan and proposed creating a new  non itemized tax credit for mortgage interest  salt  a proposal to eliminate a popular tax deduction for state and local tax  salt  payments has threatened to derail the republican plan  democratic and republican lawmakers from high tax states  such as new york  california and new jersey  oppose this change because it would hit their constituents hardest  real estate interests have fought for an exemption of state and local property taxes  which is expected to make it into the bill  with a cap  some salt state republicans say they would be satisfied with an adequate property tax deduction  others have said they will push to preserve income tax deductibility  pass throughs  republicans want to cut the tax rate for  pass through  businesses  such as partnerships and sole proprietorships  to  percent from as high as   percent  winners from this would include many pass throughs that are small mom and pop businesses but it would also benefit big enterprises  such as hedge funds and real estate partnerships  losers would be upper middle class wage earners unable to channel their incomes through pass through structures  some tax experts warn slashing the pass through rate could unleash new tax dodging schemes to enable americans to do just that  run their personal incomes through pass through structures such as partnerships  corporations and sole proprietorships  tax negotiators are examining ways to limit what types of professional partnerships would qualify for a new pass through rate  they also are weighing a proposal to limit the new rate to only  percent of business income  business interest  another change being evaluated by republicans is ending or further restricting tax deductibility of business interest  this would mean business borrowers could no longer write off the interest they pay on debts  businesses have formed a group  called the build coalition  to oppose the provision  members include abbott laboratories  abt n   owens illinois  oi n   s p global  spgi n  and lobbying groups for private equity firms  farmers  mortgage bankers  real estate investment trusts  casinos and equipment leasing groups  tax writers are looking at ways to exempt small businesses and allow them to continue to deduct business interest on debts  deficit  not long ago  most republicans stood firmly against increasing the federal budget deficit and the national debt but analysts say their tax plan would hugely expand both  washington was expected to collect    trillion in taxes in  but spend   trillion  leaving a deficit of   billion  previous deficits have piled up a national debt of   trillion  the trump tax cut plan would reduce federal tax revenues by    trillion in the first  years and by    trillion in the  years after that  adding greatly to the deficit and the debt  according to the tax policy center  a non partisan think tank  the plan would give a small economic boost but soon be overwhelmed by the rising federal debt burden  the center said  helping the rich  the tax plan has struggled since it was unveiled as a rough framework in september with criticism from democrats and social activists  who say it is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations that hurts or neglects others  on that issue  the tax policy center study said   in   all income groups would see their average taxes fall  but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases  those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts
