 washington los angeles new york  reuters    when president donald trump signed an executive order last week to sweep away obama era climate change regulations  he said it would end america s  war on coal   usher in a new era of energy production and put miners back to work   but the biggest consumers of u s  coal   power generating companies   remain unconvinced   reuters surveyed  utilities with operations in the  states that sued former president barack obama s administration to block its clean power plan  the main target of trump s executive order  the bulk of them have no plans to alter their multi billion dollar  years long shift away from coal  suggesting demand for the fuel will keep falling despite trump s efforts   the utilities gave many reasons  mainly economic  natural gas   coal s top competitor   is cheap and abundant  solar and wind power costs are falling  state environmental laws remain in place  and trump s regulatory rollback may not survive legal challenges   meanwhile  big investors aligned with the global push to fight climate change   such as the norwegian sovereign wealth fund   have been pressuring u s  utilities in which they own stakes to cut coal use    i m not going to build new coal plants in today s environment   said ben fowke  ceo of xcel energy  which operates in eight states and uses coal for about  percent of its electricity production   and if i m not going to build new ones  eventually there won t be any    reuters recommendswindow closing for republican stealth assault on regulationsafter australian cyclone  coking coal spikes as china chases u s  supplies of the  utilities contacted by reuters   said trump s order would have no impact on their investment plans  five said they were reviewing the implications of the order  six gave no response  just one said it would prolong the life of some of its older coal fired power units   north dakota s basin electric power cooperative was the sole utility to identify an immediate positive impact of trump s order on the outlook for coal    we re in the situation where the executive order takes a lot of pressure off the decisions we had to make in the near term  such as whether to retrofit and retire older coal plants   said dale niezwaag  a spokesman for basin electric   but trump can be a one termer  so the reprieve out there is short    trump s executive order triggered a review aimed at killing the clean power plan  the obama era law would have required states  by   to collectively cut carbon emissions from existing power plants by  percent from  levels  it was designed as a primary strategy in u s  efforts to fight global climate change   the u s  coal industry  without increases in domestic demand  would need to rely on export markets for growth  shipments of u s  metallurgical coal  used in the production of steel  have recently shown up in china following a two year hiatus   in part to offset banned shipments from north korea and temporary delays from cyclone hit australian producers   coal had been the primary fuel source for u s  power plants for the last century  but its use has fallen more than a third since  after advancements in drilling technology unlocked new reserves of natural gas   hundreds of aging coal fired power plants have been retired or retrofitted  huge coal mining companies like peabody energy corp and arch coal fell into bankruptcy  and production last year hit its lowest point since    the slide appears likely to continue  u s  power companies now expect to retire or convert more than   megawatts of coal fired plants in  after shutting almost   mw last year  according to u s  energy information administration and thomson reuters data   luke popovich  a spokesman for the national mining association  acknowledged trump s efforts would not return the coal industry to its  glory days   but offered some hope    there may not be immediate plans for utilities to bring on more coal  but the future is always uncertain in this market   he said   many of the companies in the reuters survey said they had been focused on reducing carbon emissions for a decade or more and were hesitant to change direction based on shifting political winds in washington d c    utility planning typically takes place over much longer periods than presidential terms of office   berkshire hathaway inc owned pacificorp spokesman tom gauntt said   several utilities also cited falling costs for wind and solar power  which are now often as cheap as coal or natural gas  thanks in part to government subsidies for renewable energy   in the meantime  activist investors have increased pressure on u s  utilities to shun coal   in the last year  norway s sovereign wealth fund  the world s largest  has excluded more than a dozen u s  power companies   including xcel  american electric power co inc and nrg energy inc   from its investments because of their reliance on coal fired power   another eight companies  including southern co and northwestern corp  are  under observation  by the fund   wyoming based coal miner cloud peak energy said it doesn t blame utilities for being lukewarm to trump s order    for eight years  if you were a utility running coal  you got the hell kicked out of you   said richard reavey  a spokesman for the company   are you going to turn around tomorrow and say   let s buy lots of coal plants   pretty unlikely
