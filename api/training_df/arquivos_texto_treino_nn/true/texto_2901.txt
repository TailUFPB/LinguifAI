chicago  reuters    a democratic plan to end illinois  crippling two year budget stalemate is poised to be enacted by the state house of representatives on thursday  but the nearly   page package leaves gaping financial holes unresolved  the fiscal  budget plan  which has drawn both democratic and republican support in the legislature  does not guarantee funding for public schools to open on time next month  the plan identifies only enough funding to pay down roughly a third of the state s record   billion unpaid bill backlog   in addition  no substantial progress was made to reduce illinois  paralyzing   billion unfunded pension liability   the state s pension contribution is set to consume more than    billion of the state s   billion budget in the fiscal year that began july   illinois on thursday could end its dubious status as the only state to ever go multiple years without a full operating budget if the democratic led legislative chamber overturns the vetoes from republican governor bruce rauner  one of the bills increases the state s personal income tax from   percent to   percent and corporate income tax from   percent to  percent   moody s investors service issued a warning on wednesday that even if the house follows identical senate action monday and  overrides rauner s vetoes  the nation s fifth largest state risks a credit rating downgrade to junk because of unaddressed fiscal woes  moody s said the budget plan falls short of adequately addressing pensions and the backlog of unpaid bills   it s not clear to me that they won t quickly find themselves with a comparable backlog and more long term bonded debt   said moody s analyst ted hampton  laurence msall  president of the civic federation  a chicago based government finance watchdog  said the bill does not provide stability   what rating agencies are pointing to  even with the tax increase if the general assembly overrides the governor and with the spending plan as approved  the state still has severe financial challenges going forward   he said   drafters of the budget package inserted language that ties release of billions of dollars for k  education to enactment of a school funding overhaul that rauner has called a  bailout  for chicago s cash strapped school system  the house and senate have passed the funding revamp  but rauner has threatened to veto it  if republicans and democrats do not reconcile their differences before the first state payment goes to schools in august  about a dozen financially struggling public school systems might not open for classes next month  said roger eddy  executive director of the illinois association of school boards   we re talking about children that are going to be affected by this stalemate at this point  that is absolutely not an exaggeration  this is real  and it s going to happen   eddy told reuters  the budget impasse also resulted in a halt of construction projects and illinois suspended sales of powerball and mega millions tickets  in another key area the state s    billion backlog of unpaid bills the plan authorizes only   billion of general obligation bonds  as well as    billion in borrowings and transfers from other state funds for that purpose  sufficient money exists only to support   billion of   billion in authorized bonding  which in turn would generate   billion in federal matching medicaid dollars for unpaid bills  the budget also purports to save   million from pension changes  although there were slim details on how those savings would be realized   the pension reform in  the legislation  doesn t look like it s really revolutionary or will move the needle in any big way   hampton said   this story corrects fourth paragraph to indicate house will only undertake veto override votes
