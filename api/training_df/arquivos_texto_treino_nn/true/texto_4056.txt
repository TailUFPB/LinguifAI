washington  reuters    republican lawmakers launched the next round in their fight against federal regulation on wednesday  helped by at least one democrat  as the u s  senate began work on legislation to change nearly every step agencies take in creating and applying new rules  republicans have said they deem lightening federal regulation  which they consider costly and burdensome  as much a priority as overhauling healthcare and rewriting the tax code   for most of president donald trump s first  days  the republican led congress attacked regulation by passing resolutions to wipe some of former democratic president barack obama s rules off the books under the congressional review act  trump also ordered agencies to scrap two existing rules every time they enact a new one  just before trump s january inauguration  the house of representatives passed the  regulatory accountability act   combining a half dozen bills to radically change government regulation  on wednesday  senator rob portman  a ohio republican  and senator heidi heitkamp  a north dakota democrat  introduced a version of the act for that chamber  if it passes  the bill will be combined with the house version for trump to sign into law  the bill would bring  our outdated federal regulatory process into the  century by requiring agencies to use the best scientific and economic data available  strengthening checks and balances  and giving the public a voice in the process   portman said in a statement  it requires stricter cost benefit analysis  use of the  best available science  to craft rules  and reviews of regulations  according to a summary  the bill diverges from the house version on what is known as the  chevron deference   based on a supreme court ruling that courts should defer to agencies  interpretations of statutes governing their rulemaking  the house legislation eliminates the chevron deference  while the senate one creates a judicial review process where courts can decide if agencies comply with the law and then remand non compliant rules to agencies  courts would also review factual determinations used in drafting rules costing more than   billion annually  environmental and labor groups said the senate bill could block needed new regulations and weaken existing ones    this bill would tilt the scales in favor of polluters at the public s expense   said scott slesinger  legislative director of the natural resources defense council   it would make it virtually impossible to safeguard the public from dirty air  unsafe drinking water and other health threats
