washington london  reuters    the republican tax bill unveiled last week in the u s  congress could disrupt the global supply chains of large  multinational companies by slapping a  percent tax on cross border transactions they routinely make between related business units    european multinationals  some of which currently pay little u s  tax on u s  profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of u s  earnings to their home countries or other low tax jurisdictions  could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law  according to some tax experts  others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties  the world trade organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries  the proposed tax  tucked deep in the  page bill backed by president donald trump  caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals  as well as whether congress is likely ever to vote on it  reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups  none would comment directly on the proposal  with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package  the proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by house of representatives republicans on thursday  which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code  whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain  with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead  the house package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business  however  the corporate tax part  experts said  included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion  they said the  percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so called transfer pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods  services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units  under global standards  those prices should resemble those available on the open market  however  if a foreign parent charges u s  affiliates inflated price  it can reduce its u s  tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower tax country  reducing the entire corporation s overall tax costs   clearly there s a transfer pricing issue and something should be done   said steven rosenthal  senior fellow at the tax policy center  a nonpartisan washington think tank   i would view this  percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem  and the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit  and sometimes they hit what you don t want to hit   said rosenthal  former legislation counsel at congress s joint tax committee  under the proposal  u s  business units that import products  pay royalties or other tax deductible  non interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a  percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their u s  business and subject to u s  taxes  as proposed  the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from u s  units to foreign affiliates exceeding   million  the rule would not take effect until after   european companies that sell foreign made products into the u s  market through local distribution units could be among those most affected  said michael mundaca  co director of the national tax department at the accounting firm ernst   young  such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice   first if they paid the excise tax in the united states and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new u s  tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties   that would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force  of the excise tax  said mundaca  a former u s  treasury department assistant secretary for tax policy  he said european officials would be registering concern   i am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the u s  treasury looking for some explanation     and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations   gavin ekins  an economist at the tax foundation  a conservative think tank  predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay u s  corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the united states  those include profits on activities conducted overseas  like manufacturing or research  which are also subject to foreign income taxes  the u s  corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to  percent from  percent if the house bill becomes law  the promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the united states  may well outweigh international concerns  the entire republican tax package is projected to add    trillion over  years to the   trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall  it is expected to bring about   billion over  years  according to a summary of the republican proposal distributed last week  still  as the tax debate heats up  foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it  with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well  there is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice   it was unclear  for example  from the bill s language how companies should calculate income  effectively connected  to their u s  business  tax foundation s ekins said   you don t know what profit is included when you choose  effectively connected income  and don t know the formula   he said   is it just for that product line  all the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source   the house tax committee was scheduled to begin considering amendments to the republican tax bill on monday
