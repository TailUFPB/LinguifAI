washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday seized on the deadly new york city truck attack to step up demands for stricter u s  immigration laws  asking congress to end a visa program that let the uzbek suspect into the country and saying he might send him to guantanamo bay  in a day of harsh recriminations over tuesday s attack that killed eight people in america s largest city  trump appeared to assign some blame for an incident that authorities have labeled as terrorism to top senate democrat chuck schumer  who accused trump of politicizing a national tragedy   trump said he would consider sending the suspect  identified by authorities as sayfullo saipov  to the military prison at the u s  naval base at guantanamo bay  cuba  which his democratic predecessor barack obama tried but failed to shut  no detainee has been sent to the guantanamo prison since   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders later told reporters that trump considers saipov an  enemy combatant   a designation that would curtail his legal rights  trump called the suspect  this animal  and lambasted the u s  justice system for terrorism suspects as  a joke  and  a laughingstock   since taking office in january  trump has sought to increase deportations of illegal immigrations and limit legal immigration  the department of homeland security said saipov entered the united states in  through the so called diversity visa program  designed to provide a path to u s  residency for citizens from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the united states  authorities said saipov drove a rented truck along a bike path in lower manhattan  mowing down cyclists and pedestrians  police shot and wounded saipov before arresting him  trump reprised what has been his stance as a white house candidate and as president   that tougher immigration laws should be a first line of defense against such attacks   i m going to ask congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program   trump told reporters at the white house    we have to get much tougher   he said   we have to get much smarter  and we have to get much less politically correct  we re so politically correct that we re afraid to do anything   schumer helped create the diversity visa program in  when he in the house of representatives  but he was also part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who crafted an immigration bill in  that would have done away with the program  that bill was passed by the senate but killed by the republican led house  the program  via a lottery  selects up to   people per year who receive u s  visas  and eventually permanent residence in the united states  those selected undergo u s  security checks before being allowed to immigrate   the terrorist came into our country through what is called the  diversity visa lottery program   a chuck schumer beauty  i want merit based   trump wrote on twitter  sanders said later that trump does not blame schumer for the attack and would  love  to work with the senator on tougher immigration laws  trump on wednesday also renewed his call for a  merit based  visa system   which would favor the highly skilled   and for ending  chain migration   which allows legal immigrants to apply for relatives abroad to come to the united states  trump said there were   people that came in or potentially came in  with saipov  asked if legislation to end the visa program would be taken up  no   senate republican john cornyn told reporters that congress must first pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought into the country as children   and then the next thing we need to do is turn to our legal immigration system and see how we can change it   trump accused congressional democrats of blocking immigration legislation that would make the nation safer   we have a lot of good bills in there  we re being stopped by democrats because they re obstructionists  and honestly  they don t want to do what s right for our country   trump said  both the senate and the house are controlled by trump s fellow republicans  republican senator lindsey graham criticized the trump administration for not declaring saipov  who remained hospitalized after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer on tuesday  as an  enemy combatant    it s ridiculous to believe that one day of interviews in a hospital tells us all we need to know about saipov s terrorist ties   graham said in a statement  the complaint filed against saipov said he had waived his rights and agreed to speak to investigators without an attorney present  as a presidential candidate  trump called for a total ban on muslims entering the country as a counter terrorism measure  courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the united states by people from several muslim majority countries  sanders said the white house has not ruled out adding uzbekistan to the list of countries named in the travel ban  in a speech on the senate floor  schumer said that  instead of politicizing and dividing america  which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy   trump  should be bringing us together and focusing on the real solution  anti terrorism funding  which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget
