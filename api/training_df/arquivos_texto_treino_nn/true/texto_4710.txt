washington  reuters    the top u s  senate democrat on thursday pledged to pursue a procedural hurdle to try to block the confirmation of republican president donald trump s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  a move that could provoke a nasty partisan fight and change the way the senate does business  republicans hold a   majority in the  member senate  leaving democrats with an uphill battle to prevent gorsuch s confirmation  but senate rules enable democrats to insist on  votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up or down vote on confirming gorsuch    to the lifetime job on the nation s highest court  trump has called on senate republicans to change the long standing rules in order to allow a simple majority vote on confirmation if democrats mount a filibuster  if eventually confirmed as expected  the federal appeals court judge from colorado would restore a conservative majority on the nine seat high court  fulfilling one of trump s top campaign promises  as the judiciary committee completed its fourth and final day of gorsuch s confirmation hearing  the spotlight turned to whether he gains the support of vulnerable democratic senators facing re election in   the support of eight democrats would short circuit a filibuster   after careful deliberation  i have concluded that i cannot support judge neil gorsuch s nomination to the supreme court   democratic leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor  a day after gorsuch finished marathon judiciary committee testimony    he will have to earn  votes for confirmation  my vote will be  no   and i urge my colleagues to do the same   white house spokesman sean spicer called schumer s remarks  truly disappointing  and urged him to abandon the filibuster threat  saying it was the type of partisanship americans have grown tired of  spicer said trump  in light of schumer s comments  would discuss senate confirmation strategy with republican majority leader mitch mcconnell  conservative activists have said they have identified  possible  yes  votes for gorsuch among democrats seeking  re election in states trump won in the  presidential  election  democratic senator bob casey  up for re election in  in one of those states  pennsylvania  announced he would vote against gorsuch and support a filibuster   i don t believe that judge gorsuch  his judicial approach  would ensure fairness for workers and families in pennsylvania   casey said  expressing  serious concerns about judge gorsuch s rigid and restrictive judicial philosophy   casey said he was unaware of any discussions among democrats about a deal to advance gorsuch s nomination in return for a guarantee from republicans that the next supreme court nomination would need  votes to proceed to a senate confirmation vote  democratic senator tammy baldwin  facing re election in wisconsin next year  also opposes the nomination  a spokesman said  west virginia s joe manchin and florida s bill nelson  democrats facing voters next year  remain undecided on gorsuch  their spokesmen told reuters  several judiciary committee democrats  including its top democrat dianne feinstein  declined to comment on whether they would support a filibuster  another vote potentially up for grabs is that of michael bennet  a democrat from gorsuch s home state of colorado  he is not up for re election next year and his state voted for democrat hillary clinton in   he introduced gorsuch to the judiciary committee on monday  but did not commit to supporting confirmation  promising an  open mind   schumer said if gorsuch cannot attract  votes   the answer isn t to change the rules  it s to change the nominee   schumer said gorsuch failed to convince him he would be  an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint from executive overreach  or that he would be a neutral justice  free from the biases of politics and ideology   democratic committee members on tuesday and wednesday pressed gorsuch on rulings he participated in that they said showed a inclination to decide in favor of corporate interests and against what they called  the little guy   democrats  expressed frustration about his refusal to answer questions on whether supreme court rulings favoring abortion  contraception and gay rights were correctly decided   the judiciary committee was due to vote on the nomination on april   mcconnell planned a full senate confirmation vote before senators begin a recess on april   on thursday  the committee heard about six hours of testimony from witnesses supporting and opposing gorsuch  including representatives of the american bar association  the lawyers group that evaluates such nominees and gave gorsuch its highest rating of  well qualified    feinstein noted that merrick garland  democratic former president barack obama s supreme court nominee who the republican led senate last year refused to consider for confirmation  also earned the aba s highest rating   another witness was jeff perkins  father of an autistic son who gorsuch ruled against in  in a special education dispute using legal reasoning repudiated by the supreme court in a related case on wednesday  perkins said gorsuch set a  new low standard  for educational benefits school districts must offer disabled students   i was devastated   perkins said of gorsuch s ruling
