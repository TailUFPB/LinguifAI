washington  reuters    here are highlights of a reuters interview on wednesday with u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  on estimates that the republican tax plan could increase federal deficit by    trillion  the     trillion    without getting too deep into the details   represents incorporating the bill that we ve always intended writing in the ways and means committee in the house  which does have macroeconomic feedback  we are convinced that the models are really clear  people will change their behavior  businesses will change their behavior if taxes change    that     trillion  number is sort of in the midrange of the growth we expect of the models we ve seen    we believe that we ll get faster economic growth  that will exceed this     trillion   so we do not anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform    the obamacare taxes will have to stay  we passed this in the house but it didn t get through the senate  so as a result of that  we can t get rid of those obamacare taxes in this tax reform    i think there is a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers in those states so that they are net winners in tax reform as well   on why republicans aim to pass a tax package by year s end  the reason we re trying to do it with this timeline is we want to get a  percent  gdp growth  economy  we re sort of limping along  growing between  and  percent  and that is so far underneath our potential as a country    i really believe getting this done now means we are going to have a very good    on whether the house will pass legislation to protect  dreamer  immigrants this year  i don t know when we re going to do it  we re having lots of discussions on how to do it and the timing is something that s just open debate    i want to do it     the goal is  we want to fix this and we re working on it  and we want to make sure that we do it in such a way that we don t have the same problem down the road   that means border security and interior enforcement
