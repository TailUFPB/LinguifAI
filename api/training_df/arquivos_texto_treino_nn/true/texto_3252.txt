new york san juan  reuters    puerto rico s governor on monday said the island s vote in favor of becoming a u s  state  despite low voter turnout and widespread boycotts  was  a fair and open  process that u s  congress should act upon  an island wide referendum on sunday favored statehood in a  percent landslide  though voter turnout reached just  percent as opponents of governor ricardo rossello s push to become a state boycotted the vote  the non binding plebiscite is not expected to sway the u s  congress  which would have to agree to make puerto rico a state  currently a u s  territory  the island is struggling with   billion in debt and a  percent poverty rate  and is not viewed as a priority in washington    rossello  who campaigned on a push for statehood  said in a telephone interview with reuters that he will go to the u s  capital this week to urge federal lawmakers to begin the process of admitting puerto rico into the union   we will make sure this becomes an issue   rossello said  the vote comes at a critical time for puerto rico  whose hazy status   which dates to its  acquisition by the united states from spain   has contributed to its ongoing economic crisis  last month  the island filed the biggest municipal bankruptcy in u s  history  its woes make statehood even more urgent  rossello said   statehood brings stability  allows us to have fewer rule changes from congress  provides resources to our people   he said   sunday s referendum  which cost puerto rico between   million and   million  according to government estimates  was the island s fifth since    and the third in which pro statehood sentiments triumphed  though none have moved congress to act   if the u s  is going to go to venezuela and cuba and afghanistan and push democracy abroad  they ve got to do the same  with their own territories  he said   but puerto ricans are skeptical the island s status will change   this has all been a waste of time   said taxi driver felix salasarar    adding that federal lawmakers will  look at the voter turnout and say   where s the will of the people     working against the governor may be a perception in washington that sunday s vote was not fair   the u s  department of justice in april called on rossello to change ballot language that initially did not give voters an option to remain a u s  territory   rossello told reuters he made that decision because the territory option   which rossello equates to colonialism   already lost in a previous status referendum  in   making this year s vote a choice between statehood and independence   the justice department viewed the language as politically unfair to millions of puerto ricans who favor territory status  prompting rossello to add the territory option  but the justice department never reviewed or approved the new language  to be sure  sunday s results do not reflect the true nature of puerto ricans  views on statehood  which are fairly evenly divided between those who favor it and those who do not  based upon historical election results  statehooder rossello  for example  won his own election with just  percent of the vote  but that  the governor said  is how democracy works   everybody knows that those who go through the voting process have a louder voice than those who don t   he said  carolina santos  a single working mother struggling to make her mortgage payments  said bankrupt puerto rico has more important things to worry about than a status vote   maybe we should focus more on fixing our financial problems and our schools   she said
