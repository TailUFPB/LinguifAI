washington  reuters    the fate of president donald trump s order to ban travelers from six predominantly muslim nations  blocked by federal courts  may soon be in the hands of the conservative majority supreme court  where his appointee neil gorsuch could help settle the matter  after the richmond based  u s  circuit court of appeals declined on thursday to lift a maryland federal judge s injunction halting the temporary ban ordered by trump on march   attorney general jeff sessions said the administration would appeal to the supreme court  a second regional federal appeals court heard arguments on may  in seattle in the administration s appeal of a decision by a federal judge in hawaii also to block the ban  a ruling by the  u s  circuit court of appeals is pending  the justice department has not made clear when the administration would make its formal appeal or whether it would wait for the  circuit ruling before appealing   if they take it up  the justices would be called upon to decide whether courts should always defer to the president over allowing certain people to enter the country  especially when national security is the stated reason for an action as in this case  they also would have to decide if trump s order violated the u s  constitution s bar against the government favoring one religion over another  as the ban s challengers assert  gorsuch s april confirmation by the republican led senate over democratic opposition restored the court s   majority  which means that if all the conservative justices side with the administration the ban would be restored regardless of how the four liberal justices vote  during his senate confirmation hearing  gorsuch was questioned about trump s criticism of judges who ruled against the ban  gorsuch avoided commenting on the legal issue  saying only that he would not be  rubber stamp  for any president  while the justices could decide in the coming weeks whether to hear the case  they likely would not hold oral arguments until late in the year  with a ruling sometime after that  a final resolution may not come until perhaps a year after trump issued the executive order  the justices are not required to hear any case  but this one meets important criteria cited by experts  including that it would be the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction   the administration could file an emergency application seeking to put the order into effect while the litigation on its legality continues  at least five justices must agree for any such request to be granted  while the court could split   along ideological lines  it also is possible some conservative justices could join the liberals in overturning the travel ban  libertarian law professor ilya somin of george mason university said   conservatives in other contexts often take a hard line against any kind of government discrimination  based  on race or religion or the like  even if the motivation may be benign  also conservatives have concerns about government infringements on religion   somin said  the  circuit said the ban s challengers  including refugee groups  in the case argued by the american civil liberties union were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violated the constitution s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any religion  in the   ruling  three republican appointed judges dissented  the republican president s march  order  replacing an earlier jan   one also blocked by the courts  called for barring people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days while the government implements stricter visa screening  it also called for suspending all refugee admissions for  days  the travel ban s challengers may take some comfort from the appeals court ruling s reliance on a concurring opinion in a  supreme court immigration case by justice anthony kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the court s liberals in big cases  in the  case  kennedy wrote that in the immigration context  the government s actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith   as with any opinion by justice kennedy  i think the million dollar question is just what he meant in his concurrence  and this may be a perfect case to find out   university of texas school of law professor stephen vladeck said  in thursday s ruling   circuit chief judge roger gregory wrote that the plaintiffs had shown there was  ample evidence  of bad faith  which gave the green light to probe whether there were reasons for the order other than the administration s stated national security rationale  the administration has argued the temporary travel ban was needed to guard against terrorist attacks  gregory wrote that the order uses  vague words of national security  but in context drips with religious intolerance  animus  and discrimination   trump during the presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states
