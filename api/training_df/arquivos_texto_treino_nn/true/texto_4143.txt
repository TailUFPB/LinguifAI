new york washington  reuters    when raj  a sri lankan fisherman  sought refuge in the united states in   he had precisely the kind of fear of returning home that u s  asylum laws require  in   he was kidnapped by the separatist rebel group the tamil tigers and had to pay   to secure his release  according to raj  his lawyer and court records reviewed by reuters  the group then demanded more money  which he could not pay after a tsunami destroyed his house and fishing boat   raj    who asked that only his first name be used because of the sensitive nature of his situation  decided to flee  he boarded a plane using a false canadian passport and requested asylum upon arriving in the united states   there was a catch  however  u s  laws ban immigration by anyone who has provided  material support  to terrorists  and the tamil tigers are designated as a terrorist group by the united states  a judge ruled that raj s ransom payment to them constituted material support   read an excerpt of the letter petitioning the u s  government for a waiver in this case  tmsnrt rs   ultimately  raj was granted asylum in  because of rules that allow for waivers for people who provided aid to terrorists under duress  he now lives in san diego  california  works in an indian restaurant and hopes to become a citizen   read an excerpt of the letter from the u s  government granting the waiver  tmsnrt rs    raj said it was  a big relief  when he finally received his green card around a year after receiving asylum   i am not a terrorist   he said   now the trump administration is debating whether to rescind the waivers that have allowed raj  and tens of thousands of others  to immigrate to the united states in the past decade  see graphic on waivers  tmsnrt rs    some immigration hardliners are concerned the exemptions could allow terrorists to slip into the country  u s  president donald trump directed the secretaries of state and homeland security  in consultation with the attorney general  to consider abolishing the waivers in an executive order in march  that directive was overshadowed by the same order s temporary ban on all refugees and on travelers from six mostly muslim nations    the bans on refugees and travel were challenged in lawsuits  and their implementation has been suspended pending full hearings in court  but the waiver review was not included in the court rulings  so that part of the order remains in effect  rules governing the waivers have been hammered out over the last decade with both democratic and republican support  but in recent years they have drawn fire from some conservative lawmakers  including attorney general jeff sessions when he was a senator  a state department official said this week the department is working with dhs to review the waivers and is  looking at actually pulling them back in accordance with the executive order    the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  declined to give details on the timing of the review or its likely outcome  the department of justice declined to comment  following the sept     attacks  congress expanded the definition of who could be considered a terrorist and what constituted  material support  to terrorism in rules now known as the terrorism related inadmissibility grounds   those changes ensnared people like raj who were coerced or inadvertently provided support to terrorists  as well as members of persecuted ethnic groups that supported rebel organizations  and even u s  allied groups fighting against authoritarian regimes   without an exemption  members of kurdish groups that battled saddam hussein s forces in iraq  hmong groups who fought alongside u s  troops in vietnam  or some cubans who fought fidel castro s regime would not be allowed to immigrate to the united states   under the exemptions  u s  authorities have the discretion to grant people residency in the united states after they have passed background checks and are found to pose no threat to national security  congress initially passed waivers to the terrorism bars in  with bipartisan support  and in the years that followed both the bush and obama administrations added additional groups and circumstances to the exemptions  u s  citizenship and immigration services  uscis  has granted nearly   trig exemptions in total over the last decade  according to the latest data available  which goes through september   the state department also grants trig exemptions  but a spokesman could not provide data on how many  refugees from myanmar are the largest single group of beneficiaries to date of trig exemptions granted by uscis  with more than   waivers  the wave of myanmar refugees dates to   when u s  secretary of state condoleezza rice ruled that thousands of members of the karen ethnic group  then living in a camp in thailand  could resettle in the united states  even if they had supported the political wing of an armed group that had fought the country s military regime   one high profile supporter of scrapping the waivers is  house of representatives judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte  a republican from virginia whose staffers were instrumental in drafting trump s travel ban  goodlatte told reuters he was  pleased that the trump administration is reviewing the dangerous policy   groups favoring stricter immigration laws have also applauded the review  rosemary jenks  director of government relations at numbersusa  called the waivers  a potential security risk     i personally don t think that a bureaucrat should be deciding how much support for terrorism is enough to be barred   she said  a uscis spokeswoman  when asked if a recipient of an exemption had ever been involved in a terrorism related case after arriving in the united states  referred reuters to the federal bureau of investigation  which said it was a question for the state department to answer   i don t know of any cases where beneficiaries of exemptions have gotten into trouble after arriving   the state department official said  noting that the department does not typically track people after they arrive in the united states  trump s order to review the waivers  is another example of an attempt to address a non existent phantom problem   said eric schwartz  who served in the state department during the obama administration  schwartz and immigration advocates say the waivers are granted after lengthy review and are extremely difficult to get    these are case by case exemptions for people who represent no threat to the united states but rather have been caught in the most unfortunate of circumstances   said schwartz  for raj  the initial ruling that his ransom payment supported a terrorist group led to more than two years in u s  immigration detention  followed by more years of electronic monitoring  his waiver allowed him to bring his wife to the united states after nine years apart  she now studies nursing
