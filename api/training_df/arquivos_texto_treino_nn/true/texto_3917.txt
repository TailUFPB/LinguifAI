 reuters    the u s  house of representatives approved a bill on thursday to repeal major parts of obamacare and replace it with a republican healthcare plan  handing president donald trump his biggest legislative victory but setting up a tough fight in the senate  stephen wood  chief market strategist  russell investments  new york   this strikes to me that the market is breathing a sigh of relief more than a nod of approval  i think there will be progress on individual and corporate tax cuts but they will come at the end of   this will be positive for the economy and markets  we think there will be  knots in the floss  to get legislation done  we expect to see more sloppiness in the legislative process so you have to focus on fundamentals  valuation is currently very high in the equity space  the outlook for the united states is good  but we need very good fundamentals to justify current equity valuation  europe is increasingly interesting from an equity perspective  one would be more comfortable with europe compared with the u s    elections have consequences  and i think that this is the very first manifestation of it  it would be foolish to say that it doesn t reinvigorate trump because     earlier this week the main headlines were that the budget was an obama type budget instead of anything that was promised during the campaign   once republicans develop cohesion you are going to see more of a domino effect  it s like   we all got onboard with this  healthcare reform   what s stopping us from trying to get money for the wall or having tax reform that s going to be agreeable to the president s agenda   so i think that it does in some way invigorate it    guy lebas  chief fixed income strategist  janney montgomery scott  philadelphia   what is a bit lost in the perception that house s healthcare reform bill is positive for financial markets is a proposed repeal of a surcharge of roughly   percent on investment income on high income individuals  which is in the affordable care act  now this bill goes to the senate  for the market  the odds of passage of at least this version of  repeal and replace  in the senate isn t very high  it s going to a tough sell in the senate  this is largely a non event for the bond market  it s more gearing up for tomorrow s jobs report and what yellen might say   randy frederick  vice president  trading and derivatives  charles schwab  austin  texas   i think anything that they  republicans  get done  that they accomplish  popular or unpopular  will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together  because obviously the biggest divisions are not between the democrats and the republicans but within the republican party   this puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality  simply because it s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together   joseph krist  partner  credit specialist  court street group research  new york       it means that it satisfies those members of congress who have made this a primary campaign issue and want to say they want to repeal obamacare and we voted to did it  from a policy standpoint it is virtually meaningless  the bill from everything i have seen is virtually impossible to pass in the senate        i don t think this really should have any impact  the fundamentals driving people s healthcare ideas came before the election  people looking at small standalone and rural hospitals  saw they were wall badly positioned for healthcare reform going forward  whether it be because of obamacare  should it remain  due to cost reduction measures  and conversely people were looking at size as a really important factor  whether a large institution or large chains  the consolidation was already coming whether repealed or not  it is not really a big factor from a public finance fixed income perspective  you still want big balance sheets  large pools of cash and diversity revenues     this morning going in the market was expecting the house was going to pass it and it did    this is just one of several different things trump is trying to get accomplished  this is out of the way and now they have to go to tax reform  that s something that s going to drag out for a while and probably the next key thing  aside from the geopolitical things that are going on         as far as traders and investors i talk to  this  healthcare bill  isn t affecting their position or what they want to do    rick meckler  president  libertyview capital management  jersey city  new jersey   the fact that they could pass this doesn t make much of a difference  the real risk in the near term to the so called trump rally was a failure to pass it   i don t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue  i think they re really focused on the tax plan  if they couldn t pass the healthcare  it would bode very poorly for the tax plan    but the fact that they could pass the healthcare  even pass it in the house  and pass it so narrowly  i don t think it necessarily means the tax plan is more likely to come through   ken polcari  director of the nyse floor division  o neil securities  new york   it passes the house  that s fine  now it goes to the senate  and we know in the senate it is going to have a very tough time  so even though it has passed the one  it is certainly not a done deal yet  obamacare is still very much alive and intact    the market has really been flat  i don t necessarily think this is such a surprise  after all the news reports today and yesterday  people were expecting it  they are all high fiving and cheering and all that stuff in the congress but it still has to go to the senate and that is where it is going to run into some problems    the market is again biding time  there is no reason it s not really taking off  we are hitting our head at the ceiling  we have been hitting our head on the ceiling  if anything it is going to cause it  the catalyst is going to be the  french election  sunday night  it is listless trading at the moment  nobody is making big huge bets one way or the other   stocks  s p  remains little changed on the day bonds    and  year treasury yields hold higher on the day forex  the dollar index ticks down to the session low
