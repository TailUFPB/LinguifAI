washington  reuters    the u s  justice department is developing plans to temporarily reassign immigration judges from around the country to   cities to speed up deportations of illegal immigrants who have been charged with crimes  according to two administration officials   how many judges will be reassigned and when they will be sent is still under review  according to the officials  but the justice department has begun soliciting volunteers for deployment   the targeted cities are new york  los angeles  miami  new orleans  san francisco  baltimore  bloomington  minnesota  el paso  texas  harlingen  texas  imperial  california  omaha  nebraska and phoenix  arizona  they were chosen because they are cities which have high populations of illegal immigrants with criminal charges  the officials said  a spokeswoman for the justice department s executive office of immigration review  which administers immigration courts  confirmed that the cities have been identified as likely recipients of reassigned immigration judges  but did not elaborate on the planning   the plan to intensify deportations is in line with a vow made frequently by president donald trump on the campaign trail last year to deport more illegal immigrants involved in crime  the department of homeland security asked for the judges  reshuffle  an unusual move given that immigration courts are administered by the department of justice  a homeland security spokeswoman declined to comment on any plan that has not yet been finalized   under an executive order signed by trump in january  illegal immigrants with pending criminal cases are regarded as priorities for deportation whether they have been found guilty or not  that is a departure from former president barack obama s policy  which prioritized deportations only of those convicted of serious crimes  the policy shift has been criticized by advocate groups who say it unfairly targets immigrants who might ultimately be acquitted and do not pose a threat                                  the cities slated to receive more judges have more than half of the   pending immigration cases that involve undocumented immigrants facing or convicted of criminal charges  according to data provided by the justice department s executive office of immigration review   more than  of those cases involve immigrants currently incarcerated  meaning that the others have either not been convicted or have served their sentence  the justice department did not provide a breakdown of how many of the remainder have been convicted and how many are awaiting trial    as part of the trump administration crackdown on illegal immigrants  the justice department is also sending immigration judges to detention centers along the southwest border  those temporary redeployments will begin monday  former immigration judge and chairman of the board of immigration appeals paul schmidt said the trump administration should not assume that all those charged with crimes would not be allowed to stay in the united states legally   it seems they have an assumption that everyone who has committed a crime should be removable  but that s not necessarily true  even people who have committed serious crimes can sometimes get asylum   schmidt said   he also questioned the effectiveness of shuffling immigration judges from one court to another  noting that this will mean cases the judges would have handled in their usual courts will have to be rescheduled  he said that when he was temporarily reassigned to handle cases on the southern border in  and   cases he was slated to hear in his home court in arlington  virginia had to be postponed  often for more than a year     that s what you call aimless docket reshuffling   he said   under the obama administration  to avoid the expense and disruption of immigration judges traveling  they would often hear proceedings from other courthouses via video conference  the judges  reshuffling could further logjam a national immigration court system which has more than   pending cases   the cities slated to receive more judges have different kinds of immigrant populations   imperial  california  for example  is in one of the nation s largest agriculture hubs  attracting large numbers of immigrant farmworkers from mexico and central america   bloomington  minnesota  near st  paul  is home to a large number of african immigrants  many of whom traveled from war torn countries like somalia to claim asylum in the united states
