washington  reuters    for a man who prefers to project a glowering brusqueness  donald trump s trip to houston on saturday provides him with the opportunity to show a warmer  more empathetic side   and perhaps connect with some americans critical of his presidency  trump s predecessor  barack obama  became known as the  comforter in chief  for his role in consoling victims of mass shootings and terror attacks  but the flooding caused by hurricane harvey marks the first large scale national tragedy under trump s watch  the white house said trump will first travel to houston to meet with flood survivors and volunteers who assisted in relief efforts and then will move on to lake charles  louisiana  another area hammered by the storm   trump first visited the region on tuesday  but stayed clear of the disaster zone  saying he did not want to hamper rescue efforts  instead  he met with cabinet members  state and local leaders  and first responders  he was criticized  however  for not meeting with victims of the worst storm to hit texas in  years  and for largely focusing on the logistics of the government response rather than the suffering of residents    that was reasonable criticism   said matt mackowiak  chairman of the republican party in travis county  texas  who has praised the trump administration s handling of the disaster   more than  million people have been displaced by harvey and up to  are feared dead in flooding that paralyzed houston and swelled river levels to record highs  saturday s trip gives trump a second chance  one mackowiak said he should take full advantage of   it s useful for the president of the united states to have an emotional connection with the country   he said  adding that it could be  valuable for the half of the country that opposes him right now   according to the reuters ipsos tracking poll  almost  percent of the public disapproves of trump s performance as president   while obama famously shed tears after the  shootings at sandy hook elementary in newtown  connecticut that left  children dead  trump has rarely displayed emotion other than anger at his critics and the news media   one exception was the chemical attack in april by syria s  government that killed more than  people  many of them children    when you kill innocent children  innocent babies  babies  little babies  with a chemical gas that is so lethal   trump said at a press conference after the attack   that crosses many  many lines   as a presidential candidate  trump was lauded by the families of people killed by undocumented immigrants  who said he personally expressed his sympathy for their loss   but he was widely rebuked for his response to last month s violence in charlottesville  virginia when he appeared to be more interested in apportioning blame and feuding with his detractors than soothing the nerves of a rattled nation   trump of course first made his name as a real estate mogul in manhattan  branding himself as an expert in steel eyed negotiation  and then cemented that image with his popular reality tv show  in which he coldly fired contestants unable to measure up   as a presidential candidate  he frequently exhorted the value of  toughness  and praised business executives who were  killers    my sense  based on his life and career  is that he s not a publicly sympathetic or empathetic individual   mackowiak said   tony perkins  a pastor and president of the family research council  a conservative advocacy group  said there is a warmer side to trump  perkins accompanied trump when  as a candidate  he visited with flood victims in rural louisiana last year  trump  along with now vice president mike pence  toured the devastation  handing out bottles of water and diapers   perkins said trump would repeatedly order his caravan to stop so he could talk to survivors   i saw a very compassionate side to him     he was visibly impacted by what he saw   gerard landry  the mayor of denham springs  louisiana  a city of   which saw almost  percent of its buildings damaged by the flood  met with trump at the town high school    he shook my hand  grabbed me by the shoulder   landry said   he said   mr  mayor  your city is going to come back  and i know you ll be fine  i know you can do this thing    landry had been expecting the boisterous trump of his campaign rallies  but found him to be  totally different  down to earth   saturday s trip  perkins said  affords trump a moment to show the nation that side of him   it s genuine   perkins said   it s real
