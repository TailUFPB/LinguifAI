washington  reuters    the trump administration has set a collision course with the auto industry as it launches renegotiations of the  year old nafta trade pact this week  aiming to shrink a growing trade deficit with mexico and tighten the rules of origin for cars and parts  more than any other industry  autos have been the focus of u s  president donald trump s anger over the north american free trade agreement  which he blames for taking car factories and jobs away from america to low wage mexico  the united states had a   billion trade deficit with mexico in autos and auto parts last year  the dominant component of an overall   billion u s  deficit  according to u s  census bureau data   the trump administration has framed their nafta negotiating objectives around reducing the trade deficit with mexico   said caroline freund  a senior trade fellow at the peterson institute for international economics   if they don t touch autos  there s no way of getting at what they want   among tools that u s  trade representative robert lighthizer may seek to boost auto employment in the u s  is strengthening the rules of origin to shut out more parts from asia  and possibly an unprecedented u s  specific content requirement for mexican vehicles  lighthizer s negotiating objectives for nafta seek to  ensure the rules of origin incentivize the sourcing of goods and materials from the united states and north america   which has raised concerns among auto industry executives and trade groups that he will seek a deal that guarantees a certain percentage of production for the united states  the industry is opposed to such a carve out or to increasing the percentage of a vehicle s value that must come from the region above the current   percent   already the highest of any global trade bloc  they say this would raise costs and disrupt a complex supply chain that sees parts crisscrossing nafta borders and has made north american car production competitive with asia and europe   our members feel very strongly that rules of origin are not the tools to use to reshore jobs into the u s    said ann wilson  senior vice president of government affairs for the motor and equipment manufacturers association  a trade group representing auto parts makers  wilson and other industry advocates say a better way to boost u s  manufacturing jobs is through policies aimed at expanding vehicle exports  but if u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross gets his way  it would be harder to reach the   percent content threshold because the  tracing list  of parts that count towards that goal would be modernized  he argues the current rules are too loose and allow a tariff free  back door  for chinese auto parts  parts that did not exist when the  plus page list was devised in the early   largely electronics sourced from asia such as console touch screens or hybrid drive controllers  do not count against reaching the threshold  if they are put on the list  companies would have to source them from north america or pay tariffs on them  if the content requirements become too onerous  automakers will simply skip compliance  and they ll just end up paying the duty   said charles uthus  vice president for international policy at the american automotive policy council  a lobbying group for ford motor co   general motors and fiat chrysler  foregoing all nafta tariff free access benefits   something that could happen if trump is dissatisfied with the negotiations and decides to scrap the trade pact   would raise costs by about   billion  billion a year  ulthus added  ford plans about   billion in total capital spending this year     among the other contentious nafta issues that u s   canadian and mexican negotiators will tackle starting on wednesday in washington is the future of a mechanism for resolving trade disputes  the united states wants to eliminate a so called  chapter   provision  arguing that it fails to combat unfair subsidies of some mexican and canadian goods  mexico and canada have vowed to keep the provision  negotiators are expected to pursue new nafta chapters governing digital trade  and tightening environmental and labor standards  changes previously agreed by the three countries as part of the now defunct  country trans pacific partnership  u s  negotiators will also seek a provision to deter currency manipulation  aiming to set a precedent for future trade negotiations  such as a revised u s  north korean deal or a bilateral pact with japan   the negotiations face an extremely tight timeline  with officials saying they want to complete negotiations by early next year to avoid ratification difficulties posed by elections in mexico in july  and in the u s  in november   freund  a trade economist for more than a decade at the world bank and international monetary fund  said the negotiators should focus on a few key areas     if you really want to do a full blown modernization of nafta  it s going to take a lot more than six months   she said   ultimately i think they re going to get bogged down in all these details and pick two to three things and have a smaller agenda
