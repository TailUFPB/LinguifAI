washington  reuters    president donald trump thinks a bipartisan healthcare bill aimed at stabilizing obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers is a step in the right direction but he does not support the measure  the white house said on wednesday   we ve said all along that we want something that just doesn t bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all americans  and this bill doesn t address that fact   said white house spokeswoman sarah sanders   we think that this is a good step in the right direction  this president certainly supports republicans and democrats coming to work together  but it s not a full approach and we need something to go a little bit further to get on board
