washington  reuters    president donald trump tried to rally republican lawmakers behind a plan to dismantle obamacare on tuesday as u s  stock markets showed their worst one day performance since the november election   trump is trying to win the first major legislative battle of his presidency  pressure is growing on the businessman turned politician to deliver as investors become worried that a failed healthcare push could also portend trouble for promised tax cuts and relaxed regulation that have propelled the market to record highs in recent months  in one of the few visits he has made to the u s  capitol since taking office two months ago  trump told fellow republicans in the house of representatives on tuesday morning they would face  political problems  for opposing the bill that takes apart obamacare and partially replaces it  later in the day  trump hosted roughly a dozen lawmakers in the oval office to listen to their concerns   the president was really clear  he laid it on the line for everybody   house speaker paul ryan  the leading proponent of the bill  told reporters   we made a promise  now is our time to keep that promise      if we don t keep our promise  it will be very hard to manage this   the s p  and dow jones industrial average lost over  percent in their worst one day performances since before trump s election victory on nov    the s p financial index sank   percent  its biggest daily fall since june   you have this back and forth in congress with the new healthcare plan and you have this belief that if the healthcare plan can t pass  then they can t move on to taxes  there s this feeling that if things don t get done  then maybe what the market has been anticipating gets held up   said mark kepner  managing director at themis trading in chatham  new jersey   some conservative lawmakers believe the healthcare bill does not go far enough  while moderate republicans worry that millions of americans will be hurt by the dismantling of the  affordable care act  democratic former president barack obama s signature healthcare legislation   for a graphic on how u s  healthcare stacks up under the aca and ahca click tmsnrt rs    party leaders hope to move the bill to the house floor for debate as early as thursday  but the administration and house leadership can afford to lose only about  republican votes or risk the bill failing since democrats are united against it  republican representative mark meadows  chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus  said the roughly three dozen members have decided not to vote as a bloc  as many as  currently plan to vote no on the legislation  according to a cnn report  republican representative walter jones said trump told lawmakers in the closed door meeting at the capitol that if the republican bill does not pass  they would face  political problems   jones said he thought trump meant lawmakers could lose their seats  repealing and replacing obamacare was one of trump s main campaign promises and has been a goal of republicans since it was enacted   while trump predicted that republicans could face challenges in primary contests ahead of the  midterm elections if they do not gut obamacare  there is also danger to them in doing so  if the republican bill is passed  millions of voters might lose their healthcare coverage  the congressional budget office said last week that  million people would forfeit coverage under the house bill over the next year  although that number could change based on the most current version of the legislation   nancy nielsen  associate dean for health policy at the university at buffalo s jacobs school of medicine  said republican leaders were in a tough spot   it is a not so delicate balancing act  as they have to win over the most conservative house and senate members without causing an outrageous backlash from voters now or in the next election   nielsen said   democrats oppose the republicans  plan  saying it would hurt the elderly  poor and working families while giving tax cuts to the wealthy      republican leaders tweaked the bill this week to try to satisfy critics  mainly from their own party   republican chairmen for two key committees said late monday they proposed more funding for tax credits  which conservatives have opposed  that would give the senate flexibility to help older people afford health insurance  additionally  obamacare s taxes would be eliminated in  instead of   the amendments also addressed medicaid  which is the country s largest health insurance program and covers about  million people  mostly the poor  the changes would allow states to implement work requirements for certain adults  an idea championed by many conservatives  and to decide how they receive federal funds      congressman dan donovan  who attended the oval office meeting on tuesday  said trump did  more listening than directing   there was some  political talk  but  no threats   he said  donovan  who has not announced whether he will support the bill  cited people losing medicaid and the defunding of women s healthcare provider planned parenthood as concerns in his new york district   the club for growth  an influential conservative lobby group  said it would spend at least    for ads on television and digital platforms urging congress members to defeat the bill  the senate also will vote on the legislation  and more changes could be made  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said that if the house approved a healthcare bill  he would try to bring it to the senate floor next week
