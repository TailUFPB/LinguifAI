 reuters    the u s  state department has told refugee agencies it will sharply pare back the number of offices across the country authorized to resettle people in  as president donald trump cuts the number of refugees allowed into the united states  the announcement was made at a dec   meeting in washington with state department officials and representatives from nine major refugee agencies  several executives of the agencies said  advocates said the decision is likely to lead to the closure of dozens of resettlement offices around the country  potentially leaving some refugees without access to services that help them integrate into american life  several state refugee coordinators said they had also been made aware of the closures      refugee resettlement in the united states is handled by nine non profit agencies that receive funding from the federal government for some of their refugee work  they partner with  or oversee  hundreds of local offices in nearly every state that help new arrivals with basic tasks like enrolling children in school  arranging doctors  visits and applying for social security cards and other documents   though the agencies are independent  they must get government approval for where they will resettle new refugees   aid workers and state officials involved in refugee resettlement said the agencies were informed by the state department in the dec   meeting that offices expected to handle fewer than  refugees in fiscal year  will no longer be authorized to resettle new arrivals  which means many of them will have to close  there are about  resettlement offices spread across  states  and advocates estimate several dozen are at risk  though shuttering plans will not be finalized until next year  the trump administration has said it wants refugees to assimilate quickly  both to promote national security and so that they can become self sufficient  refugee advocates say the closure of local offices will undermine that goal  they say the offices play a crucial role in helping newcomers traumatized from having fled conflict or persecution  even if no new refugees are resettled by the offices they still have an obligation to help those already here  they say   if refugees lose access to  services to help them navigate the processes of registering for school  and english classes and finding a job  that will mean that it will take longer for them to navigate life in the united states and contribute to our economy   said robert carey  who directed the office of refugee resettlement under former president barack obama   a state department official confirmed the dec   meeting and said the agency is looking to  reduce costs and simplify management structures to help the u s  refugee admissions program run in a way that is fiscally responsible and sustainable    some conservative groups that favor lower immigration said they would welcome curbs on the agencies  activities   these organizations have to adapt when their services are no longer needed as much   said jessica vaughan  director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies   there is no reason to keep funneling money to them   joshua meservey  a senior policy analyst at the conservative heritage foundation who formerly worked in refugee resettlement  said that costs need to be balanced against benefits   it is unclear to me if the assimilation gains are great enough to justify the extra expense  of funding the smaller agencies  he said  the nine agencies are now trying to coordinate closures so that they can maintain at least one resettlement agency in as many states as possible  several agency executives said   we re hoping that they  the state department  only close sites where there is possible duplication   said mark hetfield  president of hias  one of the nine agencies   this is going to have to be a negotiation and a process   since taking office in january  trump has moved to sharply reduce refugee admissions to the united states  because of national security concerns and a belief that money could be better spent resettling people closer to their original homes  soon after taking office  he slashed the  u s  refugee cap to   from the   ceiling set by obama  in september  he announced a cap of   for   the lowest number since the modern u s  refugee program was established in   the resettlement office in chattanooga  tennessee is at risk of shutting down  because it is only projected to receive about  refugees  said holly johnson  the state s refugee coordinator   small doesn t necessarily mean weak or subpar   johnson said   they spend more time with folks  they have really well established connections to the community  so people feel welcomed  which really helps   until this year  idaho had four resettlement offices   three in boise and one in twin falls  said jan reeves  director of the idaho office for refugees  a non profit which administers resettlement in the state  earlier this year one of the sites in boise shut down  he said   it was disruptive  and we ve lost a really valuable partner and we ve lost some capacity to do the job   he said
