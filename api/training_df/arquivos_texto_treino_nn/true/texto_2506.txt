washington  reuters    the white house domestic policy council  dpc  is taking the lead on a decision about how many refugees to admit to the united states next year  two current and three former officials said  a move that may empower those who wish to reduce immigration  the council  which reports to u s  president donald trump s senior adviser for policy stephen miller  an architect of trump s initial travel ban  is adopting a role traditionally handled by national security council and state department officials  the shift may strengthen the hand of officials who  like trump himself  wish to cut the number of refugees resettled in the united states  against foreign policy experts who view the issue through an international humanitarian lens and say taking them in is vital to getting others to keep their borders open  the bureaucratic maneuver appears to be part of a wider washington fight over steps that the trump administration has taken to limit immigration to the united states  these include two trump executive orders  both challenged in court  temporarily banning most refugees from entering as well as most visits by citizens of six muslim majority nations  an internal debate over the cost of resettling refugees  and a crackdown on illegal immigration  by law  the president must tell congress before the oct   start of the fiscal year how many refugees he believes need to be resettled in the united states in the next year  it is not known how many refugees trump will decide to admit  the dpc s enhanced role may reflect a white house tendency to view the issue through a political prism given trump s focus in his  election campaign on curbing immigration and its popularity with his base  the current and former officials said   they see it as continuation of a campaign issue about keeping america safe  rather than as  a humanitarian issue about helping people who were fleeing persecution and war overseas   said one former official who spoke on condition of anonymity  in his original jan   executive order  trump said some people admitted as refugees  have been convicted or implicated in terrorism related crimes  and called for tighter vetting   deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war  strife  disaster  and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter   he added      critics argue refugees are the most heavily vetted group to come to the united states and highly unlikely to pose a threat  the white house and state department did not respond to requests for comment  miller was the keynote speaker at a  awards ceremony of the center for immigration studies  a group which aims to limit immigration  dpc member john zadrozny has worked for the federation for american immigration reform  which seeks to lower immigration to a level that  more closely reflects past policy   in both his travel ban executive orders  trump has ordered the united states to accept a maximum of   refugees for permanent resettlement in the fiscal  year ending sept    less than half the   president barack obama authorized  that would be the lowest level of refugee resettlement in the united states since fiscal   when   were admitted  as of july   the united states had taken in   so far in fiscal   according to official data   for a graphic of u s  refugee admissions see  tmsnrt rs   however  it would track with the original guideline set by the refugee act of   which capped admissions at   for fiscal    and  unless the president found more were justified on humanitarian or other national interest grounds  from fiscal   the   cap did not apply  proponents argue that the united states needs to take in refugees for many reasons  not least to help make the case to states such as jordan  turkey and lebanon accepting hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees to keep their borders open   there has been so much talk recently of the alleged security implications of letting refugees in  but the administration doesn t seem fully cognizant of the national security implications of keeping refugees out   said rebecca heller of the international refugee assistance project  which sued to block trump s travel ban executive orders   our allies in the middle east  on whom we depend in the partnership to defeat  the islamic state group   rely on u s  refugee resettlement to relieve the strain placed by refugees on their domestic infrastructure   she added
