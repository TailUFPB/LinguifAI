washington  reuters    the u s  congress  bitterly divided for years along party lines  may be mapping a bipartisan path forward that skirts around president donald trump when he refuses to engage constructively with lawmakers  democrats and some lobbyists said on monday  the path was discernible in a nearly    trillion federal spending deal carved out over the weekend to avert a government shutdown  it had democratic fingerprints all over it  even though republicans control congress and the white house   white house budget director mick mulvaney said trump will sign the  budget bill when he receives it from congress on thursday or friday  trump  in an interview with bloomberg on monday  said he was  very happy  with the deal announced late on sunday  democrats claimed victory on issue after issue in the agreement  which will keep the lights on in washington through the end of  the federal fiscal year on sept    provided it holds up and wins final approval as expected  trump scored a partial win  getting a commitment for up to   billion in additional funding for a military buildup  that was about half of what he originally asked for  no money was included for trump s proposed u s  mexico border wall  democratic opposition to it was solid and support from trump s fellow republicans was soft  mulvaney said trump will seek wall funding in a budget proposal coming in late may  at a white house briefing  mulvaney defended the concessions trump made to reach an agreement  saying democrats gave up on some items they had wanted as well in order to find a compromise   everything we got in this deal     lines up perfectly with the president s priorities   he said  democrats took an opposite view  describing the work on capitol hill that went into the temporary spending pact  senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters   democrats and republicans in the house and senate were closer to one another than we were to the president on so many of the different issues   schumer and senator patrick leahy  the senior democrat on the appropriations committee  said they were bolstered in negotiations by the fact that several republican senators opposed funding for trump s wall and his call for deep domestic spending cuts  schumer and leahy said the white house never tried to work with democrats in the process  trump treats engaging with lawmakers on legislation as  an afterthought   said doug heye  a republican strategist who worked in congress as an aide to former house republican leader eric cantor   the power of the oval office can provide a lot of leverage when trying to move something on capitol hill   heye said   we just haven t see that level of engagement from trump  whether it s healthcare  or building a wall  or tax reform   but john feehery  a republican strategist in washington  said the spending bill may not be indicative of trump s ability to negotiate with congress because the legislative body should have dealt with this year s funding months ago and never have been allowed to go into the current year    he knows that this bill was probably not going to reflect his priorities because it was old business   feehery said   when it comes to new business  he has a lot more leverage in getting his priorities accomplished   the spending deal preserved funding for healthcare provider planned parenthood  which has drawn republican ire because it performs abortions  for the obamacare healthcare law  and for an array of environmental and other domestic programs trump wanted to slash  white house spokesman sean spicer said because the legislation needs to win a supermajority of  votes in the  member senate that cannot be achieved without democratic support   we couldn t have our entire way  on the deal  spicer said the  president s priorities will be reflected much more  in spending yet to be worked out for the  fiscal year that begins on oct    he said trump was pleased to see the increase in military spending  a  down payment  on border security and money for scholarships to help low income children in washington attend private schools      the fiscal  funds  which should have been locked into place seven months ago  would pay for federal programs from airport and border security operations to soldiers  pay  medical research  foreign aid  space exploration and education  the pentagon would win a    billion increase in defense spending for the fiscal year  with the possibility of an additional    billion contingent on trump delivering a plan to congress for defeating the islamic state militant group  congressional negotiators settled on    billion more for border security  including money for new technology and repairing existing infrastructure   under the deal  puerto rico would get an emergency injection of   million for its medicaid health insurance program for the poor  the impoverished u s  territory faces a severe medicaid funding shortfall  the u s  government and coal companies would be required to pay out healthcare to retired coal miners  guaranteeing benefits to workers even as coal companies face bankruptcy  under the spending agreement  the deal also would reimburse new york city for money spent securing trump and his family at trump tower in manhattan
