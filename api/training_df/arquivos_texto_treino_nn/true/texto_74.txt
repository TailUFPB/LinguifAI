washington  reuters    wealthy business owners  such as president donald trump  stand to gain from a provision in the republican tax bill that creates a valuable deduction for owners of pass through businesses  democrats and some tax experts say  the provision creates a  percent business income deduction  with some limits  for sole proprietors and owners in partnerships and other non corporate enterprises  it was initially sold by republicans as a way to help small businesses and create jobs  but the final formula for determining what types of businesses can benefit has widened to take in companies with few  if any  workers  critics said   the president will try to tell the american people that his great political victory is a win for working people  but they see all the benefits going to his type of businesses  real estate pass throughs   democratic senator jack reed said on the senate floor  trump  a real estate developer  wants to sign the republican tax bill into law this week  which would give republicans their first major legislative victory of   the house of representatives and senate were hurrying toward passage of the bill on tuesday  with a final house vote set for wednesday  on house speaker paul ryan s website  he said pass through businesses employed about half of u s  private sector workers  high tax rates  he said   discourage investment and job creation  discourage business activity  and put american businesses at a competitive disadvantage   pass through businesses  profits  pass through  their books directly to owners  unlike corporations  which parcel out profits through dividends to stockholders  under existing law  pass through owners pay the individual income tax rate on those profits  not the corporate rate  under the republican bill  the corporate rate would be slashed to  percent  while the top individual income tax rate  which some pass through business owners pay  would be  percent  to address the disparity  republicans included tax relief for pass through owners in their bill  allowing them to deduct  percent of their pass through business income  republicans put in anti abuse measures to ensure owners of bona fide business operations claim the  percent deduction and prevent high earners from seeking to recategorize their income as pass through income to take advantage of the deduction  republicans also capped the income eligible for the full  percent deduction at    for married couples and    for individuals  but they included a  capital element  in the formula for determining eligibility beyond those thresholds  presenting a lucrative tax break for some  including wealthy owners of commercial property  said tax experts   this seems ideally suited for commercial property businesses  where there aren t a lot of workers  but there is a lot of valuable property around   said steven rosenthal  senior fellow at the nonpartisan tax policy center  a think tank  income above the pass through caps can be eligible for the  percent deduction based on a formula   percent of employee wages paid  or  percent of wages plus   percent of the value of qualified property at purchase  whichever is greater   the idea is to use the sum of the    percent rule  plus  percent of wages     to get the full  percent deduction  on more income  said new york university school of law professor daniel shaviro  a tax law specialist  in an email  an assessment of the republican bill by  tax experts  mostly academics  said the formula would  expand the ability of highly paid owners in certain industries   and particularly those heavy in property but light in employees  like real estate   to qualify for the pass through deduction
