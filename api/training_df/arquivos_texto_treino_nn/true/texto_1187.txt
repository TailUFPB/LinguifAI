washington  reuters    the central intelligence agency thought for months that it had mistakenly shredded a massive u s  senate report on its use of waterboarding and other  enhanced interrogation techniques  before suddenly discovering that its copy had not been lost after all  an agency official said on tuesday   it s embarrassing and i have apologized   christopher sharpley  the acting cia inspector general  told the senate intelligence committee during his confirmation hearing as president donald trump s nominee for the position  championed by democratic senator dianne feinstein when she chaired the senate panel  the  torture report   as it is known  is the result of a six year investigation into so called enhanced interrogation techniques used by the cia after the sept      attacks  during the administration of republican president george w  bush  the report has been the subject of disputes between the agency and committee democrats  as well as democrats and republicans  over issues including whether it should be declassified and whether investigators broke the law as they assembled it  feinstein wants the   page document declassified  but republican senator richard burr  her successor as committee chairman  has resisted its release and asked for the return of copies distributed to government agencies under democratic president barack obama  sharpley said the cia received the report in december  on a computer disk  which was then uploaded into a classified system  shortly thereafter  he said  the agency was told to delete it because of ongoing freedom of information act  foia  litigation  an email was sent saying the disk should not be destroyed  but sharpley said he was told months later it could not be found and that an employee said it had been shredded  but he said the disk was discovered later  after the foia litigation concluded that the report was a  congressional  document not subject to foia requests  sharpley said around that time  burr asked him to return the disk and he did so  the committee s democrats appeared frustrated by sharpley s account   the point of distributing it to the departments was in the hope that they would read it   not look at it as some poison document   and learn from it   feinstein said  noting that to her knowledge  not a single fact in the report has been refuted  sharpley said he had not read the report  only an unclassified executive summary  democratic senator ron wyden announced after the hearing that he would not support sharpley s nomination because he had handed the report over to burr  although there was no legal requirement to do so  sharpley also would not commit to protecting any future reports  such as one related to the committee s probe of potential links between trump s campaign and russian efforts to interfere in the  u s  election   i think your highest duty here is to follow the law  the notion that the chairman asked for it and that s all that governed your judgment isn t acceptable to me   wyden said during the hearing  obama ended the use of  enhanced interrogation techniques  via executive order in january   led by feinstein and republican senator john mccain  congress has since passed legislation outlawing their use  burr said he planned a vote on sharpley s nomination next week and looked forward to supporting him
