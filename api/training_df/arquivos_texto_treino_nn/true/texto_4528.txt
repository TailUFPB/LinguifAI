washington  reuters    the united states should continue to be  engaged  in international climate change discussions but the paris climate change agreement is a  bad deal  for the country  the head of the environmental protection agency said sunday  epa administrator scott pruitt did not confirm whether the united states would remain in the global climate change pact  under which nearly all countries agreed in  to halt or curb their greenhouse gas emissions  even as the world s biggest emitter china reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement      chinese president xi jinping is due to have his first meeting with president donald trump on april    xi and other chinese officials have pledged to remain in the agreement   to demonstrate the leadership that we have shown on this issue with china and india and other nations is very important and discussions should ensue   pruitt said on fox news sunday   but what paris represents is a bad deal for this country   last week  trump signed an executive order rolling back former president barack obama s climate change policies  including the clean power plan to slash carbon emissions from power plants   a key factor in the united states  ability to meet its paris commitments  the executive order did not address the question of whether the united states would remain in the agreement but white house spokesman sean spicer said last week a decision would be made before the  summit in june  sources told reuters that white house officials are getting feedback from fossil fuel companies about the pros and cons of staying in the agreement  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said last week all countries should  move with the times and  fulfill their promises and earnestly take proactive steps to jointly push the enforcement of this agreement   pruitt said china and india signed onto the agreement without being required to reduce emissions  under the agreement each country has submitted a national strategy to meet its own emission reduction goals          asked on sunday to clarify a statement he made last month that carbon dioxide   emitted from fossil fuel power plants   is not a primary contributor to climate change  pruitt said  human activities contribute to that change in some  measure     the real question is how much are we contributing to that and measuring that with precision   he said
