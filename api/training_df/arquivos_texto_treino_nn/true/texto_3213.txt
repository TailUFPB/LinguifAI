washington  reuters    attorney general jeff sessions on tuesday denounced as a  detestable lie  the idea he colluded with russians meddling in the  election  and he clashed with democratic lawmakers over his refusal to detail his conversations with president donald trump  sessions  a senior member of trump s cabinet and an adviser to his election campaign last year  had a series of tense exchanges with democrats on the senate intelligence committee during about    hours of testimony as they pressed him to recount discussions with the republican president   you raised your right hand here today and said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth  the whole truth and nothing but the truth   democratic senator martin heinrich said   now you re not answering questions  you re impeding this investigation    sessions refused to say whether he and trump discussed fbi director james comey s handling of an investigation into possible collusion between trump s campaign and russia during the election campaign before the president fired comey on may   he also declined to say if trump opposed sessions  decision to recuse himself from the russia probe in march  and whether justice department officials discussed possible presidential pardons of individuals being looked at in the probe  democratic senator ron wyden told sessions   i believe the american people have had it with stonewalling  americans don t want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged    i am not stonewalling   sessions replied  saying he was simply following justice department policy not to discuss confidential communications with the president  sessions  testimony did not provide any damaging new information on trump campaign ties with russia or on comey s dismissal  but his refusal to discuss conversations with trump raised fresh questions about whether the white house has something to hide  adam schiff  the top democrat on the house of representatives  intelligence committee  which is conducting a parallel russia probe  said on twitter that congress  must compel responses using whatever process necessary   last week  comey told the senate committee that trump had fired him to undermine the fbi s investigation of the russia matter   trump s decision to fire comey  a move recommended by sessions despite having already recused himself from the russia probe  prompted critics to charge that the president was trying to interfere with a criminal investigation  senator angus king  an independent  questioned sessions  legal basis for refusing to answer questions after sessions said trump had not invoked executive privilege regarding the conversations   executive privilege can be claimed by a president or senior government officials to withhold information from congress or the courts to protect the executive branch decision making process  sessions said it would be  inappropriate  for him to reveal private conversations with trump when the president  has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer   legal experts said there was some merit to sessions  argument  andrew wright  a professor at savannah law school and associate counsel under former president barack obama  said it was not unusual for government employees to refuse to discuss conversations with the president in order to preserve the right to invoke executive privilege later  sessions  clash with the democratic senators was the latest chapter in a saga that has dogged trump in his first five months as president and distracted from his domestic policy agenda including major healthcare and tax cut initiatives   the suggestion that i participated in any collusion or that i was aware of any collusion with the russian government to hurt this country  which i have served with honor for over  years  or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process  is an appalling and detestable lie   sessions said   i have never met with or had any conversation with any russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the united states  further  i have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected with the trump campaign   u s  intelligence agencies concluded in a report released in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered an effort to interfere in the election to help trump in part by hacking and releasing damaging emails about democratic candidate hillary clinton  russia has denied any such interference  and trump has denied any collusion by his campaign with moscow  sessions recused himself from the russia investigation in march after revelations that he had failed to disclose two meetings last year with russia s ambassador to washington  sergei kislyak  in his testimony on tuesday  sessions addressed media reports that he may have had a third previously undisclosed meeting with kislyak at washington s mayflower hotel last year  sessions said he did not have any private meetings and could not recall any conversations with any russian officials at the hotel but did not rule out that a  brief interaction  with kislyak may have occurred there  a former republican senator  sessions was an early supporter of trump s presidential campaign  but sources say there has been tension between the two men in recent weeks because trump was annoyed that sessions recused himself from the russia probe  sessions said on tuesday he did not recuse himself because he felt he was a subject of the investigation himself but rather because he felt he was required to by justice department rules
