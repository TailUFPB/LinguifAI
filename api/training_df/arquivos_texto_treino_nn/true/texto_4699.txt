washington  reuters    a third of democratic senators have so far announced they will vote against confirming u s  president donald trump s supreme court nominee  adding to a chorus of opposition from the left  but leaving questions over whether there will be a concerted effort to block a vote in the senate  to date   of the  democratic senators have publicly backed their leader  chuck schumer  who said on thursday he opposes confirming appeals court judge neil gorsuch  others have yet to announce their intentions   gorsuch is headed toward a senate judiciary committee vote  likely on april   on his nomination to the high court after a marathon four day confirmation hearing this week   after that  it is not yet clear how much of a fight democrats will put up when the nomination is due for a final vote in the  member senate  where there are  republicans    the democratic opposition to gorsuch could prompt a showdown in the senate and delay the judge s confirmation but ultimately the republicans are likely to win that fight and avoid another setback in congress for trump who suffered a blow on friday when lawmakers pulled a major healthcare bill  senate rules enable democrats to insist on  votes to overcome a procedural move called a filibuster to allow a final up or down vote on confirming gorsuch    to the lifetime job on the nation s highest court   graphic   confirming gorsuch  how it works tmsnrt rs    but the senate s republican leadership could adopt a rule change allowing a vote that would only require a simple majority of the chamber  if eventually confirmed  gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine seat high court  for democrats  putting up a fight would at least frustrate trump and placate liberal activists sore about the republican led senate s refusal to vote on president barack obama s nominee to the same open seat on the court last year   if eventually confirmed  gorsuch would restore a conservative majority on the nine seat high court   conservative activists were targeting ten democrats running for reelection in  in states trump won in the presidential election as possible  yes  votes for gorsuch among democrats   of that number  sherrod brown of ohio  bob casey of pennsylvania and tammy baldwin of wisconsin have already announced their opposition to the nomination  the other seven  including joe manchin of west virginia  have yet to announce their plans  another democratic senator under pressure from both sides on gorsuch is michael bennet  who represents gorsuch s home state of colorado  bennet has yet to announce his position  republicans are also hopeful that some democratic members of the judiciary committee  including chris coons of delaware and amy klobuchar of minnesota  might be wary of blocking a vote on the nominee  their spokesmen did not respond to requests seeking comment  don stewart  a spokesman for republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said it would be an  unprecedented  even nuclear step  to require a  vote threshold before the senate can vote on the nominee   there has never  in the history of the republic  ever been a successful partisan filibuster of a supreme court nominee   he added  the last attempt to filibuster a nominee was a democratic bid to block a vote on justice samuel alito  who was nominated by president george w  bush in   democrats failed to gather enough support and the senate voted   to proceed to an up or down vote  alito was eventually confirmed by     sarah binder  a political scientist at george washington university  said democrats may be able to gather enough support to block a vote because so few of them are moderates from republican leaning states  meaning they may feel they have little to lose  if trump s popularity drops  that could embolden them further  she added
