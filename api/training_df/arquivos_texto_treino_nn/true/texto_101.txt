washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration said on monday that russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries globally  but stopped short of accusing moscow of meddling in the  u s  election  the criticism of russia  laid out in a new national security strategy based on trump s  america first  vision  reflects a view long held by u s  diplomats that russia actively undermines american interests at home and abroad  despite trump s own bid for warmer ties with president vladimir putin   through modernized forms of subversive tactics  russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world   said the document  it avoided directly citing what u s  intelligence agencies say was russian meddling in last year s u s  presidential election   russia uses information operations as part of its offensive cyber efforts to influence public opinion across the globe  its influence campaigns blend covert intelligence operations and false online personas with state funded media  third party intermediaries  and paid social media users or  trolls    the document said  trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations with putin  even though russia has frustrated u s  policy in syria and ukraine and done little to help washington in its standoff with north korea  in a speech laying out his strategy  trump noted that he received a call from putin on sunday to thank him for providing u s  intelligence that helped thwart a bomb attack in the russian city of st  petersburg  trump said the collaboration was  the way it s supposed to work    but while we seek such opportunities of cooperation  we will stand up for ourselves and we will stand up for our country like we have never stood up before   he said at the ronald reagan building in downtown washington   the audience of about  people frequently applauded the speech  it included the military s joint chiefs of staff  several cabinet secretaries  lawmakers  military personnel and officials from the intelligence community and other agencies   a u s  justice department investigation is looking into whether trump campaign aides colluded with russia  something that moscow and trump both deny   u s  intelligence agencies have concluded russians tried to tip the election to trump through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass democratic candidate hillary clinton and spreading social media propaganda  facebook  google and twitter inc are facing a backlash after saying russians used their services to anonymously spread divisive messages among americans in the run up to the election  other western nations  including france  have accused russia of trying to interfere in their elections  congress mandates that every u s  administration set out its national security strategy  the new trump strategy is influenced strongly by the thinking of top national security officials rather than that of the president himself  said one official involved in preparing the document   the republican president s strategy reflects his  america first  priorities of protecting the u s  homeland and borders  rebuilding the military  projecting strength abroad and pursuing trade policies more favorable to the united states  talking points sent to u s  embassies worldwide on what diplomats should say about the new strategy makes clear that the official u s  position is tough on russia  an unclassified state department cable  seen by reuters  said   russia tries to weaken the credibility of america s commitment to europe  with its invasions of georgia and ukraine  russia has demonstrated a willingness to use force to challenge the sovereignty of states in the region  harry kazianis  an analyst at the conservative center for the national interest think tank  said   while things with moscow might be warm and fuzzy for the moment  president putin will not take too kindly to being labeled as what essentially amounts to as an enemy of america   it drops democratic former president barack obama s  description of climate change as a u s  national security threat  aides said  trump has vowed to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord unless changes are made to it     the trump administration lumps together china and russia as competitors seeking to challenge u s  power and erode its security and prosperity                  the singling out of china and russia as  revisionist powers  also comes despite trump s own attempts to build strong relations chinese president xi jinping  a senior administration official said russia and china were attempting to revise the global status quo   russia in europe with its military incursions into ukraine and georgia  and china in asia by its aggression in the south china sea  russia denies the allegations that it meddled with the  u s  presidential election  trump has been working with xi to exert pressure on north korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs  the administration warned that intellectual property theft by china is a national security problem    we need to protect data in different ways  we need to ensure that the legislation we have  like cfius  is up to date and reflects the kinds of strategic investments that are taking place by other countries   an administration official said   the committee on foreign investment in the united states  cfius   which reviews the purchase of u s  assets by foreign companies  has recently taken a strong stand against technology transfers to chinese companies
