washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday handed a victory to president donald trump by reviving parts of a travel ban on people from six muslim majority countries that he said is needed for national security but that opponents decry as discriminatory  the justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a march  executive order that trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks  allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the united states   the court issued its order on the last day of its current term and agreed to hear oral arguments during its next term starting in october so it can decide finally whether the ban is lawful in a major test of presidential powers  in a statement  trump called the high court s action  a clear victory for our national security   saying the justices allowed the travel suspension to become largely effective   as president  i cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm  i want people who can love the united states and all of its citizens  and who will be hardworking and productive   trump added  trump s march  order called for a blanket  day ban on people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen and a  day ban on all refugees while the government implemented stronger vetting procedures  the court allowed a limited version of the refugee ban  which had also been blocked by courts  to go into effect  trump issued the order amid rising international concern about attacks carried out by islamist militants like those in paris  london  brussels  berlin and other cities  but challengers said no one from the affected countries had carried out attacks in the united states  federal courts said the travel ban violated federal immigration law and was discriminatory against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution  critics called it a discriminatory  muslim ban   ahmed al nasi  an official in yemen s ministry of expatriate affairs  voiced disappointment   we believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism  but rather will increase the feeling among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted  especially given that yemen is an active partner of the united states in the war on terrorism and that there are joint operations against terrorist elements in yemen   he said  groups that challenged the ban  including the american civil liberties union  said that most people from the affected countries seeking entry to the united states would have the required connections  but they voiced concern the administration would interpret the ban as broadly as it could   it s going to be very important for us over this intervening period to make sure the government abides by the terms of the order and does not try to use it as a back door into implementing the full scale muslim ban that it s been seeking to implement   said omar jadwat  an aclu lawyer  during the  presidential race  trump campaigned for  a total and complete shutdown  of muslims entering the united states  the travel ban was a signature policy of trump s first few months as president   in an unusual unsigned decision  the supreme court on monday said the travel ban will go into effect  with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states    a lack of a clearly defined relationship would bar from entry people from the six countries and refugees with no such ties  hawaii attorney general douglas chin  who successfully challenged the ban in lower courts  said that students from affected countries due to attend the university of hawaii would still be able to do so  both bans were to partly go into effect  hours after the court s decision  the department of homeland security and the state department pledged to implement the decision in an orderly fashion   we will keep those traveling to the united states and partners in the travel industry informed as we implement the order in a professional  organized  and timely way   a state department spokeswoman said  trump signed the order as a replacement for a jan   one issued a week after he became president that also was blocked by federal courts  but not before it caused chaos at airports and provoked numerous protests  even before the supreme court action the ban applied only to new visa applicants  not people who already have visas or are u s  permanent residents  known as green card holders  the executive order also made waivers available for a foreign national seeking to enter the united states to resume work or study  visit a spouse  child or parent who is a u s  citizen  or for  significant business or professional obligations   refugees  in transit  and already approved would have been able to travel to the united states under the executive order  the case was trump s first major challenge at the supreme court  where he restored a   conservative majority with the appointment of neil gorsuch  who joined the bench in april  there are five republican appointees on the court and four democratic appointees  the four liberal justices were silent  gorsuch was one of the three conservative justices who would have granted trump s request to put the order completely into effect  fellow conservative justice clarence thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he warned that requiring officials to differentiate between foreigners who have a connection to the united states and those who do not will prove unworkable    today s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding   on peril of contempt   whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the united states have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country   thomas wrote  the state of hawaii and a group of plaintiffs in maryland represented by the american civil liberties union argued that the order violated federal immigration law and the constitution s first amendment prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion  regional federal appeals courts in virginia and california both upheld district judge injunctions blocking the order
