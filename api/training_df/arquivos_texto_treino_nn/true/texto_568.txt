washington  reuters    the department of homeland security violated two court orders in the days after u s  president donald trump issued a temporary travel ban on citizens of seven muslim majority countries  according to the department s watchdog  dhs inspector general john roth summarized his findings in a letter dated monday to three democratic u s  senators  saying he has been unable to release the full  page report  completed six weeks ago  he said the delay was due to a dispute with dhs higher ups over redactions  which would  deprive congress and the public of significant insights into the operation of the department   roth said  after the jan   order by the president  the u s  customs and border protection agency  cbp   was very aggressive in preventing affected travelers from boarding aircraft bound for the united states  and took actions that  in our view  violated two separate court orders   roth said  trump banned the entry of citizens from seven muslim majority countries for  days  his order was issued with little warning to major u s  agencies  sparking confusion at airports in the united states and around the world over its scope and impact  civil rights groups quickly challenged the travel ban  managing to block implementation of some of its key measures as protesters  lawyers and elected officials rushed to major u s  airports where citizens of the seven countries had been detained  at u s  ports of entry  cbp officials largely complied with court orders blocking the ban  though they were hampered by a lack of guidance from superiors  roth wrote in his letter   cbp officials  had virtually no warning  that trump was issuing his travel ban  or of the scope of the order  and was caught by surprise   roth said  still  cbp officers at u s  airports  attempted in good faith to obey court orders   he said  in one case  at dulles international airport near washington  cbp stopped a departing airplane that was taxiing so an affected traveler could be admitted to the united states  from jan   to feb    cbp instructed airlines to prevent boston bound passengers from the seven countries from flying to the united states in violation of an order by a federal court in massachusetts  all of the airlines except lufthansa  lhag de  followed cbp instructions  when lufthansa s passengers arrived in boston  they were allowed to enter  roth said  cbp also continued to issue  no board  instructions to airlines even after a separate nationwide federal court order on jan   blocked the agency from doing so  roth said  top dhs officials are reviewing roth s report and may invoke a form of governmental privilege which he said  would prevent us from releasing to you significant portions of the report  i am very troubled by this development   agency officials  conducted themselves professionally  and in a legal manner  as they implemented an executive order issued by the president   said tyler q  houlton  a dhs spokesman  parts of the report are subject to  privileges afforded by well recognized law   he said since the travel ban s implementation is subject to lawsuits and court orders
