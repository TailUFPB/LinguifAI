 oslo  reuters    a  global pact for fighting climate change will benefit in some ways at least if u s  president donald trump carries out a threat to pull out  backers say  in a shift from gloom about the fate of a deal that took two decades to negotiate   the paris agreement requires consensus for all decisions  meaning the withdrawal of a recalcitrant united states would make it easier for emitters such as china and the european union to design details of a trillion dollar shift from fossil fuels   trump has called man made climate change a hoax and made a so far unfulfilled campaign pledge to  cancel  the agreement  saying he wants to promote the domestic fossil fuel industry   in a step to undo environmental regulations introduced under former president barack obama  trump will sign an order on tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the united states    there will be some advantages for other countries and there will also be extraordinary disadvantages   if the u s  ends up quitting paris  said christiana figueres  an architect of the agreement who was the u n  s climate chief in paris    it s not a black and white scenario   she said   she said the ideal outcome  both for the united states and other nations  was for washington to stay and make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions  there were better investment prospects for renewable energies such as solar power than coal  she added   the fear has long been that a pullout of the world s top economy would drain other nations  willingness to cut greenhouse gas emissions under an agreement ratified by nations as diverse as china  saudi arabia and african countries   but there is an emerging rival view that paris might be better off    the achilles heel of the paris agreement is that it s built on consensus   said johan rockstrom  director of the stockholm resilience center at stockholm university    it s very difficult to have a negative giant in the room  able to obstruct all decisions  he said  adding that he had swung in recent weeks to reckon that a u s  pullout would be better overall from an earlier view that it would be a  big failure    the paris agreement has few binding obligations  it lets all nations set their own goals for fighting climate change and has no penalties for non compliance   governments have set a  deadline to work out a rule book for the paris agreement  filling in details  for instance  of how nations will report and monitor their curbs on emissions   maldives environment minister thoriq ibrahim   chair of the alliance of small island states whose members fear they are at risk from rising sea levels   urged continued u s  participation in paris    the closer you look at it  the clearer it becomes that it  the paris agreement  also promotes important strategic  economic  and security benefits as well   he said   norwegian prime minister erna solberg also said it would be better for the united states to stay   but i don t think that it s the end of the paris agreement if the united states decides to leave   she said   oliver geden  of the german institute for international and security affairs  disagreed  a u s  withdrawal would badly undermine the paris agreement and any decisions would be largely irrelevant without the world s biggest economy  he said   the momentum could fade away pretty soon   he predicted   still  almost  nations agreed after trump s election in november that the world had an  urgent duty  to combat an  alarming and unprecedented  rate of global warming    the pace and scale of change already underway in the global economy is remarkable and irreversible   said stephanie pfeifer  head of the institutional investors group on climate change  a forum with  trillion euros    trillion  in assets under management    renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source  electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created very rapidly in clean energy   she said   the u s  target under paris  set by obama  is to cut emissions by between  and  percent below  levels by  as part of global efforts to avert more downpours  droughts  heatwaves and floods   trump s pro coal policies are likely to make u s  emissions cuts less ambitious   by staying in the paris agreement  trump would also undermine a demand in its article  that successive national climate plans have to be ever deeper cuts  a u s  pullout would make it easier for backers to argue that the principle has not been violated   the paris agreement sets an over riding goal of limiting global warming to  well below  two degrees celsius    fahrenheit  above pre industrial times  the united nations says that current pledges are insufficient to meet that goal          euros
