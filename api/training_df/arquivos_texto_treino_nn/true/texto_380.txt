washington  reuters    when republicans tried to repeal and replace obamacare over the summer  they acted like  a bunch of free range chickens   said republican senator john kennedy   everybody was upset  tired  mad  people drawing lines in the dirt   not this time  republican leader mitch mcconnell and the rest of his party s senate leadership brought party members into line this week and finally won passage of a sweeping tax overhaul early on saturday  late arm twisting and deal sweeteners for wavering lawmakers allowed them to push through legislation that aims to slash corporate taxes and cut personal taxes  democrats complained it was a bad deal for middle class and poor americans and would irresponsibly raise the national debt by    trillion over the next decade  but they were outnumbered and republicans  discipline  in short supply for much of this year  saw the bill through    the debate revealed how the republican party is undergoing a transformation under president donald trump  republicans who fight above all for a balanced budget no longer wield the power they once had    i feel somewhat like a dinosaur   deficit hawk bob corker admitted on friday afternoon  hours later  he was the only republican to vote against the bill  fear also played a role  the risk of a backlash from wealthy donors and conservative supporters if the party failed to deliver on another campaign promise ahead of mid term elections next year helped party leaders get the legislation approved in a   vote   i think after failing twice on healthcare  folks went back home and talked to the real people of america   said kennedy   and they were told   look  we sent you up there to fix our problems  fix them or we ll find somebody who will    mcconnell needed  of the  republicans in the senate to back the tax bill  knowing vice president mike pence was on hand to provide the tie breaking vote if needed  mcconnell could only count on  votes on wednesday night  nine other republican members were wobbly and he had no support from senate democrats   mcconnell and his allies went to work  offering a wide range  of late concessions to holdouts to get a political victory after months of frustration   the bill still needs to be reconciled with a different version approved by the house of representatives  but the senate bill is expected to remain largely intact  led by corker and jeff flake  a small group of fiscal conservatives were at first upset that the senate bill was going to increase fiscal deficits and the national debt  early efforts to get their support went slowly   it s been pretty hard to make them happy so far  we re going to keep working on it  as we always have  and we ll get to the finish line   senator orrin hatch said on thursday night  flake came around when he was able to win two concessions  first  he got a commitment from senate leadership and the trump administration to put a time limit on allowing companies to write off the full value of new capital investments  second  pence assured flake the administration would work with him on fair and permanent protections for illegal immigrants who came to the united states as children  two other fiscal conservatives  james lankford and jerry moran  also came on board  although corker refused to yield  the others  votes were enough to ensure victory    senator ron johnson demanded and won amendments to further ease the tax burden on  pass through  businesses   i was just kind of biding my time     and then senator portman came over and said  what can we do     johnson said of a thursday night vote      even moderate senator susan collins  who helped scuttle obamacare repeal efforts earlier this year  agreed to vote in favor of the tax bill   representing voters with a high state tax burden in maine  collins was against her party s plan to end the deduction of state and local property taxes  under an amendment she pushed  taxpayers would be allowed to deduct up to    a year   collins also said she was assured by republican leaders that they would take steps soon to mitigate damage caused by the repeal of a fee linked to the obamacare  individual mandate   which requires some americans to buy health insurance   mcconnell also got lucky in that trump didn t make his job any harder  unlike his conduct in the obamacare debate  trump largely stayed on message  proclaiming the tax bill would help the middle class and businesses  although incorrect  he also claimed it would be the biggest tax cut ever  trump met with republican senators on capitol hill for lunch this week  a gathering described as thoughtful and positive   nobody called anybody names or talked about anybody s native american heritage  or anything   said kennedy  referring to trump s habit of picking fights with perceived enemies  democrats were furious  saying republicans were throwing money at the rich and that the bill was handled too fast   if the economy grows or shrinks  if it creates jobs or loses them  who knows  certainly no one here  no one could know  because it hasn t even been read  let alone thoughtfully considered   said senate democratic leader chuck shumer
