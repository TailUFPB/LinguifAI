washington  reuters    in a highly unusual intervention  secretary of state rex tillerson plans to remove iraq and myanmar from a u s  list of the world s worst offenders in the use of child soldiers  disregarding the recommendations of state department experts and senior u s  diplomats  u s  officials said  the decision  confirmed by three u s  officials  would break with longstanding protocol at the state department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights   tillerson overruled his own staff s assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in asia and the middle east who wanted to keep iraq and myanmar on the list  said the officials  who have knowledge of the internal deliberations  tillerson also rejected an internal state department proposal to add afghanistan to the list  the three u s  officials said  one official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the pentagon to avoid complicating  assistance to the iraqi and afghan militaries  close u s  allies in the fight against islamist militants  the officials spoke on condition of anonymity  foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving u s  military aid  training and u s  made weapons unless the white house issues a waiver  human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting  which was expected to be announced on tuesday  the officials said  as part of the state department s annual trafficking in persons  tip  report  a state department official said the tip report s contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department  does not discuss details of internal deliberations   the pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment  under the child soldiers prevention act of   the u s  government must be satisfied that  no children are recruited  conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers  in order for a country to be removed from the list and u s  military assistance to resume  in the lead up to tuesday s report  the state department s bureau of democracy  human rights  and labor  which researches the issue and helps shape u s  policy on it  along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in asia and the middle east concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list  the officials said  officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last minute changes  human rights watch said removing myanmar  formerly known as burma  from the list would be a  completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses   the decision also would put the trump administration at odds with the united nations  which continues to list the myanmar military  along with seven ethnic armed groups  on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers   what s particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the u n  in burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited  by the myanmar military  said phil robertson  deputy asia director at human rights watch  rights groups have long accused myanmar of using child soldiers  bordering both china and india  myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the united states at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by china  which has sought closer relations with its neighbor  iraq  which has received more than   billion in u s  arms and training over the last three years  was added to the state department s  child soldier prevention act list  in   however  the flow of u s  assistance has continued  former president barack obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly  including last year to iraq  myanmar  nigeria  south sudan and others out of  countries on the list  last year s state department report said some militias of iraq s popular mobilization forces  pmf   an umbrella group of mostly shi ite muslim factions with ties to the iraqi government and backed by iran   recruited and used child soldiers   the report said that despite the pmf being funded by the government  baghdad struggled to control all of its factions   the government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the pmf and pmf affiliated militias       human rights watch said in january that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one iraqi refugee camp since last spring      the broader tip report  the first of trump s presidency  is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his  america first  approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments  especially strategically important ones  for human rights violations at home  the obama administration  while more vocal about political repression around the world  also faced criticism from human rights groups and some u s  lawmakers that decisions on annual human trafficking rankings had become increasingly politicized
