new york  reuters    the administration of u s  president donald trump opposed opening the door to grandparents from six muslim majority countries on monday  arguing in a court filing that the government s interpretation of how to implement its temporary travel ban is based on u s  immigration law  the u s  supreme court in a ruling last monday revived parts of trump s march  executive order that banned people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  which had been blocked by lower courts  the highest court let the ban go forward with a limited scope  saying that it cannot apply to anyone with credible  bona fide relationship  with a u s  person or entity  trump said the measure was necessary to prevent terrorist attacks  but opponents  including states and refugee advocacy groups  sued to stop it  disputing its security rationale and saying it discriminates against muslims  after the supreme court ruling  the government said that a  bona fide relationship  means close family members only  parents  spouses  siblings and children  grandparents  grandchildren  aunts  uncles  nieces  nephews and cousins from the six countries would still be banned   the government s definition   hews closely to the categorical determinations articulated by congress in the immigration and nationality act   department of justice lawyers argued in court papers on monday    the government s filing came after the state of hawaii last week went to u s  district judge derrick watson in honolulu  who originally ruled to block the ban  to seek clarification of the supreme court s ruling  arguing the government s definition of  bona fide relationship  was too narrow  the government said hawaii  and refugee organizations that filed a  friend of the court  brief in support of the state  were seeking to apply  broader  free hand rules   the refugee organizations had argued that their work to resettle refugees  a process that can take years of work in coordination with the u s  government  qualifies as a  bona fide  relationship with a u s  entity  any refugees with such a relationship should be exempt from the three month ban on refugees included in the executive order  according to the supreme court ruling   but the government said workers with offers of employment with a u s  company and international students are fundamentally different than refugees receiving help from u s  resettlement agencies   a refugee s relationship with the agency flows from the government  not from an independent relationship between the refugee and the resettlement agency   the government said in its brief   indeed  resettlement agencies typically do not have any direct contact with the refugees they assure before their arrival in the united states    using the organization s interpretation would make the refugee provisions in the executive order  largely meaningless   the government said   u s  refugee resettlement is continuing as normal until july   the state department has said  around when the   cap for the fiscal year set by trump s executive order is likely to be reached   late on thursday  before the ban went into effect  the government reversed its position on fianc√©s  saying they could also qualify for exceptions  the court filing described a  hour scramble to  coordinate among multiple government agencies  and issue detailed guidance  on how to implement the supreme court s ruling   the roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued on friday compared to in january when trump first signed a more expansive version of the order  sparking protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world
