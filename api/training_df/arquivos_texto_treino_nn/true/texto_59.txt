 reuters    democratic leaning states may take legal action to challenge the cap on deductions of state and local taxes under the sweeping overhaul of the u s  tax code  and even though such lawsuits would face long odds they could help galvanize democrats for next year s mid term election  the u s  tax bill  passed by republicans in congress on wednesday  limits deductions of state and local income and property taxes  known as salt  to     the provision hits hardest democratic leaning states with high incomes  high property values and high taxes  like new york  new jersey and california   law professors said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states  rights under the u s  constitution  some political strategists see a win for democrats regardless of how courts ultimately rule  saying that lawsuits could be used to keep the issue front and center for voters already largely disenchanted with the republican party   it s a no brainer for them to do this   said democratic political consultant phil singer   failing to aggressively pursue a remedy would be political malpractice   new jersey governor elect phil murphy said during an appearance on cnbc on wednesday that  everything is on the table  for new jersey to oppose the bill  including challenging its  legality and constitutionality    the governors of california and new york  jerry brown and andrew cuomo  have both previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits  their offices did not return requests for comment on wednesday  since president donald trump took office  blue states have aggressively used the courts to attempt to block the president s agenda  suing over his proposed travel ban  environmental policies and other measures  william o reilly  a conservative political consultant in new york  said the salt deduction issue would likely add to republicans   suburbia problem  among college educated voters ahead of the  midterm elections   they already had one because of this president s style   o reilly said  darien shanske  a tax law professor at the university of california davis school of law  said the governors would probably argue that restricting the salt deduction  which dates back to the introduction of the federal income tax in   violates the u s  constitution s  amendment that protects states  rights  shanske and other tax experts said the federalism argument would need to overcome the u s  supreme court s historically broad interpretations of congress   amendment power to impose taxes   as a general matter  nothing prevents the federal government from changing the salt deduction   said david gamage  a professor of tax law at indiana university s maurer school of law  in a frequently cited  decision  the supreme court called tax deductions a  legislative grace  rather than a right  and said congress has broad leeway to abolish them  the court reiterated this view in a  decision allowing congress to remove a federal tax exemption for interest on some state and local bonds   kirk stark  a professor of tax law at the university of california  los angeles school of law  said there is a slight possibility that a federalism argument against limiting the salt deduction could gain traction   courts create new law all the time   he said  noting that decisions on matters this sweeping tend to become political  but some legal experts noted that the state s rights argument is more typically a conservative position  using it to challenge the salt provision could be a move that democratic governors come to regret in the future  said daniel hemel  a professor at the university of chicago law school     the progressive agenda depends on the federal government being able to raise revenue and the supreme court not getting in the way of that   hemel said
