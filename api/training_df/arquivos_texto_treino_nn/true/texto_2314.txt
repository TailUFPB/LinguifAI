washington  reuters    president donald trump pressured the mexican president to stop voicing opposition in public to his plan to have mexico pay for a border wall  according to transcripts of phone calls published on thursday that gave an insight into trump s attempts to influence foreign leaders in his first days in office  the washington post published texts of sometimes fraught calls with mexico s enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull just days after the republican took office on jan    the substance of the calls has previously been reported but the lengthy transcripts reveal trump  whose first elected office is the presidency  trying to use a mixture of bluster  tough talk and charm as he fully enters the world of diplomacy  trump argued with turnbull over refugees in an acrimonious call on jan   which the new u s  president told his counterpart was  unpleasant   in a jan   call  trump pressed pena nieto to avoid saying in public that mexico would not fund the planned border wall  but he complimented the mexican leader s  beautiful words  and said he hoped mexico would change its constitution to allow pena nieto to extend his stay in office  the proposed wall  aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the united states  is a bone of contention between mexico and washington  pena nieto has repeatedly rejected trump s promise that mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction       trump told the mexican leader in the call that  if you are going to say that mexico is not going to pay for the wall  then i do not want to meet with you guys anymore because i cannot live with that   according to the transcript    you cannot say that to the press   trump said      pena nieto had earlier scrapped a plan to hold talks with trump in the united states due to tensions over the wall and trade  the two men have since met  holding talks at a summit of the group of  nations in germany last month              the white house has said the u s  government will pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work       both the white house and mexico s foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on thursday about the release of the call transcripts  it was the latest in a series of leaks from inside trump s administration which have angered the president  the republican won some sympathy over leaks from a political opponent on thursday    i am alarmed at leaks of conversations between two heads of state   democratic u s  senator brian schatz wrote on twitter   it doesn t matter what i think of this president  this is terrible    in the conversation with pena nieto  trump said both leaders were  in a little bit of a political bind  due to trump s campaign pledge to build the wall and have mexico foot the bill   i have to have mexico pay for the wall   i have to  i have been talking about it for a two year period   trump said                      he suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked       they are going to say   who is going to pay for the wall  mr  president   to both of us  and we should both say   we will work it out    trump said   it will work out in the formula somehow  as opposed to you saying   we will not pay  and me saying   we will not pay    the u s  president said     pena nieto said he understood trump s position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking  a creative way to jump over this obstacle   toward the end of their conversation  trump responded effusively to a comment by pena nieto about the mexican leader s wish for a constructive relationship with the united states       your words are so beautiful  those are beautiful words and i do not think i can speak that beautifully  okay   trump said   i want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in mexico so that you can run again for another six years   he said  by law  mexican presidents can only serve one six year term   drug infested den  in comments likely to upset voters in new hampshire   an important early voting state in the u s  presidential election primaries   trump described the state as  a drug infested den     i won new hampshire because new hampshire is a drug infested den   he said  complaining that drugs from mexico are damaging the united states  while trump won the republican primary there  he narrowly lost the state to democratic rival hillary clinton in the general election      new hampshire officials from both parties lashed out at trump  with several saying his push to repeal the obamacare healthcare law would worsen the nation s opioid crisis  speaking to australia s turnbull  trump became irritated that the united states was expected to honor an agreement made by his democratic predecessor  barack obama  to accept as many as   refugees held in australian processing centers on remote pacific islands  trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the united states  according to the transcript   this is going to kill me  i am the world s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country   trump said         seeking to win trump s support  turnbull on friday said washington could honor the deal while taking as few as  refugees from the two offshore centers  should the rest fail to satisfy its vetting   it has always been subject to american vetting procedures   turnbull told reporters in western australia state   those procedures from the department of homeland security are ongoing   the dialogue was a  frank conversation between adults   he added  trump told turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day  after speaking to russian president vladimir putin and others   i have had it  i have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day   trump said   putin was a pleasant call  this is ridiculous
