san francisco  reuters    a proposal by the u s  senate to change the way shares in startup companies are taxed incited panic and dread in silicon valley on monday  with startup founders and investors warning of nothing less than the demise of their industry should the proposal become law  the provision in the senate s tax reform plan  which appeared to catch the industry by surprise  involves the treatment of employee stock options  these options give the holder the right to purchase shares in the future at a set price and can be very valuable if a company does well and the share price increases  options are often a major portion of the compensation for  startup employees and founders  who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off  options typically vest over a four year period  senate republicans have now proposed taxing those stock options as they vest and before startup employees have the opportunity to cash them in  resulting in annual tax bills that could easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars  say startup founders and venture capitalists   if there were a single piece of legislation to adversely affect startups  it would be this   said venky ganesan  managing director at venture capital firm menlo ventures   everyone is freaked out   justin field  vice president of government affairs at the national venture capital association  said that the senate s proposed tax change would be  crippling  to the startup industry  how far the provision gets remains to be seen  the national venture capital association was successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the house tax bill  although it  didn t fully appreciate  the senate s intention to add the tax provision  field said  the association also helped to steer lawmakers away from a proposal discussed late last year to tax venture capitalists  profits on investments at a higher rate  republican senator rob portman of ohio  a member of the senate committee on finance  has filed an amendment to repeal the provision in the tax bill  according to his spokesman   under current tax code  employees are taxed only when they exercise their options  options are exercised when the price they were granted at known as the strike price is lower than the share price  and some shares can then be sold to pay the taxes  but the senate proposal would require startup employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of their stock options even before they are exercised  these options are illiquid assets  and cannot be spent or saved   what this would mean is every month  when your equity compensation vests a little bit  you will owe taxes on it even though you can t do anything with that equity compensation   fred wilson  a venture capitalist with union square ventures  wrote on his blog monday  for instance  if a startup employee receives stock options at a dollar per share  and the shares increase in value by   every year during the four year vesting period  the employee would have to pay income tax on   per share after the first year  pay again on the   increase in value after the second year  and so on  when that employee owns hundreds of thousands and even millions of shares  that is a hefty bill to pay  and there is always the risk the startup will eventually fail   this reform will force the average employee to pay taxes on that bet well before they even know if it s a winning ticket   said amanda kahlow  founder and executive chairman of marketing data startup   for startup founders in particular  such a tax bill could be ruinous    it would mean that i would have to sell the company   said shoaib makani  founder and chief executive of long haul trucking startup keeptruckin   i have zero net worth aside from the common stock i hold in the company  it would be impossible  i would be in default   some executives in the startup industry  however  have pushed for companies to move toward bigger salaries so employees are not so dependent on options to buy a house or pay for other large expenses  and when startups suffer valuation cuts  employees can end up with worthless options  the senate s proposal came as a revenue generating measure to help offset tax breaks in the bill  a spokesman for senator orrin hatch  a republican and chairman of the senate committee on finance  did not respond to requests for comment and other republicans on the committee were not immediately available   a spokeswoman for senator ron wyden  the committee s ranking member and a democrat  said he was aware of concerns that the provision would limit startups  ability to attract talent
