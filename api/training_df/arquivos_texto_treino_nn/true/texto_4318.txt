washington  reuters    the trump administration must decide by the end of this month whether to grant belarus continued relief from u s  economic sanctions despite a stiff government crackdown on street demonstrations last month  the renewal decision is considered a low level priority for the administration  which is facing bigger questions about u s  relations with russia and china  and with most major diplomatic positions still unfilled  but whether the united states renews the sanctions relief or instead returns to blacklisting nine major belarus companies is an early test for the trump administration on the importance it puts on human rights versus efforts to coax countries in russia s orbit to turn to the west  the sanctions waivers  which began in  and were extended twice last year  were tied to domestic political reforms and intended to encourage belarus  which has long historical ties to russia  to move closer to the european union and the united states  now  however  u s  officials are alarmed by the arrests of hundreds of people last month during an attempt to hold a street protest in the capital minsk  and concerned if continuing sanctions relief could be seen as ignoring the crackdown  belarus authorities last month raided a human rights group s offices and used violence against peaceful protesters  rights groups say   this most recent crackdown sharpened people s focus   said a u s  congressional aide  speaking on the condition of anonymity   now there is a real question about whether or not they  the sanctions  should be reimposed   the decision must be taken by the end of april  if the administration makes no decision  the sanctions will be re imposed  nato members  including poland and the baltic states  feel threatened by what they see as increased russian intervention in europe  including moscow s annexation of ukraine s crimea region in    belarus is so important from a strategic point of view and it s so dependent economically on russia that we are really very concerned   said piotr wilczek  the polish ambassador to the united states   belarus is becoming more and more part of this wider russian problem we have   the trump administration is inclined to renew the sanctions relief  but likely would wait until the last minute  to make sure they don t do anything awful   said a u s  official  also speaking on condition of anonymity  state and treasury department officials declined to comment in detail on the belarus sanctions  the belarus ministry of foreign affairs declined to comment  president george w  bush in  blacklisted top belarus officials  including president alexander lukashenko  for undermining the country s democratic processes or human rights abuses  the united states later added large belarus companies to the sanctions list  but in   lukashenko released political prisoners and indicated he was open to better relations with the west  that october  president barack obama temporarily lifted sanctions on nine belarus companies  including petrochemical conglomerate belneftekhim and tire manufacturer belshina   now  however  lukashenko appears to be keeping his country firmly in moscow s orbit  in a letter to him last week  four u s  senators said they were concerned over the crackdown and that he decided to allow russia to conduct  provocative  military exercises in belarus later this year
