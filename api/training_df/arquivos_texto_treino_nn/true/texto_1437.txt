washington  reuters    u s  defense secretary jim mattis on tuesday played down an apparent split between the u s  president and his top diplomat over outreach to north korea  saying america s focus was still on finding a diplomatic solution to the dispute with pyongyang  president donald trump  who has traded insults and threats with north korean leader kim jong un in recent weeks  said on sunday secretary of state rex tillerson was  wasting his time  trying to negotiate with north korea over its nuclear weapons program  tillerson  during a trip to china on saturday  said the united states had direct channels of communication with the north and was probing pyongyang to see if it was interested in dialogue  he expressed hope for reducing tensions with north korea  which is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland   i do not see the divergence as strongly as some     have interpreted it   mattis said  both mattis and marine general joseph dunford  chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  broadly backed tillerson s efforts as they testified at the hearing before the senate armed services committee   president trump s guidance to both secretary tillerson and me has been very clearly that we would     pursue the diplomatic effort to include with the various initiatives with china   mattis told a senate hearing   i believe that secretary tillerson is accurately stating that we are probing for opportunities to talk with the north  all we re doing is probing  we re not talking with them  consistent with the president s dismay about not talking with them before the time is right   trump has vowed to halt north korea s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months  with pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept    it has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific  dunford  the top u s  military officer  strongly backed tillerson s efforts to tighten an economic squeeze on north korea  the international community s sanctions will need to be strong enough to convince kim he cannot survive in power unless he changes course  he said  dunford said kim sees possession of ballistic missiles and a nuclear capability as inextricably linked to regime survival  adding   what i think kim jong un needs to realize is that he cannot survive with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons because the international community will not allow him to survive   dunford said kim was particularly sensitive to the flow of oil into north korea  saying when there has been a cut off in the past  there s been a change in kim jong un s behavior    the fact is he needs economic resources external to the country to survive   he said  u s  senator jack reed questioned whether some degree of communication was vital between washington and pyongyang  given the risks of miscalculation by either side that could lead to conflict  mattis suggested that the trump administration was exploring a host of ways to influence the north  including through diplomacy   i think the president dispatching secretary tillerson to beijing here within the past several days to carry messages and to look at the way we can work with them is the most accurate answer to your question  that in fact this is part of a whole     integrated effort that we have underway right now   mattis said  it was not the first time the white house and state department have seemed at odds on policy issues  but the white house has said trump still had confidence in tillerson  trump has vowed to halt north korea s nuclear ambitions and tensions have escalated in recent months  with pyongyang conducting its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept    it has also threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific  the fate of americans held in north korea is also a bone of contention  the trump administration has demanded north korea release three u s  citizens it has detained  missionary kim dong chul and academics tony kim and kim hak song  the trump white house and state department have taken divergent stances on other foreign policy issues  when a dispute over qatar erupted this year  trump strongly backed gulf arab leaders who accuse qatar of supporting iran as well as islamist militants   trump accused qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism even as the pentagon and tillerson cautioned against the military  commercial and humanitarian effects of a boycott imposed by arab states  months into the dispute  trump adopted a position more in line with that of the state department
