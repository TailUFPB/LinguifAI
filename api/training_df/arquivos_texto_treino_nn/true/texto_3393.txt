new york washington  reuters    president donald trump accused his own justice department on monday of watering down his temporary travel ban on people from several predominantly muslim countries  potentially hurting his case in the supreme court on the matter  in a series of early morning twitter messages  trump returned to the issue of the travel ban that he raised immediately after an attack in london on saturday night that killed  people and wounded    legal experts said trump s tweets could complicate his legal team s defense of the ban  since they contradict some of the arguments the government s lawyers are making in court  trump has presented the measure  which seeks to halt entry to the united states for  days for people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen and bar refugees for four months  as essential to prevent attacks in the united states   critics suing the government  including states and civil rights groups  say there is little national security justification for the move and the ban is discriminatory against muslims  federal courts have stopped it from being enforced   the justice dept  should have stayed with the original travel ban  not the watered down  politically correct version they submitted to s c    trump tweeted  referring to the country s highest court    the justice dept  should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court     seek much tougher version    federal courts struck down trump s first temporary travel ban  an executive order he issued a week after taking office on jan   to overcome the legal hurdles  he replaced it with a new order in march  the second ban was also put on hold by courts  the justice department says the courts should look only at the text of the order  not at the president s comments during the  election campaign about imposing a ban on muslims   his tweets invite the question  if the second ban is  politically correct   what is un p c  about the original  and the answer is obvious  trump told us it s about banning muslims   said micah schwartzman  a professor at the university of virginia school of law   trump  whose populist brand of politics includes criticizing political correctness as an evasion of uncomfortable truths  called in a statement on his campaign website for a  complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states    the president s tweets may help encourage his base  but they can t help him in court   said jonathan adler  a professor at the case western reserve university school of law   trump s legal team asked the supreme court last week to reverse rulings by lower courts and allow the revised travel ban to go into effect immediately  at issue before the court is whether the travel curbs violate the u s  constitution s ban on favoring one religion over another   the revised order removed language barring legal permanent residents and a clause that protected religious minorities  it also removed iraq from the list of targeted countries  trump said in an interview with the christian broadcasting network shortly after signing the first ban that it would help syrian christians fleeing the country s civil war  a comment lawyers challenging the ban have pointed to as a sign it meant to favor christians over muslims  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump agreed to modify the language of the first order in an effort to satisfy the concerns of a federal appeals court that halted it  but he preferred the stronger action   he wants to go as far and as strong as possible under the constitution to protect the people in this country   sanders told a news briefing on monday  neal katyal  an attorney for the state of hawaii  which  challenged the revised ban  said the president s comments only bolstered its case   it s kinda odd to have the defendant in hawaii v trump acting as our co counsel  we don t need the help but will take it   katyal said in a tweeted response to trump s posts on monday            trump also tweeted on monday that his administration was implementing tougher vetting of would be visitors to the united states  adding   the courts are slow and political   legal experts said that comment could also undermine the government s case that the travel ban is urgently needed  given the government has said the temporary travel restrictions would free up resources to put in place tougher screening protocols  last week  the administration rolled out new policies on visa applications for some people who are deemed subject to greater scrutiny     u s  senator ben cardin  who is the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee and opposes the ban  said on cnn the tweets showed the republican president s disdain for the judicial branch  trump needs five votes from the nine judge supreme court in his favor to put the ban into effect  with the confirmation of trump s supreme court pick earlier this year  the court retains a   conservative majority  while the lower courts that have ruled thus far have been more liberal leaning   peter margulies  an immigration expert at roger williams university school of law in rhode island  said of trump s tweets   to the extent that trump is sort of a bull in a china shop  that might make the supreme court nervous    on friday  the supreme court asked the challengers of the travel ban to file responses to the emergency request by june   trump s administration would then likely to file its own response before the court s nine justices make their decision  white house senior adviser kellyanne conway defended trump s tweets following the london attack  in an nbc interview on monday  she cited a media  obsession with covering everything he says on twitter and very little of what he does as president
