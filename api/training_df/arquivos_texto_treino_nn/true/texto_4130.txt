washington spring  tx   reuters    the united states will not make an exception for american companies  including oil major exxon mobil corp  seeking to drill in areas prohibited by u s  sanctions on russia  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday  the unusually direct statement served to clarify that the united states would maintain a tough stance on sanctions against moscow    in consultation with president donald j  trump  the treasury department will not be issuing waivers to u s  companies  including exxon  authorizing drilling prohibited by current russian sanctions   mnuchin said in a statement  the united states and european union imposed economic sanctions on russia over its annexation of the crimea region in  and its role in the conflict in eastern ukraine  the sanctions forced exxon  the world s largest publicly traded oil producer  to wind down drilling in russia s arctic in    we understand the statement today by secretary mnuchin in consultation with president trump   exxon spokesman alan jeffers said  exxon had asked for and received in  and  waivers to operate a joint venture with russian oil producer rosneft in russia  european union sanctions do not keep european oil companies from operating in russia  a point of annoyance for exxon  the wall street journal reported this week that exxon had in recent months applied for a treasury department waiver to drill with rosneft  jeffers said exxon had not applied for waivers from treasury since trump took office  any such request would have drawn attention because exxon s former chief executive  rex tillerson  is now u s  secretary of state  under his leadership  exxon lobbied congress on russia sanctions  and tillerson opposed sanctions against russia in   saying they would be ineffective  u s  lawmakers are investigating possible ties between some trump campaign aides and moscow  republicans in congress as well as u s  allies in europe are anxious about any sign that the trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on russia  during his confirmation hearing in january  tillerson said he never personally lobbied against sanctions and that he was not aware of exxon mobil directly doing so  later acknowledging that he spoke to former u s  treasury secretary jack lew regarding gaps between american and european sanctions on russia  tillerson has pledged to recuse himself until the end of this year from any matter involving exxon mobil unless he is authorized to participate  he also has until early may to sell his exxon mobil stock  u s  companies frequently file license applications to the treasury department asking permission to undertake activities that would otherwise be barred by sanctions  the u s  government weighs each application based on national security interests  the law and other factors  the refusal is unlikely to affect exxon mobil s bottom line  as it has not been able to operate in russia for several years  but it does hinder its growth potential  treasury almost never comments publicly on license applications  mnuchin s statement will likely serve to clarify the u s  stance on sanctions against russia at a time when american allies are looking for clues to u s  policy  observers said   it s good from a regulatory perspective as it provides clarity to u s  companies  but it s also great from a foreign policy perspective   edward fishman  a fellow at the atlantic council think tank and former state department official during the obama administration  said of mnuchin s statement   any uncertainty about the future of sanctions scares our allies and encourages russia to prolong its aggression in ukraine
