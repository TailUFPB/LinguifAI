 reuters    former federal bureau of investigation director james comey will testify on june  before a congressional committee investigating russia s alleged meddling in the  u s  presidential election  comey is expected to tell the senate intelligence committee that president donald trump asked him to drop an investigation into former white house national security adviser michael flynn s ties to russia  trump fired comey on may    legal experts say that trump could invoke a doctrine called executive privilege to try to stop comey from testifying  but such a maneuver would draw a backlash and could be challenged in court  they said  the following describes how executive privilege works and why it could backfire on trump if he invokes it  what is executive privilege  executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows the president to withhold information from other government branches  the u s  supreme court ruled in  in u s  v nixon that executive privilege can only be used in limited circumstances  such as protecting national security or preserving the confidentiality of sensitive communications within the executive branch  how would trump invoke the privilege to block comey s testimony  before invoking executive privilege  the president typically obtains a written memorandum justifying the decision from the office of legal counsel  a division of the department of justice  the white house counsel is often informally involved in the decision  after invoking the privilege  the president can direct current and former government officials to not divulge information   have presidents invoked executive privilege in the past  the term was not coined until the   but most presidents have invoked some version of it  said mark rozell  a professor of government at george mason university  president barack obama asserted the privilege in  to block congress from seeing documents relating to an investigation into fast and furious  a botched gunrunning operation conducted by the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives  what are the odds that trump would legally succeed in blocking comey s testimony  legal experts said trump would face an uphill climb if he asserted executive privilege to stop comey from testifying before the congressional committee  trump likely would argue that comey s testimony involves confidential conversations or matters of national security  but that claim would be undercut by the fact that the president has publicly discussed and tweeted about his conversations with comey  said rozell  trump faces another hurdle if he tries to block comey s testimony  if trump pressured comey to drop the flynn investigation  as comey is expected to testify  then trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice  according to some lawyers  executive privilege cannot be used to  cover up government misconduct   said andrew wright  a professor at savannah law school   if trump invoked the privilege  could comey disregard it  typically a president uses executive privilege to prevent government employees from releasing information  comey is now a private citizen who does not have to worry about losing his job if he does not comply  rozell said he knows of no legal sanction for ignoring an assertion of executive privilege  but that it would be  unprecedented  for an assertion of the privilege to be ignored   could trump be challenged in court if he asserts executive privilege  the president and congress typically hammer out a compromise when they disagree about whether privilege can be asserted  said rozell   but there are instances of executive privilege being challenged in court  when obama cited the privilege to block the release of documents relating to fast and furious  congress sued and asked a judge to direct then attorney general eric holder to comply with its subpoena  a judge ruled last year that the justice department s public disclosures about the controversy undercut the president s executive privilege claim  saying that the justice department had already publicly revealed much of the information it said should be kept private  it would be procedurally complicated to challenge a decision by trump to block comey s testimony  first  congress would have to issue a subpoena requiring comey to testify  then congress would have to find comey in contempt if he refused  congress could then ask a federal judge to force comey to comply with its subpoena  that litigation would lead to a ruling on whether trump lawfully invoked executive privilege   there is a path to judicial review  but a lot of things would have to take place   wright said  what are the political risks if trump tries to assert privilege  trump would surely face public criticism if he tries to stop comey s testimony  rozell said  critics could claim trump is using privilege to thwart questions about potential ties between russia and flynn and russia s alleged influence on the election   that s the rub with executive privilege  it makes it look like you have something to hide   rozell said
