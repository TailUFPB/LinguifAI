washington  reuters    president donald trump said on wednesday he would ban transgender people from the u s  military  a move appealing to some in his conservative political base but creating uncertainty about the fate of thousands of transgender service members  the surprise announcement by trump  who as a presidential candidate last year vowed to fight for lesbians  gays  bisexuals and transgender people  came in a series of morning twitter posts  it drew condemnation from rights groups and some lawmakers in both parties as politically motivated discrimination but was praised by conservative activists and some republicans  the administration has not determined whether transgender individuals already serving in the military would be immediately thrown out  a point the white house and pentagon have yet to decide  trump spokeswoman sarah sanders said  a transgender ban would reverse democratic former president barack obama s policy and halts years of efforts to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexual orientation or gender identity   after consultation with my generals and military experts  please be advised that the united states government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the u s  military   trump tweeted  without naming any of the generals or experts   our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail   he said  sanders said trump had  extensive discussions with his national security team   and defense secretary jim mattis was informed after the president made the decision on tuesday   this was about military readiness   sanders told a briefing   this was about unit cohesion  this was about resources within the military  and nothing more   the pentagon earlier referred questions about trump s decision to the white house  critics said the health costs of caring for transgender service members were a tiny portion of the military s healthcare budget and trump s policy change was based on prejudice  his action unleashed a torrent of legal threats from civil liberties advocates seeking plaintiffs willing to challenge the ban in court and sparked a protest by hundreds who rallied outside an armed forces recruiting station in manhattan s times square   we are in a crisis  this is a dark day for everyone   brad hoylman  new york s sole openly gay state senator  said as he addressed the crowd  which carried  resist  signs amid chants of   hey hey  ho ho  donald trump has got to go   trump s tweet caught some white house officials by surprise   a senior administration official said trump had been determined to act for a while but the question was the timing  with advisers split on whether to conduct reviews before announcing the move  the announcement at least temporarily changed the subject in washington  where trump s administration faces investigations into his presidential campaign s contacts with russia and has struggled to win major legislative victories  it was not the first time trump has targeted transgender people since taking office in january  in february  he rescinded protections for transgender students put in place by obama that had let them use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity  senate armed forces committee chairman john mccain   the most prominent military veteran in congress  who was a navy pilot and prisoner of war during the vietnam war   called trump s announcement unclear and inappropriate until a pentagon study on the issue is completed and reviewed by mattis  the military leadership and lawmakers  tony perkins  president of the family research council advocacy group  was among those praising trump  saying   our troops shouldn t be forced to endure hours of transgender  sensitivity  classes and politically correct distractions   under obama  the pentagon last year announced it was ending its ban on transgender people serving openly  calling the prohibition outdated  the defense department had been expected to begin formally allowing transgender people to enlist this year  but mattis on june  approved a six month delay in that step  transgender service members already number about   active duty personnel  with about   more in the military reserves  according to a rand corporation think tank study cited last year by obama s defense secretary  ash carter   to choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military   carter said on wednesday  noting the existing ranks of transgender individuals serving  capably and honorably   advocacy groups said trump s policy was open to legal challenge under the u s  constitution s guarantee of equal protection under the law  american civil liberties union attorney joshua block said trump had rejected the  basic humanity  of transgender service members   there are no cost or military readiness drawbacks associated with allowing trans people to fight for their country   block said   the president is trying to score cheap political points on the backs of military personnel who have put their lives on the line for their country   the house of representatives  top democrat  nancy pelosi  noted that a pentagon commissioned study determined the cost of providing medically necessary transition related care involving transgender service members would amount to about one  of  percent of the military s healthcare budget   the study put the cost at    million to    million a year of the more than   billion the defense department spends on healthcare   once again  president trump has shown his conduct is driven not by honor  decency  or national security  but by raw prejudice   pelosi said  retired colonel sheri swokowski    the highest ranking openly transgender veteran  joined the criticism    transgender people are serving today knowing that their leader frankly doesn t trust them   she said   the bottom line is that this does great harm to people who simply want to serve their country   u s  representative ileana ros lehtinen  a republican whose son is transgender  said on twitter   no american  no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity  should be prohibited from honor   privilege of serving our nation   transgender celebrity caitlyn jenner defended  patriotic transgender americans  in the military and asked trump on twitter   what happened to your promise to fight for them   canada s military also took to twitter on wednesday to say it welcomes citizens  of all sexual orientations and gender identities   adding the hashtag  diversityisourstrength  but vicky hartzler  a republican congresswoman  praised trump for changing obama s  costly and damaging policy   the u s  military s ban on gays serving openly in the armed forces ended under obama in  after congress passed legislation in  reversing a law dubbed  don t ask  don t tell  that had forced the ouster of thousands of service members and others to hide their sexual orientation  the pentagon under obama also opened all combat roles in the military to women  the u s  military at times has been in the vanguard of social progress  trump s action came on the  anniversary of democratic president harry truman racially integrating the armed forces  years before the  and  civil rights battles
