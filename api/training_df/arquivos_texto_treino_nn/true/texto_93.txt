washington  reuters    a u s  district court judge ruled on monday that president donald trump s administration must allow access to abortion for two pregnant teenagers who are in the country illegally  escalating a high profile legal fight  judge tanya chutkan put her order on hold  however  to give the u s  justice department time to appeal her ruling   the justice department filed its notice of appeal shortly afterward to the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  the judge s temporary restraining order marked the latest chapter in a legal dispute with the trump administration over whether minors who are illegal immigrants have the right to seek an abortion during their detention  the issue was ignited by a  year old who petitioned the court in october to have an abortion  and ultimately had the procedure over the trump administration s objections   in that instance  the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit ruled on oct   that the teen could have an abortion immediately  rejecting the administration s opposition  the two  year olds in the latest legal action  known to the court as jane roe and jane poe  requested abortions  but the u s  office of refugee resettlement has refused to allow them access to the procedure  in her ruling  chutkan wrote that the girls    constitutional right to decide whether to carry their pregnancies to term  needed to be preserved   she also noted they were likely to succeed on the legal merits of their case  based on the prior ruling in the higher court   we are deeply disappointed in the decision to grant a temporary restraining order that will compel hhs to facilitate abortions for minors when they are not medically necessary   a spokesman for the u s  department of health and human services said in a statement   a pregnant minor who has entered the country illegally has the option to voluntarily depart to her home country or identify a suitable sponsor  hhs funded facilities that provide temporary shelter and care for unaccompanied alien minors should not become way stations for these children to get taxpayer facilitated abortions
