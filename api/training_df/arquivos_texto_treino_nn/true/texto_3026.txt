 reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday gave president donald trump a victory by allowing his temporary ban on travelers from six muslim majority countries and all refugees to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the united states while agreeing to decide the order s legality this fall  the case is a major test of presidential powers  the justices granted parts of the trump administration s emergency request to put the order into effect immediately while the legal battle continues  the court  which narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked his march  executive order  said it would hear arguments in october on the lawfulness of the ban  the council on american islamic relations  a muslim civil rights and advocacy organization the council expressed its concerns about the supreme court decision in relations to islam saying it  ignores the islamophobic origins of the policy and emboldens islamophobes in the trump administration   ahmed al nasi  official at yemen ministry of expatriate affairs al nasi  whose country is one of the six falling under the ban  also criticized the supreme court decision    we believe it will not help in confronting terrorism and extremism  but rather will increase the feeling among the nationals of these countries that they are all being targeted   he said   especially given that yemen is an active partner of the united states in the war on terrorism and that there are joint operations against terrorist elements in yemen   shaheen expressed disappointment in the court s decision   muslim travel ban has no merit   offensive to our nation s core values   she said on twitter   tom fitton  president of judicial watch  a conservative foundation  fitton praised the supreme court s decision   this is a major blow to anti trump activist judges on the lower courts  and it is a big victory for our nation s security  president trump  and the rule of the law   he said in a statement   david miliband  chief executive of the international rescue committee humanitarian agency and a former british foreign minister miliband said the ruling could hurt refugees who have already been vetted and were slated to come to the united states        the court s decision threatens damage to vulnerable people waiting to come to the u s   people with urgent medical conditions blocked  innocent people left adrift  all of whom have been extensively vetted   he said in a statement   we urge the administration to begin its long delayed review of the vetting process and restart a program which changes lives for the better   michael o rourke  chief market strategist at jonestrading in greenwich  connecticut o rourke said it was not clear if the news on the travel ban was having an impact on stocks    i think it s having a little impact  but i m not sure  it just seemed to be the timing of the headlines    there are a couple of different things floating around      i feel there s a combination of a bunch of little things     and i have a thematic track basket for immigration  and there are a bunch of tech names in there  maybe people are reading into the immigration story there      but we know what policy the president is going to pursue  it s not lining up perfectly for me   eric schwartz  president of refugees international and former u s  assistant secretary of state for population  refugees  and migration schwartz said he was disappointed by the court s decision   the suspension of refugee resettlement will impact the most vulnerable of the world s populations  including refugee women and girls  survivors of violence and torture  and refugee children  among many other groups at considerable risk   he said   the options for organizations like ours are now limited as the supreme court reviews this case   becca heller  director of the international refugee assistance project heller said the parts of the travel ban allowed to go into effect  are actually incredibly narrow    almost anyone coming into the u s  who has a visa or has been in the refugee program for a while     has some kind of tie to a u s  person or a u s  entity   she said   the hope is that this really only impacts a very small number of people   trump praised the court s decision in a statement released by the white house   today s unanimous supreme court decision is a clear victory for our national security   he said   today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation s homeland   democratic senator ed markey of massachusetts  member of the senate foreign relations committee markey said in an interview with cnn that the top court made it clear the trump administration had overreached when it came to businesses  family members and students but expressed concern that the court did not issue a more fundamental ruling             i m disappointed that the court just didn t rule that a muslim ban in and of itself is unconstitutional   markey said  omar jadwat  director of the american civil liberties union s immigrants  rights project jadwat  who argued the appellate case on the executive order  said in a statement   president trump s muslim ban violates the fundamental constitutional principle that government cannot favor or disfavor any one religion  courts have repeatedly blocked this indefensible and discriminatory ban  the supreme court now has a chance to permanently strike it down   william stock  outgoing president of the american immigration lawyers association  stock said the  bona fide connections  to the united states cited by the court as a requirement for admission to the country might include those on employer sponsored visas  family sponsored green card applications  people who are admitted by schools in the united states as students and those collaborating on research with people in the united states    the court seems to be saying if a family in iran had prepaid for disneyland  they probably have a demonstrable connection to the united states that might allow for issuance of a visitor visa   stock said   if a person says  i ve heard of disneyland and i d really like to see it   that probably doesn t get them in   in a statement  perez vowed to keep fighting the ban  which he called unconstitutional and an assault on american religious freedom     as a nation  our diversity is our greatest strength  and we cannot allow such prejudice to shut the doors of progress  democrats will continue to fight this hatred every step of the way   perez said     great news for our national security  the rule of law and  potus   strange said on twitter  referring to trump
