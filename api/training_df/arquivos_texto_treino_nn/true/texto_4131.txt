washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump ordered the treasury department on friday to examine two powers given to regulators to police large financial companies following the  financial crisis  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said  in his first visit to the treasury building  trump signed two memos that analysts view as largely affirming existing priorities he has outlined  one temporarily bars regulators from identifying new non bank financial institutions as  systemically important financial institutions   or sifis  while also ordering a review of this process  mnuchin said in a briefing with reporters  sifis face added regulatory oversight and must hold more capital as a buffer against losses to safeguard against risk to the financial system  the other memo directs regulators to temporarily halt the use of  orderly liquidation authority  to dissolve troubled financial institutions unless the president directs it in an emergency  trump will order a review of this as well  mnuchin said  still  the government has never attempted to use its orderly liquidation authority  the memo directs the treasury to review the authority for  days  focusing on whether it exposes taxpayers to losses and encourages companies to take on more risk  or whether a revamped bankruptcy process would be preferable   critics  including republicans in congress  argue the authority effectively gives some firms  too big to fail  status  which could encourage them to take on more risk and necessitate government intervention if they fail  trump has long said financial sector oversight could curb economic growth  while the two memos indicate that revisiting the rules remains a priority  they overlap with an earlier executive order the president signed in february directing a review of all financial rules  the impact of the memos may be limited  mnuchin had previously said his team was already looking into both the sifi designation process and the use of orderly liquidation  the trump administration has been expected to reduce the number of companies subject to sifi level policing  only two insurers  american international group inc  aig n  and prudential financial inc  pru n   are designated as sifis because they pose a systemic threat to the financial system  banks with more than   billion in assets such as jpmorgan chase  jpm n  and bank of america  bac n  are automatically designated as sifis by law   republicans  who have criticized the sifi process as opaque and arbitrary  have introduced legislation to curb it  the financial stability oversight council  a panel of top regulators that mnuchin now chairs  oversees the process    the president will be instructing me to put a hold on that for designations until we do a thorough review and make sure that it s a fair and transparent process   said mnuchin
