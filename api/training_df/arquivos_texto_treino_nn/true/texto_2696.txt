washington  reuters    for seven years  u s  senator mitch mcconnell vowed to slay obamacare if only his republican party controlled both chambers of congress and the white house  pull it out  root and branch   he pledged  the  year old senate majority leader now has that luxury  but instead of basking in the glow of his first major legislative victory in the donald trump era  mcconnell is what a source close to the majority leader calls  the man in the middle in an impossible spot   late on monday and again on tuesday  after a long struggle  mcconnell s efforts to repeal all or portions of former president barack obama s landmark  affordable care act and replace them with less expensive healthcare came crashing down  with  republican senators in the  member chamber  mcconnell could lose only two of his colleagues on any bill that was opposed by democrats and still win with vice president mike pence casting the tie breaking vote   three times  he failed to muster the  supporters needed   the man who epitomized  the party of no  in democrats  eyes during obama s presidency  especially when he slammed the door in february  on merrick garland s supreme court nomination  fell victim to the  no  of fellow republicans   we finally get a chance to repeal and replace  and they don t take advantage of it   trump  six months into his four year presidential term  said on tuesday  across washington  there was dismay republicans could not deliver on a promise they assert helped them to assume control in january of congress and the white house   i am kind of shocked   said republican representative dave brat  of the conservative firebrand house freedom caucus that has been a thorn in the side of the republican establishment  his hand weakened  mcconnell could be heading into fierce budget battles  a tax reform fight and a storm over legislation avoiding a government debt default that could shake global financial markets  the result has democrats feeling emboldened  months before the next congressional elections  around town  the sphinxlike mcconnell is known as a master of senate rules  able to outfox opponents  giving nothing away until he can strike at just the right moment  the senator s leadership job  a position he yearned for in the years leading up to his  ascension  does not appear to be in jeopardy   but this rocky run calls into question mcconnell s reputation as a master tactician and deal maker that he earned as republican minority leader under the democratic obama  it is  a real blow to republicans in congress generally and to leadership   said former senate majority leader trent lott  a republican   more of the blame sits with the rank and file  lott said   the problem in washington today is not lack of leadership  the problem is lack of followership   had mcconnell succeeded  lott said he would have been  considered a magician  given the inability of republicans to coalesce around healthcare legislation for so many years  a republican operative with ties to mcconnell saw a possible silver lining  failure to pass healthcare could boost chances for tax reform or infrastructure investment if republicans felt it a more urgent political imperative to rack up a win for trump before the november  congressional elections  mcconnell  a courtly kentuckian who can appear at pains to speak to reporters nipping at his heels  won accolades in years past for cutting deals with democrats to keep the government operating and making permanent most of former president george w  bush s tax cuts  those deals involved giving voters government services and lower taxes  but republican healthcare legislation involves taking something away from millions of lower income people   their medical coverage   in part they  republicans  misunderstood how difficult it will be  to repeal and replace obamacare  former senate majority leader tom daschle  a democrat  said in a phone interview  republican rhetoric against obamacare was so  hyperbolic  it had to take priority early in trump s presidency  but senators lacked enthusiasm for legislation  said daschle  who like lott lobbies on behalf of healthcare interests   once boxed into healthcare  mcconnell took another controversial step  one that many republicans questioned  instead of developing a healthcare bill in public   mcconnell and his top aides  with the advice of a  member group of male senators  called the shots  mcconnell said hearings were unnecessary  as healthcare policy had been intensively debated since obama took office in   he said he was listening to suggestions of all of his  fellow republican senators  many senators felt disconnected and tensions boiled over  as monday wore on  matters only got worse for mcconnell  republican senator ron johnson publicly accused him of  a real breach in trust  in hard charging back room negotiations  he threatened to withhold support for the bill  mcconnell supporters argued that no matter how he handled the private negotiations  the republican leader was dealt a difficult hand from the outset   the majority leader is trying to keep all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and it s a tough job but he s doing a good job   said republican senator lisa murkowski  and then there was trump  as mcconnell struggled  the president was in france last week celebrating bastille day before jetting back to the united states to attend a tournament at his new jersey golf course  he tweeted about his excitement at the tournament  his disgust with  fake news  and an investigation into russian influence in the  election  trump boasted that the white house  is functioning perfectly  and  i have very little time for watching t v   missing  some senate aides said  was trump traveling the country in a serious effort to bolster support for mcconnell s efforts
