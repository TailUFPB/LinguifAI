 washington  reuters    during the eight years of the obama administration  business lobbyists often found the gates to the white house closed tight   they are open now under president donald trump  that is not altogether unexpected as the new york real estate developer did campaign during the  presidential election on a promise to elevate the needs of business  which he argued would fuel economic growth   what does surprise lobbyists  however  is the sheer number of wins in getting the trump administration to roll back or delay unfavorable regulations in its first  months  and it is occurring despite white house dysfunction and distraction   the lobbyists say it is a stark departure from the approach of the obama administration  which had a reputation for aloofness toward business and sought to limit the influence of lobbyists  whom it saw as beholden to special interests  the trump white house is listening to them  they say  it is returning their phone calls  and it is working to eliminate regulations they view as detrimental to the ability to prosper   when  lobbyists and business leaders recently held talks with trump administration officials on energy infrastructure and climate change  they were surprised by the officials  opening question   do you have a regulation that we could put on a list to try to eliminate  is there something that is impeding you from growing    in that moment  one of the lobbyists at the meeting knew it was a new era   that as an opening was not the way the obama administration approached meetings   she said    it s night and day   between the trump and obama administrations  said james thurber  a professor in the public affairs school at american university  who studies lobbying and its effects   trump promised to  drain the swamp   an oath that came with plans to curb lobbying and end a  culture of corruption   the campaign stump speech line had a populist appeal  but one person s swamp dweller is another s job creator   some of the  lobbyists spanning nine different industries interviewed by reuters acknowledged that many people view them as part of the problem in washington  not the solution  and that their growing influence may be seen by those as a negative   spending so far this year on lobbyists is on pace to exceed spending in   according to the opensecrets website  with    billion spent over the first nine months compared to    billion at the same point in    after taking office in january  trump quickly made it easier to get into the white house   he reversed president barack obama s restrictions that sought to keep lobbyists at bay by physically barring many of them from the white house   a rule that critics said did nothing more than move meetings with lobbyists to coffee shops across the street  and trump has stopped the public disclosure of white house visitors  logs  so now lobbyists come and go with less concern that their presence at the white house will be scrutinized   most lobbyists refused to speak on the record because they did not want to reveal anything about their private discussions with the administration  lobbyists are also acutely aware that anything they say will be used by critics who think trump has tilted too much toward corporate interests   the white house did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article   the coal  steel  oil and gas industries are some of the clear winners  with easier access to the trump administration and more deregulation of their industries  said stan veuger  a fellow at the conservative thinktank american enterprise institute who studies politics and the economy   that business has been given more access and even more control of certain regulatory issues is  fair criticism and praise if you want to call it that   said veuger    there are big losers  too  consumer advocacy and environmental groups warning about the perils of climate change  who enjoyed easy access to the obama white house  have largely been shut out of a trump white house that is more skeptical of climate change and believes obama over reached with some of his measures to protect consumers   it was no secret that trump wanted to greenlight the dakota access pipeline to move oil from north dakota to illinois despite the fierce opposition of environmentalists and american indian tribes whose land was being used  he spoke about it frequently during the campaign  then trump gave the energy industry more than they had hoped for   the american petroleum institute  which represents all the large refiners  had asked the administration to speed the permitting process for drilling and building new facilities  when trump signed his executive order authorizing the pipeline only four days after taking office  he also granted this wish   a number of business trade groups asked the trump administration to suspend a rule  created during the obama years  that would require companies to disclose to the government any communications they have with employees during union disputes  in june  the trump labor department did just that  citing the opposition from business   among the other wins for business  the labor department delivered on a top priority of the u s  chamber of commerce business lobbying group and wall street brokerages when it reversed an obama era rule aimed at brokers who recommend inappropriate retirement investments   the administration also side stepped the process to repeal regulations by implementing delays and holds on rules   for instance  in the final months of the obama administration the bureau of land management created a rule governing methane and waste prevention over the strong objections of groups representing oil and gas companies   api wrote to ryan zinke  trump s secretary of the interior  in may asking him to postpone implementation of the rule  the trump administration announced it would and even cited the lobbyists  objections as the reason   of course  it is not perfect harmony between trump and business  dozens of corporate leaders abandoned advisory business councils set up by trump after he appeared to side with white supremacists following a white nationalist rally in virginia that resulted in the death of a protester   the u s  chamber of commerce has spent the past few weeks ringing alarm bells over trump s various positions on the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement   and yet  said neil bradley  one of the top lobbyists for the chamber   i have even found in times when we may not see eye to eye with the administration on something  we have cordial  timely discussions that are substantive
