washington  reuters    lawmakers in the u s  house of representatives on wednesday debated resurrecting the stalled yucca mountain spent nuclear fuel dump in nevada  a project critics say is hindered by the lack of an easy transport route  representative john shimkus  an illinois republican  has proposed draft legislation to restart the licensing of yucca mountain  the government has already spent billions of dollars for initial construction of the project  which has been pending since ronald reagan was president  former president barack obama opposed yucca and stopped its licensing process in   but president donald trump s proposed  budget provides   million to restart licensing and for development of interim nuclear waste sites until yucca can be completed  more details about the trump administration s support of yucca could come when a broader budget is released in may  currently  spent nuclear fuel  which can be deadly if left unshielded  is stored at reactors across the country  first in cooling ponds and then in thick casks   the yucca site itself  about  miles   km  northwest of las vegas  faces a cumbersome and costly licensing process that could take years to complete and questions from critics about how long spent fuel can remain without radiation leaking into an aquifer  yucca supporters say there is little groundwater at the desert site and what is there is contained by barriers and does not flow to any river or drinking water supply  an even trickier problem will be getting the spent fuel to yucca mountain safely by train and truck from nuclear reactors sites all across the country   transportation is the achilles heel of the yucca mountain repository site   said bob halstead  the head of nevada s agency for nuclear projects   one train route studied by the department of energy  known as caliente  has been at least partially blocked by obama s  designation of a national monument called basin and range  another route  known as mina  is opposed by the walker river tribe  which withdrew permission in  for the government to ship waste through its reservation  many casino owners and gaming associations also oppose the transport of spent nuclear fuel near the city of las vegas  saying publicity about the shipments could harm property values and tourism  the federal nuclear regulatory commission has pointed out that nuclear waste has been transported safely in the country for more than  years  which yucca backers are quick to cite  shimkus  whose state of illinois has more reactors than any other  says yucca is ideal because of its remoteness  there are no nuclear power reactors in nevada  and the state s entire congressional delegation  which includes members of both parties  opposes yucca   representative jacky rosen  a nevada democrat  said a major accident would harm human health  cost hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs  and damage the las vegas economy     do you honestly believe that shipping over   truck casks of high level nuclear waste over a span of  years won t result in at least one radiological accident   rosen said at the hearing   the bill contains a measure directing the energy secretary to consider routes avoiding las vegas  but the provision is unenforceable under existing laws  halstead said  nevada governor brian sandoval  a republican  met with energy secretary rick perry in washington on wednesday  sandoval said he reiterated his opposition to yucca and urged perry to explore a  realistic  safe alternative   to the u s  nuclear waste problem
