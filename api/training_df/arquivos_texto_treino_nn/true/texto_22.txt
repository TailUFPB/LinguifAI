 reuters    a u s  appeals court on friday said president donald trump s hotly contested travel ban targeting people from six muslim majority countries should not be applied to people with strong u s  ties  the  u s  circuit court of appeals  which covers several west coast states  also said its ruling would be put on hold pending a decision on the latest version of the travel ban from the trump administration by the u s  supreme court  since taking office in january  trump has been struggling to enact a ban that passes court muster  a three judge panel from the  circuit narrowed a previous injunction from a lower federal court to those people  with a credible bona fide relationship with the united states   it also said that while the u s  president has broad powers to regulate the entry of immigrants into the united states  those powers are not without limits   we conclude that the president s issuance of the proclamation once again exceeds the scope of his delegated authority   the panel said  the ban targets people from chad  iran  libya  somalia  syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states  trump  a republican  has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism  the state of hawaii  however  challenged it in court  and a honolulu federal judge said it exceeded trump s powers under immigration law  trump s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela  but the lower courts had already allowed those provisions to go into effect  the same three judge  circuit panel  which limited a previous version of trump s ban  heard arguments earlier this month  trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries in january  which caused chaos at airports and mass protests  he issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts  that expired in september after a court fight and was replaced with the current version  the ban has some exceptions  certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism  business or education purposes  and applicants can ask for an individual waiver   we are pleased that the supreme court has already allowed the government to implement the proclamation and keep all americans safe while this matter is litigated  we continue to believe that the order should be allowed to take effect in its entirety   u s  justice department spokeswoman lauren ehrsam said in a statement
