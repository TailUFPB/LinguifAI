washington  reuters    the u s  senate voted almost unanimously on thursday to slap new sanctions on russia  putting president donald trump in a tough position by forcing him to take a hard line on moscow or veto the legislation and infuriate his own republican party  the legislation all but dashes trump s hopes for warmer ties with moscow as his administration is dogged by congressional and special counsel investigations into russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election to sway it in trump s favor  russian president vladimir putin  who has repeatedly denied the conclusions of u s  intelligence agencies that moscow interfered using cyber warfare methods  has threatened retaliation against the legislation  the senate backed the bill  which also imposes sanctions on iran and north korea  by a margin of   with strong support from trump s fellow republicans as well as democrats  the bill  which includes a provision that allows congress to stop any effort by trump to ease existing sanctions on russia  will now be sent to the white house for trump to sign into law or veto  it is the first major foreign policy legislation approved by congress under trump  who has struggled to advance his domestic agenda despite republicans controlling the senate and house of representatives  the strong bipartisan support for the bill was a sharp contrast to the bitter partisan rancor during debate over how to overhaul the u s  healthcare system  if trump chooses to veto it  the bill is expected to garner enough support in both chambers to override his veto and pass it into law  the sanctions measure has already passed the house of representatives by a vote of     republicans and democrats have pushed for more sanctions partly as a response to the election allegations  trump denies any collusion between his campaign and moscow  republican senator john mccain  a leading congressional voice calling for a firm line against russia  said before the vote   the united states of america needs to send a strong message to vladimir putin and any other aggressor that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy   putin said moscow would only decide on how to retaliate once it had seen the final text of the proposed law  the bill would affect a range of russian industries and might further hurt the russian economy  already weakened by  sanctions imposed after russia annexed crime from ukraine  besides angering moscow  the legislation has upset the european union  which has said the new sanctions might affect its energy security and prompt it to act  too  the legislation also cracks down on iran and north korea  for activities including their missile development programs and human rights abuses  including seeking to punish foreign banks that do business with north korea  it also imposes restrictions on anyone involved in iran s ballistic missile program and those who do business with them  the sanctions also apply to iran s islamic revolutionary guards corps security force  earlier on thursday  a senior white house aide said trump could veto the pending legislation in order to push for a tougher deal  an idea that drew skepticism in congress because his administration had spent weeks lobbying for a weaker bill   he may sign the sanctions exactly the way they are or he may veto the sanctions and negotiate an even tougher deal against the russians   white house communications director anthony scaramucci told cnn  earlier on thursday  senator bob corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  told reporters   i would guess that he  trump  will sign it   a white house official said the bill would be reviewed   but we strongly support sanctions against all three countries   another white house official said it could take a couple of days before the legislation gets to trump s desk  trump can impose new sanctions at any time through an executive order   this bill doesn t preclude him from issuing tougher sanctions  that doesn t make any sense   said edward fishman  a former state department official during the obama administration who worked on u s  sanctions policy  once trump receives the bill  if he does not sign it  he has  days  excluding sundays  before he must issue a veto and prevent the bill from becoming law automatically   if he opts for a veto  the bill can become law anyway if two thirds of both the house and senate vote for an override   putin said on a visit to finland on thursday that russia was  exercising restraint and patience  but at some moment we ll have to retaliate  it s impossible to endlessly tolerate this boorishness towards our country   putin  at a news conference with finnish president sauli niinisto  also spoke about former president barack obama s order last december to seize russian diplomatic property in the united states and to expel  russian diplomats   this goes beyond all reasonable bounds   putin said   and now these sanctions   they are also absolutely unlawful from the point of view of international law
