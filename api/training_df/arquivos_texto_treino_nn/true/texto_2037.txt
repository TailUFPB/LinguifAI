washington new york  reuters    president donald trump s fellow republicans rebuked him on wednesday after his threat to shut down the u s  government over funding for a border wall rattled markets and cast a shadow over congressional efforts to raise the country s debt ceiling and pass spending bills   i don t think anyone s interested in having a shutdown   the top republican in congress  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  told reporters on wednesday in hillsboro  oregon  where he visited an intel factory   ryan said building a wall along the country s border with mexico to deter illegal immigration was necessary  but added that the government did not have to choose between border security and shuttering operations  trump in a speech on tuesday evening threatened a shutdown if congress does not agree to fund constructing the wall  a signature promise of his presidential campaign  which added a new complication to republicans  months long struggle to reach a budget deal  after mexico rejected a chief part of trump s promise   that it would pay for the wall   the president said the united states would fund it initially and be repaid by its southern neighbor  lawmakers  including many republicans  have not made that funding a top priority  as some question if a wall is necessary  congress will have about  working days when it returns on sept   from its summer break to approve spending measures to keep the government open  while also facing a looming deadline to raise the cap on the amount the government may borrow  both are must approve measures   u s  stocks and the dollar weakened and investors pivoted to the safety of u s  treasury securities on wednesday after trump s threat  the s p  index  spx closed about   percent lower  the dow jones industrial average  dji was down by   percent and the nasdaq composite index  ixic slid   percent   ryan suggested congress would need to approve a short term extension  or continuing resolution  of current funding levels so that the senate could have more time to pass a full spending bill  that would push the budget battle to later in the year and could in turn delay attempts at tax reform  another signature trump campaign issue  friction between republicans and trump has grown in recent months  with the president publicly castigating some party leaders  notably senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  and expressing infuriation that congress has not passed any significant legislation since his january inauguration  mcconnell did not take a stand on the border wall issue on wednesday  he said in a statement he and trump were in regular contact and working together on a list of goals that included preventing a government default and funding government priorities  in the short and long terms    we have a lot of work ahead of us  and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation   he said  a white house statement said trump would hold  previously scheduled meetings  with mcconnell once congress returns to washington and that trump and mcconnell  remain united on many shared priorities  including middle class tax relief  strengthening the military  constructing a southern border wall  and other important issues   congress frequently has to pass funding extensions for a few weeks or months while it hammers out a full budget  occasionally lawmakers have enter a standoff over a single issue  delaying agreement and forcing a shutdown  the most recent closure  which spanned  days in october   was over funding for the affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  in opinion polls during and after that shutdown  voters loudly disapproved of the republican party  which controlled the house of representatives at the time  representative tom cole of oklahoma  the republican chairman of a house appropriations subcommittee  said trump s threatened move could backfire on the party   when you control the presidency  the senate and the house  you re shutting down the government that you re running  i don t think it s smart politically and i don t think it would succeed practically   he told reuters in an interview     the white house stressed on wednesday that trump would work with congress to get funding for the wall    the president ran on it  won on it and plans to build it   said white house spokeswoman natalie strom  the party s conservative wing backed the president s call for wall funding  with representative jim jordan of ohio  a founding member of the freedom caucus  telling reuters any government shutdown would be caused by senate democrats  representative adam kinzinger  a republican member of the house foreign affairs committee  said  however  the threat was   dangerous for our role in the world as we re talking to nations like afghanistan to say   here s how you govern yourself    he added it could also hurt financial markets  confidence in the united states   trump saying he would be willing to shut down the government over the wall obviously doesn t really inspire much confidence in anyone   said michael o rourke  chief market strategist at jonestrading in greenwich  connecticut   the house passed a spending bill late last month that included funding for the wall  republicans  slim majority in the senate means democrats are needed to pass most legislation and they have opposed including border wall funding in any fiscal  spending bill  congress also must periodically raise the debt limit to keep the u s  government borrowing and operating  politicians sometimes take advantage of that need to push through policy or spending changes  the treasury department  already using  extraordinary measures  to remain current on its obligations  has said the debt limit must be raised by sept    trump has asked congress to extend the limit with a  clean  bill that excludes any other provisions  credit ratings agency fitch said on wednesday it would review the u s  sovereign debt rating   with potentially negative implications   if the debt limit is not raised in a timely manner
