washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court is set this week to hear a closely watched case testing the limits of religious rights  and new justice neil gorsuch s judicial record indicates he could tip the court toward siding with a church challenging missouri s ban on state funding of religious entities  trinity lutheran church  which is located in columbia  missouri and runs a preschool and daycare center  said missouri unlawfully excluded it from a grant program providing state funds to nonprofit groups to buy rubber playground surfaces  missouri s constitution prohibits  any church  sect or denomination of religion  from receiving state taxpayer money  gorsuch  who embraced an expansive view of religious rights as a colorado based federal appeals court judge  on monday hears his first arguments since becoming a justice last week  he will be on the bench on wednesday when the justices hear the trinity lutheran case  one of the most important of their current term  gorsuch  appointed by president donald trump  restored the supreme court s   conservative majority  trinity lutheran wanted public funds to replace its playground s gravel with a rubber surface made from recycled tires that would be safer for children to play on  the u s  constitution calls for a separation of church and state and guarantees the free exercise of religion  at the very least  a victory for trinity lutheran would help religious organizations nationwide win public dollars for certain purposes  such as health and safety  but it also could bolster the case for using public money for vouchers to help pay for children to attend religious schools rather than public schools in  school choice  programs backed by many conservatives  for example  colorado s top court in  found that a douglas county voucher program violated a state constitutional provision similar to missouri s  trinity lutheran s legal effort is being spearheaded by the alliance defending freedom conservative christian legal activist group  which argues missouri s policy violates the u s  constitution s guarantees of free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law  if the church wins   religious organizations cannot be excluded from general public welfare benefits that apply to everybody   said erik stanley  an alliance lawyer representing the church  referring to gorsuch  stanley said   he has definitely been a friend of religious liberty  so we are hopeful that will continue when he s on the court  and we re grateful he gets to participate on this important case    in   gorsuch sided with the evangelical christian owners of arts and crafts retailer hobby lobby and allowed owners of private companies to object on religious grounds to a provision in federal healthcare law requiring employers to provide medical insurance that pays for women s birth control  gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion that hobby lobby s owners faced a choice  between exercising their faith or saving their business   the supreme court later affirmed the ruling  missouri said there is nothing unconstitutional about its grant program   trinity lutheran remains free  without any public subsidy  to worship  teach  pray and practice any other aspect of its faith however it wishes  the state merely declines to offer financial support   the state said in legal papers  the church has drawn support from the religious community including the u s  conference of catholic bishops  the mormon church and jewish groups  groups filing legal papers opposing trinity lutheran  including the american civil liberties union  said government funding of churches is precisely what the constitution forbids   forcing states to provide cash to build church property could open the floodgates to programs that coerce taxpayers to underwrite religion   said daniel mach  director of the aclu s program on freedom of religion and belief  mach said three quarters of the u s  states have provisions like missouri s  alliance defending freedom  which also opposes gay marriage  transgender protections and abortion  has another major case involving religion that the supreme court could take up in its term beginning in october  it represents a colorado bakery s christian owner who argues the constitution s promise of religious freedom means he should not have to make a wedding cake for a gay couple  trinity lutheran sued in federal court in   the st  louis based  u s  circuit court of appeals in  upheld a trial court s dismissal of the suit  the appeals court said accepting the church s arguments would be  unprecedented   noting the supreme court s  decision in the case locke v  davey that upheld a bar on washington state scholarships for students preparing for the ministry  the justice who gorsuch replaced  the late fellow conservative antonin scalia  was one of two dissenters in the locke ruling  when a state withholds a generally available benefit solely on religious grounds  it is like an unconstitutional  special tax  on religion  scalia said  judicial observers have described gorsuch as very much in the mold of scalia  missouri s grant program was meant to keep tires out of landfills while also fostering children s safety  the church s brief to the high court stated   a rubber playground surface accomplishes the state s purposes whether it cushions the fall of the pious or the profane
