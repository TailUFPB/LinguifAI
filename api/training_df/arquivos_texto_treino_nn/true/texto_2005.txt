washington  reuters    democrats in the u s  congress wield little clout nowadays  but they will likely have plenty of influence on the looming issue of the u s  debt ceiling and party leaders are considering whether they should try to convert that advantage into bargaining power on tax reform  even though they control the white house and both chambers of congress  republicans are again divided among themselves as pressing fiscal issues rattle financial markets and test president donald trump s ability to keep the country s accounts in order  the debt ceiling is a legal cap on how much money the federal government can borrow to fund its budget deficits and meet debt obligations  failure to meet payments could lead to a default and a downgrade in america s credit rating  with the potential to trigger global financial shockwaves  speaking to reporters at the white house on friday  u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he was   percent confident  that the debt ceiling would be raised in september   there is no scenario where the government won t be paying its bills   mnuchin said  action is needed to raise the debt ceiling by sept    the administration has warned  although some fiscal experts say the deadline may actually be mid october  the trump administration wants congress to pass a  clean  increase  without extraneous political measures attached  but  reflecting long divisions in the party over fiscal policy  many conservative republicans have said they will not  vote for a debt limit bill that does not also contain promises of federal spending cuts  so  analysts say  trump and republican leaders will need the votes of democrats  who generally favor a clean bill  to raise the debt limit and avoid a default  armed with this edge  democrats are considering using the debt debate to press republicans for bipartisan tax reform  said democratic senate aides  which would inject new uncertainty into the debt limit issue  overhauling the tax code is a top priority for trump and his fellow republicans  but they have made little progress since the president took office in january  their behind closed doors planning process so far on tax reform has ignored the democrats  senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi are skeptical about supporting a debt ceiling increase while republicans pursue tax cuts that democrats say would cause the federal deficit to balloon   we re telling republicans that if it is their intention to use that debt limit increase to allow for tax cuts for the wealthy  that they are going to have a harder time getting democratic votes   said a senate democratic aide  senate democrats offered earlier this month to move forward with bipartisan legislation on taxes  on condition that changes do not add to the deficit or benefit the wealthy  for now  senate and house democrats are watching  republicans and the trump administration wrangle over the debt ceiling  with no clear plan yet in sight  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan have not said if they want a clean bill  ryan said on thursday that congress will pass legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling  noting that lawmakers have several options  mcconnell has said the debt ceiling will be raised  a spokesman said on thursday  pelosi spokesman drew hammill said in an email   leader pelosi has expressed support for a clean debt ceiling hike  but has also echoed the concerns that many house democrats have about supporting such a move while republicans simultaneously blow a multi trillion dollar hole in the deficit with tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires   given the stakes  schumer and pelosi would face a daunting task in holding their parties  lawmakers together if they want to squeeze concessions out of republicans with the country on the brink of a potential default  some democrats are skeptical such a strategy could work   we ought to get the debt ceiling done  it s a bad precedent to try to use the debt ceiling for leverage for other political objectives   said representative john yarmuth  the top democrat on the house budget committee  federal reserve governor jerome powell expressed concern on friday about the possibility of the debt ceiling not being raised    if the debt ceiling were not to be raised  the united states would not be able to pay all of its bills  that s never happened before  it would be unprecedented and that could be a major shock to the economy   powell said in an interview with cnbc during a conference in jackson hole  wyoming  democrats have been talking about using the debt ceiling as a lever against republican tax reform since june and laid out their conditions for working together on tax legislation in an aug   letter to trump and republican leaders  mcconnell flatly rejected the idea of broad bipartisanship  but it could be the only way forward on taxes if republicans cannot agree on a budget resolution for fiscal   that is needed to unlock a legislative provision that would allow them to pass a tax bill in the senate  where republicans have only a slim majority  without democratic support
