washington  reuters    a political feud erupted on wednesday over the u s  house intelligence committee s probe of suspected russian meddling in the  presidential election  with charges that the panel s republican chairman subpoenaed the cia  fbi and national security agency without telling democratic members  committee aides complained that the chairman  representative devin nunes  who publicly recused himself from leading the russia probe in april following a secret visit he paid to white house officials  failed to consult democrats on the subpoenas  the subpoenas asked the agencies to provide details of any requests made by two top obama administration aides and the former cia director to  unmask  names of trump campaign advisers inadvertently picked up in top secret foreign communications intercepts  congressional sources said  the former officials named in the subpoenas were obama national security adviser susan rice  former u s  ambassador to the united nations samantha power and former cia director john brennan   subpoenas related to the  unmasking  issue would have been sent by chairman nunes acting separately from the committee s russia investigation  this action would have been taken without the minority s  democrats   agreement   said a senior committee aide  speaking on condition of anonymity  another congressional source  who also requested anonymity  said democrats were  informed and consulted  before the subpoenas were issued  the cia declined to comment on the subpoenas and the federal bureau of investigation and nsa did not immediate respond to requests for comment  u s  privacy laws and intelligence regulations require that americans  names picked up in foreign communications intercepts be concealed unless senior officials request them to be disclosed for intelligence or law enforcement purposes  any such requests undergo rigorous legal reviews  several u s  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  told reuters that all such requests by obama administration officials were properly scrutinized and appropriate  subpoenas for trump lawyer  ex aide the spy agency subpoenas were not mentioned in a bipartisan announcement on wednesday that the panel approved subpoenas for president donald trump s former national security adviser  michael flynn  and trump s personal lawyer  michael cohen  in connection with the russia probe  the committee also approved subpoenas to the two men s firms  flynn intel llc  and michael d  cohen and associates pc  the committee statement said   as part of our ongoing investigation into russian active measures during the  campaign  today we approved subpoenas for several individuals for testimony  personal documents and business records   republican representative mike conaway and democratic representative adam schiff  who are leading the committee probe  said in a joint statement  conaway assumed republican leadership of the probe after nunes recused himself  nunes retained his power to issue subpoenas  u s  intelligence agencies reported in january that russian president vladimir putin oversaw a campaign of computer hacking  fake news and propaganda intended to swing the election to republican trump over his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  putin has denied conducting such a campaign  trump denies any collusion between russia and his campaign and has questioned the veracity of the u s  intelligence finding  trump fired flynn in february for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  and misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations  the retired army general is the subject of congressional  justice department and defense department investigations into his apparent failure to disclose payments he received from russian and turkish entities  cohen is one of several trump associates under scrutiny in an fbi examination of possible contacts between trump s campaign and russia  according to the new york times  it reported that cohen was involved in a back channel plan  which never came to fruition  that would have involved a peace agreement between russia and ukraine  and the lifting of u s  sanctions against moscow  cnn reported on wednesday night that congressional investigators were looking into whether attorney general jeff sessions had an undisclosed private meeting with kislyak during the campaign  citing republican and democratic sources in congress and intelligence officials briefed on the probe  the focus of the probe is on whether such a meeting took place on april     at the mayflower hotel in washington   where trump delivered his first major foreign policy address  cnn reported   during his confirmation hearing in january  sessions testified that he  did not have any communications with the russians  during the campaign and said in a written statement given to the senate judiciary committee that he was not in contact with anyone linked to the russian government during the campaign  it was reported in march that he met with kislyak twice during the campaign  once at the republican national convention in july and once in his senate office in september  sessions later admitted having the meetings but said they were part of his senate duties and were unrelated to the campaign  he later recused himself from the russia probe
