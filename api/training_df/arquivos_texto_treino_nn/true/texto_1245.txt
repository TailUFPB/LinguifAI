washington  reuters    president donald trump s call for congress to toughen the iran nuclear deal faced opposition on friday from among the ranks of his fellow republicans as well as from democrats  narrowing the chances any legislation could pass  as trump announced that he had chosen not to certify tehran is complying with the deal but would not immediately withdraw from it  republican senators bob corker and tom cotton offered an outline of legislation they said would  address flaws  in the accord  if passed  the measure would set stricter restrictions on iran and immediately revive u s  sanctions imposed over iran s nuclear program if tehran is deemed able to produce a nuclear weapon within a year   we have provided a route to overcome deficiencies  in the agreement  and to keep the administration in the deal  and actually make it the kind of deal that it should have been in the first place   corker  chairman of the senate foreign relations committee  said on a call with journalists  republicans control congress  but their four seat edge in the senate means any measure would need democratic support to pass  even if every member of trump s party supports it  that is not a given  republican senator marco rubio said he had  serious doubts  about the corker cotton plan  he said he would reserve judgment until the final measure  but preferred that trump abandon the deal   ultimately  leaving the nuclear deal  reimposing suspended sanctions  and having the president impose additional sanctions would serve our national interest better than a decertified deal that leaves sanctions suspended or a new law that leaves major flaws in that agreement in place   rubio said in a statement  most democrats were strongly opposed  senator ben cardin  ranking democrat on the foreign relations panel  said he would only support a measure backed by european allies who had signed the nuclear pact  formally known as the jcpoa   anything we do must be consistent with the jcpoa  cannot lead us on a path to violate the jcpoa and must have the support of our european allies   he told reuters in a telephone interview  cardin said he wanted a full senate briefing on the plan from administration officials  and then committee hearings  corker acknowledged the tough fight ahead  but said he hoped to win over democrats  he pledged to seek the support of european allies britain  france and germany  who had signed the agreement and urged trump not to decertify
