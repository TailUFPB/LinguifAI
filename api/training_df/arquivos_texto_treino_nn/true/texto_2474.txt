washington  reuters    a proposed border tax in the house of representatives was killed on thursday  bringing relief to retailers and other large importers whose profits faced threats and removing a hurdle that had kept negotiations on the long promised republican overhaul of the u s  tax code from advancing  the border adjustment tax was part of a broad reform of the tax code being pushed by house republican leaders  it was meant to discourage companies from manufacturing products overseas and then importing them into the united states for sale instead of producing goods in the u s   the tax would have generated roughly   trillion in revenue  allowing tax code writers to slash the corporate tax rate without increasing the nation s deficit  removing the controversial provision could make it easier to pass tax legislation  but likely narrows the scope of what could become law  it suggests republicans are more likely to implement simple rate cuts and not accomplish sweeping tax reform on the scale of the last major overhaul in   such as moving to a territorial tax system  in which companies would pay tax only on profits earned in the united states  without a new source of revenue  it will make it more difficult for republicans to make tax code changes permanent and deficit neutral  the republicans are looking to use rules that would require passage of a tax bill only with a simple majority   meaning they would not need any democratic votes  those rules restrict creating long term deficits  so if the bill is not deficit neutral the tax cuts would likely carry an expiration date  the group of six republican negotiators working on tax reform on thursday did not announce any agreement on their target for corporate rate cuts   a signal that tax lobbyists said shows continuing divisions among republicans about the closely watched rate   corporate profits are currently taxed at  percent  but president donald trump wants them slashed to  percent  which he says will promote business spending  economic growth and job creation        while we have debated the pro growth benefits of border adjustability  we appreciate that there are many unknowns associated with it and have decided to set this policy aside in order to advance tax reform   the  big six  republican tax negotiators said in a joint statement  large retailers and other importers had lobbied aggressively against the border tax proposal  including a coalition that included automakers like toyota   t  and stores like target  tgt n   autozone  azo n  and best buy  bby n   the retailers argued that the border tax would drastically increase consumer prices  hitting low  and middle class households the most  the big six is comprised of treasury secretary steve mnuchin and gary cohn  the head of the national economic council   both representing trump   house speaker paul ryan  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and the heads of the two tax writing committees in congress  senator orrin hatch and representative kevin brady  in addition to killing the border tax  the group offered other vague goals but no details  saying they remain committed to increased expensing for corporations  or allowing them to write off the cost of new equipment more quickly  and to return profits held by american companies overseas  known as repatriation  at a lower tax rate than the current  percent  the statement offered no specific goals or targets on the personal income tax code   we have always been in agreement that tax relief for american families should be at the heart of our plan   the big six said  trump has vowed to finish a tax overhaul by the end of this year  republicans leaders in congress are hopeful that the current debate on repealing and replacing obamacare  which is now before the senate  can be completed quickly  allowing congress to then turn its attention to the tax code  the u s  chamber of commerce praised the announcement as progress toward an ultimate goal of overhauling the code    we re pleased  but we re not satisfied until we get an outcome   said neil bradley  the head of policy for the business group
