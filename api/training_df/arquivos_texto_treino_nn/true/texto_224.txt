washington  reuters    incoming federal reserve chair jerome powell  chosen by u s  president donald trump to keep the recovery humming  appears set to let an expected trillion dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered  powell in statements throughout the year  culminating with his recent senate confirmation hearing  has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the fed to raise rates faster than expected  and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs  new data added evidence to that view on friday  employment in november grew faster than expected  but wage growth remained muted  the share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady  six year recovery that is approaching its pre crisis peak  even with the unemployment rate at a  year low of   percent   there s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market   powell told members of the senate banking committee  saying that the fed should raise rates only gradually   debate among powell s colleagues  meanwhile  has highlighted other risks if the fed speeds its pace of rate increases  some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak  others have noted that if the fed continues raising short term rates while long term rates remain stalled  it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down  a typical signal of recession    if the fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn t materialize  and they take rates too far  then markets would feel aggrieved   said carl tannenbaum  chief economist at northern trust in chicago  and a former senior risk official at the fed board  other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when powell takes over in february  the tax cuts could kick in  and the fed stands aside    with a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework  powell will lead  a more data driven fed  which at the current juncture means a more dovish fed   until and if inflation recovers  said robin brooks  chief economist at the institute of international finance   he expects the fed under powell to only raise rates twice next year    policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the republican tax plan when they meet next week  they are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year  they will also update their economic and interest rate projections for  and beyond  the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear  top republicans from the house and the senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law    though janet yellen remains fed chair until february  her final scheduled press conference on wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop powell inherits  the  year old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor  and help shape the statement issued that day by the federal open market committee  it is a group struggling with a fundamental issue  the economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment  a condition in which prices and wages should be rising  yet both remain weak  into that mix  the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households   if there is still  slack  in the economy  that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase  and more workers are hired  however  if the economy is near or above its potential  as some measures indicate  it may merely cause faster than desired price increases  or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble   as the tax plan advanced in congress  forecasting shops at goldman sachs  jp morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of fed rate increases   essentially expecting the fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome  the tax package is  ultimately worth almost two additional fed hikes  in coming years  goldman sachs economists david mericle and alec phillips wrote in a recent analysis  but the new chair s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the fed s go slow approach can continue  giving more time for workers to rebound from the   crisis without creating other economic risks   accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth  rather  it helped restore full employment   powell said in june in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top fed job   his outlook is consistent with positions trump and current chair janet yellen have taken  and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the fed s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan  at his confirmation hearing  powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation  telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain  but when asked about fed staff research that challenged a key republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs  powell kept his distance   it s just someone s research   powell told senators   don t associate that with a position of the board
