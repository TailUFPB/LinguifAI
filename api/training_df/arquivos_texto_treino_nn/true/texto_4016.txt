washington  reuters    here are some of the highlights of the reuters interview with u s  president donald trump on thursday   there s a chance that we could end up having a major  major  conflict with north korea  absolutely   question  is that your biggest global worry at this point   yes  i would say that s true  yes      north korea would be certainly that   on getting south korea to pay for thaad missile defense system  on the thaad system  it s about a billion dollars  i said    why are we paying  why are we paying a billion dollars  we re protecting  why are we paying a billion dollars   so i informed south korea it would be appropriate if they paid  nobody s going to do that  why are we paying a billion dollars  it s a billion dollar system  it s phenomenal  it s the most incredible equipment you ve ever seen   shoots missiles right out of the sky  and it protects them and i want to protect them  we re going to protect them  but they should pay for that  and they understand that   on whether the war against islamist extremism will ever end  yours is the toughest question  because at what point does it end  but we can t let them come over here  i have to say  there is an end  and it has to be humiliation  there is an end  otherwise it s really tough  but there is an end  we are really eradicating some very bad people  when you take a look at what s going on with the cutting off of the heads  we haven t seen that since medieval times  right    on chinese president xi s efforts to rein in north korea  he certainly doesn t want to see turmoil and death  he doesn t want to see it  he s a good man  he s a very good man and i got to know him very well     we ll see how it all works out  i know he would like to be able to do something  perhaps it s possible that he can t  but i think he d like to be able to do something    he s  years old  his father dies  took over a regime  so say what you want but that s not easy  especially at that age  you know you have plenty of generals in there and plenty of other people that would like to do what he s doing  so i ve said this before and i ve  i m just telling you  and i m not giving him credit or not giving him credit  i m just saying that s a very hard thing to do    as to whether or not he s rational  i have no opinion on it  i hope he s rational    i get a call from mexico yesterday   we hear you re going to terminate nafta   i said that s right  they said   is there any way we can do something without you   without termination   i said   what do you want to do   he said   well  we d like to negotiate   i said we ll think about it  then i get a call  and they call me  i get a call from justin trudeau and he said   we d like to see if we can work something out   and i said that s fine  because i ve always   i ve been very consistent  it s much less disruptive if we can make a fair trade deal than if we terminate    it s unacceptable  it s a horrible deal made by hillary  it s a horrible deal  and we re going to renegotiate that deal  or terminate it    question  when will you announce it   very soon  i m announcing it now    by the way  with south korea  just so you know  they re ready for it  mike pence was representing me  he was just over there  he s told them  and we have the five year anniversary coming up very shortly  and we thought that would be a good time to start     it s a great deal for south korea  it s a terrible deal for us    frankly  saudi arabia has not treated us fairly  because we are losing a tremendous amount of money in defending saudi arabia    well  my problem is that i ve established a very good personal relationship with  chinese  president xi  and i really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation  so i wouldn t want to be causing difficulty right now for him     so i would certainly want to speak to him first    if there s closure  there s closure  we ll see what happens  if there s a shutdown  it s the democrats  fault  not our fault  it s the democrats  fault  maybe they d like to see a shutdown    on trump s plan to generate revenue to offset tax cuts  we will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit  we are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals       there will be other ways that we are going to raise revenues  but we are going to run the country properly  and we are going to be reimbursed when we do things  why should we be paying for somebody else s military   on middle east peace and possible trip to israel  saudi arabia  it s a possibility  we re talking to both  it s a possibility  but i want to see peace with israel and the palestinians  there is no reason there s not peace between israel and the palestinians   none whatsoever  so we re looking at that and we re also looking at the potential of going to saudi arabia
