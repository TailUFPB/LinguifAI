washington calgary  alberta  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration approved transcanada corp s  trp to  keystone xl pipeline on friday  cheering the oil industry and angering environmentalists even as further hurdles for the controversial project loom  the approval reverses a decision by former president barack obama to reject the project  but the company still needs to win financing  acquire local permits  and fend off likely legal challenges for the pipeline to be built   transcanada will finally be allowed to complete this long overdue project with efficiency and with speed   trump said in the oval office before turning to ask transcanada chief executive officer russell girling when construction would start   we ve got some work to do in nebraska to get our permits there   girling replied   nebraska   trump said   i ll call nebraska   trump announced the presidential permit for keystone xl at the white house with girling and sean mcgarvey  president of north america s building trades unions  standing nearby  he said the project would lower consumer fuel prices  create jobs and reduce u s  dependence on foreign oil  the pipeline linking canadian oil sands to u s  refiners had been blocked by obama  who said it would do nothing to reduce fuel prices for u s  motorists and would contribute to emissions linked to global warming  trump  however  campaigned on a promise to approve it  and he signed an executive order soon after taking office in january to advance the project  transcanada s u s  listed shares  trp n  dipped  cents to close at    on friday   trump has claimed the project would create   jobs in the united states  but a  state department study predicted just   construction jobs and  permanent jobs   the president said he would get in touch with nebraska governor pete ricketts later in the day  transcanada applied to the nebraska public service commission in february for approval of the pipeline s route through the state  the company said it expects that process to conclude this year  ricketts said in a statement posted on twitter that the project would help his state    i have full confidence that the public service commission will conduct a thorough and fair review of the application   he said  the white house has said the pipeline is exempt from a trump executive order requiring new pipelines to be made from u s  steel  because much of the pipe for the project has already been built and stockpiled   as we move forward  we ll continue to look to buy the rest of the materials we need from     american manufacturers  we ll put american workers to work   girling told reporters    environmental groups vowed to fight it   greenpeace said it would pressure banks to withhold financing for the multibillion dollar project  and others said they would fight the pipeline in court   we ll use every tool in the kit   said rhea suh  president of the natural resources defense council      since obama had nixed the pipeline based on an environmental assessment commissioned by the state department in early   opponents will likely argue in court that trump cannot reverse the decision without conducting a new assessment  fred jauss  partner at the international law firm dorsey   whitney and a former attorney with the federal energy regulatory commission  said local permitting would also be a challenge   the presidential permit is only one part of a web of federal  state  and local permits that must be obtained prior to starting construction   he said   other federal agencies  such as the army corps of engineers  state regulatory commissions  and even local planning boards may have requirements that need to be fulfilled by keystone prior to construction    in addition  transcanada may still need to reach deals with hundreds of potentially affected landowners on the pipeline s route  there is a lot of work ahead for transcanada   the keystone xl pipeline would bring more than   barrels per day of heavy crude from canada s oil sands in alberta into nebraska  linking to an existing pipeline network feeding u s  refineries and ports along the gulf of mexico   the project could be a boon for canada  which has struggled to bring its vast oil reserves to market   our government has always been supportive of the keystone xl pipeline and we are pleased with the u s  decision   said a spokesman for canada s minister of natural resources   the importance of a common  continental energy market cannot be overstated   the president of the american petroleum institute  jack gerard  said the approval was  welcome news  and would bolster u s  energy security  expedited approval of projects is part of trump s approach to a  year    trillion infrastructure package he promised on the campaign trail  the white house is looking for ways to speed up approvals and permits for other infrastructure projects  which can sometimes take years to go through a regulatory maze  transcanada tried for more than five years to build the   mile    km  pipeline  until obama rejected it in   the company resubmitted its application for the project in january  after trump signed the executive order smoothing its path
