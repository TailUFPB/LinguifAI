washington  reuters    during his presidential campaign  republican donald trump praised russian president vladimir putin as a  strong leader  with whom he would like to reset tense u s  russian relations  but as trump heads to his first face to face meeting as president with putin on friday at the  summit in germany  he is under pressure at home to take a tough line with the kremlin  allegations of russian meddling in last year s u s  election have alarmed both republican and democratic lawmakers  who are pushing to extend tough sanctions placed on russia following its  annexation of crimea  a peninsula belonging to ukraine  lawmakers including republican senator cory gardner are also concerned russia has prolonged the civil war in syria by backing its president bashar al assad  a strongman whose forces have used chemical weapons against insurgents and civilians  the chaos has fueled instability in the region and a flood of migrants to europe   president  trump  needs to make it clear that the continued aggression by russia around the globe     is unacceptable  and that they will be held accountable   said gardner  who was among six lawmakers invited by the white house last month to discuss foreign policy with trump over dinner  meanwhile  the appointment of a special counsel who is investigating potential links between the russian government and members of the trump campaign has weakened the president s ability to maneuver with russia  foreign policy experts say  the u s  intelligence community has concluded russia sponsored hacking of democratic party groups last year to benefit trump over his democratic challenger hillary clinton  russia has denied those allegations while trump has repeatedly dismissed the idea of any coordination between his campaign and russia as a  witch hunt   still  just the optics of trump meeting with putin  a former kgb agent  are fraught with risk  foreign policy experts say   if  trump  smiles  if he wraps his arm around putin  if he says   i m honored to meet you  we re going to find a way forward       i think congress is going to react extremely negatively to that   said julie smith  a former national security aide in the obama administration  trump has signaled an interest in cooperating with russia to defeat islamic state in syria and to reduce nuclear stockpiles  the white house has been mum on what trump would be willing to give russia in exchange for that help  but there has been speculation he could ratchet down sanctions  or even return two russian diplomatic compounds in maryland and long island  president barack obama seized those facilities and expelled  russian diplomats just before he left office as punishment for the election hacks  while some administration officials  including secretary of state rex tillerson  also support engagement  others  such as vice president mike pence and u s  ambassador to the united nations nikki haley  have taken a hawkish line on russia  the lack of a unified strategy has left u s  allies anxious  and it has lowered expectations for american leadership to help resolve crises in syria and ukraine  where russian cooperation would be critical   trump is like a horse with his front legs tied   said a german diplomat  who spoke to reuters on condition of anonymity   he can t make any big leaps forward on russia  if he tried people would immediately suspect it was all part of some big conspiracy   trump s administration is still reviewing its russia policy  a process that may not be wrapped up for a couple of months  a u s  official said  speaking with reporters last week about trump s upcoming meeting with putin  white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster said his boss would like  the united states and the entire west to develop a more constructive relationship with russia  but he s also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront russia s destabilizing behavior   trump is just the latest president to grapple with the complicated u s  russia dynamic  george w  bush and obama sought to improve the u s  relationship with russia early in their administrations only to see relations deteriorate later  among the concerns for this president is trump s apparent lack of interest in policy details and his tendency to wing it with foreign leaders   mcmaster told reporters that trump has  no specific agenda  for his meeting with putin and that topics would consist of  whatever the president wants to talk about   michael mcfaul  who was u s  ambassador to russia under obama  said he feared trump might be headed to the meeting without clear objectives   i hope that he would think about first  what is our objective in ukraine  what is our objective in syria  and secondarily  how do i go about achieving that in my meeting with putin   mcfaul said  other washington veterans say trump won t be able to make meaningful progress with russia on anything until he confronts putin about the suspected election meddling    trump  really has to raise the russian election hacking last year  and has to say something like   vladimir  don t do this again  there will be consequences    said steve pifer  a long time state department official focused on u s  russia relations  so far trump has shown little inclination to do so  a situation that has heightened speculation about the potential impact from his coming encounter with the russian leader      the shadow of all these investigations hangs over this   said angela stent  a professor at georgetown university and former national intelligence officer for russia
