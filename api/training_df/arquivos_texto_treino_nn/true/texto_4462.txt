beijing washington  reuters    although worried about the prospect of a trade war  american businesses operating in china nonetheless want president donald trump to wring some concessions on market access from china s leader xi jingping when the two meet this week  trump warned in a tweet last week the meetings at his mar a lago resort on thursday and friday will be  very difficult  and  american companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives    trump has said he wants u s  companies to stop investing in china and instead create jobs at home  he has also accused china of manipulating its currency to boost exports  critics within u s  industry have accused china of unfair government subsidies to its companies  and of flooding the u s  market with cheap products from steel to solar panels  while restricting foreign investment over vast swathes of the world s second biggest economy   but they also worry trump s policies on china are not entirely clear  with his trade team still not in place  and may be subject to a  grand bargain  involving other issues such as north korea  trump is set to enter the meeting without several key advisors  including his pick for trade negotiator  robert lighthizer who has yet to be confirmed by congress  his nominee as ambassador to china  iowa governor terry branstad  has also yet to be confirmed  while several posts in the u s  state department that formulate asia policy remain unfilled   with this in mind  it is hard to imagine that there will be much in the way of concrete accomplishments at this summit  or even that there has been any significant interagency discussion on strategy leading up to it   said randal phillips  mintz group s beijing based managing partner for asia and the former chief cia representative in china  some of the largest u s  companies have contributed to the billions of dollars of foreign direct investment that have poured into china over the past two decades  creating hundreds of thousands of jobs  they include tech companies like apple  which makes much of its iphone in china  automakers such as general motors and ford  heavy machinery firms like caterpillar  retailers like starbucks and makers of shaving foam and detergent  like procter   gamble  u s  steel producers want trump to press xi on chinese steel prices  according to a source who has been in discussions with the administration in advance of the summit  u s  automakers complain about a disparity in tariffs  the united states has a   percent tariff on auto imports  china s is  percent   but the stakes are perhaps highest for american technology firms  who worry that china s new cyber security law  which takes effect in june  sets potentially discriminatory standards for multinationals  the information technology   innovation foundation  itif   a think tank whose board includes representatives from apple  ibm google and other tech heavyweights  has urged the trump administration to pressure china to  stop rigging markets   it warned that possible retaliation from beijing was not a reason for inaction  trump has staked out various positions on china as president in his tweets  phone calls and statements  in a phone call with xi after taking office  trump gave ground on one of beijing s most sensitive issues   the status of taiwan   after earlier suggesting he might not stick to washington s long held  one china  policy  trump signed two executive orders on trade on friday  one to improve import tariff collection and another to study the causes of the u s  trade deficit  trump said at the white house signing ceremony he and xi were  going to get down to some serious business  and vowed that  the theft of american prosperity  by foreign countries would end  chinese vice foreign minister zheng zeguang said on friday  the u s  china trade imbalance was mostly the result of differences in the two countries  economic structures and noted  china had a trade deficit in services  china tops the list of countries who have trade surpluses with the united states  with a   billion surplus last year  some in the u s  business community worry about tit for tat retaliation in trade disputes with china  jacob parker  vice president of china operations at the u s  china business council  said the two presidents need to take  positive actions that would lead to a more durable relationship  not retaliatory actions that would lead to a trade war   the list of commercial issues between the two countries was so long  it would be impossible to make a major dent in them with one meeting  he said  china is the largest export market for u s  soybean producers  accounting for  percent of u s  soy exports in  with a value of over   billion  leading some experts to suggest the sector could be particularly vulnerable to retaliation  steve censky  chief executive of the american soybean association  told reuters he hopes trump will take a  prudent  approach to the trade relationship and address any issues in a  workman like manner   recognizing that both countries have a lot to lose if the relationship suffers  william zarit  chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china met senior trump administration officials in february  and said  it was clear they were very familiar with the issues facing american companies in china  perhaps more so than previous administrations   but several corporate lobbyists  representing a range of companies expressed concern trump s lack of attention to detail could prove counterproductive when it comes to the intricacies of the massive trade and investment relationship   it s not yet clear whether     this is a white house that wants to fundamentally reset the terms of the relationship or tinker at the edges and declare a public relations win   said a china expert at a washington business lobby who asked not to be named
