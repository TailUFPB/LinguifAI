 reuters    president donald trump could trigger a political and legal backlash if he escalates his attacks on attorney general jeff sessions into an attempted purge of u s  law enforcement officials  lawmakers and legal experts said on tuesday  in lashing out against an investigation of possible ties between his  campaign and russia  trump is slamming sessions  prompting speculation that the president wants to oust the attorney general  if robert mueller  the special counsel running the russia investigation  is trump s ultimate target and he moves to fire mueller  a legal and political showdown could ensue  senator angus king  an independent from maine  told cnn on tuesday that he expected fellow lawmakers would not tolerate any effort by trump to replace sessions with a loyalist  especially if it appeared aimed at undermining mueller s investigation   the senators are going to be very skeptical about this   said king  who normally votes with democrats   my expectation is you d see a special prosecutor pass by veto proof majorities in both houses  and the investigation would continue   trump  who dismissed james comey as director of the federal bureau of investigation as it was looking into possible russian connections  was asked about sessions at a news conference on tuesday and said   time will tell  time will tell   these remarks followed twitter messages by trump in which he described sessions as  weak  and  beleaguered   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell told reporters in a capitol hallway on tuesday that sessions is  doing a fine job   republican richard shelby told reporters sessions  formerly his fellow senator from alabama  is  not the president s lawyer  he is the attorney general of the united states   here are basics on the law covering dismissal of justice department officials  including mueller  who was appointed by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein because sessions is recused from matters dealing with the russia investigation  on what grounds could mueller be fired  justice department regulations say a special counsel can only be removed for  misconduct  dereliction of duty  incapacity  conflict of interest  or for any other good cause   do trump s claims that mueller is on a  witch hunt  and that he is conflicted constitute  good cause     probably not  no court has ever interpreted the meaning of  good cause  in this context  but mueller has a sterling reputation and there is no indication he has exceeded the scope of his mandate  said andrew wright  former associate counsel in the obama white house and professor at savannah law school  campaign donations from members of mueller s team to democrats do not pose a conflict of interest  wright said  could trump directly fire mueller      probably not  department of justice rules say the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or the acting attorney general  trump has criticized rosenstein for appointing mueller and due to session s recusal  rosenstein has sole authority to fire mueller  but a few constitutional lawyers have said that trump might be able to lawfully fire mueller directly  saikrishna prakash of the university of virginia law school said the special counsel regulations may interfere with the president s broad power under the constitution to remove executive branch officials   i don t know if that regulation is constitutional   he said  if trump fires sessions or sessions quits  could trump handpick an attorney general who would fire mueller  normally  the president nominates an attorney general who must win senate confirmation  if trump followed this course  the senate would likely press any nominee on his or her intentions on terminating mueller  prakash said    the senate is going to want promises that this person will be independent of the white house and not be a toady   he said   how else could trump name an attorney general who he believes would fire mueller  under the federal vacancies reform act of   trump could appoint an interim attorney general  but only someone previously confirmed by the senate  the law can only be invoked to replace officials who die  resign or are  otherwise unable  to do their job  if trump invoked the federal vacancies reform act to replace sessions  a court may rule that trump overstepped  josh chafetz  a professor of constitutional law at cornell law school  said  what about a recess appointment   trump could try replacing sessions while the senate is on summer recess  expected to begin aug    the constitution grants the president such authority  said stephen vladeck  constitutional law professor at the university of texas school of law       the supreme court ruled in  the president cannot make a recess appointment during recesses of less than  days  the senate calendar is controlled by trump s fellow republicans       senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on tuesday that democrats would use every tool at their disposal to block a recess appointment of a sessions replacement  if mueller were fired  could he mount a court challenge  unclear  vladeck said the special counsel regulations do not address this question  if he brought a lawsuit  mueller likely would argue the rules would be pointless if there was no way to enforce them  vladeck said
