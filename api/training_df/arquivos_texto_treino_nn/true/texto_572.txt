yangon naypyitaw  reuters    members of the u s  congress said on tuesday operations carried out against the rohingya muslims in myanmar had  all the hallmarks  of ethnic cleansing  while the country s leader aung san suu kyi expressed doubts about allegations of rights abuses  the u s  senate members also said they were disturbed by a  violent and disproportionate  security response to rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than   people from myanmar to neighbouring bangladesh  human rights monitors have accused myanmar s military of atrocities  including mass rape  against the stateless rohingya during so called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on  police posts and an army base  myanmar s government has denied most of the claims  and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops   we are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment   suu kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the asia europe meeting  or asem  in myanmar s capital naypyitaw   we can t say whether it has happened or not  as a responsibility of the government  we have to make sure that it won t happen   nobel laureate suu kyi said she hoped talks with bangladesh s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the  safe and voluntary return  of those who have fled  suu kyi s less than two year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis  though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under myanmar s transition to power after decades of military rule  while a top un official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing   u s  secretary of state rex tillerson on a visit to myanmar last week refused to label it as such  in early november  u s  lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on myanmar military officials  democratic senator jeff merkley  who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the senate  led a congressional delegation that visited rakhine this week  but was blocked from traveling to the violence hit north of the state and to rohingya camps  the group also traveled to cox s bazar district in bangladesh  where rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies   many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones  children and husbands being killed in front of them  wives and daughters being raped  burns and other horrific injuries  this has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing   merkley told reporters in myanmar on tuesday   we are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the rohingya by the military and local groups   he said  the delegation called for myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community   we want to emphasize that the world is watching   merkley said  adding that it was important myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms  merkley said the delegation was  not here today to recommend what the u s  government would do or should do   when asked about the legislation introduced in the congress  myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new  model villages   rather than on the land they previously occupied  an approach the united nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps   individuals cannot be coming back simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination  restrictions on full participation in the economy and society   said merkley  he warned that isolating people in camps creates a  two tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts   speaking earlier on tuesday  suu kyi said discussions would be held with the bangladesh foreign minister on wednesday and thursday about repatriation  officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the rohingya wanting to return   we hope that this would result in an mou signed quickly  which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border   suu kyi said  the rohingya are largely stateless and many people in myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh  suu kyi said myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the  to cover the earlier repatriation of rohingya  who had fled to bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence  that agreement did not address the citizenship status of rohingya  and bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided rohingya with more safeguards this time   it s on the basis of residency   this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success  so this will be formula we will continue to follow   suu kyi said  earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal  but a senior myanmar official later accused bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees
