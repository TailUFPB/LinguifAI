washington  reuters    it is a political practice nearly as old as the united states   manipulating the boundaries of legislative districts to help one party tighten its grip on power in a move called partisan gerrymandering   and one the supreme court has never curbed  that could soon change  with the nine justices making the legal fight over republican drawn electoral maps in wisconsin one of the first cases they hear during their   term that begins next month  their ruling in the case could influence american politics for decades  wisconsin officials point to the difficulty of having courts craft a workable standard for when partisan gerrymandering violates constitutional protections  opponents of the practice said limits are urgently needed  noting that sophisticated technological tools now enable a dominant party to devise with new precision state electoral maps that marginalize large swathes of voters in legislative elections   there is a sense that something has gone amiss with american democracy  that there is this effort to rig the rules of the game   said michael li  an expert in redistricting at new york university school of law s brennan center for justice   gerrymandering used to be a dark art  and now it s a dark science   the justices will hear arguments on oct   in wisconsin s appeal of a lower court ruling that found that the electoral map drawn by state republicans ran afoul of the u s  constitution  the map  drawn after the  u s  census  enabled them to win a sizable majority of wisconsin legislative seats despite losing the popular vote statewide to the democrats  the party s majority has widened since   the justices must decide whether courts should have a say in such matters  the supreme court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply to give one party an advantage  the justices have never settled on a standard by which partisan gerrymandering claims can be measured  in a  case  justice anthony kennedy left the door open for a  workable standard  to eventually be found  kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the liberal justices on a court with a   conservative majority  could cast the deciding vote in the wisconsin case   a federal three judge panel ruled   last november that wisconsin s redistricting plan violated the u s  constitution s  amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law and first amendment right to freedom of expression and association  over the decades  both republicans and democrats have been accused of gerrymandering  since   republicans  control of redistricting has coincided with major seat advantages for them in state legislatures  the brennan center said   it is not just republicans who are accused of abuses  republican voters sued over districts drawn by democratic lawmakers in maryland and have appealed to the supreme court  state and federal legislative district boundaries are reconfigured after the u s  government conducts a census every decade so that each one contains about same number of people  typically by the party that controls the state legislature  the republican national committee and several conservative groups have backed wisconsin  but leading republicans including senator john mccain   presidential nominee bob dole and ohio governor john kasich have joined critics who argue that partisan gerrymandering distorts the democratic process   social science hodgepodge  wisconsin republicans argued that election results since their redistricting plan was passed in  reflect the state s political geography  with democrats concentrated in cities like milwaukee and madison and republicans more spread out around the state   the state also took issue with metrics that the lower court used to determine that there was a significant partisan bias in the redistricting plan  this  social science hodgepodge   the state told the justices  makes it impossible for judges to fairly determine when an electoral map is unlawful     plaintiffs  social science approach would sow chaos  each legislatively drawn plan would be immediately challenged in federal court   the state said in a legal brief to the justices  nicholas goedert  a virginia tech redistricting expert who testified in court for wisconsin  said the metrics may be inappropriate because their results can change from one election to the next  goedert noted that large shifts in the mood of voters can cause even highly biased electoral maps to flip   partisan maps have a tendency to backfire on the party that drew them   goedert said  the case began in  when a dozen wisconsin democratic party voters sued state election officials claiming the redistricting law intended to discriminate against them for their political beliefs and create enduring republican majorities  they urged the justices to either greenlight the lower court s method of deciding cases of partisan gerrymandering  or create their own    government should treat voters equally regardless of their viewpoint and we have ways to measure it   said danielle lang  an attorney for the plaintiffs  if the justices rule that courts must stay out of this highly political process  voters will lose  lang said   there would be no way for voters to rein in partisan gerrymandering  no way for voters to take back control of their government    for a graphic on wisconsin state electoral maps  click tmsnrt rs
