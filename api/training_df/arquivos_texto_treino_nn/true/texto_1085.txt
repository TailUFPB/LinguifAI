baghdad  reuters    iraqi prime minister haider al abadi defended the role of an iranian backed paramilitary force at a meeting with u s  secretary of state rex tillerson on monday in baghdad  tillerson arrived on monday hours after the iraqi government rejected his call to send home the popular mobilisation  an iran backed force that helped defeat islamic state and capture the kurdish held city of kirkuk  in his opening remarks at the meeting with tillerson  abadi said popular mobilisation  is part of the iraqi institutions   rejecting accusations that it is acting as an iranian proxy   popular mobilisation fighters should be encouraged because they will be the hope of country and the region   he added     iraq is one of the few countries allied closely to both the united states and iran  and tillerson s effort to drive a wedge between baghdad and tehran appeared to have backfired  drawing a sharp statement from the prime minister s office  tillerson visited iraq a day after a rare joint meeting with abadi and saudi arabia s king salman in the saudi capital  riyadh  after that meeting  he called on iraq to halt the work of the tehran backed paramilitary units  which have operated alongside government troops in battles against islamic state and  since last week  in a lightning advance that seized the oil city of kirkuk from kurdish security forces  at his meeting with abadi in baghdad  tillerson urged the iraqi government and masoud barzani s kurdistan regional government in erbil to resolve their conflict on kurdish self determination and disputed territories through dialogue    we are concerned and a bit sad   tillerson said   we have friends in baghdad and friends in erbil  and we encourage all parties to enter into discussion     and all differences can be addressed     iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery just south of a kurdish operated oil pipeline that crosses into turkey  a kurdish security official said  the latest in a series of iranian backed operations against the kurds   iranian militias that are in iraq  now that the fight against daesh and isis is coming to a close  those militias need to go home   tillerson said on sunday in saudi arabia  abadi s office responded sharply   no party has the right to interfere in iraqi matters   a statement from his office read  it did not cite the prime minister himself but a  source  close to him  it referred to the mainly shi ite popular mobilisation as  patriots   one of the closest groups to iran within popular mobilisation  asaib ahl al haq  reacted to tillerson s comment by saying it would be americans who will be forced to leave iraq   your forces should get ready to get out of our country once the excuse of daesh s presence is over   said asaib s leader  sheikh qais al khazali  according to the group s tv channel  al aahd  the international battle against islamic state fighters in northern iraq since  saw the united states and iran effectively fighting on the same side  with both supporting the iraqi government against the militants  washington has   troops in iraq and provided air support  training and weapons to iraqi government forces  at the same time  iran armed  trained and advised shi ite paramilitaries that often fought alongside the army  the latest twist in the iraq conflict  pitting the central government against the kurds  is trickier for u s  policymakers  washington still supports the central government but has also been allied to the kurds for decades  iran is the pre eminent shi ite power in the middle east  shi ites  including abadi  are the majority in iraq  but it also has large sunni arab and kurdish communities  in the campaign for the kurdish referendum  iran backed the government against the kurds  major general qassem soleimani  commander of foreign operations for iran s elite revolutionary guards  repeatedly warned kurdish leaders to withdraw from the oil city of kirkuk or face an onslaught by iraqi forces and iranian backed fighters  kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said  iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif dismissed tillerson s remarks  the paramilitaries could not go home because  they are at home  already  he was quoted as saying by the state news agency irna  abadi has asserted his authority with the defeat of islamic state in mosul and the iraqi army s sweep through kirkuk and other areas that were held by the kurds  the buildup at the kurdish oil export pipeline is taking place northwest of mosul  an official from the kurdistan regional government s security council said  the loss of kirkuk dealt a major blow to the kurds  who had been steadily building an autonomous region in northern iraq since a u s  led invasion toppled saddam hussein  who oppressed them for decades   we are concerned about continued military build up of iraqi forces and iranian backed popular mobilisation forces towards the kurdistan region   said the kurdistan region security council in a statement  elections for the iraqi kurdistan region s presidency and parliament set for nov   will be delayed because political parties failed to present candidates  the head of the electoral commission  hendrean mohammed  told reuters  parties have been unable to focus on the elections in the turmoil that followed the referendum  a kurdish lawmaker said on condition of anonymity
