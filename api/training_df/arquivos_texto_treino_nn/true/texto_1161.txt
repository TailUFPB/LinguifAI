new york  reuters    a federal judge in new york voiced skepticism on wednesday over whether groups and individuals should be able to proceed with a lawsuit against president donald trump alleging that he violated the u s  constitution by accepting foreign payments through his hotels and other businesses  u s  district judge george daniels also questioned government lawyers seeking to have him throw out the suit accusing trump of running afoul of the constitution s  emoluments  clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office  daniels said he would rule within a month or two on whether he will continue to hear the suit  the emoluments clause  designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence  bars u s  officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval   trump has ceded day to day control of his businesses to his sons  critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard  during a hearing on the bid to dismiss the case  daniels suggested the u s  congress might be better suited than the courts to resolve the dispute    they can make this an issue  but they have not done so   daniels said   why is it appropriate for the judiciary to have the president fight this out in a street brawl   the plaintiffs in the lawsuit  filed in january after trump took office  are the nonprofit watchdog group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington  a hotel owner  a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group  daniels  appointed to the bench by democratic former president bill clinton  acknowledged that the case was navigating  uncharted waters    if he allows the case to go ahead  a lawyer for the plaintiffs  joseph sellers  said they intend to seek further evidence of trump s alleged violations of the emoluments clause  in court papers  they said the  full extent of his violations  are not yet known because he has not released his tax returns    but daniels raised doubts about whether the plaintiffs are legally entitled to sue  federal courts usually require plaintiffs to demonstrate they have actually been harmed   the plaintiffs allege they are injured when foreign governments try to  curry favor  with trump by favoring his businesses  such as the trump international hotel in washington  or a high end restaurant at a trump hotel in new york city  leading to lost patronage  wages and commissions  the emoluments clause was not meant to provide a right to protect individuals from competition  daniels told another plaintiffs  lawyer  deepak gupta  gupta urged the judge to reject  the government s view that the president is above the law    in june  the trump administration asked the court to throw out the case  saying the constitution prohibits gifts and emoluments given to u s  officials acting in their official capacities only and does not constrain the president s businesses   daniels did not buy that argument  if a foreign government expects favorable action  it might also  buy a million dollars worth of your hot dogs   he told brett shumate  a lawyer for the u s  department of justice   just because it s a business transaction doesn t necessarily mean it s not an emolument   daniels said  shumate replied   the president is engaging in ordinary business transactions  not in exchange for anything
