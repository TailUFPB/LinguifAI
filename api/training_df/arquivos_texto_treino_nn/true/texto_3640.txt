washington  reuters    former white house national security adviser michael flynn declined on monday to comply with a subpoena from the senate intelligence committee as it investigates possible russian interference in the  u s  election  flynn invoked his fifth amendment constitutional protection against self incrimination  according to a letter to the senate committee from his attorney  which was seen by reuters  flynn s attorneys did not respond to multiple requests for comment  the retired lieutenant general is a key witness in the russia probe  which has roiled the first months of president donald trump s presidency with a spate of negative news reports  senators richard burr and mark warner  the top republican and democrat on the intelligence panel  said in a statement they were disappointed by flynn s decision  but would  vigorously pursue  his testimony and documents related to the investigation  the committee is conducting one of the main congressional probes into u s  intelligence agency reports of russian meddling in the election and whether there was collusion between trump s campaign and russia  moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations and trump denies any collusion  separately on monday  the washington post reported that trump asked two of the country s top intelligence officials  director of national intelligence dan coats and national security agency director admiral michael rogers  to help him deny any collusion between his team and russia during his presidential campaign  coats and rogers declined the request  the post reported  flynn apparently misled pentagon investigators about his foreign connections when he sought to renew his security clearance in early   according to a document obtained by congressional democrats and released in part on monday  interviewed as part of the clearance renewal process  flynn said all of his foreign trips as a private citizen  were funded by u s  companies   according to excerpts of a march     report compiled by security clearance investigators  in fact  a trip flynn made to moscow in december   where he attended a gala dinner and sat next to russian president vladimir putin  was paid for by russia today  which u s  officials consider a state run propaganda arm  according to documents previously released by the house oversight committee  the document is the latest to shed light on how flynn received a clearance and was hired as trump s national security advisor  he was forced to resign in february after less than a month for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  and misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations  excerpts were released by representative elijah cummings  ranking democrat on the house committee  flynn s decision to decline to comply with the senate intelligence committee subpoena was first reported by the associated press  his attorney wrote to the committee that  the context in which the committee has called for general flynn s testimonial production of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any testimony he provides could be used against him   flynn s legal team said he was rejecting the subpoena because the committee spurned his offer  made by the retired army general in a may  letter   to give a full account of the facts and to answer the committee s questions  should the circumstances permit  including assurances against unfair prosecution  we stated that  absent such assurances  general flynn would respectfully decline your request for an interview and for production of documents   it was not clear what the committee would do if flynn decided not to comply  burr and warren did not elaborate  several panel members said they were waiting to learn more before coming to any conclusion about what might come next   we ll see what the future brings   democratic senator dianne feinstein told reporters  adding    this may portend that  flynn  faces something serious       senator james lankford  a republican panel member  said flynn was within his rights to invoke the fifth amendment of the u s  constitution   we will get to the truth one way or another   lankford said on twitter   we need facts  not speculation   anonymous sources   a congressional research service report outlined three main options if congress decides to enforce the subpoena  seeking criminal prosecution through the executive branch  asking the courts for a civil judgment and using a dormant power of  inherent contempt  to detain and imprison an individual  the latter option has not been used in  years  congress has more often relied on the criminal contempt statute recently  reuters reported on thursday that flynn and other advisers to trump s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least  calls and emails during the last seven months of the u s  presidential race  two other former trump associates   one time campaign chairman paul manafort and republican operative roger stone   have turned over documents the senate panel had requested  while a third   campaign adviser carter page   had not yet complied  nbc news reported  citing a congressional source  flynn has acknowledged being a paid consultant to the turkish government during the campaign
