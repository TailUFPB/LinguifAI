washington  reuters    republicans struggling to agree on healthcare legislation to overhaul obamacare obeyed u s  president donald trump s orders to try to swiftly reach a deal but were unable to resolve their differences in a long  late night meeting  earlier on wednesday  trump took senate republicans to task for failing to agree on how to dismantle obamacare  as a new report showed  million americans would lose health insurance if senators opt to repeal the law without a replacement  trump gathered  republican senators for a white house lunch after a bill to repeal and replace the  affordable care act collapsed on monday amid dissent from a handful of the party s conservatives and moderates   after trump s exhortation to keep trying  party members met with health and human services secretary tom price behind closed doors on wednesday night to try to finally come together on a major republican promise of the past seven years   undoing former democratic president barack obama s signature legislation  popularly known as obamacare  there was no immediate breakthrough   we still have some issues that divide us   said senator ted cruz  a conservative who has proposed letting insurers offer cheaper bare bones plans that do not comply with obamacare regulations   republicans attending the late meeting sent their staff away in order to talk frankly and senator john kennedy said everyone was negotiating in good faith but he added he did not know if they would reach agreement   almost all the other senators rushed off after the meeting without comment  as it was getting underway  the nearly two dozen republican senators were shaken by news that their colleague  veteran senator john mccain  had been diagnosed with brain cancer  mccain s absence from the senate makes the job of passing a healthcare bill more difficult because leaders need every republican vote they can get   obviously  i think more people are worried about his health than thinking about the math  you understand the math  obviously it makes things difficult   senator bob corker said as he left the meeting  trump had taken a hands off approach to the healthcare debate last week and suggested on tuesday that he was fine with  letting obamacare fail  then on wednesday he switched course and demanded senators stay in washington through their planned august recess until they find common ground on healthcare   we can repeal  but we should repeal and replace  and we shouldn t leave town until this is complete   trump said at the meeting  trump made the repeal and replacement of obamacare  which he has called a  disaster   a central promise of his  campaign  even with trump s new push  republican leaders in the senate face a difficult task getting moderates and conservatives to agree on an overhaul that can pass  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had planned to hold a straight repeal vote next week  but several republican senators have already said they oppose that approach   thirty two million americans would lose their health insurance by  if obamacare is scrapped without an alternative in place  the nonpartisan congressional budget office reported on wednesday  while  million would become uninsured next year alone   at the same time  premiums on individual insurance plans would rise  percent next year and double by    the cbo s estimates were unchanged from a previous report that assessed the impact of a  bill to repeal obamacare that passed the house of representatives and senate and was vetoed by obama   democrats were swift to highlight the cbo s assessment  while republicans remained silent   president trump and republicans have repeatedly promised to lower premiums and increase coverage  yet each proposal they offer would do the opposite   senate democratic leader charles schumer said in a statement      insurers and hospitals have lobbied against straight repeal  saying the limbo would increase uncertainty and their costs   cbo projects half the country would have no insurers in the individual market by  under the new repeal bill  that s a true death spiral   tweeted larry levitt  vice president at the kaiser family foundation  a healthcare research group  republicans say obamacare is a costly intrusion into the healthcare system  but the party is divided between moderates concerned the senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low income americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to obamacare  which boosted the number of americans with health insurance by  million through mandates on individuals and employers  and income based subsidies  moderate republican senators susan collins  lisa murkowski and shelley moore capito said they opposed mcconnell s plan for a repeal that would take effect in two years  all three attended the lunch with trump  with democrats united in opposition to repeal  mcconnell can only lose two votes from the republicans    majority in the  seat senate to pass healthcare legislation  opponents of repeal protested throughout senate buildings on wednesday afternoon  leading to  arrests  police said  demonstrators returned in the evening to yell as senators arrived for the meeting  party fractures also emerged in the house of representatives  the chamber passed a plan to repeal and replace obamacare in may  but on wednesday  the house freedom caucus  the republican party s conservative wing  filed a petition to vote on a straight repeal  house speaker paul ryan s spokeswoman  ashlee strong  said   the house passed an obamacare repeal and replace bill we are proud of and we hope the senate will take similar action
