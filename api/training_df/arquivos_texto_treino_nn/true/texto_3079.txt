jerusalem  reuters    u s  president donald trump s son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner  met israeli and palestinian leaders on wednesday to try to revive long fractured middle east peacemaking that washington acknowledged will take some time  kushner  a  year old real estate developer with little experience of international diplomacy or political negotiation  arrived in israel on wednesday morning and was due to spend barely  hours on the ground  video showed him giving israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  a friend of kushner s father  a handshake and a hug as they prepared to sit down with the israeli ambassador to washington  the u s  ambassador to israel and other senior officials for preliminary discussions   this is an opportunity to pursue our common goals of security  prosperity and peace   netanyahu said   jared  i welcome you here in that spirit  i know of your efforts  the president s efforts  and i look forward to working with you to achieve these common goals   kushner replied   the president sends his best regards and it s an honor to be here with you   kushner did not speak to the media or take questions  maintaining the circumspect profile he has established since trump took office in january  u s  officials and israeli leaders  underscored that forging peace will take time and stressed the importance of doing everything possible to create an environment conducive to peacemaking   the white house later said in a statement  kushner traveled to ramallah  in the israeli occupied west bank  for two hours of talks with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after iftar  the evening meal that breaks the daily ramadan fast  abbas spokesman nabil abu rdainah said all major issues at the heart of the conflict were discussed  u s  officials called the trip part of an effort to keep the conversation going rather than the launching of a new phase in the peace process  saying that kushner and jason greenblatt  the president s special representative for international negotiations  are likely to return often  trump has described peace between the israelis and the palestinians as  the ultimate deal  and made it a priority  as well as receiving both netanyahu and abbas in the white house  he visited the region last month  but it remains unclear what approach trump  via kushner and greenblatt  plans to take on resolving one of the world s most intractable conflicts   for at least two decades  the goal of u s  led diplomacy has been a  two state solution   meaning an independent palestinian state living side by side and at peace with israel  but when trump met netanyahu in washington in february  he said he was not fixed on two states saying   i m looking at two state and one state  and i like the one that both parties like   netanyahu has in the past given conditional backing to two states  but ahead of his last election victory in   he promised there would never be a palestinian state on his watch  a remark seen as an attempt to shore up right wing support  in discussions with greenblatt before kushner s visit  palestinian sources said the phrase  two state solution  had not been used  palestinian sources said that ahead of kushner s meeting with abbas  they had been asked to draw up a list of   bullet point  demands they would want met in any negotiations   they saw it as a helpful exercise in focusing on core elements rather than an oversimplification of a complex issue  trump administration officials have said that if they are going to make progress on peace  they do not want to get bogged down in process but to move rapidly on tackling what are known as  final status  issues  the complexities around jerusalem  palestinian refugees  water resources  security and borders  those have long been thorny problems in the multiple rounds of peace negotiations launched by both republican and democratic presidents since the mid   it remains unclear what new approach trump s administration may have to untangling disputes that blend politics  land  religion and ethnicity and have defied resolution for  years
