washington  reuters    some republican lawmakers appear to be reassessing whether to make changes to a surveillance law that allows broad snooping of internet communications  citing concerns over the handling of classified intercepts after leaks of conversations between russian officials and american associates of president donald trump  the law  known as section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  allows u s  intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of communications from foreigners  but often incidentally scoops up the communications of americans  until recently most republicans have been quick to defend section  and congress had been expected to renew it without major changes before it expires at the end of the year  though long criticized by privacy advocates  a new front of potential opposition to section  has emerged as republicans sputter about what they view as politically motivated leaks by the agencies amid probes of any collusion between the russian government and trump s  presidential election campaign   the tensions burst into full view on monday at a u s  house of representatives  intelligence committee hearing  during which fbi director james comey confirmed his agency was investigating those ties   republican representative tom rooney told comey and national security agency director mike rogers  who also testified  that concern over leaks would undermine support for section   even though it appears to not have led directly to the leaks republicans are fuming over   when we try to retain this tool this year and try to convince some of our colleagues that this is really important for national security and somebody in the intelligence community says   you know what  the hell with it  i m going to release this person s name because i m going to get something out of it   we re all going to be hurt by that   rooney said as he removed his glasses in apparent exasperation  while democrats on the committee focused their questioning of comey and rogers on whether trump aides may have suspicious ties to russian officials  republicans repeatedly redirected the conversation to focus on whether enough safeguards were in place to prevent leaks about americans  u s  intelligence agencies accused moscow of attempts to influence the election in favor of republican trump  in part by hacking emails of democratic party operatives  russia denies the allegations  trump has criticized the intelligence agencies and has denied he has had anything to do with russia  section  surveillance is intended to apply only to foreigners living overseas  elaborate rules govern incidental coverage of americans  but the information can sometimes be used  nonetheless  privacy advocates have said that communications belonging to as many as tens of millions of americans could be caught up in the searches  despite the concern about leaks  a white house official told reuters earlier this month that the trump administration favored a reauthorization this year of the expiring portions of the fisa without any changes to address privacy concerns  on monday  several republicans sought to directly link media reports revealing that trump s former national security advisor  michael flynn  exchanged calls during the presidential transition with russian ambassador sergei kislyak about sanctions to the debate about section    flynn had told vice president mike pence he did not speak to kislyak about sanctions  an assertion contradicted by news articles  which cited transcripts of surveillance intercepts and led to flynn s ouster  comey and rogers both said that section  surveillance was unrelated to how intercepts of flynn s calls were collected or leaked to the press  and that such information would have most likely been gathered under a different part of fisa or a wholly separate authority   that is a distinction that doesn t make a difference to people watching on television   representative trey gowdy responded  adding that renewal of section  was  in jeopardy if we don t get this resolved   the hearing echoed conversations that took place during a closed meeting with senior intelligence officials this month with the house judiciary committee  which is expected to take the lead on writing legislation that will seek reform and renewal of section    two sources familiar with the meeting said several lawmakers sought clarity on how many intelligence officials had access to classified surveillance information but were frustrated by the lack of clear answers  rogers said monday that  people at nsa  including himself  possessed the authority to  unmask  americans whose communications are ensnared via foreign intelligence programs  a select few officials at other agencies also have the authority  including some at the federal bureau of investigation  the department of justice and the cia  section  enables sweeping surveillance programs known as prism and upstream  which were revealed publicly in  by former nsa contractor edward snowden  prism gathers messaging data from alphabet inc s google   facebook inc   microsoft corp  apple inc and other major tech companies that is sent to and from a foreign target under surveillance  upstream allows the nsa to copy web traffic flowing along the internet backbone located inside the united states and search that data
