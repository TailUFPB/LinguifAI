 washington  reuters    the senate s main investigation into allegations of russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election is equipped with a much smaller staff than previous high profile intelligence and scandal probes in congress  which could potentially affect its progress  according to sources and a reuters review of public records   with only seven staff members initially assigned to the senate intelligence committee s three month old investigation  progress has been sluggish and minimal  said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter  who requested anonymity   a committee aide  also speaking on condition of anonymity  said two more staff members were being added and a few others were involved less formally    we need to pick up the pace   senator martin heinrich  a committee democrat  told reuters on monday   it is incumbent on us to have the resources to do this right and expeditiously  and i think we need additional staff    while some directly involved in the investigation disputed characterizations of the probe as off track  the appearance of a weak senate investigation could renew calls by some democrats and other trump critics for a commission independent of the republican led congress to investigate the allegations   the intelligence committees of the senate and house of representatives have taken the lead in congress in examining whether russia tried to influence the election in republican trump s favor  mostly by hacking democratic operatives  emails and releasing embarrassing information  or possibly by colluding with trump associates  russia has denied such meddling    with the house intelligence panel s investigation for weeks stymied by partisan squabbles  the senate committee s parallel probe had appeared to be the more serious of the two  with republican chairman richard burr and top democrat mark warner promising a thorough and bipartisan effort   burr  a member of congress since   last month called the russia probe one of the biggest investigations undertaken in congress during his tenure   previous investigations of national security matters have been much larger in terms of staffing than the one burr is overseeing  according to a review of official reports produced by those inquiries  which traditionally name every staff member involved    a house committee formed to investigate the  attacks on a u s  diplomatic mission in benghazi  libya  that killed four americans had  staffers and eight interns   the senate intelligence committee s years long study of the cia s  enhanced  interrogation techniques during president george w  bush s administration had  staff members  according to the panel s official report   a special commission separate from congress that reviewed the intelligence that wrongly concluded former iraqi president saddam hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the  invasion of iraq involved  staffers   a special senate committee s  investigation into watergate era surveillance practices tapped  staffers   a joint house senate probe of the  iran contra affair during ronald reagan s presidency involving secret sales of arms to iran to try to win the release of american hostages  with proceeds going to nicaraguan rebels  had  staffers   spokeswomen for burr and for warner declined to comment on the staffing levels   the listed sizes of various investigations may be an imperfect comparison because not all staffers listed may have actually had a substantial role  congressional sources said  investigations often grow in size over time  and a committee aide said the panel had secured    million in additional funding for the russia election investigation   but the numbers are still broadly  relevant as indicators of a commitment to an investigation   said steven aftergood  a secrecy expert with the federation of american scientists    for this investigation to be successful  the committee must recognize the enormity of the job and provide the resources to tackle it   senator ron wyden  another committee democrat  said in a statement   wyden sent a letter last month to burr and warner requesting that the probe include a thorough review of any financial ties between russia and trump and his associates   none of the staffers possess substantial investigative experience or a background in russian affairs  two of the sources said   the investigation has not yet conducted interviews with trump associates suspected of having links to russian intelligence services  two sources and the aide said   the investigators have focused on reviewing thousands of pages of documents supporting a previous u s  intelligence agency finding that russia interfered to help trump  and have spoken with intelligence officials in preparation for interviewing key witnesses  they said   the house intelligence panel s chairman  republican devin nunes  who was a member of trump s presidential transition team  on april  stepped aside from leading that probe because he was under investigation by the house ethics committee for allegedly disclosing classified information   the federal bureau of investigation is also conducting a wide ranging counter intelligence investigation into alleged russian interference and potential collusion with trump associates  though its findings may never become public
