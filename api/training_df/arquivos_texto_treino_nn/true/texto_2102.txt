statues from the u s  capitol  u s  senator cory booker  also a democrat  said he would introduce legislation so that could be done   there is no room for celebrating the violent bigotry of the men of the confederacy in the hallowed halls of the united states capitol or in places of honor across the country   pelosi said in a statement  a spokesman for republican u s  house speaker paul ryan said it was up to u s  states to determine which statues were displayed on their behalf in the capitol building
