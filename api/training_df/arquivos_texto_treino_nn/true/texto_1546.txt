washington  reuters    president donald trump told u s  lawmakers on tuesday he wants bipartisan cooperation on tax reform  as pressure on him to produce a legislative victory on any front escalated with the collapse of the latest republican push to repeal obamacare  the administration and republicans in congress are due to unveil a tax plan on wednesday  the plan has been developed over several months by six white house and congressional republicans working behind closed doors and with no input from democrats  on the eve of its unveiling  trump told members of the house of representatives tax committee from both parties   i ve asked lawmakers of both parties to join us to discuss our framework      it s time for both parties to come together   he said lawmakers should expect a  very  very powerful document  that would deliver a big tax cut for the middle class   we will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class   not just a little bit  but tremendously   said the president  who is set to travel to indianapolis on wednesday to unveil the plan  republicans  who control the white house and both chambers of congress have been unable to deliver a significant legislative win on any topic since trump took office in january  senate republicans admitted failure on tuesday in their latest push to replace the  affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare   raising pressure on the party to overhaul the tax code this year  although that difficult effort has repeatedly been delayed  republicans and democrats who met with trump on tuesday said afterward that the president indicated an interest in working with democrats on both tax reform and healthcare going forward   he said you get a better deal if it s bipartisan   said representative richard neal  the panel s top democrat  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch has also called for bipartisan tax reform  details of the trump tax plan that have leaked out showed that the corporate income tax rate would be slashed to  percent from  percent  the rate for  pass through  businesses to  percent from   percent  and the rate for top individual earners to  percent from   percent the u s  tax code has not been overhauled since  under republican president ronald reagan  in the years since  it has gotten much more complex  skewed toward special interests and insufficient for raising enough revenue to cover washington s spending  producing a federal budget deficit  as the trump administration and congressional republicans have tried in recent months to forge a tax plan  their work has focused mostly on cutting tax rates and less on attempting a comprehensive overhaul of the code    the trump plan is expected to be light on specifics  particularly on how to pay for its proposed tax cuts  although neal said the white house pushed hard on the idea of eliminating the deduction for state and local tax payments  lawmakers said some key tax rates were still in flux on tuesday   without offsets such as the closing of lucrative tax loopholes to pay for lower tax rates  the proposed tax cuts would deeply cut federal revenue by about   trillion in a decade  according to the nonpartisan tax foundation think tank  such huge revenue losses  as well as the plan s anticipated inclusion of a tax cut for the wealthiest americans  could make cooperation difficult for democrats  who want tax reform to be revenue neutral and to offer no relief for top earners  neal said trump showed a readiness to avoid cutting taxes for the wealthy during their meeting   he said  quote  the rich will not benefit   said the massachusetts democrat  representative james renacci  a ways and means committee republican  said individual tax rates were still under discussion  including the possibility of raising the tax rate for the poorest taxpayers to  percent from  percent    there are a lot of questions on where we re at in that area at this point  some things are not totally tied down   renacci told reuters   we ve got some tweaking to do   among republicans  even fiscal hawks were showing a willingness to accept huge revenue losses  predicting that aggressive tax cuts would drive future economic growth and produce new tax revenues that would pay for lower rates  such economic assumptions have been questioned by democrats  who say that the trump tax plan will unfairly favor the wealthy and that providing them with tax cuts does not drive growth   senate republicans tentatively agreed last week that tax legislation could lose up to    trillion over a decade  but become revenue neutral thereafter due to economic growth  on tuesday  mark meadows  chairman of the conservative house freedom caucus  said he would not support a tax reform plan with a corporate tax rate above  percent or a small business tax rate above  percent
