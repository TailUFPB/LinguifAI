washington  reuters on friday     u s  special counsel robert mueller late on friday unveiled a trove of evidence against president donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort to convince a judge that he violated a gag order by ghost writing an article to bolster his public image  the evidence mueller revealed in a filing  which is a fraction of what he said earlier on friday he has collected  is the first clear indication of the depth of his investigation and the nature of what his investigators have found  in the  page filing  prosecutors in mueller s office produced emails  drafts with tracked edits and records showing that a computer user named  paul manafort  created a version of the op ed and made numerous changes on november   between   p m  and   p m    and  last saved at   p m    they also produced records indicating that the op ed  published on thursday in the english language kyiv post over mueller s objections  tracked talking points manafort and his business associate richard gates wrote in august   that was after manafort was forced to resign from trump s campaign because of political work he had done for pro russian figures including former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych  mueller also claimed in the filing that manafort collaborated on the piece with konstantin kilimnik  a russian to whom mueller alluded in a filing earlier this week as having ties to russian intelligence  the filing did not disclose how mueller s team acquired the data  and jason maloni  a spokesman for manafort  declined to comment on it  in the filing  mueller s team argued that u s  district court for the district of columbia judge amy berman jackson should deny a request by manafort to lift his house arrest  saying the op ed violated her gag order and demonstrated that he cannot be trusted   bail is fundamentally about trust   the filing said   even taken in the light most favorable to manafort  this conduct shows little respect for this court and a penchant for skirting  if not breaking  rules   manafort s attorney kevin downing on thursday denied that his client had violated the gag order  saying an article published in a ukrainian newspaper would not substantially prejudice the case in the united states   downing acknowledged in a filing on thursday that manafort had helped edit the piece  but said it was his client s first amendment right to defend himself  he did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on mueller s second filing  mueller s team responded to downing s first amendment argument by citing a supreme court case that found that free speech does not  disable a district court   from taking steps to protect cases that could be harmed by  the creation of a  carnival atmosphere  in high profile cases   a federal grand jury indicted manafort and his business associate rick gates in october as part of mueller s investigation into accusations of russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election and possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign  russia has denied any meddling and trump has dismissed any suggestions of collusion  the charges against manafort include conspiracy to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent working on behalf of former pro russian ukrainian president viktor yanukovych s government  who was ousted in   manafort and gates are under house arrest and electronic monitoring  but they have been negotiating to have those conditions lifted  all parties were ordered by the judge on nov   not to discuss the case in public or with the media in a way that could substantially prejudice a fair trial  earlier this week  mueller s team discovered the draft op ed was in the works and ordered manafort s lawyers to shut it down  it was published on thursday under the byline of oleg voloshyn  a former spokesman for ukraine s foreign affairs ministry   on december   voloshyn emailed the u s  embassy claiming credit for writing the piece and accusing mueller of  deliberately twist ing  the reality   according to an email in the filing  the article praised manafort s work helping ukraine secure better relations with the european union and said he lobbied for pro western values  not russian interests  documents mueller filed with the court showed that gates and manafort worked together in august and september of  to craft  narratives  to deflect negative press about manafort after his resignation from the campaign   need to beat back the idea that this was nefarious work   a document said   your efforts were in support and promotion of pro democratic values around the world   the  narratives  also claimed that manafort  never worked in russia or for russians   that his work was  centered on pro ukraine efforts to enter the eu   and that he  never took cash payments   manafort and gates are scheduled to appear in court on monday for a status conference hearing  where the judge is likely to address the dispute  earlier on friday  mueller revealed in another filing that his office has turned over more than   emails  financial records and other documents to manafort s lawyers to demonstrate what evidence the government has against him ahead of a  trial  in addition  they provided imaged copies of  electronic devices such as laptops  telephones and thumb drives  copies of  search or seizure warrants  and   so called  hot  documents  or those that contain potentially crucial evidence
