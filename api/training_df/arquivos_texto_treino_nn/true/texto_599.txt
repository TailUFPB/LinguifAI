washington  reuters    a radio broadcaster accused u s  senator al franken on thursday of touching her breasts while she slept and forcing a kiss on her in  when he was still a comedian and the two were preparing to perform before u s  troops in the middle east  anchor leeann tweeden related her experience in a first person account on the website of los angeles station kabc amid outrage over numerous reports of sexual misconduct by powerful men from hollywood to capitol hill   franken  a democrat  issued an apology on thursday  the senate s democratic and republican leaders called on the ethics committee to review the allegations and franken said he would cooperate  tweeden said franken wrote a skit that included a kiss between the two and said he insisted upon rehearsing it  which she at first resisted   he repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss  i said  ok  so he would stop badgering me   she wrote   we did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me  put his hand on the back of my head  mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth   she said she pushed franken away but felt disgusted and violated  tweeden also said franken groped her while she slept during their flight home on a military plane   i felt violated all over again  embarrassed  belittled  humiliated   tweeden wrote   how dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it s funny   she posted a photo taken at the time of franken mugging for the camera with his hands above her breasts as she sat in the military aircraft wearing a flak jacket with eyes closed     i certainly don t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way  but i send my sincerest apologies to leeann  as to the photo  it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn t  i shouldn t have done it   franken said in a statement  reuters was unable to independently verify tweeden or franken s accounts      she told reporters in a later press conference that she considered the kiss an assault but accepted his apology   the apology  sure  i accept it   she said   people make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake   u s  president donald trump weighed in on twitter  calling the photo  really bad    and to think that just last week he  franken  was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women   trump tweeted  trump himself came under fire last year over alleged sexual misconduct after a decade old outtake from his appearance on the television program  access hollywood  surfaced during the presidential campaign  in which trump bragged about kissing and grabbing women without their consent  trump later apologized for the  access hollywood  comments  which he called  locker room talk   he told reporters last month that allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled at him before the election by several women were  made up stuff   franken  in a longer statement issued after his first apology  was more contrite   i don t know what was in my head when i took that picture  and it doesn t matter  there s no excuse  i look at it now and i feel disgusted with myself  it isn t funny  it s completely inappropriate   he said   the uso  which sponsored the tour on which franken and tweeden traveled  said it was never aware of the incident   this incident was never reported to the uso   uso spokeswoman ashley mclellan said in an email   we have no knowledge of it  the report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the uso    franken was a well known american comedian before he was elected to the u s  senate in  as a democrat from minnesota  sexual misconduct allegations have been lodged against several well known men in the entertainment industry  and roy moore  a republican u s  senate candidate in alabama  has been accused of having sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago  moore    has denied the accusations and said he was the victim of a political witch hunt   trump on thursday said moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true  a stance that puts him at odds with other republican leaders in washington who have said they believe the women making the accusations against the former alabama supreme court chief justice and have demanded that moore withdraw from the race ahead of the dec   vote  lawmakers this week shared stories of women and men being propositioned and groped in the halls of the u s  capitol as congress reviewed sexual harassment policies    senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and democratic leader chuck schumer agreed the ethics committee should investigate  franken also called for an ethics investigation   it appears that the senate is looking into that  which they should  and we feel that is an appropriate action   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said on thursday when asked about the allegations against franken  franken s democratic senate colleagues clare mccaskill and kirsten gillibrand both expressed deep concern about the allegations   the behavior described is completely unacceptable  comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct  and i believe there should be an ethics investigation   mccaskill wrote on twitter  former republican vice presidential candidate sarah palin  asked about alabama senate candidate moore  said reporters should be asking her instead about franken and called up the photograph on her phone   this is what you should be asking me about   palin said  as she talked to reporters in the u s  capitol  complaining about  double standards here   she added franken should leave the senate if the account is true  tweeden said she was inspired to tell her story by women members of congress who spoke up against harassment this week   i m telling my story because there may be others   she said
