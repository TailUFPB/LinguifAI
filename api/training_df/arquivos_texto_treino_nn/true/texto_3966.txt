washington  reuters    the white house on sunday defended president donald trump s decision to invite philippine president rodrigo duterte to washington  saying his cooperation was needed to counter north korea  even as the administration faced human rights criticism for its overture to manila  trump issued the invitation on saturday night in what the white house said was a  very friendly  phone conversation with duterte  who is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the philippines   there is nothing right now facing this country and facing the region that is a bigger threat than what s happening in north korea    white house chief of staff reince priebus told abc s  this week  during a weekend in which trump sought to firm up support in southeast asia to help rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs  north korea suggested on monday it would continue its nuclear weapons tests  saying it will bolster its force  to the maximum  in a  consecutive and successive way at any moment  in the face of what it calls u s  aggression and hysteria  priebus insisted the outreach to duterte  doesn t mean that human rights don t matter  but what it does mean is that the issues facing us developing out of north korea are so serious that we need cooperation at some level with as many partners in the area as we can get to make sure we have our ducks in a row   since he came to power last year  duterte has often sniped at washington  his country s longtime ally  has sought to mend relations with china and spoken of improving ties with russia  asked on monday about his invitation from trump  he was non committal  telling reporters   i m tied up   i cannot make any definite promise  i am supposed to go to russia and go to israel   he said  referring to already scheduled visits  foreign ministry spokesman robespierre bolivar said that once a formal letter of invitation came it would be accepted   the  invitation for duterte to the visit white house at an unspecified date appeared to be the latest example of the affinity trump has shown for some foreign leaders with shaky human rights or autocratic reputations  for instance  he expressed admiration for russian president vladimir putin during the  presidential campaign  hosted egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi at the white house and has had warm words for chinese president xi jinping  whom trump is pressing to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor  north korea  on sunday  trump also extended a white house invitation to thai prime minister prayuth chan ocha  a former general who heads a military government that took power in a  coup  prayuth s administration had strained relations with trump s predecessor  barack obama   celebrating a man who boasts of killing his own citizens and inviting him to the white house  while remaining silent on his disgusting human rights record  sends a terrifying message   said john sifton  the asia director of human rights watch   by effectively endorsing duterte s murderous  war on drugs   trump has made himself morally complicit in future killings   he said  a trump administration official insisted  however  that the invitation was not a reward to duterte or an endorsement of his policies but a decision that engagement with the philippines was better than withdrawal which could  intensify bad behavior  by duterte   it s not a  thank you    the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity   it s a meeting   the official denied a new york times report citing administration officials saying the state department and the national security council were caught off guard by the invitation to duterte and were expected to object internally   we were not surprised  the guys who prepared for the call were unified on this   the official said  priebus made clear that north korea was the top priority   if we don t have all of our folks together   whether they re good folks  bad folks  people we wish would do better in their country  doesn t matter  we ve got to be on the same page  on north korea  priebus said  but taking a swipe at trump for his invitation to duterte   democratic u s  senator chris murphy tweeted   we are watching in real time as the american human rights bully pulpit disintegrates into ash   thousands of filipinos have been killed since duterte unleashed his fierce anti drugs campaign nearly  months ago  police say they have killed only in self defense  and the deaths of other drug dealers and users was down to vigilantes or narcotics gangs silencing potential witnesses  human rights groups say official accounts are implausible and accuse duterte of backing campaign of systematic extrajudicial killings by police  the government denies that  duterte was infuriated by the obama administration s expressions of concern about extrajudicial killings after he took office last year and threatened to sever the long standing u s  defense alliance  duterte spoke positively about trump  a fellow populist  after the u s  presidential election in november  and the new administration has sought ways to mend the alliance  in a summary of saturday s phone call between the two leaders  the white house said the two discussed  the fact that the philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs  a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world   the white house statement included no criticism of duterte s methods
