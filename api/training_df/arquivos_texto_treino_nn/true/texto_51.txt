washington  reuters    the republican controlled u s  house of representatives gave final approval on wednesday to the biggest overhaul of the u s  tax code in  years  sending a sweeping    trillion tax bill to president donald trump for his signature  in sealing trump s first major legislative victory since he took office in january  republicans steamrolled opposition from democrats to pass a bill that slashes taxes for corporations and the wealthy while giving mixed  temporary tax relief to middle class americans  the house approved the measure by    passing it for the second time in two days after a procedural foul up forced another vote on wednesday  the republican led senate had passed it   in the early hours of wednesday   we are making america great again   trump said  echoing his campaign slogan at a white house celebration with republican lawmakers   ultimately what does it mean  it means jobs  jobs  jobs  jobs   trump  who emphasized a tax cut for middle class americans during his  campaign  said at an earlier cabinet meeting that lowering the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent was  probably the biggest factor in this plan   it was uncertain when the bill would be signed  white house economic adviser gary cohn said the timing depended on whether automatic spending cuts triggered by the legislation could be waived  the administration expects the waiver to be included in a spending resolution congress will pass later this week  a white house official told reporters  cohn told fox news channel on wednesday night that trump could sign the bill as soon as friday if the resolution was passed by then   if not  most likely we ll sign it in the first week of the new year   cohn said  in addition to cutting the u s  corporate income tax rate  the debt financed legislation gives other business owners a new  percent deduction on business income and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations along the lines that the country s largest businesses have recommended for years  wall street s main indexes were little changed on wednesday  taking a breather after a month long rally ahead of the long anticipated tax vote  the s p  has climbed about   percent since mid november  led by a rally in sectors such as transport  banks and others that are expected to benefit the most from lower taxes  under the bill  millions of americans would stop itemizing deductions  putting tax breaks that incentivize home ownership and charitable donations out of their reach  but also making tax returns somewhat simpler and shorter  the bill keeps the existing number of tax brackets but adjusts many of the rates and income levels for each one  the top tax rate for high earners is reduced  the estate tax on inheritances is changed so far fewer people will pay  once signed  taxpayers likely would see the first changes to their paycheck tax withholdings in february  most households will not see the full effect of the tax plan on their income until they file their  taxes in early   in two provisions added to secure needed republican votes  the legislation also allows oil drilling in alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge and removes a tax penalty under the obamacare health law for americans who do not obtain health insurance   we have essentially repealed obamacare and we ll come up with something that will be much better   trump said  democrats were united in opposition to the tax legislation  calling it a giveaway to the wealthy that will widen the income gap between rich and poor  while adding    trillion over the next decade to the   trillion national debt  trump promised during the campaign that he would eliminate the national debt   today the republicans take their victory lap for successfully pillaging the american middle class to benefit the powerful and the privileged   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said  opinion polls show the tax bill is unpopular with the public and democrats promised to make republicans pay for their vote during next year s congressional elections  when all  house seats and  of the  senate seats will be up for grabs   republicans will rue the day they passed this bill   senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters   we are going to continue hammering away about why this bill is so unpopular   u s  house speaker paul ryan defended the bill  saying support would grow for after it passes and americans felt relief   i think minds are going to change   ryan said on abc s  good morning america  television program  a few republicans  a party once defined by fiscal hawkishness  have protested the deficit spending encompassed in the bill  but most voted for it anyway  saying it would help businesses and individuals while boosting an already expanding economy they see as not growing fast enough  in the house   republicans voted against the tax bill  all but one  walter jones of north carolina  were from the high tax states of new york  new jersey and california  which will be hit by the bill s cap on deductions for state and local taxes  despite trump administration promises that the tax overhaul would focus on the middle class and not cut taxes for the rich  the nonpartisan tax policy center  a think tank in washington  estimated middle income households would see an average tax cut of   next year under the bill  while the wealthiest  percent of americans would see an average cut of     the house was forced to vote again after the senate parliamentarian ruled three minor provisions violated arcane senate rules  to proceed  the senate deleted the three provisions and then approved the bill  since the house and senate must approve the same legislation before trump can sign it into law  the senate s vote sent the bill back to the house
