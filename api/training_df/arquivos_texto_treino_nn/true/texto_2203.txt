bedminster  n j   reuters    for president donald trump  this was the week when the real world began to intrude upon his presidency   the violent clashes in charlottesville  virginia  between white nationalists and counter protesters confronted trump with perhaps the first true domestic crisis of his young administration  and to some  even within his own republican party  he came up short   it followed days of blustery threats toward north korea that rattled some americans and unnerved allies  both are the kinds of white knuckle challenges that define presidents   and which trump largely has avoided during the first months of his tenure   as images of rising tensions and a deadly car rampage in charlottesville filled tv screens nationwide  the president was criticized first for waiting too long to address the violence and then  when he did so  failing to explicitly condemn the white supremacist marchers who ignited the melee   marco rubio  a republican senator who was trump s rival for the presidential nomination  quickly suggested trump s initial response was inadequate  on twitter  rubio wrote that it was   very important for the nation to hear  describe events in charlottesville for what they are  a terror attack by  whitesupremacists   while trump has had to deal with the pressures of the federal probe into russian meddling in last year s election  disarray in his white house  and conflicts with congress over his stalled agenda  there are have been few external crises that have tested his presidential mettle   by contrast  his predecessor  barack obama  inherited a severe economic downturn during his first year in office  and would go on to face  among other tests  a catastrophic oil spill in the gulf of mexico  middle east upheaval  terror attacks in boston  orlando  and elsewhere  and civil unrest in ferguson  missouri and baltimore  maryland   trump has spent this week at his tony golf club in new jersey  attempting to show the american public that he is indeed working and not vacationing  he held one event after the other  while answering media questions with an approachability he hasn t shown for months  yet  when news of the situation in charlottesville first started filtering out on friday  trump was silent  he first addressed the matter   through a tweet   on saturday afternoon  after a planned white supremacist rally had been dispersed  fights had broken out  and a state of emergency declared   by the time trump finally appeared before reporters at a staged bill signing event at his club  footage of a car speeding up and slamming into a crowd of protesters had swamped social media and cable networks  raising the specter of domestic terrorism  at least one woman in the car s path died and several people suffered critical injuries  at a podium  trump read a statement rebuking the violence  but without specifically mentioning or faulting the role of white nationalists     we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred  bigotry and violence on many sides   on many sides   trump said   he also took the occasion to boast about declining unemployment and new corporate investment in the united states  afterwards  he ignored shouted questions from reporters as to whether he would denounce white supremacism and whether the car incident constituted terrorism   beyond rubio  trump s response apparently also was not enough for senator cory gardner  who chairs the republican party s senate election effort   mr  president  we must call evil by its name   he tweeted   these were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism   republican orrin hatch  who has served as a senator for  years  referenced his brother  who was killed in world war ii   we should call evil by its name  my brother didn t give his life fighting hitler for nazi ideas to go unchallenged here at home   he said on twitter   democratic senator brian schatz said that trump had not demonstrated moral leadership   there are not many sides to this   he wrote   trump tweeted several more times after the press event  offering support to the city of charlottesville and the police but still declining to critique the violence in more explicit terms  both as a candidate and as president  trump has met with charges that he has courted the support of white supremacists and nationalists  the so called  alt right   as a key part of his passionate voter base  he was forced at one point last year to publicly denounce the ku klux klan and one of its leaders  david duke  after trump was elected  he installed steve bannon  a trusted figure in nationalist circles and former chairman of the hard right outlet breitbart news  as a top adviser in the white house
