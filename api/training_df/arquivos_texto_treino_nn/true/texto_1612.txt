washington  reuters    republican leaders sought to nail down the final votes needed to pass what u s  vice president mike pence on thursday called their  last best chance  to repeal obamacare while a new analysis underscored how democratic leaning states stand to lose large amounts of federal funding under the legislation  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to bring the bill introduced by fellow republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy to a vote next week  as his party seeks to make good on seven years of promises to erase democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement  with no democratic support for the bill  republicans remain a handful of votes short in the senate  needing  votes in a  seat chamber they control    with pence casting a potential tie breaking vote  senator rand paul opposes it and at least six others are undecided  john mccain  susan collins  lisa murkowski  dan sullivan  rob portman and jerry moran  asked whether the legislation will pass  pence said   we ll see  we re close   republicans  still reeling from their failure in july to win senate passage of previous legislation to repeal and replace obamacare  have set a sept   deadline for passage of this bill   this may well be our last best chance to stop and turn around and head america back in the direction of the kind of healthcare reform that s based on individual choice  state based innovations   pence told fox new channel  president donald trump has been pushing congress to repeal and replace obamacare  which would fulfill one of his top campaign promises from last year  the current bill would take money that the federal government now spends on healthcare through the medicaid insurance program for the poor and subsidies to help americans buy private insurance and distribute it to the states in block grants  the non partisan congressional budget office has not yet assessed the bill s effects but independent analyses indicate it would fundamentally redistribute federal healthcare money  generally with republican leaning states benefiting and democratic leaning states losing  the nonprofit kaiser family foundation  a healthcare research group  estimated on thursday that states that expanded medicaid under obamacare would lose   billion under the bill from  to   while non expansion states would gain   billion in the same time period  the graham cassidy bill in  would end the obamacare medicaid expansion  which many democratic governed states had carried out while many republican governed states did not  and limit overall federal spending on the five decade old program regardless of how many americans qualify for its benefits  republicans have called obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  a federal overreach  and say block grants would give states discretion on how to provide healthcare coverage  according to the kaiser family foundation analysis  five states would stand to lose more than  percent of their federal healthcare money from    new york  down  percent   oregon  down  percent   connecticut  down  percent   vermont  down  percent  and minnesota  down  percent   all are democratic leaning  the analysis found that six republican leaning states would get at least  percent more in federal funds  mississippi  up  percent   texas  up  percent   kansas  up  percent   georgia  up  percent   south dakota  up  percent  and tennessee  up  percent   in total dollars  the state with the largest forecast loss of funds is california  losing   billion  the biggest gainer would be texas  with a   billion increase  california  the most populous u s  state  is democratic leaning  texas is the second most populous state and the largest republican leaning one   it s absolutely true to say the graham cassidy bill over time levels out on a per person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare  which i think resonates with most americans   pence said  mccain  collins and murkowski were the three republicans who voted against the last republican healthcare legislation brought up in the senate  which failed   in july  paul  who voted in favor of that bill after previously expressing misgivings  on thursday went to twitter to underscore his criticism that the graham cassidy bill does not go far enough to erase obamacare  the insurance industry  hospitals  medical advocacy groups such as the american medical association  american heart association and american cancer society  the aarp advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists have come out against the bill  urging a bipartisan fix to the current law that was abandoned this week  more medical and civil rights advocacy groups lined up against the graham cassidy bill on thursday  including the american psychological association  the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists and the naacp   the center on budget and policy priorities  a liberal think tank  estimated that the bill would cause more than  million people to lose insurance  the graham cassidy proposal would let states opt out of the requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates  causing a furor among advocacy groups that say it could make health insurance unaffordable for those with pre existing conditions
