washington  reuters    senate republicans announced plans to vote next week on their latest bid to scuttle obamacare even as a popular comedian who has become part of the u s  healthcare debate denounced the bill and former president barack obama on wednesday warned of  real human suffering   president donald trump  who has expressed frustration at the senate s failure thus far to pass legislation dismantling obama s signature legislative achievement  said   or   republicans back the bill  which needs  votes for passage in the  seat senate  which his republican party controls      we think this has a very good chance   trump  who made replacing obamacare a top  campaign promise  told reporters during an appearance with egypt s president in new york  kentucky senator rand paul opposes the bill  at least five other republicans are undecided on it  susan collins of maine  lisa murkowski and dan sullivan of alaska  john mccain of arizona and jerry moran of kansas  republican senator john thune on fox news said   we re a handful of votes short of having the  that we need   as they worked to gather enough votes to win  after prior legislation failed in july  congressional republicans and the white house were on the defensive after jimmy kimmel used his late night tv show to blast the proposal and call republican senator bill cassidy  one of its two sponsors  a liar   this guy  bill cassidy  just lied right to my face   kimmel said on his show on tuesday night  referring to the senator who since may had touted a  jimmy kimmel test  of standards any obamacare replacement would need to possess  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who was noncommittal on tuesday about scheduling a vote  now intends to bring it to the senate floor next week  said his spokesman david popp  republicans are using the measure cassidy is sponsoring with fellow senator lindsey graham to make one last push this year to pass legislation to roll back the  obamacare law  a goal of theirs for seven years  facing a sept   deadline  avalere health  a healthcare consultancy to hospitals and insurers  forecast that the bill would slash federal funding to states by   billion through   with  states facing cuts  hit hard would be democratic governed california and new york  which expanded the medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled under obamacare  while republican governed texas  which did not expand medicaid  would be a winner  avalere said  it remained unclear if the bill  opposed by democrats and top medical groups and hospitals  can attract the  votes needed for passage  with vice president mike pence ready to cast a tie breaking vote  in a speech in new york  obama defended the affordable care act  known informally as obamacare  which expanded medical insurance to  million americans   so when i see people trying to undo that hard won progress for the  or  time  with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage or roll back protections for older americans or people with pre existing conditions     it is aggravating   the democratic former president said   and it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents   cassidy defended his bill  which would divvy up healthcare money as block grants to states  let them opt out of some obamacare consumer protections and waive requirements that insurers cover certain benefits  it also would end obamacare s medicaid expansion  kimmel entered the healthcare debate after revealing on his show in may that his newborn son had undergone life saving emergency surgery for a congenital heart condition  and pleaded that no family be denied medical care because they cannot afford it  cassidy appeared that month on  jimmy kimmel live    he said he would only support a healthcare bill that made sure a child like mine would get the health coverage he needs no matter how much money his parents make   kimmel said on tuesday   stop using my name  ok  because i don t want my name on it  there s a new  jimmy kimmel test  for you  it s called the lie detector test  you re welcome to stop by the studio and take it any time   he said to cheers from his audience  cassidy  a gastroenterologist who represents louisiana  gave a measured response to kimmel s remarks  telling reporters on capitol hill   it was a personal attack and i can t help that    graham blasted the comedian   i bet he looked at some liberal talking point  bought it hook  line and sinker  and went after bill cassidy without talking to him  and i think that s unfair   graham said on fox news channel s  fox   friends  show   cassidy said his proposal would protect people who are already ill  although it does let states waive an obamacare mandate that insurers cannot charge people who have pre existing medical conditions more than those who are healthy   there is a specific provision that says that if a state applies for a waiver  it must ensure that those with pre existing conditions have affordable and adequate coverage   cassidy told cnn  trump  in a tweet late on wednesday  said he would not sign the bill if it did not include coverage of pre existing conditions   it does  a great bill   trump said
