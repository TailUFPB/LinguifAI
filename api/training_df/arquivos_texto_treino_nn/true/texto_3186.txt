washington  reuters    republican senators trying to repeal obamacare are forming  consensus to keep some of the u s  healthcare law s taxes they long criticized  in hopes of delaying more drastic funding cuts  particularly to the medicaid program for the poor and disabled   first proposed by moderate republicans  the idea is gaining traction among party members  according to five sources involved in or briefed on internal discussions  while no final decisions have been made  a sense of urgency has increased as republicans draft a replacement bill to former president barack obama s healthcare law before congress goes on recess on june   but keeping some of the taxes in the senate bill risks alienating conservatives  on tuesday   conservative groups and activists sent a letter to republican senator orrin hatch of utah  the chairman of the senate committee on finance  urging the senate to repeal all obamacare taxes  one cornerstone tax that could remain is the net investment income tax  which imposes a   percent surtax on capital gains  dividends and interest  the sources said  the taxes most likely to be abolished directly impact consumers and the health industry  including a tax on health insurance premiums  the so called cadillac tax on high cost employer provided insurance and the medical device tax  another proposal being floated is to keep all the taxes from the affordable care act  often called obamacare  but to scale them back  a group of  republican senators led by majority leader mitch mcconnell has not completed a full draft of the bill  but is sending pieces to the nonpartisan congressional budget office to assess the impact of various provisions  the cbo s assessment will help determine which taxes the senate needs in order to pay for its replacement bill  it is not clear whether mcconnell  or more conservative party members such as senator ted cruz of texas and senator mike lee of utah  are receptive to keeping some of the taxes   i think most of the taxes are going to go away   senator john thune of south dakota  the senate s no   ranking republican  said on tuesday   our members are still having a conversation about if we want to make changes that are in the end going to require some additional revenue   spokesmen for mcconnell and cruz declined to comment  a spokesman for lee said he wants republicans to abolish every tax that was included in a  obamacare repeal bill that obama vetoed   since obamacare became law in   republicans have campaigned on repealing the program that extended insurance coverage to  million additional americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of medicaid  they have argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in americans  healthcare  president donald trump promised to eliminate the law on his first day in office  but republicans  who control the white house  the house of representatives and the senate  have struggled to coalesce around a single plan  under senate rules  their bill must replicate the   billion in savings projected by preliminary legislation that passed in the u s  house of representatives last month  that bill would end obamacare s expansion of medicaid in   slash its federal funding by more than   billion over  years and eliminate most of the law s taxes  moderate republican senators from states that expanded medicaid  including rob portman of ohio  shelley moore capito of west virginia and dean heller of nevada  have proposed phasing out the expansion over a seven year period  from  to   to give state governors more time to cut program costs  that timeframe also prevents senators  who serve six year terms  from having to run for re election when medicaid cuts have been implemented  two former republican senate aides said   some of obamacare s taxes could also be repealed later when congress tackles new legislation overhauling the u s  tax code  two current senate aides said    there s no question that the current debate is not centered on eliminating all the taxes in obamacare right now   senator tim scott of south carolina said last week  under a process called reconciliation  the bill needs at least  votes to pass  with vice president mike pence casting the tie breaking vote if needed  in an interview with reuters last month  mcconnell said he did not yet know how he would get enough votes for an obamacare repeal   think of me with a rubik s cube  sitting there trying to think about what combination will get you to    mcconnell said
