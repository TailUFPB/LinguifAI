washington  reuters    fbi director james comey said on wednesday it made him  mildly nauseous  to think his announcement of the reopening of an investigation into hillary clinton s emails affected the  presidential election  but he had no regrets and would make the same decision again  in four hours of testimony before the senate judiciary committee  comey delivered his most impassioned defense yet of a decision that many democrats believe cost them the white house  telling congress  days before the nov   election that the fbi had uncovered a new trove of clinton related emails  comey said he felt he had to speak out at that time because he had repeatedly told lawmakers the clinton email probe was over   to not speak about it would require an act of concealment in my view   comey said   concealing  in my view  would be catastrophic   he told the panel one reason for the fbi s renewed interest in clinton s case was that investigators had found emails  some of them classified  forwarded by clinton s assistant huma abedin to her husband  who was not authorized to see such information   it makes me mildly nauseous to think that we might have had some impact on the election  but honestly  it wouldn t change the decision   comey said  the fbi  which is supposed to remain politically neutral  said a few days later that the new emails did not change its  decision not to recommend criminal charges against clinton  but many democrats believe the political damage was done  clinton said on tuesday her election bid was derailed in part by comey s announcement about the renewed probe of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  she said her effort also was damaged by the wikileaks release of her campaign chairman john podesta s emails  allegedly stolen by russian hackers          senator dianne feinstein  ranking member on the committee  led the democrats in hammering comey with questions about why he went public with the clinton probe but kept silent on an  investigation related to the republican candidate  donald trump   it s still very unclear   and i hope director that you will clear this up   why the fbi s treatment of these two investigations was so dramatically different   she asked   u s  intelligence agencies in december accused russia of hacking of democratic emails in an effort to tilt the election to trump  comey confirmed in march the fbi was investigating possible collusion between trump surrogates and russia  comey said on wednesday the probe into whether russian hacking activities and american citizens was a classified investigation in its early stages   far different from the almost completed email probe    comey declined to comment on whether trump  or anyone else  had been ruled out as a possible subject  moscow has denied the hacking allegations  the fbi director acknowledged recent months have been difficult   but i think i ve done the right thing at each turn  i m not on anybody s side  it s so hard for people to see that   comey said  adding later   i don t have any regrets
