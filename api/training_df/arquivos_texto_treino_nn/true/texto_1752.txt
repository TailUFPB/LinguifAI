washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump and republicans in congress would have a hard time slashing the corporate tax rate to below  percent  even if they eliminated nearly every business tax preference  according to a study released on wednesday  the analysis by the tax policy center  a nonpartisan think tank  found republicans might have to expand the federal budget deficit to cut the corporate rate to trump s proposed  percent or to the  percent level sought by leading tax policymakers from congress and the administration  the corporate income tax rate is now  percent  although many companies pay far less than that thanks to abundant loopholes   there s a lower boundary on this and it s much higher than what the president and congressional republicans say   said howard gleckman  a senior fellow at the center   the most likely outcome is that they re not going to reduce corporate taxes as much as they d like to   he said  republicans have vowed to slash business tax rates  saying it would boost economic growth and help create jobs  eliminating tax breaks are a main focus of closed door negotiations on capitol hill and in the white house  but no policymakers have gone as far as the tax policy center did in its study  measuring the impact of throwing out hundreds of tax breaks  including subsidies for research  alternative energy  fossil fuels and domestic manufacturing   in a revenue neutral bill  congress can t get the rate below  percent even if it eliminates nearly every corporate tax expenditure   gleckman said in a blog posting accompanying the study   white house officials and conservatives in congress  including senator ted cruz  have called for deficit funded tax cuts as a way to spur economic growth  but analysts warn that expanding the deficit would undermine economic growth by raising the federal debt burden and forcing interest rates higher  gleckman said policymakers could pay for tax cuts by finding new sources of revenue to compensate for lower rates  rather than expanding the deficit  but republicans have already rejected revenue raising options  including a border adjustment import tax and a carbon tax  the study was funded by the nonprofit peter g  peterson foundation
