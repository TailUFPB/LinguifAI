washington  reuters    michael flynn and other advisers to donald trump s campaign were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least  calls and emails during the last seven months of the  presidential race  current and former u s  officials familiar with the exchanges told reuters  the previously undisclosed interactions form part of the record now being reviewed by fbi and congressional investigators probing russian interference in the u s  presidential election and contacts between trump s campaign and russia  six of the previously undisclosed contacts described to reuters were phone calls between sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  and trump advisers  including flynn  trump s first national security adviser  three current and former officials said  conversations between flynn and kislyak accelerated after the nov   vote as the two discussed establishing a back channel for communication between trump and russian president vladimir putin that could bypass the u s  national security bureaucracy  which both sides considered hostile to improved relations  four current u s  officials said  in january  the trump white house initially denied any contacts with russian officials during the  campaign  the white house and advisers to the campaign have since confirmed four meetings between kislyak and trump advisers during that time  the people who described the contacts to reuters said they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and russia in the communications reviewed so far  but the disclosure could increase the pressure on trump and his aides to provide the fbi and congress with a full account of interactions with russian officials and others with links to the kremlin during and immediately after the  election  the white house did not respond to requests for comment  flynn s lawyer declined to comment  in moscow  a russian foreign ministry official declined to comment on the contacts and referred reuters to the trump administration  separately  a spokesman for the russian embassy in washington said   we do not comment on our daily contacts with the local interlocutors   the  calls and electronic messages took place between april and november  as hackers engaged in what u s  intelligence concluded in january was part of a kremlin campaign to discredit the vote and influence the outcome of the election in favor of trump over his democratic challenger  former secretary of state hillary clinton  those discussions focused on mending u s  russian economic relations strained by sanctions imposed on moscow  cooperating in fighting islamic state in syria and containing a more assertive china  the sources said  members of the senate and house intelligence committees have gone to the cia and the national security agency to review transcripts and other documents related to contacts between trump campaign advisers and associates and russian officials and others with links to putin  people with knowledge of those investigations told reuters  the u s  justice department said on wednesday it had appointed former fbi director robert mueller as special counsel to investigate alleged russian meddling in the u s  presidential campaign and possible collusion between trump s campaign and russia  mueller will now take charge of the fbi investigation that began last july  trump and his aides have repeatedly denied any collusion with russia  in addition to the six phone calls involving kislyak  the communications described to reuters involved another  calls  emails or text messages between russian officials or people considered to be close to putin and trump campaign advisers  one of those contacts was by viktor medvedchuk  a ukrainian oligarch and politician  according to one person with detailed knowledge of the exchange and two others familiar with the issue  it was not clear with whom medvedchuk was in contact within the trump campaign but the themes included u s  russia cooperation  the sources said  putin is godfather to medvedchuk s daughter  medvedchuk denied having any contact with anyone in the trump campaign   i am not acquainted with any of donald trump s close associates  therefore no such conversation could have taken place   he said in an email to reuters  in the conversations during the campaign  russian officials emphasized a pragmatic  business style approach and stressed to trump associates that they could make deals by focusing on common economic and other interests and leaving contentious issues aside  the sources said  veterans of previous election campaigns said some contact with foreign officials during a campaign was not unusual  but the number of interactions between trump aides and russian officials and others with links to putin was exceptional   it s rare to have that many phone calls to foreign officials  especially to a country we consider an adversary or a hostile power   richard armitage  a republican and former deputy secretary of state  told reuters  beyond medvedchuk and kislyak  the identities of the other putin linked participants in the contacts remain classified and the names of trump advisers other than flynn have been  masked  in intelligence reports on the contacts because of legal protections on their privacy as american citizens  however  officials can request that they be revealed for intelligence purposes  u s  and allied intelligence and law enforcement agencies routinely monitor communications and movements of russian officials  after vice president mike pence and others had denied in january that trump campaign representatives had any contact with russian officials  the white house later confirmed that kislyak had met twice with then senator jeff sessions  who later became attorney general  kislyak also attended an event in april where trump said he would seek better relations with russia  senior white house adviser jared kushner  trump s son in law  also attended that event in washington  in addition  kislyak met with two other trump campaign advisers in july on the sidelines of the republican convention  trump fired flynn in february after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations with kislyak in late december   after the nov   election and just after the obama administration announced new sanctions on russia  flynn offered to testify to congress in return for immunity from prosecution but his offer was turned down by the house intelligence committee
