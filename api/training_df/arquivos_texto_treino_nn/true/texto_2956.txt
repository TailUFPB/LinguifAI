washington  reuters    the u s  congress is divided over whether to privatize the nation s air traffic control system as both chambers advance bills to expand airline passenger protections  on thursday  the senate commerce  science and transportation committee adopted legislation that includes federal aviation administration reforms  but unlike a house panel  does not spin off air traffic control and leaves it with the faa   the support is not there   said senator bill nelson  the top democrat on the panel  the u s  house transportation and infrastructure committee approved the privatization plan on tuesday  putting air traffic control under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation  president donald trump has said the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs  the proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports  critics say it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines  american airlines group inc  united airlines  southwest airlines co and jetblue airways corp all back the proposal  congress has until sept   to reauthorize the faa  but republican senator john thune  chairman of the committee  said the senate may not take up the proposal until after the august recess  potentially leaving little time to come up with a compromise measure   the senate bill would require new rules prohibiting cancellation  baggage  seat selection and same day change fees that are not  reasonable and proportional   airlines for america  an airline trade group  said it would result in  government mandated price controls  and should be rejected  in   u s  airlines collected    billion in baggage and reservation change fees  both measures would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight  in april  a united passenger was forcibly removed from his seat  prompting public outrage  the airline has since banned the practice  the senate bill also requires new rules that would mandate  airlines promptly refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive services  the house bill would require the faa to set minimum seat sizes on u s  airlines and a minimum distance between rows to  protect the safety and health of airline passengers   the average distance between rows of seats has dropped from  inches in the  to about  inches today  supporters say  and the average width of airline seats has shrunk from  inches to about    inches  one contentious issue is training requirements for pilots  and whether certain simulated training hours can be counted  thune said that two thirds of u s  airports are only served by regional carriers and that there is a  crisis  in trying to attract pilots  while democrats said the revised rules could lead to unqualified pilots  both bills would seek to speed approval of some commercial drone use and testing  while studying privacy implications  the measures also require medium  and large sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in flight mobile phone calls in law  the senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats
