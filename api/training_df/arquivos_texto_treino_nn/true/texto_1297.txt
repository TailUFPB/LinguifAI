new york  reuters    president donald trump on thursday prescribed a quick fix to undo obamacare through executive order after republicans in the u s  congress failed to repeal and replace the healthcare law as promised  but industry experts said there are many steps involved that will slow it down  trump s plan rests on one main pillar  the creation of associations in which multiple employers can band together to buy health plans under the same law that large employers do  that law rests outside of many of the mandates of the  affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  here are some questions and answers about these plans  potentially  small business employees and maybe even more people would be able to buy such plans  the executive order envisions that associations will form to offer these new health plans for small businesses that want to join together  it is not clear from the order whether freelance workers or other individuals interested in buying health insurance outside of obamacare would be able to access these association plans through other routes  that may be decided in the federal rule making process  which takes months  there currently are some associations that have united to buy health insurance  but the order imagines the creation of many new associations around the country  by allowing small businesses to join forces to create a larger pool of employees when buying insurance  these associations can decrease the risk of having a higher proportion of members with costly illnesses that can drive up coverage costs for small employers  it is not clear who would create these groups  but there are some employer trade groups  like the national restaurant association  that have advocated this year to allow restaurants to band together to buy healthcare   groups first need to create an association  register it with the u s  labor department  design the benefit plans  sign up medical providers or hire a third party company that establishes networks of doctors  and then advertise and sell those plans to employees  insurance experts said  signing up providers such as doctors and hospitals could be challenging  especially across state lines  said dave dillon  a fellow and actuary at the society of actuaries  doctors and hospitals charge higher prices when they are uncertain about how many patients they might have  even when they are dealing with known entities like the large health insurers   in addition  americans next month are due to start buying their plans for next year during open enrollment  whether that is through an employer or on their own  that means  would be off the table for the executive order s provisions   to get ready for   you would have to be fairly up and running by the spring or early summer  and you would have to have things in place for the employers who would want to sell coverage for a   date   dillon said  referring to jan      by the time april rolls around  health insurers like aetna inc and unitedhealth group inc and benefit design brokers like aon plc and mercer  part of marsh   mclennan cos   are shopping around plans for  with the goal to sign contracts by the summer  that gives them time to create the advertisements and documents that go to employees in time for sign up  the  plans would go on sale in november   legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general who have fought some of trump s initiatives could further delay associations from forming  or employers from deciding to move employees from current small group plans or to offer a plan to employees currently being served by the individual market
