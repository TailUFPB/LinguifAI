new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump is using money donated to his re election campaign and the republican national committee to pay for his lawyers in the probe of alleged russian interference in the u s  election  two people familiar with the matter told reuters  following reuters exclusive report on tuesday  cnn reported that the republican national committee paid in august more than    to cover some of trump s legal fees related to the  probe   rnc spokesperson cassie smedile confirmed to reuters that trump s lead lawyer  john dowd  received    from the rnc and that the rnc also paid    to the constitutional litigation and advocacy group  the law firm where jay sekulow  another of trump s lawyers  is a partner  the rnc is scheduled to disclose its august spending on wednesday  the trump campaign is due for a disclosure on oct    the u s  federal election commission allows the use of private campaign funds to pay legal bills arising from being a candidate or elected official   while previous presidential campaigns have used these funds to pay for routine legal matters such as ballot access disputes and compliance requirements  trump would be the first u s  president in the modern campaign finance era to use such funds to cover the costs of responding to a criminal probe  said election law experts  smedile said the rnc payments to trump s lawyers were  from a pre existing legal proceedings account and do not reduce by a dime the resources we can put towards our political work    it was not clear how trump s legal costs related to the russia probe would be allocated between the campaign and the rnc  one of the sources said   dowd declined to say how the president s legal bills were being paid  adding   that s none of your business    special counsel robert mueller is looking at possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia in last year s election  and whether trump may have obstructed justice by firing federal bureau of investigation director james comey  among other actions   moscow has denied meddling in the u s  election  and trump has denied any collusion or obstruction  reuters could not determine how large a legal bill trump has incurred to date from his lawyers on the mueller investigation  trump hired his longtime new york lawyer marc kasowitz to head his defense team in may  but kasowitz stepped down in july  with dowd taking over the lead role  according to people familiar with the situation  special white house counsel ty cobb  who is a salaried staff member  is also working on the matter   the trump campaign has paid law firm jones day almost   million  according to campaign filings  mostly for routine campaign legal expenses like ballot access disputes  vendor contracts  human resources and compliance with state and federal laws  it has also responded to russia related inquiries on behalf of the campaign by  for example  providing documents to congress  the reason trump is able to tap into his campaign funds for legal expenses is because for the past decade  presidential candidates have abandoned public financing for their campaigns  instead  they have built networks that collect millions of dollars from private donors  a move that comes with less restrictions on how the money is spent  barack obama in  was the first to eschew public financing for his campaign  and all the major party candidates followed suit in  and   campaign filings show  trump also filed for reelection the day he took office in january  two years earlier than any previous president  ensuring a fund of millions in campaign cash would remain at his disposal  according to its most recent filing to the federal election commission  donald j  trump for president inc had almost   million on hand by the end of june  an increase of over   million since january  adav noti  a senior director at the campaign legal center  a watchdog group that describes itself as nonpartisan  said public campaign funds   as opposed to the private funds trump has raised   cannot generally be used for expenses arising from criminal investigations  or for any expenses that arise after the campaign is over  president bill clinton  who ran two publicly funded campaigns  had supporters start legal defense funds and used his own insurance to help pay legal bills during the whitewater investigation  he still wound up with millions of dollars in personal debt which he paid off through speaking fees he earned once he left office  hillary clinton  who ran a privately funded campaign  paid millions to campaign lawyers at perkins coie to handle routine legal matters  according to campaign filings  her campaign made no payments to the washington law firm williams   connolly  which represented her in the probes of her use of a private email server when she was u s  secretary of state   her lawyer  david kendall of williams   connolly  declined to comment on how he was paid  campaigns also have discretion to pay legal fees for others besides the president   according to a july filing  the trump campaign paid    to the law firm of alan futerfas  who is representing donald trump jr  futerfas did not respond for requests for comment   a number of other current and former trump staffers have also recently hired lawyers
