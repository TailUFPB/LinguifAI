new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump and fellow republicans in the house of representatives have proposed a healthcare law to kick off their promise to repeal and replace obamacare  following are some questions and answers about healthcare spending and health insurance coverage in the united states as republicans try to throw out president barack obama s signature piece of domestic policy  the  affordable care act  who is covered by what insurance      the majority of america s  million people are covered by either government or private insurance  less than half of u s  spending on healthcare is publicly financed  a contrast to the  percent average among member countries of the organisation for economic co operation and development  a core goal of obamacare was to cut into the numbers of uninsured and some  million people gained coverage under the law     million people are covered by employer based health plans    million people are in the publicly funded medicaid program for the poor  including  million children    million older or disabled people receive medicare     million people are covered by military healthcare    million people buy individual insurance on the online shopping exchanges created by obamacare    million people purchase unsubsidized health insurance directly    million people are covered by the indian health service  student health plans and other sources   about  million americans remain uninsured the figures are government estimates  they do not add up to a total of  million because some people have more than one type of coverage       how much does the country spend      spending on healthcare in the united states is about    trillion a year  representing about  percent of u s  gross domestic product  current u s  government estimates are for that spending to outpace economic growth and rise to  percent of gdp by   healthcare spending has been rising faster than inflation  the government estimated it to have risen   percent in  and that it will increase at an average rate of   percent through       what does america get for its money      while u s  healthcare spending as a percentage of gdp ranks higher than for any other oecd country  americans  life expectancy is near the bottom in a ranking of other oecd countries  behind countries such as france  germany and britain  the country s obesity rate is the highest       what was the impact of obamacare      as the affordable care act was implemented over the past six years  it made sweeping changes to the health insurance system and implemented new taxes  so gutting the law will affect most americans at some point      the law set a series of minimum standards  it introduced free preventive care coverage  mandated most employers to offer insurance and individuals to buy it  expanded the medicaid program to include people with higher incomes and created income based subsidies for individuals to draw them into buying insurance  it prevented insurers from denying coverage to people based on their health status and allowed young adults to stay on their parents  health insurance policies      what sectors are feeling the impact now      republicans will tackle repealing obamacare in multiple steps because while they control both chambers in congress  they do not have the  seats in the  seat senate needed to simply undo the law  the first step focuses on insurance sold to individuals and the medicaid expansion  which could mean diminished payments to hospitals and doctors who benefited from the  million people covered by the aca  they now face uncertain revenues and the possibility of increased bad debt as they lose paying patients  the impact on insurers is twofold  uncertainty over who will buy insurance could lead to them mispricing insurance plans and suffering financially as soon as this year  in the longer term  the retrenchment is changing the outlook for the growth rate of publicly backed healthcare      which publicly traded companies does this affect      there are only a handful of publicly traded hospital companies  and the biggest one  hca holdings inc  is not focused on states where medicaid expanded  so it tends not to be involved  tenet healthcare corp and community health systems inc are smaller hospital chains with high debt loads and their shares do tend to be affected by news about potential cuts to the numbers of americans with publicly funded healthcare      the insurers that specialize in medicaid and government healthcare such as wellcare health plans  molina healthcare inc and centene corp are small but tend to move on news that the medicaid expansion may be repealed and on proposed changes in how the federal government pays its share of all medicaid costs to the states  anthem inc is one of the biggest insurers selling plans on the individual exchanges and may see shares affected by news of rules that could affect who enrolls in insurance  sources   congressional
