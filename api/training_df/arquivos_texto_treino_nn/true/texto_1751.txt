washington  reuters    whether or not richard cordray stays as head of the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  until his term ends in july  the agency s ability to rein in wall street will be severely weakened  political insiders  lawyers and consumer advocates said  doubts are growing that the democratic director of america s top consumer watchdog will leave his post to run for ohio governor  as had been widely speculated  after a lackluster labor day speech sparked anxiety over his campaign appeal  according to some party insiders  cordray  whose term at the cfpb ends in july   is not expected to announce any decision to run until the regulator releases long awaited rules restricting payday lenders  which are expected within weeks  according to multiple sources  cordray has evaded questions from the republican chairman on the house of representatives financial services committee  jeb hensarling  about his plans  writing in a recent letter   at this time  i have no further insights to provide on that subject   even if cordray stays  he will not enjoy a reprieve from republican efforts to defang the agency which they believe is too powerful and restricts the flow of credit   he has been under constant attack in his position because of the threat he poses to the status quo on wall street   said karl frisch  executive director of allied progress  a consumer advocacy group which has called for cordray to stay on   i would imagine that would continue regardless of how long he stays in the job   some republicans  including hensarling  have introduced legislation to weaken and even dismantle the agency which was created as part of the post crisis dodd frank act  while those bills have not gotten far  cordray will still have to play defense against a republican dominated congress poised to suffocate new cfpb rules using the congressional review act  a mechanism already used to kill  obama era regulations  lawmakers are also considering amending the government budget to bring the cfpb s funding  currently provided by the independent federal reserve  under the control of congress  potentially allowing republicans to starve the agency of resources  president donald trump could also take the more extreme step of intervening to remove cordray   a court ruling last year said the president should be able to fire the cfpb director without cause  which the cfpb is appealing  even if the cfpb is victorious  trump may still seek to use causes allowed by the law  such as inefficiency or neglect of duty  to get cordray out of the way  according to legal experts  the cfpb has declined to comment multiple times on cordray s plans  possible successors or how it would operate in his absence  since trump came to power  the cfpb has raced to finish outstanding rule proposals and taken numerous enforcement actions  hoping to lock in its work in case trump appoints a pro wall street replacement  said quyen truong  a partner at law firm stroock   stroock   lavan  who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the cfpb until early   if cordray quits or is removed  dodd frank requires his deputy to step up temporarily but lawyers say the legitimacy of that step could be challenged  the act may be superseded by a law that allows the president to temporarily fill vacancies   alan kaplinsky  head of the consumer financial services group at law firm ballard spahr and a cordray critic  said the white house is widely expected to appoint treasury secretary steve mnuchin as an interim replacement  who would then delegate his duties to lower ranking officials  scrapping a new rule allowing bank and credit card customers to band together in class action lawsuits and tougher regulation of payday lenders will likely be a trump appointee s first moves  kaplinsky said  this could be done by delaying the rule s effective date for further study  a common washington tactic used to stall the implementation of regulation indefinitely  an acting director could also dramatically scale back the consumer complaint database  a key tool the cfpb uses to resolve disputes for individuals and to identify corporate malfeasance  truong said  meanwhile  she said  the agency will continue pursuing enforcement cases  but those will likely be much smaller in scope  jeff emerson  a spokesperson for hensarling  said any new director would naturally be bound by the law  but this person would have  a lot of discretion  to make changes
