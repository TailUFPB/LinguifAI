washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives on thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal obamacare  handing republican president donald trump a victory that could prove short lived as the healthcare legislation heads into a likely tough battle in the senate  the vote to repeal former president barack obama s signature domestic achievement  which enabled  million more americans to get health insurance  was trump s biggest legislative win since he took office in january  putting him on a path to fulfilling one of his key campaign promises as well as a seven year quest by republican lawmakers  it marked a reversal of fortune for the republican president who suffered a stunning defeat in late march when house republican leaders pulled legislation to scrap obamacare after they and the white house could not resolve the clashing interests of republican moderates and the party s most conservative lawmakers  trump has called obamacare a  disaster  and congressional republicans have long targeted the  law  formally known as the affordable care act  calling it government overreach  but despite holding the white house and controlling both houses of congress  republicans have found overturning obamacare politically perilous  partly because of voter fears  loudly expressed at constituents  town hall meetings  that many people would lose their health insurance as a result      with thursday s   vote  republicans obtained just enough support to push the legislation through the house  sending it to the senate for consideration  no democratic house members voted for the bill  democrats say it would make insurance unaffordable for those who need it most and leave millions more uninsured  they accuse republicans of seeking tax cuts for the rich  partly paid for by cutting health benefits  the legislation  called the american health care act  is by no means a sure thing in the senate  where the republicans hold a slender   majority in the  seat chamber and where only a few republican defections could sink it  as republicans crossed over the vote threshold to pass the bill  democrats in the house began singing  na na  na na na na  hey hey hey  goodbye   a rowdy suggestion that republicans will lose seats in the  congressional elections because of their vote  within an hour of the vote  trump celebrated with house lawmakers in the white house rose garden   i went through two years of campaigning and i m telling you  no matter where i went  people were suffering so badly with the ravages of obamacare   trump said   we are going to get this passed through the senate  i am so confident   pre existing conditions the treatment of people with  pre existing  conditions was one of the central issues in the house debate on the bill and is sure to resurface in the senate  obamacare prevented insurers from charging those with pre existing conditions higher rates  a common practice before its implementation  it also required them to cover  essential health benefits such as maternity care and prescription drugs  the republican bill passed on thursday would allow states to opt out of those provisions  while insurers could not deny people insurance because of pre existing conditions  they would be allowed to charge them as much as they want  in an analysis released on thursday  healthcare consultancy and research firm avalere health said the republican bill would cover only  percent of enrollees with pre existing conditions in the individual insurance markets  republicans have argued that their bill would give people more choice and reduce the role of government  in a push to pass the bill before members leave on friday for a week in their home districts  the house voted before the bill was assessed by the non partisan congressional budget office  which estimates its cost and effect on insurance rolls  republicans have said the bill will be scored by the cbo and other fixes will be made before the senate votes  health insurers  such as anthem inc  unitedhealth group inc  aetna inc and cigna corp  have faced months of uncertainty over healthcare s future  so have hospital companies  such as hca holdings inc and tenet healthcare corp  obamacare expanded medicaid  the government insurance program for the poor  provided income based tax credits to help the poor buy insurance on individual insurance markets set up by the law  and required everyone to buy insurance or pay a penalty  the republican bill would repeal most obamacare taxes  which paid for the law  roll back the medicaid expansion and slash the program s funding  repeal the penalty for not purchasing insurance and replace the law s tax credits with flat age based credits  in a sign of the challenges ahead for the legislation  nearly every major medical group  including the american medical association and the american hospital association  and the aarp advocacy group for older americans  strongly opposed the republican bill  many said last minute amendments further eroded protection for the most vulnerable groups  including the sick and elderly   i ve already made clear that i don t support the house bill as currently constructed because i continue to have concerns that this bill does not do enough to protect ohio s medicaid expansion population   said republican senator rob portman    while the bill s fate in the senate is uncertain  its house passage could boost trump s hopes of pushing through other big ticket items on his agenda  such as tax reform  the previous failure to overhaul healthcare legislation had raised questions about how much republicans could work together to help trump fulfill his campaign pledges   anything that they  the republicans  get done  that they accomplish  popular or unpopular  will show that they have the ability to make progress and to get things done and work together   said randy frederick  vice president trading and derivatives at charles schwab in austin  texas   this puts the idea of tax reform a little bit closer to reality  simply because it s shown that they have figured out a way to negotiate and work together   he added
