washington  reuters    the trump administration s announcement on sunday that it is issuing new travel restrictions on people entering the united states from eight countries could lead to an upcoming supreme court case on its previous more controversial ban ending in a whimper rather than a bang  the new presidential proclamation set restrictions on citizens from eight countries and is set to go into effect on oct    eight days after the court is due to hear oral arguments over the legality of trump s earlier ban  the trump administration on sunday night asked the high court to considering hearing new briefing on the case before the oral argument to address  the effects of the proclamation on the issues currently pending before the court in these cases   now the nine justice court could skip deciding the case altogether  legal experts said  the march  order under supreme court review banned travelers from six muslim majority countries and limited refugee admissions  challengers say the order discriminated against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution  a decision on that issue would be consequential not just for trump but also future presidents who would be bound by it  but with the challenged policy no longer on the books  the court has various options to resolve the dispute without issuing a ruling  the  day travel ban  which covered iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  ran until sunday  the  day refugee ban expires on oct    even before trump s latest announcement  experienced supreme court lawyers and immigration law experts had expressed doubts about whether the nine justices would want to issue a decisive ruling  in part because of a desire to stay out of such a contentious issue       if the court can avoid entering into the fray  that may be appealing to them   said anil kalhan  an immigration law professor at drexel university school of law  with the travel restrictions expiring  the court has an easy way out because it could simply say that the case is no longer a live issue and therefore  in legal parlance  moot  the supreme court has already intervened three times since march in limiting the scope of lower court rulings that struck down the march order  its most significant act came in june when it allowed both bans to go into effect in a limited fashion  the unsigned decision suggested that the court s four liberals and two of its conservative majority  chief justice john roberts and justice anthony kennedy  were keen on a compromise  three other conservatives  including trump appointee neil gorsuch  said both bans should have been allowed to go into effect in full  the trump administration has yet to say what it would prefer the court to do  but former justice department lawyers say it is likely to request that if the court does dismiss the case  it also throws out the lower court rulings that struck the bans down  the benefit for the administration is that it would wipe out those precedents  including the broad decision by the richmond based  u s  circuit court of appeals that said the order discriminated against muslims  the decision cited trump s campaign statements in concluding that the order was motivated by anti muslim bias  the trump administration says the order was needed for national security reasons   it s certainly in the government s interest to get the adverse     opinions off the books because those decisions constrain executive authority   said washington lawyer pratik shah  who previously worked at the justice department  the march order took effect on june   following a supreme court ruling that narrowed the scope of lower court rulings  litigation continued over the summer on who exactly was covered by the bans  culminating in a supreme court decision on sept   that allowed trump to enforce the refugee ban broadly but kept lower court restrictions that prevent close family members from being denied entry  the march  order was itself trump s second attempt to impose a travel ban after his original  much broader jan   plan was blocked by lower court following turmoil at u s  airports caused by its abrupt rollout       this version of the story has been refiled to change date in dateline
