 clyde  ohio  reuters    in the middle of whirlpool corp s bustling washer factory in northern ohio there is an empty patch of concrete floor   a reminder of a   million expansion plan the appliance maker says fell victim to unfair foreign competition    we cleared that out to hold more plastic molding machines   says daniel o brien  the factory s vice president of operations  whirlpool  whr n  halted the upgrade two years ago blaming south korea s lg electronics inc   ks  and samsung electronics co ltd   ks  for the setback  in a string of trade cases the benton harbor  michigan based manufacturer has argued the koreans have undercut its u s  business by exporting washers at unfairly low prices   since the nov   presidential election  whirlpool has been fighting with renewed vigor  seeking more protection  president donald trump s administration is the first one in decades that openly says it is searching for ways to hit back at foreign producers it finds are hurting domestic manufacturers   but the washer case has a twist   since the election  both korean producers have announced plans for big u s  factories and that confronts the administration with a dilemma  how do you weigh interests of a u s  manufacturer against investment plans of foreign competitors and which jobs are more important   whirlpool s sprawling complex in clyde   stretching nearly a mile from corner to corner   employs   well paid union workers   now  lg is spending   million to build a  worker factory in tennessee  while samsung is investing   million to renovate an old caterpillar inc  factory in south carolina that will employ   both states are dominated by republicans   the investment in tennessee has attracted support from local  state and federal officials  many of whom attended a groundbreaking ceremony in august  lg spokesman john taylor said   we got terrific feedback from commerce secretary  wilbur  ross when he was at the groundbreaking    both lg and samsung said their investments followed years of preparations  though taylor said the timing of the announcement was  opportune  given trump s focus on manufacturing jobs   whirlpool remains the leader in the    billion u s  washer market  but the rivals are closing in  the company s brands  which include maytag and amana  account for just under  percent of domestic sales  down from over  percent in   according to stevenson co s traqline  a market research company  over the same period  samsung s share doubled to just under  percent  while lg s held steady around  percent   the korean producers argue innovation and more choice for the consumers rather than prices have driven their growth and say whirlpool s five straight years of record results weaken its case  both companies deny they have violated u s  trade laws    whirlpool s stock price more than tripled from  to   it is hard to see how such an industry is suffering material injury   lg lead outside counsel daniel porter told the international trade commission  a federal agency that investigates trade issues  in a meeting earlier this year   the commerce department declined to comment for this story because of the pending itc case brought by whirlpool   nevertheless  the korean manufacturers are nervous  at the groundbreaking for the lg plant in august  the company pulled forward the date for completion by six months to the first quarter of    an extremely fast construction window for such a factory   whirlpool  which won two anti dumping cases against the korean firms in the past four years  took its fight one step further and filed a  safeguard petition  in may  seeking broader protection than anti dumping measures provide   a safeguard targets imports from any country and the petitioner does not need to prove that the goods are being sold at unfairly low prices just that the influx of products is disrupting the u s  market and causing  serious injury  to domestic producers   the itc is due to vote on thursday whether washing machine imports cause harm to u s  producers  if it rules in whirlpool s favor  the commission will recommend remedies  such tariffs  import quotas or other measures  to trump in early december   u s  producers have seldom sought such protections  in part because they are often challenged at the world trade organization  the last case was in   when president george w  bush imposed tariffs of up to  percent on certain imported steel products   clark packard  a policy analyst at the r street institute  a libertarian think tank  says the safeguards should be reserved for rare instances of unforeseen surges in imports  but that the  atmosphere is ripe in washington  for these cases   whirlpool says it is seeking broader protection because the korean producers were able to avoid anti dumping tariffs by moving production from country to country  after the itc imposed anti dumping tariffs against south korean washers made in south korea and mexico in   the production moved to china and when the itc slapped tariffs on those washers  lg and samsung began making them in vietnam and thailand    the only plausible explanation for these moves was to dodge the u s  anti dumping orders and avoid duties   said whirlpool chairman jeff fettig  in testimony before the itc in september   as part of the safeguard petition  whirlpool also wants curbs on the import of large washing machine components  arguing otherwise the korean companies could merely set up assembly plants running primarily on foreign parts   while the case has worked its way through the system  the mood in clyde has darkened as investment plans were scaled back   leading the way up to a cluster of idle machines  o brien  the plant vice president  says   this is   million worth of machinery   and it only runs two or three hours a day    the equipment was installed in  before the other investments were put on hold  he notes  elsewhere in the plant  a giant poster  painted by a worker  shows an anthropomorphic whirlpool washing machine  pushing past stumbling washers labeled lg and samsung   a far more upbeat take on the rivalry than the mood on the factory floor    everyone here feels the frustration   says lori frasure  a  year old factory worker   it s a frustration that we re not all playing by the same rules    the only other large domestic manufacturer of washing machines is ge appliances  now owned by china s haier group   hk   earl jones  the company s senior counsel  says ge is not party in the whirlpool case  but it has also cut investments and reassigned workers inside their appliance manufacturing complex in louisville  kentucky    we re on the record of supporting their petition    follow trump s impact on energy  environment  healthcare  immigration and the
