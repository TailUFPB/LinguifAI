washington  reuters    lawmakers on tuesday called for more information after reports that president donald trump asked then fbi director james comey to drop an investigation of former white house national security adviser michael flynn  the white house said a memo written by comey after he met with trump in february was not an accurate portrayal of the conversation  details of the memo were first reported by the new york times and were confirmed by a reuters source   last week  the republican president fired comey  who had been leading an investigation into the trump  presidential campaign s possible collusion with russia to influence the election outcome   flynn resigned in february after disclosures that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with the russian ambassador to the united states before trump took office and misled vice president mike pence about the conversations  media reports of the comey memo prompted members of congress to renew calls for an independent investigation into the trump campaign s possible connections to russia and for comey to testify before congress  here are reactions from capitol hill    gopoversight is going to get the comey memo  if it exists  i need to see it sooner rather than later  i have my subpoena pen ready     republican representative jason chaffetz  chairman of the house oversight and government reform committee  on twitter  he later sent the federal bureau of investigation a letter asking for all memos  notes and recordings between comey and trump by may    what we re seeing     is an obstruction of justice case unfolding in real time  and i m still stunned that more of my republican colleagues are not standing strong and speaking out     democratic senator richard blumenthal to cnn  i have to say yes simply because obstruction of justice is such a serious offense  and i say it with sadness and reluctance     independent senator angus king  asked on cnn if congress was getting close to impeachment proceedings  we re a long ways from a conviction   the fact that we simply have a headline in the new york times      republican representative trey gowdy on fox news  we need to have all the facts and it is appropriate for the house oversight committee to request this memo     ashlee strong  spokeswoman for republican house speaker paul ryan  in a statement  i don t want to read a memo  i want to hear it from him  comey      republican senator lindsey graham in an msnbc interview  this is an explosive allegation and it appears like a textbook case of criminal obstruction of justice  we need to hear testimony immediately from director comey   in public      we also obviously need to get director comey s memos immediately  as well as all associated records  including any audio tapes  and notes  if they exist     democratic representative elijah cummings in a statement  if true  this is yet another disturbing allegation that the president may have engaged in some interference or obstruction of the investigation  i think we know enough now  there s been enough alleged publicly to want to bring the director back to testify  ideally in open session  either before our committee or the judiciary committee     democratic representative adam schiff to reporters  country must have answers  it is clear former fbi director comey should testify before congress      republican representative frank lobiondo on twitter   if these reports are true  the president s brazen attempt to shut down the fbi s investigation of michael flynn is an assault on the rule of law that is fundamental to our democracy  at best  president trump has committed a grave abuse of executive power  at worst  he has obstructed justice     democratic representative nancy pelosi in a statement   i m shocked and surprised by this development and would like to discuss it with chairman grassley and look forward to doing so  the judiciary committee is the appropriate place to hold a hearing and get to the bottom of exactly what was said and by whom     democratic senator dianne feinstein in a statement  the stories of the last week raise serious questions about whether the president respects the independence of the fbi and law enforcement authorities  it is vital that congress obtain these memos and hear public testimony from former director comey      the american people deserve answers about president trump s conduct      democratic senator bob casey in a statement
