new york  reuters    president donald trump s outspoken doubts about climate change and his administration s efforts to roll back regulation to combat it have stirred a sleepy faction in u s  politics  the republican environmental movement   the various groups represent conservatives  catholics and the younger generation of republicans who  unlike trump  not only recognize the science of climate change but want to see their party wrest the initiative from democrats and lead efforts to combat global warming   conservative green groups such as conservamerica and republicen  along with politically neutral religious groups such as catholic climate covenant and bipartisan groups such as the citizens climate lobby  have ramped up efforts to recruit more congressional republicans to work on addressing climate change since trump s election  conservative environmental advocates promote what they call  free enterprise  solutions to climate change  like a carbon tax  that stands in contrast to the approach of liberal environmentalists under former president barack obama  who backed bans on certain kinds of oil drilling and regulations aimed at discouraging petroleum use  but whatever their differences  the conservative groups say they have an important role to play   conservatives now have a chance to earn back the trust of americans on environmental issues   said alex bozmoski  director of strategy for republicen   they can lead in a completely different direction that actually grows the economy while cutting greenhouse gasses   the activists  efforts have not swayed anywhere near a majority yet on capitol hill  only  or so of the  republicans in the u s  house of representatives have spoken out on climate change this year  but they hope to build a big enough bloc in congress  or enough influence at the white house  to temper trump s agenda  lobbying has yielded some early results  a pro environment voting bloc in congress  the climate solutions caucus  for example  has signed on more republicans in the last two months than in it had in the final year of obama s administration   its first year in existence  urged on by a coalition of conservative and religious groups  including the catholic climate covenant  a handful of additional republicans have also signed a congressional resolution pledging to address climate change   the resolution was non binding  but it represented a direct challenge to trump s climate stance  a high profile signal of dissent within his party   it s like alcoholics anonymous   you ve got to first recognize you ve got a problem before you can deal with it   said mark sanford  a republican congressman from south carolina who signed the resolution  melinda pierce  legislative director for the more than  year old sierra club environmental group  said she was happy to see  enlightened republicans  beginning to act on climate change  but pierce added   legislative action is a long time away based on  at least  the republican leadership     pierce also said she was skeptical of free enterprise solutions advocated by conservative environmental groups like republicen  which she said sounded to her like  we have to pay them not to pollute   jose aguto  associate director of the catholic climate covenant  said republicans are the only major political party in the world not convinced by climate change   once they accept the reality and science of climate change  we will have reached a tipping point in the political will for solutions   trump has raised the hackles of many environmentalists since taking office  he has overturned several obama era environmental regulations  and last week he proposed slashing the environmental protection agency budget by  percent  during his presidential campaign trump called climate change a  hoax  and vowed to pull the united states out of the paris accord  a global pact to fight it   tapping into a well of republican concern that the united states  energy habits would be policed by the united nations  but republican bias against climate science is out of step with the majority of americans  a reuters ipsos poll shows a majority of republican supporters agree the united states should play a leading role in combating climate change   it shouldn t surprise anyone that more and more republicans are interested in this issue   said republican representative carlos curbelo of florida   this issue was regrettably politicized some  or so years ago  and we are in the process of taking some of the politics out   on feb    representatives from a newly formed group of republican statesmen  the climate leadership council  including former treasury secretaries henry paulson and james a  baker  met with senior administration officials to push a carbon tax   we got a very respectful hearing   said the council s ceo  ted halstead   we ve also been meeting with republicans on the hill and have found open minds   the white house did not comment on the meetings  billionaire republican donor and environmental advocate andy sabin  meanwhile  said he has been speaking directly with white house officials in hope of becoming trump s unpaid climate change adviser   modeled on the role of fellow billionaire carl icahn in advising trump on regulation   focusing on health concerns would be the most effective way to get trump to try to slow climate change  said sabin  a precious metals magnate  when asked about the chances of sabin getting the position  a white house spokeswoman said   we don t have an announcement at this time   republican senator james inhofe incurred public ridicule two years ago after marching into the capitol building with a snowball  claiming the cold weather disproved obama s climate change claims  this year  republicen used the incident as part of a humorous rallying call on valentine s day  volunteers delivered greeting cards to lawmakers quoting secretary of state rex tillerson  in his former role as chief executive officer of exxon  declaring climate change to be a serious risk warranting  thoughtful action    along with the card were coconut coated cakes called sno balls  a photograph of inhofe and a poem   roses are red  snowballs are white  together we ll get the solution right
