washington new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on saturday that actions by former national security adviser michael flynn during the presidential transition were lawful  and that he had had to fire him because flynn had lied to the fbi and the vice president   the president s comment suggested he may have known flynn lied to the fbi before he urged the fbi director not to investigate his former adviser  legal experts said  but they noted that it was unclear from the tweeted comment exactly what the president knew when  flynn is the first member of trump s administration to plead guilty to a crime uncovered by special counsel robert mueller s wide ranging investigation into russian attempts to influence last year s u s  presidential election and possible collusion by trump aides    i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi  he has pled guilty to those lies   trump said on twitter while he was in new york for a fundraising trip   it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful  there was nothing to hide   flynn  who on friday pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his contacts with russia  is a former defense intelligence agency director who was trump s national security adviser only for  days  he was forced to resign after he was found to have misled vice president mike pence about his discussions with russia s then ambassador to the united states sergei kislyak   what has been shown is no collusion  no collusion   trump told reporters as he departed the white house for the new york trip   there s been absolutely no collusion  so we re very happy   establishing when trump was told flynn lied to the fbi agents could be key to determining if the president acted improperly  according to a person familiar with the matter  during a conversation between white house counsel don mcgahn and then acting attorney general sally yates in january  yates told mcgahn that flynn had told fbi agents the same thing he had told pence  this was the same conversation reported earlier this year in which yates told mcgahn that flynn had misled the vice president about his conversations with the russian ambassador and that he might be compromised  the person said   however  yates did not give mcgahn the impression that the fbi was actively pursuing flynn for lying  the source said  mcgahn did not believe the fbi was investigating flynn for lying because the bureau had not revoked his security clearance  the person said  mcgahn shared the information from yates with the president  the person said  a lawyer for mcgahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment  yates did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment  legal experts said if trump knew flynn lied to the fbi and then pressured then fbi director james comey not to investigate him  that would be problematic  if that were the case trump s tweet  absolutely bolsters an obstruction of justice charge   said jimmy gurule  a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at notre dame university   it is evidence of the crucial question of whether trump acted with a corrupt intent   in may  the president fired comey  who later accused trump of trying to hinder his investigation into the russia allegations  comey also said he believed trump had asked him to drop the fbi s probe into flynn  andrew wright  a professor at savannah law school  said the tweet is open to interpretation and that trump s lawyer would downplay its significance  white house attorney ty cobb referred questions about the president s tweet to trump s personal attorney  john dowd  who described it as a  paraphrase  of a statement cobb had made on friday reacting to flynn s guilty plea   according to a person familiar with the matter  dowd composed the tweet  the tweet is  bizarre and helpful to mueller and hurtful to the president   said renato mariotti  a former federal prosecutor in chicago now at the law firm thompson coburn   it s one more piece of evidence that helps show the president s intent when he fired comey   as part of his plea on friday  flynn agreed to cooperate with the investigation  the retired u s  army lieutenant general admitted in a washington court that he lied to fbi investigators about his discussions last december with kislyak  in what appeared to be moves undermining the policies of outgoing president barack obama  the pair discussed u s  sanctions on russia  and flynn asked kislyak to help delay a united nations vote seen as damaging to israel  according to prosecutors  flynn was also told by a  very senior member  of trump s transition team to contact russia and other foreign governments to try to influence them ahead of the u n  vote  the prosecutors said  sources told reuters the  very senior  transition official was jared kushner  trump s son in law and senior advisor  kushner s lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment  separately  speaking at a defense conference in california on saturday  trump s current national security advisor h r  mcmaster said he saw no evidence that the indictment of flynn  his immediate predecessor  was hurting u s  national security   there s tremendous confidence  i think there s more confidence in the united states frankly  i think there s a sense that we re re engaging in areas where we had largely disengaged   he said
