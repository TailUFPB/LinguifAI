washington  reuters    the trump administration s budget proposal would convert some of the united states  foreign military grants to loans  part of a larger effort to slash spending on diplomacy  aid and programs abroad by more than  percent  the white house said on monday  the cuts to programs under the state department are in part meant to fund an increase in military spending  the white house budget documents showed total defense spending for the  fiscal year at   billion  about  percent higher than president barack obama s proposed  fiscal year defense budget  the   billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the department of energy and other national defense programs as well as the department of defense   the pentagon s specific defense request is for    billion  an increase of   percent compared to fiscal year   under president donald trump s proposal  the united states would spend   percent less on the state department and  other international programs  in the  fiscal year compared to   a decrease of    billion  that decrease includes a re shaping of the way some countries receive military aid from the united states  foreign military financing gives countries loans or grants to buy u s  military equipment  the state department decides which countries are given the financing while the pentagon executes the decisions  under the trump proposal  many current grants would instead be converted to loans   we do change a couple of the foreign military programs from direct grants to loans   said mick mulvaney  the director of the white house office of management and budget  in a briefing with reporters on monday   our argument was instead of     giving somebody   million  we could give them a smaller number worth of loan guarantees and they could actually buy more stuff   military aid to israel and egypt  two close u s  allies in the middle east and the biggest recipients of u s  military assistance  will remain unchanged  mulvaney said  the wall street journal  which first reported the proposal  said the foreign military grants could affect pakistan  tunisia  lebanon  ukraine  colombia  the philippines and vietnam  u s  military assistance to partners and allies reached    billion in   or  percent of all u s  foreign aid spending that year  according to the congressional research service  most grants through the foreign military financing  fmf  program go to israel  egypt  jordan  pakistan and iraq  congress ultimately controls the government purse strings and may reject some or many of the trump administration s proposals  republicans and democrats in congress have criticized the size of the cuts to the state department and u s  agency for international development  mulvaney said that aid to pakistan would be reduced  though he did not give concrete details    the  state  department  still has some flexibility to come up with a final plan on that  but i do know that writ large we have proposed to move several countries from a direct grant program to a loan guarantee program   he said  todd harrison  a defense budget analyst with the center for strategic and budgetary assessments  said the switch from grants to loans for military aid may mean that countries will not be able to afford u s  military equipment  forcing them to go elsewhere for supplies   countries can buy from china or russia  they have other places to shop  and one of the ways that we build capacity with our partners is through these grants   harrison said   it s in our interest to have interoperability with our allies  and these military grants are a part of that   thomas spoehr  who directs the center for national defense at the conservative heritage foundation  said the conversion from grants to loans will be a challenge especially for smaller military aid recipient countries like macedonia and tunisia      but  it s a proposal whose time has come   spoehr said  given u s  budget deficits and high military spending overall       this is probably a prudent place to make some cuts given all the other investments we make in national defense   spoehr said
