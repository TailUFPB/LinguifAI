washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump signed an executive order on friday to extend offshore oil and gas drilling to areas that have been off limits   a move meant to boost domestic production but which could fall flat due to weak industry demand for the acreage  the order could open up swathes of the atlantic  pacific and arctic oceans  as well as the u s  gulf of mexico  that former president barack obama had sought to protect from development after a huge bp  bp l  oil spill in    we re opening it up    today we re unleashing american energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high paying american energy jobs   trump said as he signed the order  trump had campaigned on a promise to do away with obama era environmental protections that he said were hobbling energy development without providing tangible benefits  pleasing industry and enraging environmental advocates  but the executive order  called the america first offshore energy strategy  comes as low oil prices and soaring onshore production have pushed industry demand for offshore leases near their lowest level in years  raising questions over the impact  a reuters review of government data showed the amount of money that oil companies spent in the central gulf of mexico s annual lease sale dropped more than  percent between  and   dollars bid per acre and the percentage of acreage receiving bids both declined more than  percent  the figures were similar in the western gulf of mexico  the only other zone that got offers for leases during that period  according to the figures from the u s  bureau of ocean energy management   the trump administration s hasty move today toward expanding offshore oil drilling     defies market realities and is as reckless as it is unnecessary   said david jenkins  president of conservatives for responsible stewardship  a non profit conservation group   why on earth would someone choose to push drilling in the riskiest and most expensive places on the planet when the current oil glut will make such ventures unprofitable for the foreseeable future   he said      the president of the american petroleum institute trade group welcomed the order in a statement  while an api official said the order could help the industry over the long term  the official did not respond to a request for comment directly about current offshore lease demand   in order to meet u s  energy needs  it is important to keep options open for the long term  so industry can start planning for and determining where the best prospects are and then make those investments the global economy will require over time   the official said  asking not to be named   the order directs the u s  department of interior to review and replace the obama administration s most recent five year oil and gas development plan for the outer continental shelf  which includes federal waters off all u s  coasts  weeks before leaving office  obama had banned new oil and gas drilling in federal waters in the atlantic and arctic oceans  protecting  million acres    million hectares  of waters off alaska and   million acres in the atlantic from new england to the chesapeake bay  in addition to requiring a new five year drilling plan  the order reverses obama s decision to place certain parts of the arctic permanently off limits to drilling  it also requires commerce secretary wilbur ross to review previous presidents  designations of marine national monuments and sanctuaries  jill mcleod  a partner at international law firm dorsey   whitney  said trump s order was a positive signal to the oil industry but was unlikely to trigger a surge in exploration in the near term given the costs   the lifting of the ban does not necessarily make drilling in the arctic a compelling proposition   she said    environmental groups  including oceana and the center for biological diversity  criticized the order and promised to fight it in court  democratic senators also opposed the order  saying it could threaten the fishing and tourism industries  friday s order came on the heels of a separate decree by trump this week triggering a review of federally managed land to determine if they were improperly designated as national monuments by former presidents  the move is intended to expand federal areas available for development
