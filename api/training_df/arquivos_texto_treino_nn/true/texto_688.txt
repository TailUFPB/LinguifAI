washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans unveiled a tax plan on thursday that differed from the house of representatives  version on several key fronts  including how they treat the corporate tax rate  the tax deduction for state and local taxes  and the estate tax  complicating a republican push for the biggest overhaul of u s  tax law since the   senators said that  like the house  they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  but in   not right away  the house was set to vote on its measure next week after its tax writing ways and means committee approved the legislation on thursday along party lines  with democrats united in opposition  the senate s timetable was less clear  with a formal bill yet to be drafted in that chamber  where republicans have a much smaller majority and a narrower path to winning approval for any legislation  let alone one as contentious as a tax package   as president donald trump toured asia  republicans reiterated their goal of enacting final legislation by the end of the year  if that happens  it would be trump s first major legislative accomplishment since he took office in january  stocks  which have rallied this year on hopes for business tax cuts  declined as details of the two plans emerged  investors worried about divergence between the house and senate and the senate s proposed corporate tax rate cut delay  in a broad sense  the house and senate plans matched up in calling for deep tax cuts for high earners and businesses and for a dramatic reshaping of how the united states taxes multinational corporations  big winners if the plans become law  democrats  largely ignored in the closed door drafting of both bills  have condemned them as giveaways to the rich and businesses that will do little for ordinary americans  white house economic adviser gary cohn handed them ammunition in comments in a cnbc interview  saying   the most excited group out there are big ceos  about our tax plan   the white house issued statements that praised the ways and means committee and the tax writing senate finance committee and expressed confidence that further progress would be made  election wake up victories by democrats in state and local elections in virginia  new jersey and elsewhere on tuesday increased the urgency for republicans  who control both the white house and congress  to make good on their campaign promises on taxes    we re going to get this over the finish line   house speaker paul ryan said  adding the house would not just approve whatever the senate passes and that a house senate conference committee would be needed to reconcile differences  one big disagreement between the two chambers concerns a  deduction now available to americans for state and local taxes  salt   a keen concern for taxpayers in high tax  typically democratic leaning states such as california  new york  new jersey  connecticut and massachusetts  the senate plan would entirely repeal the salt deduction  the house bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales tax  but preserve it for property tax up to     democratic senate leader chuck schumer of new york said repealing the salt deduction and other parts of the republican proposals would hurt middle  and upper middle class americans   passing this plan won t help republicans climb out of the hole they are in     this bill could be your political doom   he said on the floor of the senate  where republicans will need to be especially united given their slim   majority  another point of friction is the estate tax on inheritances  the senate would leave it on the books  but increase exemptions so fewer people pay  the house would increase exemptions  but repeal the tax over a six year period  the senate calls for keeping the existing seven tax brackets and cutting the top tax rate for the highest earning taxpayers to   percent from   percent  the house wants to reduce the number of brackets  but leave the   percent top rate alone  the senate would close a loophole that allows private equity fund managers and other wealthy wall street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate on  carried interest  income  instead of the higher wage rate  the house plan leaves the tax break in place  but further restricts who can claim it  in another divide that will need bridging  both chambers call for slapping a mandatory tax on    trillion in foreign profits being held offshore by u s  multinationals  the senate wants that tax to be  percent for cash and liquid assets  and  percent for non liquid assets  the house amended its bill on thursday  going to  percent and  percent  respectively      tweaks to both bills were expected to continue in days ahead as lobbyists descend on capitol hill seeking favors  both the house and senate measures would add    trillion over  years to the budget deficit and national debt  a problem that not long ago would have drawn republican criticism   it turns out that deficit hawks are extinct in the republican party   california s nancy pelosi  the democratic leader in the house  said in a statement  in the senate s case  the    trillion figure is the most by which the legislation is permitted to add to the deficit in order to allow republicans to use a procedural maneuver known as reconciliation and pass the bill with a simple majority  estimates released on thursday evening by congress  nonpartisan joint committee on taxation had the senate proposal falling within that upper limit  although the bill has yet to be codified into legislative language
