washington  reuters    the republican chairman of the u s  house of representatives intelligence committee set off a political firestorm on wednesday when he said the communications of members of donald trump s transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners  representative devin nunes said at a news conference that it was possible president trump s own communications were also intercepted and disseminated among u s  intelligence agencies  the white house seized on nunes  remarks  which had cited anonymous sources  to bolster trump s unproven assertion that former president barack obama s administration spied on the incoming president  nunes himself said there is no proof of that  as have other lawmakers of both parties and the fbi director  a short while later  trump spokesman sean spicer cited nunes  comments at his white house news briefing   i do think it is a startling revelation  and there s a lot of questions that need to get asked   spicer said  democrats denounced nunes  statements as highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee  with the top democrat on the committee saying its members had not been informed and implying that nunes was giving political cover to the president  intelligence reports about the communications appeared to  unmask  the identity of the trump associates and the names were widely shared among the agencies  nunes said  he said it was possible trump s own communications were also collected  the national security agency routinely collects electronic communications on foreigners through a variety of surveillance tools  but information about americans is also sometimes incidentally gathered  such as when someone is communicating to a foreign target   typically the names of americans are made anonymous  or masked  in foreign intelligence reports unless an intelligence agency determines the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation  it was unclear why the reports nunes cited contained unmasked names  a u s  government source said it was logical  if not normal  that communications from trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by u s  agencies after his election  given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments  trump took office on jan    two days ago  the director of the federal bureau of investigation  james comey  told a hearing of nunes  committee that his agency was conducting a criminal investigation of potential links between trump associates and russia s attempts to influence the  u s  election to benefit trump   i recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community     collected information about u s  citizens involved in the trump transition   said nunes  who was himself on trump s transition team  nunes said he was referring to intelligence reports of communications collected under the foreign intelligence surveillance act   i want to be clear  none of this surveillance was related to russia or the investigation of russian activities or of the trump team   he said  trump said he felt  somewhat  vindicated by nunes  announcement after being briefed by nunes  fbi head comey on monday said that trump s claims were groundless  according to nunes  the conversations in question were collected legally in november  december and january  in an interview with cnn  the committee s leading democrat  adam schiff said   the chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the trump campaign and the russians  or he s going to act as a surrogate of the white house  because he cannot do both   nunes  remarks appeared tied to a line of questioning from republicans during monday s hearing about the importance of identifying and prosecuting those responsible for intelligence leaks  republicans have focused much of their discussion of the issue on the release of the names  or  unmasking  of trump associates in the investigation  trump fired his former national security adviser  general mike flynn  after the revelation that he had spoken to russian ambassador sergei kislyak  during the transition   which was leaked to the press after those calls were caught by surveillance intercepts  nunes appeared to suggest intelligence reports about intercepts other than flynn s conversations existed      former intelligence officials and democrats said nunes  announcement was highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee  schiff said he was not consulted by nunes before his news conference  nunes  decision to share the information with the white house before informing the committee was a  profound irregularity   schiff said  adding that  a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way   schiff said the unmasking of a u s  person may be appropriate in the context of an investigation  u s  intelligence agencies have accused russia of seeking to influence the presidential election in trump s favor against democratic candidate hillary clinton by hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation  russia denies the allegations  nunes said he was  very concerned  about whether u s  intelligence agencies were spying on trump  he briefed republican house speaker paul ryan before the news conference and went to the white house to share the information  admiral mike rogers  the director of the national security agency  was asked by republicans at monday s hearing about the agency s policies for  unmasking  the names of americans whose communications were incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs  rogers said that  nsa employees  including himself  have the authority to unmask the identity of an american s communications  and that senior officials at the cia  fbi and justice department can make such a request  asked how many americans had been unmasked since june   rogers said he did not know
