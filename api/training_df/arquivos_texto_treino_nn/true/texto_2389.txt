 reuters    four years ago  frances broaddus crutchfield    gave   to the campaign of virginia s democratic attorney general mark herring   this election cycle  the lifelong democrat who lives on a farm in powhatan county  virginia  upped the ante  donating    so far to herring s re election bid   these are desperate times   she said   like many democratic state attorneys general  herring has made legal challenges to the agenda of president donald trump a priority  he joined with attorneys general in other states to challenge trump s executive order banning travel to the united states from six predominately muslim countries and to defend former president barack obama s clean power plan  which aims to slash carbon emissions   those fights  and the prospect of others  are drawing record amounts of campaign contributions into attorney general races in a number of states  according to campaign finance records and more than a dozen interviews with attorneys general  challengers  political operatives and donors   attorneys general  who as the top elected legal officers in each state are charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own  have always helped shape national politics   but their influence grew during the obama administration  when republican attorneys general regularly sued the administration over immigration and the environment  now  with republicans controlling the white house and congress  democrats are using the same playbook to challenge some of trump s initiatives in the courts   donors from both parties have taken notice and are pouring money into upcoming attorneys general campaigns  in his most recent campaign filings  herring reported raising about    million through the end of june   over three times more than he had at this point during his campaign four years ago    what i am seeing is a lot of energy   herring said   herring s republican challenger this november  john adams  has also done well  a corporate defense lawyer who worked in george w  bush s white house  adams has raised about    million  roughly  percent more at this point than the republican candidate in virginia had in     when i first ran in  i would tell people this is one of the most consequential offices  and people would give me a funny look   said bob ferguson  washington state s attorney general who successfully sued to block trump s first travel ban   i don t get that look anymore    the national fundraising arm for republican attorneys general  raga  announced raising a record    million in the first six months of    percent more than at this point during the last election cycle in   republican ags have filed legal briefs defending trump s travel ban and other policies    the substantive work we are doing helping the trump administration  but also weighing in on a lot of regulatory issues  is motivating people   said west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey  raga s chairman   meanwhile  the democratic ag s counterpart  daga  raised about    million between january and june  daga executive director sean rankin said   percent more than in the first half of    daga hired full time finance staff for the first time this year  rankin said  and launched its first candidate recruiting program   four years ago people weren t moving at this pace   he said   to be sure  some donors are motivated by more than simply whether a candidate supports or opposes trump  c  boyden gray  who served as a white house counsel and then ambassador to the european union under two republican presidents  doubled his donation in the virginia ag s race this year  largely because he thinks adams has the talent to aspire to even higher office   but gray also said he recognizes the growing stature of attorneys general    they ve upped their game over the last decade   gray said   raga decided this year to end a longstanding custom to avoid spending money against democratic incumbents  and daga followed suit  neither committee has yet filed individual donor lists for the first half of   the deadline is monday   republicans currently hold  state ag seats across the country  next year   ag elections are scheduled including the district of columbia   in wisconsin  republican attorney general brad schimel has raised about    through the end of june  even though he is not up for reelection until november   in his  campaign schimel had not raised that much until about three months before his election   a representative for schimel did not return requests for comment   schimel faces josh kaul  an attorney who has raised about    since he launched his run in april  kaul s law firm  perkins coie  served as top election law adviser to hillary clinton s campaign last year   kaul s campaign has already drawn raga s attention  which funded a web site targeting him  raga has also funded online ads against iowa attorney general tom miller  who is expected to run for reelection next year  and set up a website attacking aaron ford  a democratic state senator in nevada eyeing an ag run in    in colorado  four democrats are currently vying for the ag nomination  the fundraising leader  phil weiser  served as a technology advisor in the obama white house and has raised about    through the end of june  almost four times more than the democratic candidate had raised at this point in    the incumbent  republican cynthia coffman  has disclosed about    in contributions to her ag committee  however  coffman is also mulling a run for governor  and it is unclear whether donors are awaiting her decision before they write checks   coffman did not respond to a request for comment   weiser  who has made fighting trump the centerpiece of his messaging  says democratic donors are making a  sophisticated investment  to confront the administration    i m pushing on an open door   weiser said
