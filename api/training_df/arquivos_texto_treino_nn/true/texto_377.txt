washington  reuters    the u s  senate narrowly approved a tax overhaul on saturday  moving republicans and president donald trump a big step closer to their goal of slashing taxes for businesses and the rich while offering everyday americans a mixed bag of changes  in what would be the largest change to u s  tax laws since the   republicans want to add    trillion over  years to the   trillion national debt to finance changes that they say would further boost an already growing economy  trump  speaking to reporters as he left the white house for new york hours after the pre dawn vote  praised the senate for passing  tremendous tax reform  and said  people are going to be very  very happy   once the senate and house of representatives reconcile their respective versions of the legislation  he said  the resulting bill could cut the corporate tax rate from  percent  to   percent   it could be   percent  when it comes out  it could also be   percent    u s  stock markets have rallied for months on hopes that  washington would provide significant tax cuts for corporations   celebrating their senate victory  republican leaders predicted the tax cuts would encourage u s  companies to invest more and boost economic growth    we have an opportunity now to make america more competitive  to keep jobs from being shipped offshore and to provide substantial relief to the middle class   said mitch mcconnell  the republican leader in the senate  the senate approved their bill in a   vote  with democrats complaining that last minute amendments to win over skeptical republicans were poorly drafted and vulnerable to being gamed later   the republicans have managed to take a bad bill and make it worse   said senate democratic leader chuck schumer   under the cover of darkness and with the aid of haste  a flurry of last minute changes will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the biggest corporations   no democrats voted for the bill  but they were unable to  block it because republicans hold a   senate majority  talks will begin  likely next week  between the senate and the house  which already has approved its own version of the legislation  to reconcile their respective bills   trump  who predicted that the negotiations would produce  something beautiful   wants that to happen before the end of the year  this would allow him and his republicans to score their first major legislative achievement of  after having controlled the white house  the senate and the house since he took office in january  republicans failed in their efforts to repeal the obamacare healthcare law over the summer and trump s presidency has been hit by white house in fighting and a federal investigation into possible collusion last year between his election campaign team and russian officials   the tax overhaul is seen by trump and republicans as crucial to their prospects at mid term elections in november   when they will have to defend their majorities in congress   in a legislative battle that moved so fast a final draft of the bill was unavailable to the public until just hours before the vote  democrats slammed the proposed tax cuts as a give away to businesses and the rich financed with billions of dollars in taxpayer debt  the framework for both the senate and house bills was developed in secret over a few months by a half dozen republican congressional leaders and trump advisers  with little input from the party s rank and file and none from democrats  six republican senators  who wanted and got last minute amendments and whose votes had been in doubt  said on friday they would back the bill and did so  senator bob corker  one of few remaining republican fiscal hawks who pledged early on to oppose any bill that expanded the federal deficit  was the lone republican dissenter   i am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that     could deepen the debt burden on future generations   said corker  who is not running for re election  numerous last minute changes were made to the bill on friday and in the early morning hours of saturday  one was to make state and local property tax deductible up to     mirroring the house bill  the senate previously had proposed entirely ending state and local tax deductibility   the tax reform measure that passed the senate is negative overall for state and local government finances  lower federal tax rates for businesses and individuals could result in a modest boost to hiring and consumption  positively affecting state and local revenues   nick samuels  vice president at moody s investors service  said in a statement   however  the change to the state and local tax  salt  deduction would reduce disposable income for many taxpayers  likely outweighing the positive effect of lower federal rates on consumption in many communities and states   in another change  the alternative minimum tax  amt   both for individuals and corporations  would not be repealed in full  instead  the individual amt would be adjusted and the corporate amt would be maintained as is  lobbyists said  another change would put a five year limit on letting businesses immediately write off the full value of new capital investments  that would phase out over four years starting in year six  rather than be permanent as initially proposed  under the bill  the corporate tax rate would be permanently slashed to  percent from  percent  while future foreign profits of u s  based firms would be largely exempt  both changes pursued by corporate lobbyists for years  on the individual side  the top tax rate paid by the highest income earners would be cut slightly  the tax policy center  a nonpartisan think tank  analyzed an earlier but broadly similar version of the bill passed by the senate tax committee on nov   and found it would reduce taxes for all income groups in  and   with the largest average tax cuts going to the highest income americans  two republican senators announced their support for the bill on friday after winning more tax relief for non corporate pass through businesses  these include partnerships and other companies not organized as public corporations  ranging from mom and pop concerns to large financial and real estate groups  the bill now features a  percent tax deduction for such business owners  up from the original   percent  the senate bill would gut a section of obamacare by repealing a fee paid by some americans who do not buy health insurance  a step critics said would undermine the obamacare system and raise insurance premiums for the sick and the old  senator susan collins  a moderate republican  said she obtained commitments from republican leaders that steps would be taken later in separate legislation to minimize the impact of the repeal of the  individual mandate  fee
