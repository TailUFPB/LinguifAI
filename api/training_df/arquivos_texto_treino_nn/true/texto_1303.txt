 reuters    democrats desperate to rebuild after losing the white house last year have scored a string of election victories for statehouse seats  testing a new generation of candidates and activists eager to resist president donald trump s conservative agenda  from new hampshire to oklahoma  democrats have flipped eight republican held seats in special legislative elections  having spent millions of dollars on low turnout contests mostly being fought over local issues  the wins showcase how democrats want to fight back after losing to trump and hitting historic lows in statehouses  but the party faces challenges carrying this momentum into the  midterm elections when thousands of seats are at stake  interviews with nearly two dozen democratic leaders  campaigns and other political experts show   can we recruit enough capable candidates  and can we run enough modern races   asked simon rosenberg  a democratic political strategist  he said the party must test its future leaders in real time   are they ready  the answer is  we don t know   in november  democrats will get an early read   one critical test is in washington state  where first time candidate manka dhingra is running for an up for grabs senate seat in seattle s suburbs  a victory on nov   would give democrats full control of the state      a prosecutor and school parent volunteer  dhingra is a sikh indian american whose political awakening began with businessman trump s surprise election victory over experienced politician hillary clinton  still  dhingra steers clear of mentioning the president in her pitch to swing voters   the trump reaction  the way it works is by invigorating volunteers   dhingra said   there are a lot of people  like myself  who decided we cannot be bystanders   nearly   volunteers have signed up through her campaign website alone  evidence of what the party calls unprecedented interest in legislative contests   an august primary  where dhingra finished  points ahead of her republican competitor  had a relatively robust turnout  including nearly   voters who normally skip primaries  outside of washington state  however  a few democratic wins  will do little to change the political map going into the  midterm elections  republicans control  state governments and two thirds of legislative chambers  democrats hemorrhaged power at the state level during president barack obama s eight years in office with their attention on national elections  now democrats see the states as critical for rebuilding  and an opportunity to advance legislation pushing back against trump s agenda of gutting democratic health care reforms and environmental protections and cracking down on immigration  the party plans to recruit hundreds of thousands of volunteers to contact more than  million voters   double their outreach in statehouse contests in the  presidential cycle    because of the gridlock in washington  people are turning to statehouses for security from donald trump   said jessica post  executive director of the democratic legislative campaign committee  but the party s many inexperienced candidates must beat battle tested incumbents in elections next year with greater voter turnout       if the democrats have every bit of momentum and the wildest day they could think of  they may take us from super majorities to majorities   said david avella  chairman of the republican group gopac   but we will still have majorities   democrats have flipped legislative seats in florida  oklahoma  new hampshire and new york in   republicans picked up an uncontested seat in louisiana  in oklahoma  where trump won  percent of the vote in the  general election  the democrats flipped three seats in districts he carried  candidates doubled down on local issues  such as a budget crisis forcing four day school weeks  they had a chance to  represent themselves as real people that weren t actually attached to nancy pelosi  or hillary clinton  or barack obama   said anna langthorn  oklahoma democratic party chairwoman  some of the special elections success reflects startup progressive groups rallying voters  but they have yet to figure out how to expand their scope for   chris walsh  a cofounder of flippable  which is working to win back state governments  went to florida last month to help democrat annette taddeo beat a republican former legislator who once competed on trump s reality tv show   the apprentice    there is a lot of knowledge out there that is siloed   walsh said  adding the party could help by sharing information such as district voting data with new groups   this year s most revealing contests will come in a statewide election in virginia  where democrats face a long shot bid in november to pick up  seats and take back the house of delegates  in a show of enthusiasm to rebuild  the party is fielding a ticket that is more than  percent larger than two years ago  yet fewer than one in four of the mostly women vying for republican held seats have raised more money than their competitors  virginia public access project data showed  republicans are also ramping up in defense  they anticipate state contests will be central to democratic efforts in   given their longer odds of reclaiming the republican controlled u s  congress       the democrats are trying to probe for the weakest link  and they are looking for that at the state level   said matt walter  president of the republican state leadership committee   it is our job to make sure that doesn t happen
