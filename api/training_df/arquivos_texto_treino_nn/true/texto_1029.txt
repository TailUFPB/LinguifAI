 reuters    republican senator jeff flake s surprise decision to drop out of next year s u s  senate race in arizona could be bad news both for the republican who was challenging him and for the democrat seeking to win the seat for her party  republican kelli ward and democratic u s  representative kyrsten sinema had  in their own ways  each been counting on flake s unpopularity in their quest to win the november  election   it was a bad day for kelli ward and a bad day for kyrsten sinema   said stan barnes  a veteran republican political consultant in arizona  flake s departure has raised the stakes in the contest for one of only two republican held senate seats that democrats appear to have a good chance of flipping in   republicans hold a   edge in the senate  ward  an anti establishment candidate backed by steve bannon  the former strategist for republican president donald trump  had targeted flake from the right  the former state senator was leading flake in opinion polls for next year s republican nominating primary  sinema  a moderate democrat  had counted on facing either a wounded flake  whose feud with trump damaged his standing among republican voters  or ward  whom many political analysts doubt could prevail in a general election  now sinema faces the prospect of a more moderate republican emerging to challenge ward and  potentially  become the party s nominee  sinema s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment  ward  could win a primary  but she can t win a general    jennifer duffy  who analyzes senate races for the cook political report in washington said   please remember that trump only carried the state by  points  you can t have a nominee who s out there   the battle between flake and ward had been seen as the latest illustration of an ideological split between mainstream republicans and the party s anti establishment wing  in alabama last month  a far right bannon backed candidate defeated an incumbent republican in the party s primary for a december u s  senate election  flake announced his retirement on tuesday in dramatic fashion  delivering a speech on the senate floor that harshly criticized trump s behavior and his own party for failing to call it out  his decision not to seek re election immediately prompted speculation that a number of arizona republicans would consider entering the race against ward  in an emailed statement  ward said her campaign was already surging even before flake s withdrawal   other republicans may decide to jump into the race at this late point  but it s not something we re worried about   she said   arizona is ready to have a true conservative represent them in the senate   republican consultants in arizona said it would take weeks for the new contours of the race to take shape  as potential candidates weigh their chances  conduct internal polling and  perhaps  quietly consult with one another  constantin querard  a republican strategist  said he found it unlikely that many candidates would rush to enter the race after having declined the chance to go after the unpopular flake months ago  when it seemed likely that trump could throw his support behind a challenger   there are no obvious names put forth today that are any different from all the names bandied about when they were looking for someone to take on flake in the first place   he said   but there will still be some   and if any is a solid conservative  they will become the odds on favorite   duffy said the strongest republican recruit was likely representative martha mcsally  a retired air force colonel and  strong fund raiser who is seen as a rising star in the party  but duffy declined to predict whether mcsally could beat ward among a very conservative republican primary electorate   i stopped betting  oh  about november  last year   she said  referring to the presidential election that trump won in an upset
