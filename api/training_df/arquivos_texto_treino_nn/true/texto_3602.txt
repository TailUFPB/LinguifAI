washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump asked lawmakers on tuesday to cut    trillion in government spending over the next decade  taking aim at healthcare and food assistance programs for the poor in an austere budget that also boosts the military  republicans who control the u s  congress   and the federal purse strings   will decide whether to make politically sensitive cuts  and the proposal is unlikely to be approved in its current form  although it is not expected to survive on capitol hill  the proposal puts numbers on trump s vision of a government that radically cuts assistance to lower income americans  the biggest savings would come from cuts to the medicaid healthcare program for the poor  which are embedded in a republican healthcare bill passed by the house of representatives  trump wants lawmakers to cut at least   billion from medicaid and more than   billion from food stamps over a decade  he seeks to balance the budget within  years   the committee for a responsible federal budget  a nonpartisan policy organization  said the plan relied on gimmicks  unrealistic cuts and  rosy assumptions  of economic growth that would reach  percent annually by the end of trump s first term   the congressional budget office projects the economy to grow at an annual pace of   percent over that period   the white house said its proposed tax cuts would help fuel higher growth and pay for themselves by generating an additional   trillion in revenue over  years  lawrence summers  a former economic adviser to democratic president barack obama  said the trump administration was double counting that money by saying it would help close budget deficits while also offsetting the revenue lost by cutting tax rates    it appears to be the most egregious accounting error in a presidential budget in the nearly  years i have been tracking them   summers wrote in the washington post  mick mulvaney  trump s budget office director  said his office made other assumptions that were probably too conservative   we stand by the numbers   he said  federal aid to states would shrink by  percent  though the cuts would fall most heavily on states that backed trump s democratic rival hillary clinton in the  election  states that voted for clinton would collectively face a drop of   percent  while those that backed trump would see assistance cut by   percent   graphic  tmsnrt rs   there is some new spending in trump s plan for fiscal year   which starts in october        the pentagon would get a spending hike  and there would be a    billion down payment to begin building a wall along the border with mexico  which was a central promise of trump s presidential campaign      trump s proposal foresees selling half of the u s  emergency oil stockpile  created in  after the arab oil embargo caused fears of price spikes  the announcement surprised oil markets and briefly pulled down u s  crude prices     republicans are under pressure to deliver on promised tax cuts  the cornerstone of the trump administration s economic agenda      but the effort has stalled as the white house grapples with the political fallout from allegations of russian meddling in the  u s  election  mulvaney said the plan is the first one in a long time to pay attention to taxpayers   you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds  but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it   he told reporters  republican leaders in the house said lawmakers would be able to find common ground with the budget plan  senator bernie sanders  who ran a populist campaign during the democratic presidential primary  said the budget showed that trump s campaign promises to stand up for working people was  just cheap and dishonest campaign rhetoric that was meant to get votes   sanders told a news conference  while the plan boosts defense spending by   billion  it falls short of campaign promises for a  historic  hike in military spending amid plans to rebuild the u s  navy  that is only  percent more than former president barack obama had sought in his long term budget plan  the president would reduce nearly a third of funding for diplomacy and foreign aid including global health and food aid  peacekeeping and other forms of non military foreign involvement   if we implemented this budget  you d have to retreat from the world or put a lot of people at risk   said republican senator lindsey graham   this budget is not going to go anywhere   trump upheld his promise   for the most part   that he would not cut medicare and social security  two expensive safety net programs that deficit hawks have long targeted for reforms  those programs may not come out of capitol hill unscathed  however  house majority leader kevin mccarthy  a fellow republican  said lawmakers would have to reform both programs to save them  the white house proposed changes that would require more childless people receiving help from the supplemental nutrition assistance program  better known as food stamps  to work  most government departments would see steep cuts  particularly the state department and the environmental protection agency    treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the budget plan will boost economic growth by fostering capital investment and creating jobs for workers who gave up their job hunts during
