washington  reuters    the u s  securities and exchange commission said on friday it is suspending enforcement of the costliest requirements of its  conflict minerals  rule  after a court remanded it back to the regulator because part of it violates the u s  constitution  acting sec chairman mike piwowar  a republican  said he has asked staff for a recommendation on how to proceed with the rule  which requires companies to disclose if their products contain certain minerals from a war torn part of africa  for now  he added  companies will not be required to conduct a due diligence review or an audit  which are both part of the process used to determine the origin of the minerals   until these issues are resolved  it is difficult to conceive of a circumstance that would counsel in favor of enforcing  the due diligence requirements  he said in a statement  the move sparked backlash from sec democratic commissioner kara stein  who accused piwowar of acting beyond his authority to gut the meat of a rule mandated by congress  adopted by the sec and reviewed by the courts   it is unprecedented for one commissioner  acting alone and without official notice and comment  to engage in de facto rulemaking   she said   it represents a troubling attack not only on the commission process  but also on the restraints of government power   the conflict minerals rule was required by the  dodd frank wall street reform law and is supported by human rights groups that want companies to tell investors if their products contain tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten mined from the democratic republic of congo  in the hope that such disclosures will curb funding to armed groups  business groups have contended that it forces companies to furnish politically charged information that is irrelevant to making investment decisions and that it costs too much for companies to trace the source of minerals through the supply chain  in   a u s  appeals court struck down part of the conflict minerals law after the business roundtable  the u s  chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers sued the sec over it  the court found part of it violated free speech rights of companies by forcing them to publicly state that their products were not conflict free  the rest of the rule was left intact   since then  companies have furnished reports with sec and conducted due diligence  though they were granted a reprieve from the audit requirement and the labeling of the minerals themselves   the litigation formally came to an end on monday  when the lower court remanded the rule back to the sec to address the first amendment concerns  the appeals court did not say whether the dodd frank law itself or the sec s implementation of the rule violated the constitution  a matter that the sec will now need to determine    companies will still need to file required forms with the sec and do origin inquiries  as they have been doing
