 reuters    the white house will host talks between the rival oil and ethanol industries on wednesday in hopes of brokering a deal to help refiners struggling to meet the country s biofuels policy  according to sources familiar with the matter  the meeting comes after the white house last week pressured midwest lawmakers to take part in talks over possible tweaks to the renewable fuels standard  a law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels  mainly corn based ethanol  into the nation s fuel supply each year  a handful of refiners say the law is threatening to put them out of business  but ethanol interests have said the refineries can pass along the costs at the pumps and have vehemently opposed any changes to the regulation  the meeting on wednesday will include staff from the offices of republican senators ted cruz of texas and pat toomey of pennsylvania  both representing the oil refining industry  according to the sources   on the corn side  staff will be present from the offices of republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa  along with deb fischer of nebraska  the sources said  staff from the environmental protection agency and the u s  department of agriculture were also expected to attend  a spokesman for grassley confirmed that  staff level dialogue and meetings  were under way but did not provide details  officials for the other senators and the white house did not comment  one source familiar with the matter said the meeting would likely focus on short term fixes to help oil refiners on the u s  east coast who say they are struggling with the costs of meeting the rfs requirements  refining companies   like philadelphia energy solutions pesc n and monroe energy  both of pennsylvania  along with texas giant valero energy corp  vlo n    that do not have adequate facilities to blend biofuels into their products are required to purchase blending credits called rins from rivals that do  rins prices have surged this year   the source said talks on wednesday could center on solutions like a price cap for rins or waivers to certain refiners that are at risk of going bankrupt without relief  the governors of both texas and pennsylvania have already formally requested such waivers from the administration  the industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels  allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets  or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners  but the trump administration has ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year   last month  the environmental protection agency  the regulator which administers the rfs  slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for   the refining industry has also been seeking a longer term overhaul of the rfs before it expires in   but such a change would require an act of congress and has met with stiff resistance from the corn lobby  the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w  bush as a way to boost u s  agriculture  slash energy imports and cut emissions  and it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to  billion gallons a year
