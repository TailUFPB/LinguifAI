beijing  reuters    the  day trade talks announced after a sino american presidential summit last week will aim to deal with decades of thorny trade issues  leaving some u s  business leaders wary that the short timeline might yield superficial results  business executives are also worried that president donald trump s focus on curtailing north korea s nuclear and missile programs could undercut u s  commercial interests in china  days after trump s meeting with president xi jinping  trump tweeted that beijing would get a better trade deal with washington if it helped resolve the u s  problem with pyongyang  the u s  business community should not be used as a  bargaining chip   said james zimmerman  a beijing based lawyer and the former chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china   trump s  far better trade deal  linkage to north korea is amateurish  illogical horse trading  at best   zimmerman said  the white house has said u s and chinese officials are still at the early stages of  fleshing out  a pledge by trump and xi to develop the  day plan to reduce the u s  trade deficit with china  which last year reached   billion  it was among the limited set of public outcomes from their first meeting in florida  while trump has promised to aggressively address trade imbalances and open the chinese market to more american goods and services  william zarit  the chamber s current chairman  said the talks need to address the  structural impediments  u s  companies face in china   we d rather be talking than having a trade war  but remember we ve been talking for  years and haven t gotten very far   zarit said  the white house has said that issues including opening up china s financial services sector and getting u s  beef exports into china were up for talks   we are pleased to hear the issue has been elevated to the highest levels of both governments and that there is commitment to resolve the u s  beef access issue in an expedited fashion   ceo of the u s  meat export federation philip seng said  others remain skeptical   beef should have been done  years ago  the fact that that has been going on for so long is emblematic of the imbalance in the way we negotiate and deal with each other   said james mcgregor  chairman of apco worldwide in greater china  china has purchased hardly any american beef since it conditionally lifted an import ban last year that was imposed in  due to a case of mad cow disease in washington state  despite initial media reports suggesting xi may have offered access for u s  beef as a concession to stave off rising trade tensions  china s premier li keqiang this week appeared to link progress on the issue to u s  restrictions on imports of some chinese poultry products for food safety reasons   china is willing to import market competitive u s  beef that meets quality and health standards   li told a u s  congressional delegation in beijing on monday  according to the state run beijing news   chinese chicken is also very competitive in the international market  we hope the united states can quickly lift the ban on chinese chicken imports  only in this way can we better embody fair trade   li said  while individual companies are hesitant to criticize china for fear of backlash  critics from u s  business groups accuse beijing of unfairly subsidizing domestic firms and restricting foreign investment into much of the world s second biggest economy  a  percent ownership cap for foreign life insurers  for example  despite china s  world trade organization commitments to lift it  has helped limit their market share to about  percent   beijing has repeatedly promised to open up financial services more widely to foreign firms  but has given few details on implementation  jacob parker  vice president of china operations at the u s  china business council  said concerns persist that china would make commitments but not follow through or take only incremental steps  while the government could remove some industries from a list of sectors restricted for foreign investment  businesses could still face red tape and licensing hurdles or be restricted to regional pilot zones   there are lots of ways china can call something an opening and it is not   parker said  xi proposed further cooperation on infrastructure development in meetings with trump  but chinese state owned companies working on major u s  public works is a politically fraught issue in the united states  where trump campaigned on creating jobs  high tech industries where china hopes to funnel investment  such as semiconductors  virtual reality and autonomous vehicles  are considered sensitive  such partnerships would likely also have to clear national security hurdles  skeptics also wonder if chinese cooperation in redressing the trade imbalance will be limited to areas that serve chinese needs  such as increasing imports of u s  gas  oil and coking coal   xi stopped in alaska on his way home  meeting with governor bill walker  who touted the state s oil  gas  and mineral resources  on the market access side  lowering restrictions on foreign investment in chinese banking  securities  investment management  futures  insurance  credit ratings and accounting sectors  as beijing has already promised  would help china improve the quality financial of instruments and make their markets more stable and professional  said mcgregor   if you look at the things that china is talking about opening  it s all areas where china needs help   mcgregor said
