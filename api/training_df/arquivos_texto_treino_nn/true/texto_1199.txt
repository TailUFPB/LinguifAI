washington  reuters    republican senator rand paul on tuesday threatened to vote  no  on a budget resolution republican leaders aim to bring up for a vote this week unless they decide to stick with spending caps  potentially putting the party s tax cut plans at risk   i have told the white house and  republican  leaders that if they simply stick to their own caps  the rest of the budget is fine and i ll vote yes   paul wrote on twitter   it is a simple  but important  change they could easily make  the ball is in their court   republican leaders can afford to lose only two republican votes on the budget plan  which would pave the way for large scale tax cuts  if democrats remain united in opposition  with senator thad cochran out of town for health reasons  a defection by paul would leave the vote on a razor s edge
