 reuters    for years the national political organizations of both democratic and republican state attorneys general observed an agreement not to target the other party s incumbent office holders in elections   that hands off stance ended this month when republican ags voted to abandon the agreement and spend money to help unseat democrats in other states  according to the republican attorneys general association  the decision has not been previously reported   the move comes as democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of republican president donald trump s policies  state ags in washington and hawaii successfully sued to block trump s executive orders restricting travel from some muslim majority countries  and california s attorney general has pledged to defend the state s environmental standards   republican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that ags should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents  two sources familiar with the closed door process said  additionally  a desire by some to roll back same sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision  said the sources  who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations   the  so called  incumbency rule  observed by the state attorneys  party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of u s  politics  aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest  such as consumer protection   attorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state  charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own  ags took tobacco companies to court in the   and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the  financial crisis  in larger states  an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources   twelve republican state ags on monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting trump s revised travel restrictions   scott will  executive director of the republican attorneys general association  confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule  but declined to discuss specifics of the vote    the stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table   will said in a statement to reuters   the vote was taken over the phone with a tally of    the two sources said  not every republican ag participated   some of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents  so ags shouldn t be any different  the sources said   those opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship  and noted that republican ags had grown their ranks under the current system  showing there was no need to change the rules now  the sources said   in   republicans held  of the  state ag positions  including the district of columbia  but that number is about to hit   if a nomination made by new hampshire s republican governor this month is confirmed   one of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in virginia  where attorney general mark herring  a democrat  is seeking reelection this november  in all   ag elections are scheduled for   republicans currently hold  of those seats  compared to  for democrats  but some of the incumbents may not run for re election   karl racine  attorney general for the district of columbia and current co chair of the democratic attorneys general association  said the republican group s decision likely means democrats will follow suit    what s good for the goose is good for the gander   racine said in an interview   colorado attorney general cynthia coffman  a republican  is up for election next year in a state that has been trending democrat  a well funded push to unseat her  something the democratic ag group wouldn t have participated in under the incumbency agreement  could spell trouble   coffman opposed the incumbency rule change  the sources said  her office did not respond to a request for comment   in laying out the reasons for the rule change  will pointed to the key role republican ags played in opposing some of president barack obama s policies   rolling back same sex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations  said the two people familiar with the discussion  more republican state ags could help further that effort  though the current composition of the u s  supreme court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely   additionally  the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating democratic ags  the two sources said   participants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage  hour energy  the sources said  the money depended on the republican group changing its rules to target incumbent democrats   the company that manufactures  hour energy  innovation ventures  declined to comment  a spokesman for the republican ag group declined to answer questions about the debate  including the role of  hour s pledge   innovation ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink  with varied outcomes   last month a washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly    million in one such case  brought by bob ferguson  the democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block trump s first travel restrictions  the company has said it would appeal the ruling  in at least two other cases  in oregon and indiana  innovation ventures prevailed  oregon has appealed   the precise dollar amount of the company s pledge to republican ags could not be determined  nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target democrats   already  the republican attorneys general association has built a fundraising advantage  in   it raised about    million  including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the judicial crisis network and koch industries  according to tax filings   sean rankin  executive director of the democratic ag group  said it raised about    million in   the group s tax filings show a mix of contributors including companies  plaintiff law firms and labor unions
