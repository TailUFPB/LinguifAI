 reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration on thursday asked the u s  supreme court to revive his executive order that temporarily bans travelers from six muslim majority nations  iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  the travel ban was blocked by lower courts that found it was discriminatory       here are answers to some questions about how the case is likely to proceed       what is the administration formally asking the supreme court to do      the administration filed two emergency applications to lift or  stay  the injunctions placed on trump s travel ban by federal district courts in maryland and hawaii  the maryland order was upheld on may  by the  u s  circuit court of appeals  an appeal of the hawaii order is pending before the  u s  circuit court of appeals  the part of the government s request will probably be acted on quickly by the court  the administration also filed a petition requesting the justices to review the overall legality of the travel ban  even if the justices agree to take on a complete review  it likely would not happen until the fall  since the court will recess for the summer later this month       what are the next steps for the supreme court      the court may ask quickly for responses to the applications to stay the injunctions from individuals and groups that challenged the ban in lower courts  five justices must then agree in order to grant a stay  if that happens  the travel ban is immediately restored  if five votes cannot be reached  the application will be denied  the decision could come within the next two weeks      the court will likely simultaneously decide whether to review the broader merits of the case  given the importance of the case  and its high profile  it is likely the justices will review it       what are the government s main arguments       lower courts have found that the travel ban violates the u s  constitution s first amendment  which bars the government from favoring one religion over another  the courts used statements by trump and his top officials  both before and after the election  as evidence of hostility toward muslims that motivated the ban       as it has argued in lower courts  the trump administration maintains that the president has  broad discretion  to suspend or ban the entry of foreigners into the united states       trump s executive order is based on national security and terrorism related concerns  and its text is neutral toward religion  the government said  supreme court precedent therefore requires lower courts to defer to the government  it added        but the administration will have to contend with a  opinion by justice anthony kennedy  a frequent swing vote on the bench  who wrote that in the immigration context  the government s actions can be scrutinized for evidence of bad faith       the administration said that campaign statements are irrelevant because they were made before trump took the oath of office  and the president s national security judgment is enough to bar second guessing by the courts        the executive order  is not a so called  muslim ban   and campaign comments cannot change that basic fact   the administration said       how might neil gorsuch  trump s appointee to the supreme court  vote in the case      gorsuch did not indicate during his confirmation hearings in march how he would vote if a travel ban case came before him  however  in response to senators  questions about trump s criticism of judges who had blocked his first immigration related executive orders  gorsuch said it was  disheartening  and  demoralizing   he promised that he would not be a rubber stamp for the president
