washington  reuters    the seven year republican quest to scrap obamacare  a major campaign vow by president donald trump  lay in ruins on friday after the senate failed to dismantle the healthcare law  with congressional leaders now planning to move on to other matters  john mccain  the maverick  year old senator and  republican presidential nominee  cast the deciding vote in the dramatic early morning showdown on the senate floor as a bill to repeal key elements of obamacare was defeated     dealing trump a crushing political setback  mccain  who flew from arizona this week after being diagnosed with brain cancer and was heading back for further treatment starting on monday  joined fellow republicans susan collins and lisa murkowski in voting with senate democrats unified against the legislation   it s time to move on   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  whose reputation as a master strategist was diminished  said on the senate floor after the vote at roughly   a m    gmt   while house of representatives speaker paul ryan said fellow republicans should not give up on healthcare  he cited other pressing issues that needed attention  including major tax cut legislation sought by trump   we have so much work still to do   ryan said in a statement  the senate s healthcare failure called into question the republican party s ability to govern even as it controls the white house  senate and house of representatives   trump has not had a major legislative victory after more than six months in office  and his administration is mired in investigations into contacts between his election campaign and russia and high level white house staff infighting  he had promised to get major healthcare legislation  tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending through congress in short order  also on the legislative agenda are spending bills for the fiscal year beginning oct   to avoid a government shutdown and raising the u s  debt limit  speaking in brentwood  new york  on long island  trump expressed dismay at the bill s failure  saying   i said from the beginning  let obamacare implode and then do it  pass legislation   i turned out to be right  let obamacare implode   trump  who earlier on twitter said the three republicans who voted no  let america down   again took aim at lawmakers in his own party   boy  oh boy  they ve been working on that one for seven years   he said in brentwood   can you believe that  the swamp  but we ll get it done                 some lawmakers urged a bipartisan effort to buttress the existing healthcare system  with the partisan divide as wide as ever in washington  it remained to be seen if a bipartisan approach can get off the ground   mccain said the defeated bill did not offer meaningful reform and that its defeat presents  an opportunity to start fresh  on legislation crafted by lawmakers in both parties   i encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to trust each other  stop the political gamesmanship and put the healthcare needs of the american people first   mccain said  top congressional democrats urged a bipartisan effort to fix problems in the obamacare law without repealing it   change it  improve it  but don t just take a knife and try to destroy it and put nothing in its place   top senate democrat chuck schumer said  democratic senator bill nelson said he was working with republican collins on a bipartisan effort on healthcare  while ryan was able to secure house passage of a comprehensive bill to gut obamacare in may  mcconnell earlier in the week was unable to win passage of similarly broad healthcare legislation amid intraparty squabbling and competing demands by hard line conservatives and moderates  on friday morning  he failed to get even a stripped down  so called skinny bill over the finish line  killing the affordable care act  democratic former president barack obama s signature domestic policy achievement dubbed obamacare  has been a passion for republicans since its  enactment over their unified opposition  and was a key campaign promise by trump last year  republicans lawmakers  some of whom have been gleeful about razing obama s presidential legacy  now fear a backlash from their conservative political base that could affect the  congressional elections  for the moment  the affordable care act  which extended health insurance to  million people and drove the percentage of uninsured people to historic lows  remains in place and must be overseen by an administration that is hostile to it  this leaves health insurers unsure of how long the administration will continue to make billions of dollars in obamacare payments that help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income americans  schumer warned against any efforts to sabotage the law  the blue cross blue shield association  which represents insurers across the country  said it would work to ensure a smooth open enrollment period from nov   dec   and stabilize the individual insurance market under obamacare for the long term  shares of health insurers  which had fought against the bill s proposed repeal of the mandate that americans obtain insurance  were up  aetna inc rose   percent  anthem inc gained   percent and humana inc edged up   percent   on wall street  shares of hospitals were mostly higher because of the dwindling prospects for big cuts in the medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled  community health systems inc rose   percent  hca healthcare inc gained   percent and tenet healthcare corp edged up   percent      republicans have long denounced obamacare   which expanded medicaid and created online marketplaces for individuals to obtain coverage   as an intrusion by government on people s healthcare decisions  veteran house republican tom cole said he thought there were  a number  of other republican senators who were uncomfortable with the senate s healthcare legislation but were able to vote  yes  knowing mccain s vote would kill it  republican senator lindsey graham  a close friend of mccain  met on friday with trump to discuss graham s proposal to take tax money raised by obamacare and send it back to the states in the form of healthcare block grants  the senator s office said  the skinny bill  released just three hours before voting began  would have retroactively repealed obamacare s penalty on individuals who do not obtain health insurance  repealed for eight years a penalty on certain businesses that do not provide employees with insurance and repealed a tax on medical devices until
