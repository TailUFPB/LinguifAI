st  louis  reuters    federal reserve officials have started to push back on the idea that the trump administration s tax cut plan would boost the economy  cautioning it could instead trigger high inflation  unsustainable debt and an eventual return to sub par growth   slashing personal or corporate tax rates could boost short term growth as households and businesses spend more  fed policymakers acknowledged  but those benefits could prove short lived due to broad trends like population aging and rising indebtedness  the remarks about u s  president donald trump s proposed tax overhaul come as he is ramping up a search for a new fed chair  promising a decision this month  unless targeted to raise productivity and underlying potential  a tax cut could feed  unsustainable  growth that  could ultimately be undone by asset price bubbles  inflation and possible recession  san francisco fed president john williams told reporters on the sidelines of a community banking conference here on thursday   having policies that don t kind of maintain this sustainable path  stable inflation  will just end up  we know from history  creating potential recessions or high inflation or other problems and that doesn t benefit anybody   he said  white house pressure on the fed to keep interest rates low in the  in order to boost growth contributed to a subsequent period of so called stagflation  or low growth and high inflation  in the   williams noted         williams said he feels the economy as it stands now can on average grow   percent annually  half the  percent growth that trump has promised  without those sorts of problems   while tax code changes and other reforms could raise potential  williams said early analysis of such proposals show they  mostly boost demand and tend to have relatively small  impacts on things like labor supply and productivity growth  fed officials have traditionally hesitated to speak directly about fiscal issues  leaving tax and spending matters to elected officials  government officials similarly refrain from commenting on or trying to influence fed policy    but the fate of the administration s tax proposal  its  effect on the economy and the fed s possible reaction to it are major unknowns for an economy that is doing well in many respects  with low unemployment and sustained growth since the   financial crisis     the trump administration has proposed   trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts at a time when many economists feel the country is not in need of massive stimulus   many of the tax plan details need to be worked out on capitol hill  but the broad idea is to offset most of the government revenue lost through lower tax rates by eliminating some tax deductions and loopholes  relying on faster economic growth to take care of the rest  some of the deductions are already in trouble in congress  while the effect that tax cuts will have on growth is a matter of controversy even among economists reportedly under consideration by trump for fed chair  stanford visiting fellow and former fed governor kevin warsh  columbia university business school dean glenn hubbard and stanford university professor john taylor  in a general endorsement of the thrust of trump s plans  argued in a mid july report that tax cuts could raise productivity and bring enough people back into the workforce to boost economic growth to  percent  but they said that would only happen if the tax cuts were paired with restrictions on entitlement spending  an idea trump opposed as a candidate when he promised to protect social security and medicare    tax reform and spending reductions go hand in hand   wrote the group  warsh in particular is considered a possible contender to replace fed chair janet yellen    without significant spending restraint  even with positive effects on economic growth  the tax rate reductions would likely be limited and temporary  limiting their economic benefits   dallas federal reserve bank president robert kaplan earlier this week warned that tax cuts on their own may trade short term growth for long term damage   my concern is you would create a bump in  gross domestic product  that would be short term  you would then decline back down to trend growth except when you declined back down you would be more leveraged than when you started   he said
