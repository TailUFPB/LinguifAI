washington  reuters    the special counsel investigating russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election on monday accused president donald trump s former campaign manager  paul manafort  of working with a russian colleague to draft an opinion piece about his political work for ukraine  in court filings  a prosecutor working with special counsel robert mueller s team said manafort was working on the article as recently as nov    had it been published  prosecutors say it would have violated a nov   court order not to discuss the case publicly   the russian colleague who was working with manafort allegedly to shape public opinion about his work for a ukrainian political party has ties to russian intelligence agencies  according to the filing   manafort ultimately never published the opinion piece  after prosecutors reached out to his attorneys to alert them  they said in the filing   due to manafort s actions  prosecutors said the judge should reject his request to modify his bail conditions   manafort has proposed an    million bail package in exchange for lifting him from house arrest and electronic monitoring    as part of that deal  he would forfeit four of his real estate properties if he violated his bail conditions   even if the ghost written op ed were entirely accurate  fair and balanced  it would be a violation of this court s november  order if it had been published   wrote prosecutor andrew weissmann   a spokesman for manafort did not have any immediate comment   manafort and his business associate rick gates were both indicted in october in a  count indictment by a federal grand jury  they face charges including conspiracy to launder money  conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents of ukraine s former pro russian government  initially  manafort s lawyers had said in their court filing that the special counsel s office was willing to accept the proposed terms of his release   but prosecutors wrote that they can no longer trust manafort  and cannot accept his proposed terms   because manafort has now taken actions that reflect an intention to violate or circumvent the court s existing orders  at a time one would expect particularly scrupulous adherence  the government submits that the proposed bail package is insufficient   the filing said
