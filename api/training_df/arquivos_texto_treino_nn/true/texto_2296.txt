washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  house of representatives are pushing to hold consumer financial protection bureau director richard cordray in contempt of congress for refusing to respond sufficiently to congressional subpoenas  a report released on friday by republican staff of the house financial services committee argued there was  ample evidence  to hold cordray in contempt because of his alleged failure to fully comply with subpoena requests  republicans on the panel have been fiercely critical of the cfpb s regulatory work  the report marked the most direct threat yet to pursue legal action against cordray  who was appointed by democratic former president barack obama after the agency was created under the   dodd frank financial reform law  the subpoenas sought records tied to the cfpb s successful efforts to ban mandatory arbitration clauses from financial contracts  including communications between cfpb staff and meetings with outside groups  the ban  hailed by consumer advocates  was finalized in july but republicans in congress are working to overturn it  republicans demanded the documents as part of a probe into rulemaking  and whether the rules regarding mandatory arbitration clauses were written in a proper fashion  mandatory arbitration clauses require consumers to resolve any disputes through arbitration instead of joining together in class action lawsuits  republican staff on the house banking panel had suggested in june that cordray could face contempt charges for insufficient responses to congressional queries  but friday s report took the conflict to new heights   a committee spokesman  jeff emerson  did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the panel would actually seek contempt charges  in response to the report  cfpb spokeswoman jen howard said the agency had already produced  thousands of pages  in response to the requests and was endeavoring to do more   we will continue our efforts to understand how we can respond to the committee in a satisfactory manner   she said in a statement to reuters  in the past  cordray has criticized similar panel subpoenas as overly broad and confusing  representative jeb hensarling  who chairs the committee  has been one of cordray s outspoken critics  and demanded in the past that republican president donald trump fire him as director  democrats have rallied behind cordray and the agency since its creation   the republican attacks on director cordray and the consumer bureau are entirely baseless  and there are no grounds at all for them to hold the director in contempt   maxine waters  the top democrat on hensarling s panel  said in a statement to reuters
