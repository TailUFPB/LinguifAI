washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson urged southeast asian foreign ministers on thursday to do more to help cut funding streams for north korea s nuclear and missile programs and to minimize diplomatic relations with pyongyang  in his first ministerial meeting with all  members of the association of southeast asian nations  asean   tillerson also called on nations with competing claims in the south china sea to cease all island building and militarization while talks aimed at creating a maritime code of conduct were under way  patrick murphy  u s  deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia  said tillerson stressed washington s security and economic commitment to the region  amid doubts raised by president donald trump s  america first  platform and withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade pact  tillerson called on asean countries to fully implement u n  sanctions on pyongyang  which is working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of reaching the united states  and to show a united front on the issue  murphy said   we think that more can be done  not just in southeast asia   he told reporters   we are encouraging continued and further steps across all of asean    last week  tillerson called on all countries to suspend or downgrade diplomatic ties with pyongyang  saying that north korea abuses diplomatic privileges to help fund its arms programs  tillerson also warned that washington would sanction foreign firms and people conducting business with north korea if countries did not act themselves  all asean members have diplomatic relations with north korea and five have embassies there  murphy said washington was not encouraging asean states to formally cut ties  but to examine the north korean presence  where it clearly exceeds diplomatic needs   he said some countries were already doing this and also looking at the presence of north korean workers  another significant revenue earner for pyongyang  some officials of asean members  speaking to reporters  acknowledged concerns about north korea  but also cited concerns about trade relations with the united states  philippine acting foreign affairs secretary enrique manalo  whose country currently chairs asean  said of the u s  call to minimize relations with pyongyahng   we haven t really discussed that among the asean countries  so that s probably something we will look at   our immediate concern is to try and ensure the tension on the peninsula doesn t increase      the last thing we would like to see is to have a conflict break out due to some miscalculation   manalo said  singapore s foreign minister  vivian balakrishnan  said sanctions would have to be fully implemented  but north korea s presence in his country is already minimal asked if that could be further reduced  he said   i won t say never  but at this point in time that s not the issue   we will stick with the u n  security council s resolutions   balakrishnan  whose country signed the tpp  stressed the importance of u s  asean business ties   annual trade of   billion supporting half a million u s  jobs and   billion of u s  investment   southeast asia is replete with economic opportunities and it s too big to miss out on   he said  his remark highlighted growing concern in asia that trump has ditched former president barack obama s economic  pivot  to the region by abandoning the tpp  something analysts say has led to more countries being pulled into china s orbit  murphy said tillerson stressed that asean remained a  very important     strategic partner   which is shown by trump s commitment to attend regional summits in the philippines and vietnam in november  manalo called the meeting with tillerson and trump s travel plans  encouraging  signs  washington wants asean countries to crack down on money laundering and smuggling involving north korea and to look at restricting legal business too  it has been working to persuade china  north korea s neighbor and only major ally  to increase pressure on pyongyang  u s  officials are also asking china to urge more china friendly asean members  such as laos and cambodia  to do the same  u s  efforts have included a flurry of calls by trump to the leaders of the philippines  thailand and singapore  diplomats say u s  pressure has caused some irritation in  asean  including malaysia  which has maintained relations with pyongyang in spite of the assassination of north korean leader kim jong un s estranged half brother at kuala lumpur international airport in february          on the issue of the south china sea  asean has adopted a cautious approach recently  with a weekend summit avoiding references to china s building and arming of artificial islands there  this stance coincided with moves by china and asean to draft a framework to negotiate a code of conduct  murphy said tillerson had stressed that this process needed  room and space  through avoiding fortifying existing claims  the united states has conducted freedom of navigation operations to challenge south china sea claims  angering china  but not yet under trump  murphy said such operations would continue  but declined to say when the next might occur
