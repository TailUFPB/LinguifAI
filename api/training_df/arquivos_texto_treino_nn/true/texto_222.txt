  in this dec   story  corrects peters  affiliation in paragraph  to reflect company name change  by jonathan spicer and rob cox new york  reuters    the federal reserve bank of new york will soon narrow its search for candidates to fill what is considered the fed s second most powerful job after having scouted a diverse field  from a local business school dean to a former fed governor  new york fed president william dudley steps down in mid  and people in contact with the directors leading the search for his successor say they have so far considered several economists  academics  investors  bankers and policymakers   they are looking beyond the traditional mold  of an expert in banking  markets or monetary policy  and plan to start trimming a preliminary list of candidates in coming days  said one person in contact with the directors   the new york fed president is at the intersection of u s  monetary policy and financial markets  and is responsible for the policing of wall street and the diplomacy with central bank counterparts around the world   unlike other top roles with a permanent vote on policy  the new york fed boss is nominated by the regional bank s board of directors rather than the white house and does not require congressional approval  dudley s successor could play an even greater role guiding the fed through a historic leadership change in which u s  president donald trump can fill six of the seven seats on the fed board of governors  he has so far named jerome powell and randal quarles   lawyers  not phd economists   to top positions in washington  with powell replacing chair janet yellen who unlike her predecessors will only serve one term  both men support the republican push for wall street deregulation  yet their relatively limited experience with monetary policy compared with their predecessors has raised questions over the fed s tightening plans and how it might tackle any severe economic downturn   by now the new york fed directors have kept open what an ideal candidate profile should look like  according to people familiar with the search  two of those people  who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the process  said search firms have contacted among several others peter blair henry    dean of new york university s stern school of business  and former fed governor kevin warsh   warsh    who was in the running for fed chair before trump picked powell last month  declined to be considered for the new york job  they said  one of these people said henry appeared to be the early front runner   henry and a spokeswoman for warsh at stanford university s hoover institution  where he is a visiting fellow  did not respond to requests for comment   the permanent voting fed governors need a white house nod and senate approval  the other  district presidents vote every two or three years under a century old rotation meant to emphasize new york s unique role as a counterbalance to the washington based board  its president enjoys broad independence and also serves as vice chair of the central bank s rate setting committee   for a graphic of the fed s ideological doves and hawks  see  goo gl    it s a critical position and more important than the fed s vice chair from a market standpoint   greg peters  senior investment officer at pgim fixed income  which oversees   billion in assets  told reuters   still  the fed s board of governors would need to approve the nominee chosen by new york s four member search committee led by liberal leaning directors sara horowitz and glenn hutchins  horowitz  founder of the freelancers union which advocates for independent workers  chairs the new york fed s board  hutchins is co founder of private equity firm silver lake partners and a noted public policy philanthropist   several weeks before dudley s resignation announcement in early november  the two were already hitting the phones and holding meetings to cast a wide net for potential candidates diverse primarily in terms of professional background  but also race and gender  according to those familiar with the effort  the new york fed declined to comment  in a video posted on its website last month  the search committee said they sought a range of attributes from team building and sensitivity to local economic trends  to intellectual leadership and crisis management   the initial search effort suggests the next new york fed chief could have a different background than dudley and his predecessors  who tended to be bankers or market economists with wall street or u s  treasury experience  and who were all white and male    dudley was chief economist at goldman sachs before joining the fed where he became a key architect of its crisis response and later the no   policymaker behind yellen   at the time of his departure  the new york fed will have only begun the tricky task of trimming its currently    trillion portfolio of assets accumulated since the crisis  a task that would favor candidates with market experience   jamaica born henry  who will step down as stern s dean at year end  would instead bring his expertise in global trade and shore up the number of economists in the fed s upper ranks  a review of henry s public papers and comments reveal little about his views on u s  monetary policy or financial supervision  though his expertise in capital flows could bolster the new york fed s role as foreign liaison  if chosen he would become the institution s first black president  those who have spoken to new york fed directors said past and present insiders  as well as outsiders  were considered  among them were  simon potter  the head of the new york fed s markets desk  brian sack  his predecessor in that role now at hedge fund d e  shaw  and lorie logan  potter s deputy   they said the field also included lael brainard  one of four sitting fed governors  former fed governor and harvard professor jeremy stein  and mohamed el erian  the chief economic adviser at pimco parent allianz se  all of those named declined to comment  it was unclear how much formal contact if any they have had with the new york fed about the job  the bank has said the process should take six to nine months
