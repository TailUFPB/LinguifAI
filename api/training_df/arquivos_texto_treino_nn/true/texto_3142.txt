havana  reuters    cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the united states as the news spread that u s  president donald trump was set to revert parts of the historic detente with cuba  trump will on friday announce a plan to tighten rules on americans traveling to communist run cuba and significantly restrict u s  firms from doing business with cuban enterprises controlled by the military  white house officials said   it hurts to be going backwards  to roll back the engagement will only manage to isolate us from the world   said havana resident marta deus  who will try to tune into trump s speech in miami  the heartland of cuban exiles  deus recently set up an accountancy firm and courier service  to cater to a private sector that has flourished since a landmark agreement two and a half years ago between former u s  president barack obama and cuban leader raul castro to normalize relations between the former cold war foes   we need clients  business  we need the economy to move and by isolating cuba  they will only manage to hurt many cuban families and force companies to close   she said  the  deal sparked widespread euphoria in cuba and raised hopes for an improvement in its ailing economy   an increased arrival of u s  tourists thanks to eased restrictions fueled a boom in tourism  especially in havana  creating demand for more bnbs  restaurants  taxis and tour guides in the fledgling private sector  but critics say the opening failed to improve rights on the island  trump will justify his partial reversal of obama s measures to a large extent on those grounds  the white house officials said  and some cuban dissidents back his tougher stance  saying repression has worsened since the detente  cuban authorities have stepped up their detentions of activists  often confiscating their telephones and laptops  but they have also been coming down with a heavy hand on self  employed cubans who appear to be empowering themselves   when the obama administration stopped condemning human rights violations in cuba  the regime here said  look we can do this and nothing happens  so we can continue repressing more forcefully    said jose daniel ferrer  who leads the patriotic union of cuba  the country s largest dissident group  ferrer said his group had  activists currently imprisoned due to their political views  other dissidents agree repression has worsened but say rolling back the detente  which will hurt ordinary cubans  is not the solution   it will probably not have any benefit in terms of human rights   said eliecer avila  the leader of the opposition youth group somos mas  the cuban government has withstood the u s  trade embargo for more than a half century and will not make any political concessions to the united states due to economic pressure  said carlos alzugaray  a retired cuban diplomat    i am concerned it will affect the private sector quite a bit and much more than the cuban government   he said  without doubt it will impact those in the tourism industry that have benefited from a threefold increase in u s  visits in the last two years  although it is unclear just how much   it s going to really hurt me because the majority of my clients are from the united states   said enrique montoto    who rents rooms on u s  online home rental marketplace airbnb  which expanded into cuba in    with things going to pot  i ll have to tighten my belt    this new setback to the cuban economy will come at a time when it is already wrestling with falling oil shipments from crisis stricken ally venezuela and a decline in exports   this is another blow for cubans and it will hurt our pockets obviously   said martha garcia     with the united states  there is no tranquility
