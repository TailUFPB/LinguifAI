washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump told a group of senators on tuesday that he expected lawmakers would be able to reach a deal on healthcare  without offering specifics on how they would do it or what had changed since a healthcare reform bill was pulled last week for insufficient support   i have no doubt that that s going to happen very quickly   trump said at a bipartisan reception held for senators and their spouses at the white house   i think it s going to happen because we ve all been promising   democrat  republican   we ve all been promising that to the american people   he said  a republican plan backed by trump to overhaul the u s  healthcare system was pulled on friday after it failed to garner enough support to pass the republican controlled house of representatives  trump  a republican  did not mention that failure at the reception nor did he offer specifics on how he planned for lawmakers to reach a consensus on a healthcare bill that would repeal and replace the affordable care act  familiarly known as obamacare   trump told lawmakers at the reception that he would be talking about infrastructure and investing in the military  without offering a time frame or details   hopefully  it will start being bipartisan  because everybody really wants the same thing  we want greatness for this country that we love   he said
