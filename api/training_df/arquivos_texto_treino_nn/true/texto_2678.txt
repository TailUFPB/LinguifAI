washington  reuters    a top u s  republican trade lawmaker on wednesday questioned the trump administration s plans to renegotiate a trade deal with u s  ally south korea  as well as the white house s focus on bilateral trade deals   i was a little surprised by the announcement on korea by the president  mainly because that agreement s worked well for us   representative kevin brady told reuters in an interview  the u s  trade representative s office notified south korea last week of its intent to negotiate amendments to the pact  calling for talks to start in august  republican president donald trump said in april he planned to renegotiate or terminate what he called a  horrible  trade deal  since the pact  known as korus  went into effect in   the u s  trade deficit with south korea has more than doubled to nearly   billion last year   brady  who chairs the trade  and tax focused ways and means committee in the house of representatives  said the united states should be  aggressively stepping into the asia pacific market    that s not an easy task if you re going to go at trade country by country     this is a question of  do we want american trade values in the world or do we want china s trade values   brady said  three days after taking office in january  trump officially withdrew the united states from the  nation trans pacific partnership trade deal  keeping an election campaign promise and emphasizing a preference for bilateral trade deals  some critics of that move have said it opened a trade policy vacuum in asia that china would move to fill   clearly  this administration believes it can achieve more in the bilaterals  they deserve an opportunity to prove that s the case   brady said   i think regional agreements  multilateral  work because you can set standards across a broad number of countries
