washington  reuters    despite public promises of cooperation from facebook and other social media companies  congressional investigators are battling over how much data the companies should hand over to them on russian efforts to influence the  u s  presidential election  congressional sources said this week that facebook inc  fb o  has been slow to cooperate  the company and others have said they are turning over information  but also that they are legally obligated to protect their users  privacy  on visits to capitol hill on wednesday and thursday  sheryl sandberg  facebook s chief operating officer  met with leaders of the house intelligence committee and said the company wanted to help investigators and would turn over more information   things happened on our platform that shouldn t have happened  in the lead up to the election  sandberg told the axios website on thursday  so far  however  the congressional sources said investigators have found it hard to extract all the relevant information from silicon valley about alleged russian activity  but the committees have so far seen no need to issue subpoenas for the data  the sources added  facebook and other major internet companies including alphabet inc s google  googl o  and twitter inc  twtr n  have faced a stream of recent revelations about how moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the united states and influence the election in favor of the republican white house candidate  donald trump  facebook disclosed last month that it had found some   politically divisive advertisements believed to have been bought by russia before and after the presidential campaign   the company has now shared with congressional investigators the ads  information on how they were paid for  and how they were targeted  a facebook spokesman said  sandberg told congressional investigators on thursday that in addition to the ads  the company would provide the rest of the information from accounts linked to russia  the spokesman said      the sources said investigators were also pressing twitter  google and other companies for similar data  and urging twitter to conduct a more comprehensive search of its data banks   we have a set of strict ads policies including limits on political ad targeting and prohibitions on targeting based on race and religion   a google spokeswoman said  asked about the issue   we are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems  working with researchers and other companies  and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries    a twitter spokesperson did not respond to an email requesting comment   twitter has likely not released all potentially relevant data to congressional investigators in part because of their policy requiring a court order and their track record of defending user privacy by fighting such requests   adam sharp  former head of news and government at twitter  said in an interview  twitter engineers are trying to regenerate some of the lost data  and may be able to retrieve some of it  said a person familiar with the company s technology  the use of social media platforms was part of what u s  intelligence agencies have concluded was a broader russian effort to meddle in the election campaign  an allegation the kremlin has denied  several congressional committees  as well as special counsel robert mueller  are investigating russian interference  including any potential collusion between trump associates and moscow  trump has denied any such collusion  in september  facebook disclosed that it had evidence that an operation based in russia had spent    on thousands of sponsored posts promoting divisive social and political messages in a two year period through may   facebook said it believed the messages were likely bought by people in russia before and after the  election      sources familiar with facebook s contacts with congress said that as recently as july this year  company officials were denying the existence of any paid russian messaging  and only later acknowledged that the company had found    in sponsored traffic linked to  facebook accounts        the sources said investigators think the paid messaging was generated by a group called the internet research agency in st  petersburg  u s  officials have called it a  troll factory  that creates false identities or copies real ones to spread real  skewed  and fake information for the kremlin  congressional sources said some of the facebook messaging went to groups with seemingly legitimate names such as heart of texas  defend the second  and united muslims of america  which they said all had as many as   followers  these groups now appear to have been bogus  or set up to look like legitimate political organizations  and investigators want to learn more about the groups  their followers  and their origins  the sources said  they said facebook lawyers have argued that turning over additional data could compromise its promise of privacy to its users  however  congressional investigators say that if russian messengers used fake identities  they would have no legal claims to privacy
