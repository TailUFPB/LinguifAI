 washington  reuters    with talks to renegotiate the nafta trade pact just weeks away  u s  farm groups and lawmakers from rural states are intensifying lobbying of president donald trump s administration with one central message  leave farming out of it   trump blames the north american free trade agreement   the  worst trade deal ever  in his words   for millions of lost manufacturing jobs and promises to tilt it in america s favor   but for u s  farmers the  year old pact secures access to stable  lucrative markets in mexico and canada that now account for over a quarter of u s  farm exports    now they fear this access could become a bargaining chip in efforts to get a better deal for u s  manufacturers    perhaps some other sectors of our economy are given better terms and in exchange for that agriculture tariffs would be reintroduced   said joe schuele  a spokesman for the u s  meat export federation in denver  colorado   another concern is that the mere uncertainty of open ended trade talks could drive mexico to alternative suppliers of grains  dairy products  beef and pork   mexico became even more crucial after trump s pullout from a vast pacific rim trade pact negotiated under barack obama dashed farmers  hopes of free access to more markets   next week  u s  trade representative robert lighthizer is due to outline the administration s goals for the nafta talks to congress and the farm lobby has turned up the heat in the past weeks to ensure that its interests will make lighthizer s list   operating under the umbrella of the u s  food and agriculture dialogue for trade  more than  commodity groups and agribusiness giants since trump s inauguration have been bombarding the new administration with phone calls and letters  public comments to ustr and face to face meetings with top officials who have trump s ear    our first ask is to do no harm   said cassandra kuball  the head of the umbrella group   lobbyists said that lighthizer  agriculture secretary sonny perdue and commerce secretary wilbur ross have been receptive  but the wild card is how trump ultimately will come down on the talks  they also wonder what concessions mexico will seek from washington in the talks due to start in mid august   among the groups involved are the american soybean association  corn refiners association and national grain and feed association and firms such as land o lakes  inc   tyson foods tsn n   inc   louis dreyfus company north america  archer daniels midland co  and others   for example  u s  cotton producers  marketers and shippers in mid june warned the trump administration that any weakening of nafta  would threaten the health of the u s  industry and the jobs of the   americans employed by it    annual u s  farm exports to mexico have grown from about   billion in   when nafta began  to an estimated    billion this year  with canada included  that number is forecast to reach   billion  quadrupling under nafta   republican lawmakers from rural states that have backed trump in the  election have sought to leverage their political clout to press farmers  case at a time when they struggle with low crop prices   pat roberts  republican senator from kansas  who chairs the senate agriculture committee  said he used an unexpected invitation for a private white house meeting with trump to plug in agriculture s cause in nafta and beyond    he  trump  wanted to know what was happening in farmland   roberts said   i told him we went through a very rough patch and if we did not have a strong  robust  predictable trade policy  it s going to make life much more difficult in farm country   roberts said of the  minute meeting in late june   in may   republican senators  mainly from pro trump farming states  wrote the administration about the  tremendous growth  in u s  trade with mexico and canada as a result of nafta    efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our north american partners will have devastating economic consequences   they warned   trump s pledges to crack down on immigration and calls for a wall along the border with mexico also vex farm state lawmakers    what i really need is a good  solid immigration system   south dakota republican senator mike rounds said  given his state s low unemployment rate of just around   percent  farmers and ranchers need better access to legal foreign labor  he said   agriculture secretary perdue got a taste of farmers  angst when met cattle ranchers in nebraska on may   the event was held shortly after washington agreed with china to resume beef exports  but some  ranchers who gathered at u s  senator deb fischer s sunny slope ranch quickly turned to nafta    if the president wants to renegotiate that agreement with our neighbors and partners in mexico and canada please leave the ag portion of that discussion out   said pete mcclymont  executive vice president of nebraska cattlemen  summarizing the discussion   while lobbying in washington  some republican lawmakers have also met with mexico s ambassador and u s  farming representatives traveled south to assure their partners unsettled by trump s  america first  mantra    the common comment is   why are you here  the problem is not with us  the problem is in washington  why are you talking to us    said tom sleight  president and ceo of the u s  grains council   the new normal is that feed buyers  millers  grain buyers are actively looking at alternative sources   he said   it will take months to find out how effective the lobbying was  meantime  some are willing to give trump the benefit of the doubt   daryl haack  a corn and soybean farmer from primghar in northwest iowa  like others fears retaliation from either canada or mexico  but is optimistic it will not come to that    i think president trump is a negotiator   he said   i think he runs bluffs  a lot of negotiators will do that
