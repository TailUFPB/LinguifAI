palm beach  fla   reuters    the trump administration will not make public white house visitor logs  the records that detail who has visited president donald trump and his staff on official business  his office confirmed  in a departure from a practice that was established under former president barack obama   white house communications director michael dubke said in a statement on friday that  the grave national security risks and privacy concerns of the hundreds of thousands of visitors annually  was the reason for keeping the records secret  transparency advocates had praised obama s decision to release the logs  although his administration argued the disclosure was not required by law but instead was voluntary  as a result  obama s team frequently redacted names from the list of visitors that were released to the public  including celebrities and donors who were sighted on the white house grounds  the logs offer the most comprehensive look at who has access to the president and his team  examining the logs provides insight into which interests are lobbying the white house and who may have more influence in the administration  trump has continued the obama policy of not allowing administration staffers to become lobbyists after leaving their government job  a rule that carries no enforcement mechanism and that they have already waived for one staffer  the announcement that the logs would remain secret quickly drew criticism from watchdog groups   elected officials work for the people and we deserve to see government business conducted in transparent daylight   faiz shakir  political director of the american civil liberties union  said in a statement   the only reasonable conclusion is to believe the trump administration has many things it is trying to hide  during the obama administration  conservative watchdog groups sued the secret service  which maintains the records  in an attempt to make unredacted copies publicly available  after trump took office  a liberal watchdog group has taken over the fight  filing a lawsuit on monday demanding the records   separately  democrats in congress have filed legislation to force the administration to release visitor logs from mar a largo  the president s palm beach estate where he has spent most weekends since becoming president  the legislation is unlikely to gain any traction because republicans control the legislative body
