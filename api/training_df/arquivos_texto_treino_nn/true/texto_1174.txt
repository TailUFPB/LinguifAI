 reuters    u s  president donald trump has interviewed several top prospects for the post of chair of the federal reserve  a nomination could come within weeks as the term of current chair janet yellen ends in february   yellen will meet with trump about the job on thursday   for a graphic on the next chair of the federal reserve  click tmsnrt rs   he faces a choice between two continuity candidates  yellen and governor jerome powell  and a clutch of outsiders  including gary cohn  currently his top economic advisor  former fed governor kevin warsh  and stanford university economics professor john taylor  here are short profiles of the candidates  gary cohn    director of the national economic council experience  longtime goldman sachs employee and president and chief operating officer of the wall street bank from  to   education  bachelor s degree in business  american university policy positions  cohn s current job as director of the nec has given him little reason to comment on monetary policy  but  he has worried in the past that the fed has been  constrained  by the actions of other central banks trying to keep their currencies weak  in his own words   if we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rates by   percent   the world would be a much better place   pros to candidacy    a practitioner s understanding of financial markets at a time the fed is attempting to unwind its bond portfolio bought after the  financial crisis  the trust of the white house and many congressional republicans given cohn s high profile role in the trump administration cons to candidacy    no formal economics background at a time when the fed leans ever more on econometric models to decipher mixed signals in inflation and employment data  a decades long career at goldman sachs and a personal fortune worth at least   million  which could raise eyebrows when it comes to confirmation by the senate  where members on both sides see the investment bank as a symbol of financial industry excess  criticism of trump in the wake of charlottesville  virginia  protests jerome powell    federal reserve governor experience  lawyer and investment banker  partner in private equity firm carlyle group from    senior treasury official under george h w  bush  fed governor since   appointed by president obama  education  bachelor s degree in politics  princeton university  law degree from georgetown university policy positions  powell has never dissented while at the fed  and in line with yellen supports slowly raising interest rates as long as the economy continues growing and inflation is expected to rise  he advocates easing some aspects of the dodd frank regulations and has discussed ways to revise the volcker rule  in his own words   the committee has been patient in raising rates  and that patience has paid dividends     i would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates   pros to candidacy    an uncontroversial pick for the position  could be the compromise who both replaces yellen and provides continuity  only republican currently on the board of governors  has already helped guide the economy in its recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in congress   familiarity with markets and financial regulation may be considered a plus cons to candidacy    as a current fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the republican party  may not provide enough of a change if trump decides to replace yellen   expertise is less in formal economics and more in markets and financial regulation  which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision  randal quarles john taylor    senior fellow at stanford university s hoover institution experience  undersecretary of treasury for international affairs in the george w  bush administration from  to   member of council of economic advisers under presidents jimmy carter and george h  w  bush education  phd in economics  stanford university policy positions  developer of the eponymous  taylor rule  for setting interest rates  taylor feels the fed should transition to a rules based policy in order to make its decision making  predictable transparent accountable   in his own words   it is very important to have a basic understanding of the monetary policy strategy  the fomc should be required to adopt and explain its monetary strategy  and then compare that strategy with monetary policy rules that are out there in a transparent way   pros to candidacy    a trained economist whose elegantly simple research in the  transformed the debate over how central banks set rates  support among key capitol hill republicans who feel the fed has too much discretion  well known in central banking circles  even if his ideas are not universally supported cons to candidacy   a long term member of the central banking and academic cliques trump may want to disrupt  advocacy of rule based policy may land with a thud in an institution that thrives on consensus and judgment  break with yellen and current policy framework could disrupt markets if taylor insists on broad reform kevin warsh    visiting fellow at stanford university s hoover institution experience  fed governor from  to   economic adviser to president george w  bush from  to   m a lawyer at morgan stanley for seven years education  bachelor s degree in public policy  stanford university  law degree from harvard university policy positions  warsh feels the fed should not try to fine tune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion  he feels the fed should aim for inflation between  and  percent  effectively lowering its inflation target  in his own words   we should not accept the fed s newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real short term interest rate  r   is a fixed feature of future monetary policy     the central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the fed s strategy  tools  governance  and communications   pros to candidacy    former banker and for several years former fed chair ben bernanke s right hand man on financial markets  has a familiarity with wall street   wife jane lauder warsh is a daughter of cosmetics magnate ron lauder  a longtime friend of trump  served on the president s economic advisory council before it disbanded cons to candidacy    may be seen as too hawkish by a president who calls himself a  low interest rate person    not an academic economist like yellen or bernanke but has still maintained u s  monetary policy needs a full makeover   worried about inflation even as the  financial crisis hit  and quit the fed over its second round of bond buying  a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the  quantitative easing  program  even while quitting over fed bond buying  never dissented on fomc decisions janet yellen    federal reserve chair experience  also served as a fed governor  president of the san francisco fed  and the fed s vice chair from  to   education  phd in economics  yale university policy positions  yellen steered the fed towards  gradual  rate increases and a slow reduction of its balance sheet  dependent on evidence of a continued economic recovery  she argues that post crisis financial regulation has made the economy more stable without sacrificing growth  in her own words   my colleagues and i may have misjudged the strength of the labor market     or even the fundamental forces driving inflation     how should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties  in my view  it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments   pros to candidacy    after a career in the fed system and four years as its head  has earned the trust of markets and shown she can shift policy without major disruption   a growing economy  low unemployment  and strong stock markets make the case for continuity  while trump has said publicly he feels she is doing a good job cons to candidacy    could be seen as a democratic holdover by a president who may want to put his own stamp on the fed   feels the core regulations approved after the financial crisis should remain intact  a possible friction with the administration s deregulatory bent   some republican leaders want the fed to have less discretion over monetary policy  an idea yellen resists
