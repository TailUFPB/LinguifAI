new york  reuters    president donald trump s reversals in the past week on maintaining obamacare subsidies to insurers are sowing new confusion over what kind of health insurance will be available to consumers  and at what price  when enrollment for  begins in two weeks  trump said last week his administration would stop paying billions of dollars in subsidies that help insurers give discounts to low income households  one of several moves to dismantle the signature healthcare law of his democratic predecessor  barack obama   since then  trump has alternately supported  and dismissed  an effort by republican and democratic senators that would reinstate the subsidies for two years  until a broader replacement to the  affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  can be negotiated   we are worried that consumers on  obamacare  plans will be confused by all the back and forth and proposed policy changes and that this will cause them to not seek out assistance   said bryna koch  special projects coordinator at the arizona center for rural health  which helps consumers choose and sign up for individual health plans offered under obamacare  trump  who promised during his election campaign to repeal and replace obamacare  which he has called a  disaster   has said the subsidies amount to a bailout for insurance companies   by law  health insurers must still offer the discounts on deductibles  co pays and other out of pocket costs  even if the government stops reimbursing them  insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies  anticipating trump s move  insurers proposed higher prices on monthly premiums in  to recoup the money  in all but a handful of states  they submitted two sets of premium rates   a lower rate to use if the subsidies remained  and a higher rate to use if the funding was cut     the fate of the subsidies remained in limbo on thursday  a senior white house aide said that trump would demand steps toward repealing obamacare in any healthcare legislation  comments that cast doubt on the prospects for the bipartisan effort to shore up insurance markets   a california court is expected to consider on monday a request by democratic attorneys general to keep the subsidies flowing until a legal challenge to trump s decision is resolved   if the funding is not restored when  enrollment opens on nov    many consumers will see premium rates that are on average  percent higher than they would have been otherwise  even before trump s decision on the subsidies  the congressional budget office said the republican president s  policies to roll back obamacare enrollment efforts would lead to  million fewer people signing up for insurance in  than previously forecast  the cbo still expects  million people to sign up for next year   an increase from this year s enrollment of  million  the federal government has already halted a subsidy payment to the insurance industry for october  but leading insurers are not yet sure whether that is the last word  anthem inc chief executive officer joseph swedish told reuters he could not yet predict how ending the subsidies or restating them through  potential congressional action  would affect pricing next year  anthem has submitted premium rates that account for the subsidies being cut     should the subsidies be restored at any time after nov    insurers may be able to revert to the lower monthly premium rates  or provide rebates for consumers   a midyear change in premiums would be highly unusual  but this would be the right thing to do   said marc harrison  ceo of intermountain healthcare  a utah based health plan and hospital chain   intermountain healthcare would pursue this   washington state s insurance regulator said it would allow insurers to change rates as soon as practical   even the next month   if lawmakers reinstate the funding  an approach backed by the national association of insurance commissioners  but that could run up against federal government objections  the affordable care act does not allow for changes to premium rates after they have been finalized  an official for the u s  department of health and human services said  at the same time  the administration is working to approve higher rates in several states that did not take into account trump s cut in subsidies for
