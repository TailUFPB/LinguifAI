 reuters    federal appeals courts in the states of washington and virginia are set to hear arguments this week on the legality of president donald trump s most recent travel ban  which sharply limits visitors and immigrants from eight countries  six of them muslim majority  challengers  including the state of hawaii and immigrant advocacy organizations and the american civil liberties union  aclu   argue the ban is discriminatory and violates the u s  constitution  the trump administration says it is necessary to protect the united states from terrorist attacks  the  u s  circuit court of appeals  which is based in san francisco  will hold a hearing in seattle  washington on dec   and the richmond  virginia based  u s  circuit court of appeals has its hearing on dec    soon after taking office in january  trump signed an order temporarily barring all refugees and visitors from seven predominately muslim countries  the decision led to chaos at airports and numerous legal challenges and the administration eventually replaced it with a second  somewhat narrower order   when the second ban expired in september  trump replaced it with a presidential proclamation indefinitely restricting travel from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad  north korea and barring certain government officials from venezuela       the administration said the restrictions were put in place after a worldwide review of each country s ability to issue reliable passports and share data with the united states   after the most recent order was issued  the same challengers who sued to stop the earlier bans went back to court  they said  the new version still discriminated against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution  the lawsuits did not dispute the restrictions placed on venezuela and north korea  all refugees were temporarily barred as part of trump s first order but were not addressed in the latest ban  instead  under a separate directive issued oct    refugees from  countries mostly in the middle east and africa now face additional security screening    the  circuit appeals court on nov   ruled the ban could go partially into effect for everyone without close family relationships to people in the united states  the white house has asked the u s  supreme court to lift those partial restrictions while the cases are moving forward in lower courts so that the ban would apply to everyone  the government argues the president has broad authority to decide who can come into the united states  but detractors say the expanded ban violates a law forbidding the government from discriminating based on nationality when issuing immigrant visas  the administration has repeatedly said the ban is not discriminatory and pointed out that many muslim majority countries are unaffected by it  trump has made statements  however  that his legal opponents say reinforce their contention that his actions are based in anti muslim sentiments   last week  for example  the president shared on twitter anti muslim videos posted by a far right british party leader  in response to the tweet  neal katyal  attorney for the state of hawaii tweeted   thanks  see you in court next week   the aclu said in a letter sent to the supreme court on monday that the group planned to file a motion that would expand the record to include the recent statements by the president
