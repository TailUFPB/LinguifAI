washington  reuters    russian president vladimir putin tossed president elect donald trump a bouquet in december when he chose not to retaliate for the u s  expulsion of russian diplomats and seizure of russian diplomatic compounds  the honeymoon is over  russia s tit for tat decision to expel hundreds of u s  diplomats and seize two u s  compounds may be an acknowledgment in moscow that trump s ability to bring better ties is limited  at best  and the start of a new downward spiral in relations  russia took the step after the u s  senate on thursday sent a breath taking signal that it does not trust trump on russia by passing a bill that imposes new sanctions on moscow and ties the president s hands if he seeks to ease them  the white house issued a statement on friday night saying trump had negotiated changes to the legislation and now intends to sign it    the russians  have taken trump s measure and while they are willing to exploit his goofy fixation on putin and naive sense you can do deals with someone like putin     they realize his clownish performance as president makes it really hard for him to deliver on any of the big things that russia wants   said andrew weiss  a former national security council russia expert  at the top of russia s wish list is an easing of u s  sanctions imposed for its annexation of crimea from ukraine and its destabilization of eastern ukraine  something the senate action would all but rule out  another  all but inconceivable   item would be formal u s  recognition russia s claim to crimea   trump s performance surely has left nobody in moscow with the impression he is a guy who can deliver   said weiss  now at the carnegie endowment for international peace think tank  trump s desire  often expressed during the  presidential campaign  to improve relations has been hamstrung by findings from u s  intelligence agencies that russia interfered to help the republican against democrat hillary clinton  a federal law enforcement investigation and multiple u s  congressional probes looking into the possibility that trump s campaign colluded with russia  have made it harder for trump to open a new chapter with putin  russia denies it interfered in the election and trump has said there was no collusion  the senate s   passage of the sanctions bill  which followed a   vote in the house of representatives  forces trump to take a hard line on moscow or veto the legislation and infuriate his fellow republicans  the huge margins mean congress could easily override a veto  weiss suggested that trump s low approval ratings at home  his tendency to alienate nato allies such as germany and his inability to pass domestic legislation all contribute to a russian perception that he is weakening the united states    that  is going to pay dividends for moscow  so there is no need to turn him away from the course he is already on which is self destructive and bad for america s standing internationally  all of that is a huge win for the kremlin   weiss said  russia gave the united states until sept   to cut its diplomatic staff in russia to  people  the number of russian diplomats left in the united states after washington expelled  russians in december because of the alleged election hacking  it also said it would seize a moscow compound used by u s  diplomats as well as a u s  diplomatic warehouse  some former officials said russia could take other steps  such as seeking to help russian backed forces seize more ground in eastern ukraine or to try to limit u s  air operations in syria  while others said any reaction might be more muted  russia could look at imposing economic counter sanctions against the united states  the former official said  saying he thought that retaliation in ukraine or syria was less likely because it was more likely to lead to a u s  counter response  michael mcfaul  the u s  ambassador to russia from    said he does not think that russia will escalate tensions with the united states just yet because trump s assertions that he wants better relations with moscow are encouraging putin to continue seeking some kind of accommodation with the u s  president   i don t think they are going to walk away from that just yet   said mcfaul   i believe that putin still believes there might be something he can do with trump
