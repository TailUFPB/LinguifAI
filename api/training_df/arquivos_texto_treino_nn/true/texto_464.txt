washington  reuters    a proposal to amend a tax bill in the u s  senate with a trigger to automatically reverse tax cuts if new revenues fall short of forecasts could further pressure businesses and the economy if the economy slows  critics said on wednesday  the trigger  championed by republican senator bob corker  is meant to allay concerns about the estimated    trillion that the tax bill would add over  years to the   trillion national debt  under the proposal  tax cuts in the bill would be scaled back to recapture lost federal revenues if the strong economic growth and fresh revenues promised by the bill s supporters fail to materialize in coming years  the trouble is that the trigger would most likely kick in during an economic downturn  said critics and even some republicans  who warned that would further weaken businesses and consumers just when a boost is needed   that is exactly the wrong time to raise taxes   said william gale  a senior economics fellow at the brookings institution  a washington think tank  among republicans who criticized the proposal  representative tom cole said   i don t like it very much      you may end up having a tax increase in a down economy    unlike programs such as unemployment insurance that add to household incomes in bad times and support consumer spending to offset a weak economy  the trigger would squelch business and household spending  reinforcing a downturn   these triggers are not innocuous  they are dangerous   gale said  details of how the trigger would work were sketchy  it was not certain it would even make it into the legislation that senators are to begin debating on thursday  but knowledgeable sources said the bill likely will include a trigger that would reverse a deep corporate income tax cut  president donald trump  his advisers and many of trump s fellow republicans in congress say the tax bill  which includes slashing the corporate tax rate from  percent to  percent  would boost the economy and raise new tax revenue sufficient to offset deficit increases   many republicans believe tax cuts can pay for themselves because they would fuel greater economic growth  democrats dismiss this notion and some republicans have expressed doubts   corker  a conservative on fiscal policy  lobbied for the trigger to try to ensure that the tax cuts do not blow out the national debt  senator jeff flake  a republican who has not committed to voting for the tax bill  said on wednesday he was more comfortable with the legislation because of indications that trigger provisions would protect against raising the deficit  because republicans hold only a   majority in the senate  they can afford to lose few votes among their own on the tax legislation  most economists and business leaders advise against raising taxes in a recession when the economy typically needs to be stimulated  david mcintosh  president of the conservative lobbying group club for growth  said in a statement   any senator who understands basic business principles and truly cares about the deficit should understand that this trigger is an automatic tax increase and will actually harm economic growth
