washington  reuters    u s  interior secretary ryan zinke said on monday he has recommended that president donald trump reduce the size of the bears ears national monument in utah   a move that drew quick fire from conservationists but was supported by mining and drilling interests  the   million acre    square kms  area  designated by former president barack obama during his final days in office and named for its iconic twin buttes  is the first of  national monuments to be reviewed by the trump administration as part of a plan to increase development on federal lands   my job is to make sure that i     reflect the concerns of utah  and reflect the concerns of the taxpayers and the public who own the lands  and i think we ve done that   zinke told reporters in a teleconference about his interim recommendation sent to trump on saturday  zinke toured utah for four days before making the recommendation  his report said that the antiquities act  used by past presidents to declare monuments  should cover the  smallest area compatible  with protecting important sites    therefore    the secretary of the interior recommends that the existing boundary of the  bears ears  be modified to be consistent with the intent of the act   rather than designating a vast monument  as obama did   it would have been more appropriate to identify and separate the areas that have significant objects to be protected to meet the purposes of the act   zinke s report said  more study is necessary to determine how much smaller bears ears should be  zinke said  and that decision will not be made until all of the  monuments are reviewed   jamie williams  president of the wilderness society  said zinke s recommendation was  nothing less than an attack on the future of all american monuments  parks and public lands   and was  against the wishes of the overwhelming majority of americans    a public comment period that closed in late may generated hundreds of thousands of comments  with the majority expressing hope that monuments like bears ears remain protected  zinke also recommended that tribes be allowed to co manage  cultural areas  within the resized monument   a nod to native americans who had lobbied for protections for the territory   and that congress review conservation policies in the area  his recommendation to trump set the tone for the administration s broader review  triggered by an executive order in april  trump had argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate monuments under the antiquities act of  and put millions of acres of land  mainly in western states  off limits to drilling  mining  logging and ranching without adequate input from locals  the review is likely to add fuel to a heated national debate over washington s role in america s wildest spaces  environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight  but many state political leaders  conservatives and industry groups say the lands should generate money for business  creating jobs  or yielding revenue for education and other public services  while the land encompassed by the bears ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal  oil or gas  several other monuments on zinke s review list do   making the bears ears decision symbolically important to industry groups  kathleen sgamma  president of the western energy alliance  representing oil and gas companies  said zinke s approach was sensible   it s clear that bears ears was an overreach  and was much larger than necessary to protect cultural resources
