washington  reuters    u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin urged congress on wednesday to raise the federal debt limit before lawmakers start  their august recess  to avoid higher interest costs to taxpayers and market uncertainty about a potential default  maintaining u s  creditworthiness is of the  utmost importance  and the united states must pay its bills on time  mnuchin told a senate appropriations subcommittee   as i ve suggested in the past  based upon our best estimate at the time  we do have funding through september  but i have urged congress to take this up before they leave for the recess   mnuchin said  however there was little sign congress would heed mnuchin s call  at least for the moment  the house of representatives is due to start its recess on friday with no hint of movement on the issue  while the senate is consumed with trying to pass a healthcare overhaul bill  that could leave the debt limit unaddressed until congress returns on sept    perhaps one month before the treasury runs a real risk of not being able to pay all of its obligations    the last extension of the federal borrowing limit expired in march with total debt of around   trillion  but the treasury has extended its ability to issue debt by employing extraordinary cash management measures  including deferring reinvestments in federal employee pension funds  but short term treasury bill markets have grown nervous about the potential for the treasury to exhaust its borrowing capacity by mid october  sending yields higher and crushing demand for a recent  month bill auction  the situation is costing taxpayers money and stoking market uncertainty  said mnuchin  a former banker and hollywood film financier    right now effectively  as opposed to borrowing in the market at lower rates  we re borrowing and making our trust funds whole at slightly higher rates  so there is a real cost to doing that   he said   there s also an implied cost of uncertainty into the market  and the longer we wait  that more that uncertainty will be   senator james lankford  a republican  said at the hearing that his best estimate  derived through working with treasury officials  was that the use of extraordinary measures would amount to about    billion  largely because the government would have to cover interest owed to the affected pension funds  mnuchin did not dispute that estimate  lawmakers showed varying levels of concern on capitol hill this week as the senate focused on trying to pass a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act  known as obamacare   right now  my focus is obamacare   said senator ted cruz when asked on tuesday if the lack of action on the debt limit was a concern  cruz led fellow republicans in  to demand spending cuts as part of a fiscal fight that led to a  day partial government shutdown  another fiscal conservative senator  david perdue  said however he would prefer that congress stay in session in august to deal with raising the debt ceiling  adding   we ve just got to get it done   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell wants to pass a debt ceiling increase but does not have timing nailed down  a spokesman said
