 reuters    the attorneys general of maryland and the district of columbia filed a lawsuit on monday claiming that government payments to president donald trump s businesses violate the u s  constitution  payments to the president s enterprises from foreign and domestic governments through his hospitality empire draw business away from maryland and d c  venues and put local governments under pressure to give trump owned businesses special treatment  according to the complaint   foreign and domestic government payments to trump s businesses were the target of a similar lawsuit brought in january by plaintiffs including an ethics nonprofit group  and democratic lawmakers have blasted them as potential corrupting influences on trump  the trump organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the u s  treasury but will not require the customers to identify themselves    every time the president has spoken about drawing a line between his presidency and his businesses  he s walked those promises back   said d c  attorney general karl racine said at a news conference on monday  the case by racine and maryland attorney general brian frosh  both democrats  has a better chance in court as the first government action over allegations that trump  a republican  violated the constitution s so called emoluments clauses  legal experts said   democratic attorneys general have taken a lead role in challenging trump policies  successfully blocking executive orders restricting travel from some muslim majority countries   the maryland and d c  attorneys general are seeking an order in u s  district court in maryland preventing trump from continuing to receive government payments beyond his salary   white house press secretary sean spicer on monday rejected the claim that trump s business interests violated the constitution and said  partisan politics  were behind the lawsuit  trump s lawyers will likely move to dismiss the case  he said  the justice department declined to comment   trump s ownership in hundreds of businesses hurts maryland and d c  and violates  emoluments  clauses in the constitution that bar the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval as well as from domestic governments under any circumstances  according to the  complaint   while trump turned over management of the umbrella trump organization in january to a trust controlled by his two elder sons  he still owns his businesses  including the trump international hotel in washington  and can draw revenue from them at any time  the attorneys general argued they had standing to sue trump because their citizens will be harmed if payments to trump are used to influence his allocation of federal funds  they also said local hospitality companies  including state owned facilities  are being harmed   the justice department on friday argued in the other lawsuit that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to sue because they cannot allege enough specific harm caused by trump s businesses   the attorneys general have a better chance of establishing standing  legal scholars said  although they are divided over whether the ags will ultimately succeed  plaintiffs typically only have standing to file lawsuits under federal law if they can show they have been injured and a court ruling would remedy the harm   fordham law school professor jed shugerman said state governments  special duty to protect their citizens means they face a lower bar to standing in federal court  and the ag lawsuit should proceed   however  derek muller  a professor at pepperdine university school of law  said it was unclear that this harm could be remedied by a favorable ruling   the government has also said trump hotel revenue does not fit the definition of an improper payment under the constitution  payments to trump s hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause  which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president  the government said   if the justice department is correct  the emoluments clause has no meaning whatsoever   said frosh  the maryland official    the president can stand over here with his president of the united states hat and he s not allowed to take payments  but he takes a step over here and puts on his businessman hat  they can funnel as much money to him as they want
