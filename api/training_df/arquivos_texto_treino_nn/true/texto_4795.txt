washington  reuters    u s  supreme court nominee neil gorsuch on tuesday pledged independence from president donald trump  bristled at his criticism of the judiciary and said not even the president is above the law amid democratic concerns he would be beholden to the man who selected him  answering questions from senators during a more than  hour session on the second day of his senate judiciary committee confirmation hearing  gorsuch said trump never asked him to overturn the  supreme court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide  saying if the republican president had done so   i would have walked out the door   trump promised during last year s presidential campaign to appoint an anti abortion justice who would overturn the landmark roe v  wade ruling  which many conservatives want reversed  if confirmed by the senate as expected to fill a  month old vacancy  gorsuch would restore the nine seat court s conservative majority at a time when republicans control congress and the white house  but the conservative federal appeals court judge from colorado repeatedly said he was beyond politics   graphic   confirming gorsuch  how it works tmsnrt rs     when i became a judge  they gave me a gavel not a rubber stamp   gorsuch said   i am my own man   he added  trump has assailed the judiciary both as a candidate and since taking office on jan    he condemned federal judges who put on hold his two executive orders to ban the entry into the united states of people from several muslim majority countries  calling one a  so called judge  and suggesting that blame for a future terrorist attack should go to the courts   when anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity or the motives of a federal judge  well i find that disheartening  i find that demoralizing  because i know the truth   gorsuch said  when democratic senator richard blumenthal asked if that included trump  gorsuch said   anyone is anyone   gorsuch previously made similar remarks in private to senators including blumenthal  but trump at the time accused blumenthal of misrepresenting gorsuch s comments  trump indicated in a speech on tuesday night that his approach was unlikely to change   the courts are not helping us  to be honest  it s ridiculous  somebody said i should not criticize judges  ok  i ll criticize judges   he said  gorsuch s steady  measured performance during the marathon session  marked by a few moments of indignation under democratic questioning  indicated he was on track for confirmation  democrats probed gorsuch on whether he would be willing to hold trump accountable  asked by senator patrick leahy whether a president has the power to violate a law on surveillance of americans  gorsuch said   nobody is above the law in this country  and that includes the president of the united states   republican senator lindsey graham said if trump resumes the use of waterboarding  a prohibited form of simulated drowning  on detainees  he  may get impeached   gorsuch said he would not speculate on whether trump could be prosecuted if he authorized waterboarding  but repeated   no man is above the law   republicans have praised gorsuch    as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice  democrats  who have slim chances of blocking his nomination  have questioned his suitability  with some portraying him as favoring corporate interests and insufficiently independent from trump  chuck grassley  the panel s republican chairman  asked gorsuch  whether you d have any trouble ruling against a president who appointed you    that s a softball  mr  chairman   gorsuch said   i have no difficulty ruling against or for any party  other than based on what the law and facts in the particular case require  and i m heartened by the support i have received from people who recognize that there s no such thing as a republican judge or a democratic judge  we just have judges in this country    i have offered no promises on how i d rule in any case to anyone  and i don t think it s appropriate for a judge to do so  no matter who s doing the asking   gorsuch added  gorsuch refused to offer his opinion of trump s travel ban  saying it was an ongoing case  when leahy brought up a republican lawmaker s suggestion that gorsuch would uphold trump s ban  the nominee said   a lot of people say a lot of silly things  and that lawmaker  has no idea how i d rule   gorsuch said rulings should be based on the law and not politics  adding   a good judge doesn t give a whit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision   democratic senator sheldon whitehouse pressed gorsuch to call for the anonymous financial backers behind the judicial crisis network conservative legal advocacy group s   million campaign supporting his nomination to identify themselves  but the nominee refused  saying he would not engage in politics  but gorsuch added   nobody speaks for me   the seat gorsuch was nominated to fill has been vacant since the february  death of conservative justice antonin scalia  some democrats have said republicans  stole  a supreme court seat last year when the senate refused to consider former democratic president barack obama s nominee to replace scalia  appellate judge merrick garland  questioned by leahy  gorsuch called garland an  outstanding judge   but refused to answer whether obama s nominee had been treated fairly by senate republicans  gorsuch said supreme court precedents deserve respect  even as he sidestepped answering whether he thought a series of contentious cases from the past had been decided correctly  including roe v  wade and cases on gun rights  political spending  religious rights and the ruling tipping the  presidential election to republican george w  bush  gorsuch did say that the issue of gay marriage  which the supreme court legalized in   was  absolutely settled law   senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters gorsuch looked like  he s playing dodge ball   saying the nominee  has bent over backwards to avoid revealing anything   the confirmation hearing resumes on wednesday morning and is scheduled to last through thursday  grassley has said the committee is likely to vote on gorsuch s nomination on april   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the full senate would vote on confirming gorsuch before lawmakers  mid april recess
