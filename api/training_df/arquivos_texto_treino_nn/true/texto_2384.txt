boston  reuters    massachusetts governor charlie baker proposed a bill on tuesday to allow police and courts to hold people facing deportation orders in custody for extra time to allow them to be turned over to federal immigration officials  the move by the republican came a week after the state s top court ruled that law enforcement does not have the legal authority to comply with u s  immigration and customs enforcement detainer requests  the ice requests ask that people facing civil deportation orders be held in custody for up to  hours after the cases that brought them into the court system are determined  baker said the court s decision overturned longstanding policy in the state   for years  many local police departments and the trial court have cooperated with ice to ensure that they can detain violent and dangerous criminals  convicted of crimes like murder and rape  to keep our communities safe   baker said in a statement   this bill allows the state police to honor specific detainers   baker s proposal would limit compliance to cases where the person ice officials want detained is suspected of violent crimes such as terrorism  street gang activity or human trafficking  or has been convicted of a felony not directly related to his or her immigration status  ice detainer requests apply to immigrants in the country illegally who are arrested or otherwise enter the criminal justice system  baker s proposal would require a judge s approval to hold people facing a detainer request for longer than  hours after their cases are resolved  president donald trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration  the state chapter of the american civil liberties union criticized the move   baker s proposed legislation     is constitutionally suspect because it attempts to authorize state and local law enforcement to detain people without due process   the group s executive director  carol rose  said in a statement  the leaders of the democratic controlled state legislature in massachusetts did not immediately respond to requests for comment on baker s proposal
