u s  presidential election  trump s interactions with the russian leader were scrutinized closely because of those allegations  which have dominated his first six months in the white house  and trump

agencies that russia interfered to help trump  a republican  win the presidency  trump says there was no collusion and russia denies interference in the election  bremmer said trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking  privately and animatedly  with putin   joined only by putin s own translator   the lack of a u s  translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner  said bremmer  who called it a  breach of national security protocol   the white house official said the leaders and their spouses were only permitted to have one translator attend the dinner  trump sat next to japanese prime minister shinzo abe s wife  his translator spoke japanese   when president trump spoke to president putin  the two leaders used the russian translator  since the american translator did not speak russian   the official said  a u s  official who was briefed by some of his counterparts about the encounter said some of the leaders who attended the dinner were surprised to see trump leave his seat and engage putin in an extended private conversation with no one else from the u s  side present   no one is sure what their discussion was about  and whether it was purely social or touched on bilateral or international issues   the official said  as part of the investigations into allegations of moscow s meddling  a congressional panel said on tuesday it wanted to interview trump s eldest son  his former campaign chairman and all others who were at a june  meeting with russian nationals  the meeting in trump tower in new york has grabbed the spotlight in the saga of possible collusion between moscow and trump s campaign as media reports of more participants than originally known have emerged   donald trump jr   who runs the trump organization family business  released emails last week in which he eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic election rival hillary clinton as part of moscow s official support for his father s campaign   any intelligence out there that suggests that somebody is of interest to us  we have to pursue it   the u s  senate intelligence committee chairman  republican senator richard burr  told reporters  trump jr  s lawyer  alan futerfas  did not immediately respond to requests for comment on
