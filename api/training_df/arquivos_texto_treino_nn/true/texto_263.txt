washington  reuters    president donald trump s former campaign manager paul manafort did not violate a court gag order when he helped edit an opinion piece about his political work in ukraine  his defense lawyer kevin downing said in a court filing on thursday  the filing comes after prosecutors working for special counsel robert mueller earlier this week said they could no longer agree to more lenient bail terms for manafort  after discovering he was working with a colleague tied to russian intelligence agencies to ghost write an opinion piece that cast his political work in a favorable light  downing said in the thursday filing that his client was only involved in editing the piece to ensure accuracy  and that it would not prejudice the case because it was ultimately published in a ukrainian newspaper  not an american one
