washington  reuters    president donald trump has given the military the authority to reset a confusing system of troop limits in iraq and syria that critics said allowed the white house to micro manage battlefield decisions and ultimately obscured the real number of u s  forces  the pentagon  which confirmed the move on wednesday  said no change has yet been made to u s  troop limits  it also stressed the u s  strategy in iraq and syria still was focused on backing local forces to fight islamic state   a tactic that has averted the need for a major u s  ground force  but the shift on troop limits was another sign of the greater authority trump appears comfortable giving his military commanders to make battlefield decisions and could allow for more rapid increases in troop levels in the future  the force management level system was introduced in iraq and syria during barack obama s administration as a way to exert control over the military  obama periodically raised fml limits to allow more troops in iraq and syria as the campaign against islamic state advanced  but the numbers did not reflect the extent of the u s  commitment on the ground since commanders found often less than ideal ways to work around the limits   sometimes bringing in forces temporarily or hiring more contractors  the force management levels  which are officially at   in iraq and  in syria  are believed to be more than a couple of thousands troops shy of the actual number of u s  forces in both countries  pentagon spokeswoman dana white said trump delegated authority to defense secretary jim mattis to determine force management levels for iraq and syria going forward   we want our reporting to congress and to the public to be more easily and clearly understood   white said in a statement  which was reported earlier on wednesday by buzzfeed news   we will conduct a review to ensure that the numbers we provide to congress and to the public accurately reflect the facts on the ground  this is about transparency   proponents within the u s  military of changing the system also argue that bringing that decision making authority to the pentagon from the white house will allow more flexibility in responding to unforeseen developments on the battlefield  replacing the force management level system with something more transparent could be a tricky task  not least because of political sensitivities about u s  forces in iraq  influential shi ite cleric moqtada al sadr already has called on iraq s government to order the withdrawal of u s  and allied forces after the battle to retake the city of mosul from islamic state is complete  the iraqi and u s  governments  however  have signaled the need for a continued u s  military presence  how large that would be has yet to be determined  too much information about the comings and goings of u s  troops  particularly if announced in advance  could give information to enemy  experts say
