washington  reuters    flush with cash  political groups outside the white house are aggressively coming to president donald trump s aid as he battles low public approval numbers  questions about his election campaign s ties to russia and a stalled legislative agenda  through television attack ads and online campaigns normally seen only during the tumult of an election  the groups are helping trump to strike back against his perceived enemies and boost his agenda  adding to the firepower of his twitter account and the bully pulpit of the white house  on tuesday  one of the groups  america first policies  launched an attack ad against a senator from trump s own republican party who had balked at a senate plan to overhaul healthcare that would leave millions more americans uninsured  the attack angered senate leader mitch mcconnell  who is struggling to rustle up the votes for the plan  it is the first time that a u s  president has had super pacs   political action committees that can raise unlimited amounts of money and typically operate during elections   or political non profits  which do not have to disclose their donors or where they spend their money  actively working to support him after the dust of campaigning has cleared   the pro trump groups are prohibited from coordinating with the white house  which declined to comment for this story  the new york times reported that mcconnell had complained to white house chief of staff reince priebus about america first policies  ad  the group later pulled the ad  america first policies and the other pro trump groups were set up to promote trump and his legislative agenda   healthcare reform  building a wall along the mexican border  and pushing for lower taxation and deregulation  they are not allied to the republican party  which can pose a problem for republican leaders as tuesday s attack ad showed  with trump s approval ratings sagging and his agenda now overshadowed by a federal investigation into his  campaign s ties to russia  the groups are pouring resources into protecting trump s image  demonizing his opponents and amplifying his message that he is the victim of a witch hunt   the establishment is shaken  angry  losing control   begins another new ad by america first policies  which says on its website that it is a non profit organization  supporting key policy initiatives   images of the u s  capitol  democratic senate minority leader chuck schumer and liberal msnbc host rachel maddow flash in the background    desperately waging an all out war to protect their interest   the narrator continues   they lie  they leak  they leech onto power   america first policies is comprised of more traditionally conservative republicans and was founded after the election by a close ally of vice president mike pence  nick ayers   the group said in a statement their mission was to promote trump s agenda and that they were not afraid to push house republicans through grassroots and advertising to support the healthcare overhaul  the groups  shift from policy promotion to attack mode  does not surprise marjorie hershey  a political science professor at indiana university   a lot of research tells us that negative ads tend to be more attention getting than positive ads  and because super pacs themselves aren t on the ballot  they can afford to risk the unsavory reputation that negative advertisers often get   hershey said   strategists and political scientists say it is hard to know if the groups are actually moving public opinion  but the groups point to their fundraising as evidence of their success   much of it raised not from millionaires  but in small donations from voters   great america alliance    which was set up as a sister organization to a super pac created by trump supporters rudy giuliani and newt gingrich   has spent    on an ad attacking former fbi director james comey  the group s director  eric beach  told reuters      the video tried to discredit comey  who was fired by trump over his handling of the russia probe  the week he testified before the senate intelligence committee   just another dc insider in it for himself   the ad concludes  the group launched a new ad this week featuring conservative media star tomi lahren attacking robert mueller  the special counsel now leading the russia investigation  mueller is investigating whether trump may have attempted to obstruct justice by pressuring comey to drop his inquiry   on its website the group says its mission is  to advocate for a stronger economy  a more secure nation  and a society with less government intrusion and more freedom for american citizens   asked to reconcile its stated mission with the attack ads  the group s director  eric beach  said   our goal is to really get on the ground and fight back  our supporters want to get out there and fight     the mischaracterization of not just donald trump s rhetoric but also his policies    alison dagnes  a political science professor at shippensburg university who specializes in super pacs  said the well resourced groups play a key role in spreading trump s message that what his supporters are reading or seeing in the media is false    they re saying we see what s happening now and you shouldn t believe it   the committee to defend the president  another super pac  launched an ad calling on supporters to  defend  trump  the group s leader  ted harvey  said unfair attacks on trump had forced his group to shift their focus to defending the president instead of promoting his policies    certainly  i would rather be talking about policies than talking about made up lies that the democrats and the mainstream media cabal have put together to discredit the administration from moving forward on its agenda   said harvey   for a graphic on super pac spending for trump versus obama click tmsnrt rs
