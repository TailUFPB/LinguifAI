washington  reuters    attorney general jeff sessions threatened on monday to cut off u s  justice department grants to cities that fail to assist  federal immigration authorities  moving the trump administration closer to a potential clash with leaders of america s largest urban centers  sessions  statements were aimed at a dozens of cities and other local governments  including new york  los angeles and chicago  that have joined a growing  sanctuary  movement aimed at shielding illegal immigrants from stepped up deportation efforts  police agencies in those jurisdictions have barred their officers from routinely checking on immigration status when making arrests or traffic stops  and they have refused to lock up individuals longer than otherwise warranted at the request of federal agents seeking to deport them  trump administration officials says the deportation crackdown is focused on illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes  they insist public safety is jeopardized when police refuse to notify u s  immigration and customs enforcement of plans to release such a person from local custody   failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk  especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetrators   sessions said at a white house news briefing  his threat to withhold grants as punishment drew swift condemnation from california and new york officials  california senate leader kevin de leon  a los angeles democrat  called sessions  threat  nothing short of blackmail   accusing of  race based scapegoating  in its crackdown on immigrants   critics also argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities  trust in local police  particularly among latinos  and they question whether the administration is really targeting dangerous criminals  president donald trump  who made tougher immigration enforcement a cornerstone of his campaign  directed the government to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions in a jan   executive order  that order has yet to be put into effect  but sessions  announcement seemed to be the first step in doing so     the justice department grants typically are used to help police improve crime fighting techniques  buy new equipment and assist victims of crime  sessions may find his ability to sway local decision making through the justice department s purse is limited  because only a fraction of its grant dollars flow directly to city and county governments   federal records show the justice department doled out   billion to state governments and   million to nonprofits  but only   million directly to cities and counties last year   new york state attorney general eric schneiderman said his office would continue helping local governments  have the tools they need to protect their immigrant communities   los angeles mayor eric garcetti  whose city is home to one of the largest u s  immigrant communities  also denounced sessions  threat to use funding as a form of coercion   l a  s values are not for sale   garcetti said   slashing funds for first responders  for our port and airport  for counterterrorism  crime fighting and community building serves no one   so far no state has adopted policies barring cooperation with immigration authorities  though maryland s democratic controlled house of delegates approved such legislation last week  the state s republican governor  larry hogan  has said he would veto the bill  california s de leon is backing a bill that would essentially make all of the most populous u s  state a sanctuary  but he does not currently have the votes to pass it  sessions sought to frame the debate as a public safety issue  citing the case of a woman shot to death in san francisco two years ago by illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictions  san francisco may not be affected by the new restrictions  as the city and county received no funding from the department in the most recent fiscal year  however  sessions  order could impact other jurisdictions  new orleans  philadelphia  chicago and new york city   all singled out as possibly noncompliant by an inspector general s report last year   collectively received   million in justice department grants  according to trump s executive order  sessions would have to wait until the homeland security department determines what constitutes a  sanctuary city  before funding is restricted  dhs last week reported roughly  cities and counties that it deems uncooperative  though the agency has not finalized the list  sal tinajero  council member of the california sanctuary city of santa ana  questioned whether sessions even had the authority to make good on his threat   how do you take money away that congress has already voted to allocate  you can t  congress has to take another vote   he said
