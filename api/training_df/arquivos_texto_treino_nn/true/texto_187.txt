washington  reuters    in backing roy moore in alabama s u s  senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls  president donald trump made a risky bet   and lost big   the victory by democrat doug jones over the republican moore in the alabama special election on tuesday was a catastrophe for trump  portending a democratic wave next year that could cost republicans control of one or both houses of congress  the stakes in alabama were that high  democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the u s  house of representatives in next year s congressional elections  jones  narrow victory increases their once long odds of retaking control of the senate as well  if democrats were to recapture both chambers  they would serve as a check on trump s agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him    that republicans lost in one of the most republican states in the nation is a wake up call no matter how flawed their candidate was   said jesse ferguson  a democratic strategist and former aide to democrat hillary clinton s presidential campaign   democrats never expected to have a chance in alabama  where they had not won a u s  senate race in  years  but the combination of trump s unpopularity  the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against moore in november  and trump s enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity  experts said   trump was the one who got jones within firing range  and moore allowed jones to win   said kyle kondik  a political analyst at the university of virginia  even as democrats lost several special congressional elections this year  they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement  which is attributable to trump  kondik said    the alabama race showed there were limits both to trump s endorsement power and his judgment   even as senior republicans urged trump to abandon moore  the president decided instead in the campaign s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him  in the end  that was not enough  and early turnout reports suggested that many republicans stayed home   moreover  despite the sexual misconduct allegations against moore  the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president  moore s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on trump and his presidency    it is donald trump on trial in alabama   dean young  a strategist for moore  told abc news  trump congratulated jones on twitter  on a hard fought victory  and added   republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time   the loss was also a body blow to steve bannon  trump s former top strategist  who backed moore in the primary against the republican incumbent  luther strange  because he viewed moore as a more reliable ally  bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about alabama and more about furthering trump s economic nationalist agenda  bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the republican establishment in the  congressional elections  particularly senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who condemned moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his   moore    has denied the allegations  and reuters has not independently verified them  anti establishment beyond moore  bannon is supporting anti establishment candidates such as kelli ward in arizona  danny tarkanian in nevada and kevin nicholson in wisconsin  all of whom oppose mcconnell staying on as senate leader   bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting republicans in mississippi and wyoming  but moore s loss seems certain to dampen that effort  and republicans who fear losing control of congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters   it is now an open question whether trump will inject himself into more republican primaries  given his setback in alabama   when you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party  you run the risk of ruining your entire brand   said josh holmes  a republican consultant and close ally of mcconnell   bannon s supporters say rank and file republican voters are more likely to blame mcconnell  not bannon  for the loss in alabama  arguing that mcconnell and his well resourced senate leadership fund did nothing to help moore  mcconnell  actively opposed the republican candidate in alabama and threatened our senate majority by helping to put a liberal democrat in that seat   said andy surabian  a former bannon protégé who now advises a pro trump advocacy group  great america alliance  even with the alabama win  democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the senate  they must defend  incumbents in states that were won by trump and they must gain two seats currently held by republicans  their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in arizona and nevada  and perhaps tennessee  democrats need  seats to retake the house  but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive  particularly in suburban areas   brian walsh  president of another pro trump group  america first policies  said trump could not be blamed for moore s loss  arguing that the president s late endorsement almost won the race for moore  a deeply flawed candidate   he was trying to push a boulder up a hill   walsh said
