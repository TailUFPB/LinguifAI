washington  reuters    here are highlights of the reuters oval office interview with u s  president donald trump on wednesday  on whether he was aware his son donald trump jr  was meeting with a russian lawyer  no  that i didn t know  until a couple of days ago  when i heard about this  no i didn t know about that   on whether he wished he had known his son was having the meeting  look   that campaign     i actually always thought i d win  to be honest with you  because i ve been winning my whole life  to be honest with you  but we started a campaign as a non politician  and many people were skeptical  some weren t  some people who know me weren t     but many were skeptical  and it was a wild time  and we would meet with many people    that same meeting  a person comes in  sits  leaves  quickly  it was a  minute meeting  i guess  from what i m hearing  many people  and many political pros  said everybody would do that  if you got a call and said   listen i have information on hillary and the dnc   or whatever it was they said  most people are going to take that meeting  i think    i think many people would have held that meeting    and you have to understand  when that took place  this was before russia fever  there was no russia fever back then  that was at the beginning of the campaign  more or less  there was no russia fever    most of the phony politicians who are democrats who i watched over the last couple of days   most of those phonies that act holier than thou  if the same thing happened to them  they would have taken that meeting in a heartbeat    first question   first    minutes   i said   did you do it   he said   no  i did not  absolutely not   i then asked him a second time  in a totally different way  he said   absolutely not     somebody did say if he did do it  you wouldn t have found out about it  which is a very interesting point    look  something happened and we have to find out what it is  because we can t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process  so something happened  and we have to find out what it is    we have to find out and get to the bottom of what s going on  because we can t have even the slightest suspicion about our election process    now  everybody agrees that there was no impact on the votes in this election  which is very important to say  but we have to make sure that nothing could ever happen to our election process    do i feel i can trust anybody  ok  i m a very suspicious person  i am not a person that goes around trusting lots of people  but he s the leader of russia  it is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth  i am the leader of the united states  i love my country  he loves his country  he s for russia  president xi   i had a long meeting with him too     hours  great relationship  he s for china  i m for the united states  they re for their countries  but i do things the way i do things  and it s just worked out    but we had a very productive meeting  including the fact that i think we have a good shot at piece by piece getting syria to stop fighting  ultimately ukraine  and other things  including the destruction of terrorists as we know them    so i m sitting with putin  and we had a very good   we were there two hours and  minutes   we had a very good meeting  one of the things brought up was a ceasefire  i said   we ve got to solve this problem in syria  and ukraine by the way   and what happened is we sat down and we worked out a ceasefire  which is by the way  as of  minutes ago  totally holding  and that s four days  four days doesn t sound like a lot  but they ve never had a ceasefire that lasted at all  that s because putin told them  as opposed to somebody that nobody ever heard of  putin and i agreed to it  and we have a four day ceasefire  that means many lives have already been saved because of four days  but it s going to go on for a while  and things are going to go better    i was very tough with president putin  we have a very important relationship  it s going to be a relationship where lots of lives could be saved  like as an example with the ceasefire  which nobody else could have gotten but me    i campaigned on strong military  strong borders  and low oil prices    look what i ve done   oil prices have been driven down  we re sending lng to poland  massive shipments to poland  that s not what putin wants  and for the military  we ve got   billion more of equipment than anybody ever thought of  in the last budget  putin doesn t want that   so why would putin want me    it s really the one question i wish i would have asked putin  were you actually supporting me    i m very big on energy  and that s not good for russia  because russia makes its money with energy  that drives the price of energy down  i also am very strong on the military  very  very strong on the military  i m also very strong on cyber    i would bet that inwardly putin would have been against me    the mood in the white house is fantastic    we have done more in five months than practically any president in history    if you look at iraq and if you look at syria and you see the progress we ve made with isis  it s been almost complete    the white house is functioning beautifully  the stock market has hit a new high  job numbers are the best they ve been in  years  we have a supreme court judge already confirmed  energy is doing levels that we ve never done before  our military is doing well  we re knocking the hell out of isis  which obama wasn t  there s not a thing that we re not doing well in  the white house is functioning beautifully  despite the hoax made up by the democrats    the problem is  i didn t do anything  i didn t do anything  this isn t a question of defense  i didn t do anything  i had no relationship to russia  so i said  what can the legal team do    the only frustration is that this russia story is a hoax made up by the democrats as an excuse for losing an election that they should have won because it s almost impossible for a republican to win the electoral college    there was zero coordination  it s the dumbest thing i ve ever heard  there s no coordination  this was a hoax  this was made up by the democrats    this is the greatest con job in history  where a party sits down the day after they got their ass kicked  and they say   huh  what s our excuse     it just continues and continues  and honestly it s a disgrace  and it s very bad for our country  and the russians must be laughing  because this narrative is so bad for us as a country
