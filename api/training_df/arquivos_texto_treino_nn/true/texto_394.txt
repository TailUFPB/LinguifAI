railroads would benefit from provisions allowing them to expense their capital expenditures in one year as opposed to over time  lowering their taxable income  schoonmaker said   we ll see what comes out as far as the ability to depreciate immediately  but that certainly would be beneficial because they are all big capital spenders   schoonmaker said  noting that railroads spend  percent to  percent of revenue on capital expenditures  airlines stand to gain from lower tax rates  analysts said  with ubs pointing to alaska air group inc  alk n  and southwest airlines co  luv n  as possible
