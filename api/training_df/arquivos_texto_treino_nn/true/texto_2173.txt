washington new york  reuters    for months  u s  president donald trump s national security adviser and his chief strategist have battled for influence behind the scenes  and their feud may force another shake up at the white house  the dispute between lieutenant general h r  mcmaster and political strategist stephen bannon has reached a level of animosity that is destabilizing trump s team of top advisers just as the administration tries to regain lost momentum  three senior officials said   under pressure from moderate republicans to fire bannon  trump declined to publicly back him on tuesday  although he left his options open   we ll see what happens with mr  bannon   he told reporters at trump tower in new york  whatever trump decides could chart the fate of a nuclear weapons deal with iran  u s  troop deployments to afghanistan and white house staffing decisions   all issues over which bannon and mcmaster have sparred  bannon has been in a precarious position before but trump has opted to keep him  in part because his chief strategist played a major role in his election victory and is backed by many of the president s most loyal rank and file supporters   the president obviously is very nervous and afraid of firing him   a source close to the white house told reuters  the source floated the possibility that bannon could be demoted instead of fired  noting that he might turn into a harsh critic of the administration if he is forced out of the inner circle   two other senior officials  both supporters of mcmaster who asked not to be identified  said he blames bannon for a series of attacks against him by right wing website breitbart news  which bannon used to lead  and other far right conservative groups   in recent weeks  breitbart has published a series of articles making a case for mcmaster s ouster on the basis that he is not a strong ally of israel and that he has staffed the national security council with holdovers from the obama administration  one of the senior officials said mcmaster s anger over the campaign  is known to the president  but declined to say whether the national security adviser had told trump directly or through general john kelly  an ally and the president s new chief of staff   mcmaster isn t saying bannon is the mastermind behind the campaign  but he does think bannon could stop it if he wanted to   said one of mcmaster s defenders  in a television interview on sunday  mcmaster repeatedly declined to answer when asked if he could work with bannon  about their feud  bannon declined to comment and mcmaster was unavailable for comment  instead of firing bannon  trump could move mcmaster into a position outside the white house  possibly back to an active military command role  or keep both men where they are and insist on some form of truce  bannon has survived other white house power struggles this year and established a detente with trump s son in law and senior adviser jared kushner after a scolding from the president  the two senior officials who support mcmaster said kelly is angry that the anti mcmaster campaign has made the white house appear chaotic  reflecting badly on him as he was brought in as chief of staff two weeks ago to restore order and discipline  bannon sees himself as the defender of trump s nationalist base and has advocated for both an end or renegotiation of trade deals and a more isolationist approach to foreign affairs than mcmaster   he has pushed to scrap the  nuclear weapons agreement with iran  which mcmaster argues should remain in place  and has also proposed using contractors to fight the war in afghanistan rather than expanding u s  forces there  as mcmaster has advocated   mcmaster is part of a more pragmatic group that bannon likes to label  globalists   he drew the fury of bannon s supporters by recently overhauling the white house s national security council  pushing out four staffers who were seen as close to bannon  conservative commentator mike cernovich is a bannon ally and has been a vocal critic of mcmaster  even leveling personal attacks against him  cernovich says he does not talk directly to bannon but praises him as an important counterweight to mcmaster   he also warns that the president would alienate his most loyal supporters if he fires bannon   i don t think that people who like trump are suddenly going to say   we re going to fight trump   instead they ll say   what s the point of supporting him    cernovich told reuters  the conservative jewish american and pro israel group zionist organization of america  zoa   which also has close ties to bannon  has been one of mcmaster s sharpest critics  urging trump to reassign him away from policy areas dealing with israel and iran   trump has himself backed mcmaster  saying he was a  good man and very pro israel   a source close to the zoa bristled at the suggestion that bannon was influencing its approach and said it would not tone down the campaign against mcmaster  despite entreaties by bannon  to do so   we find it remarkably offensive that anyone would suggest that steve bannon or anyone else tells us what to say or what not to say   the source said   it makes me feel awful that he s getting blamed for this  but there s nothing i can do about it
