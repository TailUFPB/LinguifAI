edison  n j   reuters    phil murphy  a wealthy former goldman sachs investment banker  might seem an unlikely champion of the working and middle classes  but new jersey s democratic candidate for governor  who leads republican lieutenant governor kim guadagno by double digits in polls  has pushed to increase taxes for corporations and the rich to pay for a plethora of populist policy proposals  tuition free community college  increased school funding and tax credits for families  his race  one of two gubernatorial campaigns in   offers an early opportunity ahead of next year s bonanza of congressional and governor s races for democrats to weigh how to win in the era of republican president donald trump  with republican governor chris christie s record low approval ratings dragging down guadagno s campaign  murphy  a  year old who has never held office  has pushed a decidedly liberal agenda that would put his state at the center of his party s resistance to the president s policies   a lot of people assumed that after the democratic primary was over  he would pivot more to the center   we haven t seen that happen   said brigid callahan harrison  a political science professor at montclair state university in new jersey  guadagno    portrays murphy as an elitist millionaire   he has spent more than   million of his money on his run   and said he has no plan to finance his lofty goals   i will lower your taxes  and phil murphy will raise them   she said last week at the close of their final debate  murphy s stance reflects the national party s leftward shift  following vermont senator bernie sanders  insurgent primary campaign last year against eventual presidential nominee hillary clinton  like sanders  murphy has focused his message on a  fairer  economy  vowing to help the middle  not the moneyed  class  he highlights his working class childhood as proof he understands financial struggle  he has backed a   minimum wage  proposed a public bank to provide low interest loans to residents and promised to force  corporations  hedge funds and the wealthiest among us  to pay their fair share   he seems like a hardworking guy who can relate to hardworking guys   said ed coryell jr   a carpenter who attended a union rally in edison for murphy earlier this month   we look for people who are going to create jobs for our members   murphy also has woven more traditional democratic social issues into his campaign  even as he embraces liberal causes such as legalizing marijuana   progressive means a lot of things  but i promise you it means at least three things   murphy said at a rally on thursday with former president barack obama  under whom he served as ambassador to germany from  to    we will fund planned parenthood again   he said   we will sign sensible gun safety laws to keep our communities safe  and we will do something about climate change   most notably  murphy has said he would extend protections for illegal immigrants  turning new jersey into a  sanctuary state   guadagno seized on that issue  airing a television commercial that said murphy  will have the backs of deranged murderers    phil murphy is even to the left of bernie sanders   guadagno campaign spokesman ricky diaz said   phil murphy is out of touch with middle class families who want to make the state safer and more affordable   though he has run to the left  murphy has strong backing from the democratic establishment  with obama  clinton and former vice presidents joe biden and al gore all campaigning with him this month  by contrast  guadagno  who is trailing badly in fundraising  has received minimal support from national republican leaders  there is little question that murphy s liberal positions have been buoyed by the headwinds guadagno faces  given christie s and trump s statewide unpopularity  that could mean murphy s campaign is not a perfect blueprint for other democratic candidates  some analysts said   i think a lot of people will turn to new jersey and say   democrats have to go progressive    said matthew hale  a political science professor at seton hall university in south orange  new jersey   but i would be very wary of democrats trying to take a page out of the phil murphy playbook in any other place
