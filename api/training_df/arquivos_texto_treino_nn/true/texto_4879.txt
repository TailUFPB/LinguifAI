 reuters    proponents of government efforts to clean up hazardous waste sites like radioactive soil buried in a st  louis area landfill fear the trump administration s proposed  percent budget cut will slow or damage the already struggling superfund program  the white house budget proposal submitted to congress on thursday includes a  percent cut in spending for the u s  environmental protecting agency  including a similar reduction of the agency s hazardous substance superfund account by   million to   million  the superfund program  started in   has been criticized over the years for its slow efforts to clean up hazardous waste sites  which now number more than   around the country  proponents argue that the epa fights with one arm tied behind its back because its budget has been halved from   billion in recent years  while critics say what they characterize as a bloated bureaucracy should step out of the way and allow the states and private sector do the job faster  cheaper and more effectively   this is a program that is already a bit on life support  so to take another third out of it is really quite harmful   said ken kimmell  president of the union of concerned scientists  which advocates for science based solutions to problems  those who worry about the superfund program s future are angry that epa administrator scott pruitt is already abandoning newly made promises  citing comments he made earlier this month to u s  mayors  on march   pruitt said certain epa programs  including the superfund program   are essential to protect   an epa spokeswoman said the focus for the agency has not changed  only how to achieve its mission   this budget helps refocus the agency on being more effective  more focused  and less costly   julia valentin said in an email   it is about empowering the states to be primary implementers of environmental programs on the ground  rather than insist that epa micromanage them   that is cold comfort to some living near superfund sites  like dawn chapman  a  year old stay at home mom who co founded a group named  just moms  four years ago to bring attention to the plight of residents near the west lake landfill in bridgeton  missouri  about  miles   km  northeast of st  louis  the epa last fall indefinitely delayed its proposal for how to clean up contaminated soil at the landfill  next to another site where an underground fire has been smoldering for several years  residents complain of higher rates of cancers  bloody noses or asthma   i don t see how this is going to speed up anything   chapman said of the proposed smaller budget  chapman  who has three children with special needs  is unsure whether the landfill is the cause of their issues  she wants the cleanup to move ahead  but is not confident the state could handle the matter any better  michael mckenna  a republican strategist and energy lobbyist  said asking an organization to do their job with a little bit less is not unusual  and the epa will find efficiencies   it s a bit premature to declare the sky is falling   he said  critics of the epa said the agency needs to operate better with less  and work more closely with the private sector and states to get back to its core mission   the problem i have with the epa  it s turned into more of an ideological group more concerned with spreading a liberal message  president barack  obama had   said republican senator james inhofe of oklahoma   inhofe has been critical of what he characterized as overreach by the epa  as well as its rule making and bureaucracy under obama  however  some environmental groups argue that the shifting the work to the states is not the answer  mike scott  a senior organizing representative with the sierra club in montana  said that state got   million from the epa last year for its  superfund sites  he added that the state s department of environmental quality gets almost half its annual budget from the epa as well   even if they say   we re going to shift this over to the states   i don t understand how the states are going to have the resources to pay for it   scott said   backers and critics of the program agree on one thing  the budget that comes out of congress will look far different from the trump proposal and likely will reverse some of the cuts to the superfund program   we re in the first couple steps of a thousand mile journey   mckenna said   this is not where we re going to end
