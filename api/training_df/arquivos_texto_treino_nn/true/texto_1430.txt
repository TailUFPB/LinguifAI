washington  reuters    a u s  official told congress on tuesday it would be  rational  to legislate a path for citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the united states as children  but within hours the administration backtracked  saying his comments did not state the views of president donald trump  the trump administration last month ended the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy  which began in  under former president barack obama  the program allowed nearly   so called  dreamers  to work legally in the united states without being deported  the policy was aimed at young people who came to the united states illegally as children  the administration said it ended daca because obama overstepped his constitutional authority by creating the policy  without congressional approval  trump called on congress to enact a law to protect daca recipients  and last month angered some fellow republicans by negotiating with congressional democratic leaders on possible legislation  at a senate hearing  republican senator john kennedy asked homeland security official michael dougherty about dreamers   should they be allowed to stay    under a rational bill these individuals would be able to become lawful permanent residents with a pathway to citizenship   dougherty  assistant department of homeland security secretary for border  immigration and trade policy  responded   so the president believes they should be allowed to stay   kennedy responded   the president  yes  would like to work with congress to get a solution   dougherty said  declining to give further specifics on conditions under which dreamers should be allowed to stay in the country  hours later  dhs moved to distance the administration from dougherty s testimony   mr  dougherty was not stating administration policy or the president s views   said tyler q  houlton  the dhs deputy press secretary   the white house will be issuing its priorities for immigration reform in the coming week   the trump administration has sent conflicting signals on the immigration issue  a focus of trump s  campaign  candidate trump promised to end daca and ultimately fulfilled that promise  but he has also expressed sympathy for the young immigrants it benefited  during the hearing  dougherty said the administration s immigration priorities include border control  better vetting  reducing visa overstays  reforming non immigrant business visas and establishing a merit based system that favors skilled immigrants  he said the administration also wants to expand its ability to quickly remove people who enter illegally and do not claim asylum  republicans in congress have introduced several bills that would fulfill aspects of trump s agenda  but many democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as poison pills that would kill the chance for a deal  democrats say it is unfair to make legislation helping daca recipients contingent on a broad suite of enforcement and reform measures   please do not put the burden on the dreamers to accept every aspect of comprehensive immigration reform to get a chance to become citizens of the united states   senator dick durbin said during the hearing  last month trump said he was close to a deal with top senate democrat chuck schumer and top house of representatives democrat nancy pelosi on protections for daca recipients that would have border security measures without funding construction of a wall along the u s  mexican border that he promised during the campaign  after meeting with the democrats  trump said   we re not looking at citizenship  for dreamers  but pelosi and schumer said trump had embraced provisions of a bipartisan proposal called the dream act that would grant permanent legal resident status to dreamers who qualify  and eventually  a pathway to u s  citizenship  house majority leader kevin mccarthy  who dined on monday with trump and other republicans  was asked whether the president s tentative agreement with schumer and pelosi was still live   i think what nancy said when she left the meeting is different from what everybody else in the meeting had the impression of   mccarthy said  declining to answer further questions  an aide to pelosi later said  there is no change in our understanding  after  subsequent conversations  with the white house  the aide spoke on condition of anonymity  schumer  at a news conference after the democratic caucus  said   we were explicit that the president would support   the dream act  if they are backing off that  we ought to know
