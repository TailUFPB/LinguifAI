washington  reuters    u s  interior secretary ryan zinke will recommend on aug   whether to eliminate or shrink nearly two dozen national monuments  creating the first major test for a  year old law that gives presidents the power to protect swaths of public land  zinke is expected to recommend that at least some of the national monuments under review   which were all created since    be rescinded or shrunk in size  responding to an order by president donald trump  who believes there should be greater opportunity to increase local resource development and economic opportunities   any recommendation of reductions could herald a move into unchartered territory  under the antiquities act  a president can declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument  however  no president has ever revoked a previous designation  previous presidents  including woodrow wilson and william howard taft did reduce the size of some existing monuments  but this time  environmental groups are prepared to challenge any changes in court   something that has not happened before  trump has argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate federally protected monuments under the  antiquities act and put millions of acres of land   mainly in western states   off limits to drilling  mining  logging and other activity without adequate input from locals  under the antiquities act  a president can declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument  conservation groups  state attorneys general and native american tribes  including the five tribes which lobbied to create one of the sites under review   bears ears national monument in utah   have already said they plan to challenge any changes in court   we told zinke that all the tribes are willing to go into battle in terms of litigation and we are here to fight for our monument   said davis filfred  a council delegate for the navajo nation council  while zinke has said so far that six monuments of the  on the review list should be left intact  he is expected to recommend downsizing some through presidential decree or congressional action  which could change how future presidents use the  law  zinke has already said he intends to scale down bears ears  which covers   million acres and was created last december by former president barack obama  who said it would protect the cultural legacy of native american tribes and preserve  scenic and historic landscapes   zinke said he believes previous presidents took too many liberties with the antiquities act   clearly the antiquities act was designed to protect the smallest area compatible with protection of the object   zinke told reuters in june in boston  where he met with stakeholders to discuss the atlantic coast northeast canyons and seamounts marine monument  zinke said that  congress needs to step to the plate  too   to take up legislation that could change some monument sizes and create other designations like national recreation and conservation areas    molly block  a spokeswoman for utah republican representative rob bishop  chair of the house of representatives natural resources committee  said while the house may be able to pass legislation regarding monuments  enactment of a measure would be an uphill battle   you can get something through the house  but anything we do will face a tough time in the senate   she said  meanwhile  public support for monuments has grown in visibility  zinke has said interior has received over   million public comments on the regulations gov website and thousands more via traditional mail  environmental groups have said more than   million comments were submitted  mostly in favor of keeping the monuments intact   the debate has galvanized a lot of different interests beyond traditional environmental groups  including outdoor retailers and hunters and fishers  who are out there mobilizing during this review   said sharon buccino of the natural resources defense council  outdoor retailer patagonia aired its first ever tv ads on sunday  featuring a direct appeal to zinke to leave the monuments intact  the ads will air in zinke s home state of montana  as well as utah and nevada  where several monuments are under review
