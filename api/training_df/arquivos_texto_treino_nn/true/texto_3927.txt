washington  reuters    president donald trump vowed on wednesday to do  whatever is necessary  to broker peace between israel and the palestinians as he hosted palestinian president mahmoud abbas at the white house  but gave no sign of how he could revive long stalled negotiations  in their first meeting  trump pressed abbas to do more to stop  incitement to violence  against israelis and  according to the white house  urged him in private to halt payments to families of palestinian prisoners held in israeli jails  a demand long pressed by israel  even as trump boldly predicted he would achieve peace where other presidents had failed  he stopped short of explicitly recommitting his administration to a two state solution to the decades old conflict  a long standing foundation of u s  policy  some palestinians said they were disappointed by the omission  despite what many experts see as a long shot bid  trump told abbas   i will do whatever is necessary      i would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator  and we will get this done   abbas reasserted the goal of a palestinian state  saying it must have east jerusalem as its capital with the borders that existed before the  middle east war   most israelis want all of jerusalem as their capital and reject a full return to  borderlines as a threat to their security  trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough  not least because his administration has yet to articulate a cohesive strategy for restarting the moribund peace process  abbas  white house talks followed a february visit by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  who moved to reset ties after a combative relationship with the republican president s predecessor  democrat barack obama   trump sparked international criticism at the time  when he appeared to back away from a two state solution  saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide  palestinian statehood has been the objective of successive u s  administrations and the international community  the meeting with abbas  the western backed head of the palestinian authority  was another test of whether trump  in office a little more than  days  is serious about pursuing the kind of comprehensive peace deal that eluded his predecessors  trump insisted he was ready to try to reach the  toughest deal   but when he later sat down to lunch with the palestinian leader  he said it was  maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years   trump  who said he decided to  start a process  but offered no new policy prescriptions or timetable  may be underestimating the challenge when trust between the two sides is low  analysts said   you can t just pretend you only have to handle a few key issues and that s it   said david makovsky  a member of obama s negotiating team during the last talks  which collapsed in   still  plans are being firmed up for trump to visit netanyahu in jerusalem and possibly abbas in the west bank on may  and   say people familiar with the matter  that has sparked speculation about a meeting of the three  u s  and israeli officials have declined to confirm the visit  trump and abbas appeared friendly but businesslike as they stood at side by side lecterns  but that was a far cry from the way trump and netanyahu interacted in february  abbas promised that under  your courageous stewardship and your wisdom  as well as your great negotiating ability   the palestinians would be partners seeking a  historic peace treaty   but under pressure at home to avoid major concessions  the  year old leader said   it s about time for israel to end its occupation   referring to jewish settlements in the west  bank  abbas  however  did not repeat in public his demand that israel freeze settlement construction on land palestinians want for a state as a condition for negotiations  u s  lawmakers have warned that palestinian funding could be cut off unless abbas halts plo stipends to families of prisoners whom israel considers terrorists but many palestinians see as heroes  there was no indication abbas  who governs in the west bank while hamas militants rule gaza  bowed to pressure on the issue  especially with hundreds of palestinian prisoners on hunger strike  in gaza  hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said the promises abbas made at the white house  don t obligate anyone   questions have been raised about trump s choice of son in law jared kushner to oversee the peace initiative  along with trump s longtime business lawyer  jason greenblatt  as envoy  efforts to enlist israel s sunni arab neighbors  who share israeli concerns about shi ite iran  to help rejuvenate peacemaking  have yet to yield results  national security adviser h r  mcmaster described trump s foreign policy approach as  disruptive   saying his unconventional ways could create an opportunity to help stabilize the middle east  but trump s unpredictability has even at times rattled a close ally like israel  his pro israeli campaign rhetoric suggested he might give netanyahu free rein  but trump s promise to move the u s  embassy to jerusalem from tel aviv is on the back burner  and he caught netanyahu off guard by asking him to put unspecified limits on settlement activity
