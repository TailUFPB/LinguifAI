washington san francisco  reuters    president donald trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the u s  farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce  according to farmers and officials who met with him      at a roundtable on farm labor at the white house last month  trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas             he assured us we would have plenty of access to workers   said zippy duvall  president of the american farm bureau federation  one of  participants at the april  meeting with trump and agriculture secretary sonny perdue  during the roundtable conversation about agriculture  farmers and

difficult farm jobs  according to interviews with nine of the  participants  they said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the h  visa program  the

three hours all but one had quit  brubaker told the gathering at the white house   trump said he wanted to help and asked secretary perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations  according to the accounts  while other issues such as trade  infrastructure and technology were also discussed   participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor  than about anything else we talked about    said bill northey  a farmer and iowa s secretary of agriculture  tom demaline  president of willoway nurseries in ohio  said he told the president

roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce  but trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals

illegally in the country for two consecutive years a  blue card  to protect them from deportation   brubaker  the pennsylvania farmer  said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president s support to make it a bipartisan effort    the administration has got something started here   he said of the meeting with farm leaders   it s about time something happens
