mexico city  reuters    with nafta talks grinding toward stalemate  u s  president donald trump may be tempted to carry out his threat to withdraw from the trade pact  but legal experts say such a decision  could be defeated  or delayed significantly by court challenges  the constitutional and statutory authority for who can terminate the  north american free trade agreement   trump or the u s  congress   is deeply disputed  and it may take the u s  supreme court or a truce between the white house and capitol hill to sort it out     private sector executives said that major u s  business groups are preparing legal challenges to any withdrawal by the  united states  although the plaintiffs had not yet been determined  litigation would lay bare the fault lines between trump s populist vision and the pro trade  business friendly lawmakers of his republican party  many of whom are increasingly nervous that nafta will collapse and cause economic damage    i think this is headed for a huge legal morass if the president were to unilaterally send a notice of withdrawal   said jennifer hillman  a georgetown university law professor and former world trade organization  wto  appellate judge   there will be immediate challenges across the board      nafta s original text allows a country to withdraw from the agreement six months after it provides written notice to the other parties  but neither the agreement nor u s  implementing legislation specifies how that should be decided  once the six month period ends  the president can declare the restoration of u s  tariffs on canada and mexico to wto levels  although some legal experts say congress may ultimately have authority over this  the three countries were wrapping up a fifth round of talks to update nafta on tuesday with major differences yet to be resolved  the nafta implementing law would be untouched by a trump withdrawal  creating what some call a  zombie  trade pact without tariff free access  but other provisions would remain  some of those rules are opposed by the trump administration  including the  chapter   arbitration system that often thwarts u s  anti dumping cases against canada and mexico  as well as labor  environmental and regional content requirements that u s  officials see as weak  trump would need congress  approval to repeal that law  winning that vote could be extremely difficult  as most congressional republicans follow their business and farm constituents in being advocates of free trade in general and nafta in particular   the president would want to get congress on board so that the implementing legislation is coherent   said dean pinkert  a trade lawyer and former u s  international trade commission member  almost any court challenge would argue that trump needs congressional approval to quit nafta because congress has explicit authority in the u s  constitution over tariffs and trade  but the president historically has held power over foreign policy matters such as international treaties  the supreme court is often reluctant to rule on questions of authority between the executive and legislative branches of government and prefers legislative solutions instead  in a  case  the court sided with president jimmy carter after senator barry goldwater challenged his authority to nullify a defense treaty with taiwan  but that pact did not  have a trade component and was clearly a foreign policy issue  if the supreme court did rule on a nafta withdrawal challenge  much would depend on how the case is argued  said     tim meyer  an international law professor at vanderbilt university in nashville  tennessee    if the case is successfully framed as to who has authority over foreign affairs  i think the president wins   meyer said  georgetown university s hillman said her reading of the constitutional question and implementing legislation stacks up against trump   that congress only explicitly intended for the president to implement nafta  not the reverse   nafta unequivocally falls under the commerce clause of the constitution   hillman said
