washington  reuters    president donald trump s effort to roll back obamacare gained momentum on wednesday as republican leaders scheduled a vote in the house of representatives on thursday on newly revised legislation  house majority leader kevin mccarthy expressed confidence the bill would pass and several moderate republican lawmakers who previously objected to the bill said they could now support it  a vote was expected as early as midday thursday  with lawmakers planning to leave town later that day for a week long recess  late on wednesday  the bill cleared a procedural step allowing it to advance to the house floor  even if a narrow majority in the house approves the bill  it still faces a steep climb in the senate  where only a few defections could kill the effort  keen to score his first major legislative win since taking office in january  trump threw his own political capital behind the bill  meeting with lawmakers and calling them in an effort to cajole their support  trump  whose republican party controls both the house and senate  is seeking to make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace obamacare  aides said he worked the phones furiously  wavering moderate republicans had worried that the  legislation to overhaul president barack obama s  signature healthcare law would leave too many people with pre existing medical conditions unable to afford health coverage  but several republican skeptics got behind the bill after they met with trump to float a compromise proposal that is still expected to face unanimous democratic opposition  the legislation s prospects brightened further after members of the freedom caucus  a faction of conservative lawmakers in the house who played a key role in derailing the original version of the bill last month  said they could go along with the compromise  the bill is also receiving a torrent of opposition from medical groups  including the american medical association  who say millions of americans will lose coverage or face higher costs  millions more americans got healthcare coverage under obamacare  but republicans have long attacked it  they view it as a government intrusion into the healthcare system and blame it for driving up costs  called the american health care act  the republican bill would repeal most obamacare taxes  including a penalty for not buying health insurance  it would slash funding for medicaid  the program that provides insurance for the poor  and roll back much of medicaid s expansion   the latest effort comes after earlier pushes by trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice  underscoring the difficulty of rallying together the republican party s divided factions  earlier this week  prospects for the legislation appeared grim as several influential moderate republicans said they could not support the bill  citing their concerns about protecting people with pre existing conditions  putting a spotlight on the concerns about pre existing conditions  late night talk show host jimmy kimmel made a tearful plea for keeping that provision in obamacare as he recounted a medical emergency that arose with his newborn son    kimmel s monologue about his son s congenital heart condition was viewed nearly  million times on his show s facebook page and on wednesday morning was the no   trending story on youtube  republican representatives fred upton and billy long  who were part of a group of moderate lawmakers who met at the white house with trump  said the president endorsed their plan to add   billion over five years to help cover the cost for people with pre existing illnesses who could otherwise be priced out of insurance markets  describing trump s efforts to secure his support  long said trump told him    billy we really need you  man    representative mark meadows  chairman of the conservative freedom caucus  said the new language on pre existing conditions was a  net plus  for garnering the votes needed to pass the healthcare bill  critics of the changes to the law  including several health policy experts  said the   billion could not be enough to cover the cost of coverage for the sickest patients  republicans did not await a new score from the nonpartisan congressional budget office to see how many people would be insured under their revised plan and how much it would cost  health insurers  such as anthem inc  antm n   unitedhealth group inc  unh n   aetna inc  aet n  and cigna corp  ci n   have faced months of uncertainty over healthcare s future  so have hospital companies  such as hca holdings inc  hca n  and tenet healthcare corp  thc n   on wednesday  aetna said it will exit the obamacare individual insurance market in virginia next year  citing  growing uncertainty  and expected losses this year  house democrats rejected the latest change to the republican legislation on wednesday  saying patients with pre existing illnesses would be vulnerable to being pushed off their insurance in certain states and face higher costs    this is deadly   house democratic leader nancy pelosi told a news conference   no band aid will fix it    democrats have long thought their best chance of stopping the repeal would be in the senate  where only a few republicans would need to defect to stop the law from moving forward  the difficulty in the house is now making democrats optimistic that republicans will face backlash from voters and face losing seats in the  midterm elections
