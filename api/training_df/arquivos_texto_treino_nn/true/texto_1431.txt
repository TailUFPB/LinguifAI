 reuters    warren buffett is closely monitoring whether u s  president donald trump can lower corporate taxes  one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell   it s an actual factor at berkshire   buffett  the chairman of berkshire hathaway inc  brka n   said in a tuesday interview with cnbc television   and it s very  very  very seldom in my  years that it has ever been a factor   buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues  but when asked if he was thinking about taxes  he said  i think about them plenty  now   we ve got actions on both sides that we would take   referring to taking gains or realizing losses  he said  berkshire has said it ended june with more than   billion of equity investments  which buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term  the conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as american express co  axp n   coca cola co  ko n  and wells fargo   co  wfc n   while other bets such as international business machines corp  ibm n  have fared less well  buffett had said at berkshire s annual meeting in omaha  nebraska  on may  that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall  that might be a good strategy now  if trump and many congressional republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  buffett explained that he would  feel kind of silly  realizing a   billion gain and paying   million in taxes  only to have congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill  he said other investors sitting on  hundreds of billions  of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing  it is unclear whether the republican controlled congress can pass a tax bill that trump will sign  and buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the affordable care act or move forward on infrastructure  two of the president s priorities  he expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down   i would think the republicans controlling both houses  and the presidency  they would not want to have a shutout  in their first year   buffett said   i think they can get it done
