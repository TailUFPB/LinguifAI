new york  reuters    days after president donald trump s decision to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  mayara pena still has a lot of unanswered questions  one of them is about her cars  in march  she leased a  honda for her personal use and a brand new  dodge van for the small construction business she owns  on tuesday  pena  who came to the united states from brazil as a teenager  learned that her authorization to work and protection from deportation under daca will lapse in   before the car leases are up   at that point  the social security number pena used on the leases will no longer be valid  moreover  massachusetts  where the  year old lives  will soon require proof of legal residency to obtain a driver s license  and pena worries what that will mean for her existing license   and for her car insurance  in ending the program  trump said he wants the republican controlled congress to enact a permanent  nationwide solution to stabilize the lives of so called dreamers such as pena  people brought to the united states illegally as children  but in the past  republicans and democrats in the deeply divided legislature have been unable to agree on the issue   the administration has promised an  orderly  end to daca  but program participants are finding it hard to get answers to their many questions about what exactly that means  although the program is federal  the fate of its nearly   participants will vary from state to state  with state  policies determining whether or not they will be able to continue studying  receive financial aid  or even drive legally  many states do not yet know themselves what the program s end will mean  more than a dozen state attorneys general and the university of california system are suing trump in an effort to reinstate the program   i think it s crazy because the government gave us chance to come out  they invited us to do that and now they are throwing us under the bus  it s bad for the economy   pena said   they are just putting us in the shadows again and we are not going to be able to grow   on tuesday night  hours after attorney general jeff sessions announced the end of daca  immigration attorney david leopold held a  minute facebook live session in which he was overwhelmed by more than  questions and comments from people nervous about their futures        what about those in college who don t pay or pay very little with daca   one questioner asked       i just received my approval  for a trip outside the country  another posted   should i travel        how should we address this with our employers   someone else asked      leopold had to explain that many of the questions would require individual legal counseling or just could not be answered yet  as individual states  as well as universities and businesses  have not yet had time to evaluate the situation  some issues that fall under the federal government will be uniform in each state  work authorization  for example  will be withdrawn for all  but on some matters  geography will count   at least  states  for example  allow for in state tuition rates for students living in the country illegally and a subset of those   california  minnesota  new mexico  oregon  texas and washington   allow undocumented students to receive state financial aid    three states   arizona  georgia and indiana   specifically prohibit in state tuition rates for students without legal status  and two states   alabama and south carolina   do not  let them enroll in any public postsecondary institution  according to the national conference of state legislatures    jin park  a  year old senior at harvard  has been in the united states since he was seven  when his south korean family overstayed their tourist visas  he will lose his protections in august        park is now reevaluating his plans  including applying for a prestigious rhodes scholarship  which would require him to study abroad  he fears he would not be let back into the united states after that   he is also worried about his long term goal of becoming a community doctor for the immigrant community in the new york city borough of queens where he grew up  park says he does not think he can do his final hospital training as a resident after medical school or be licensed as a physician if he no longer has a valid work permit    stuart heiser from the association of american medical colleges said he has not yet heard about any guidance group members are giving current or prospective medical students    it is very crucial question that is just up in the air   park said              for pena in massachusetts  meanwhile  some things seem clearer than others  recently  she received pre approval for a loan to buy a house  her goal was to find a fixer upper she and her husband would remodel  they have two u s  citizen children  but when her daca expires and with it her right to work legally  she does not believe a lender will take a chance on her    i am not even looking anymore   pena said   for a graphic on deferred action for childhood arrivals  click here
