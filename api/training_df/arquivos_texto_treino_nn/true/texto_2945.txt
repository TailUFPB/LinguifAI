washington new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration reversed a decision late on thursday and said fiancés would be considered close family members and therefore allowed to travel to the united states as its revised travel ban took effect  the u s  state department concluded  upon further review   fiancés would now be included as close family members   said a state department official who requested anonymity  the trump administration had previously decided  on the basis of its interpretation of a u s  supreme court ruling  that grandparents  grandchildren and fiancés traveling from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place  the  day ban took effect at  p m  edt   gmt friday   along with a  day ban on all refugees   on monday  the supreme court revived parts of trump s travel ban on people from the six muslim majority countries  narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a march  executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the united states  a spokesman for the department of homeland security  who also requested anonymity  said it would be updating its guidance to state that fiancés would not be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place  the supreme court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the united states  as an example  the court said those with a  close familial relationship  with someone in the united states would be covered   the state of hawaii asked a federal judge in honolulu on thursday evening to determine whether the trump administration had interpreted the court s decision too narrowly  hawaii said in a court filing that the u s  government intended to violate the supreme court s instructions by improperly excluding from the united states people who actually have a close family relationship to u s  persons  echoing criticism from immigrant and refugee groups   hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship  a plain violation of the supreme court s command    hawaii s attorney general doug chin asked u s  district judge derrick watson in honolulu  who blocked trump s travel ban in march  to issue an order  as soon as possible  clarifying how the supreme court s ruling should be interpreted  watson ordered the justice department to respond to hawaii s request by monday  and said he would allow hawaii to reply by july   a senior u s  official did not answer directly when asked how barring grandparents or grandchildren would make the united states safer  but instead pointed to trump s guidance to pause  certain travel while we review our security posture   the u s  government expected  things to run smoothly  and  business as usual  at u s  ports of entry  another senior u s  official told reporters  a handful of immigration lawyers gathered at dulles international airport outside washington on thursday in case of any problems   we re going to keep fighting this ban  even if it applies very narrowly   said sirine shebaya  a senior staff attorney at muslim advocates   it s still a muslim ban  and its still trying to send a message to a whole community that they re not welcome here   the administration said refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the united states would not be exempted from the ban  likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months  hawaii said in its court filing it was  preposterous  not to consider a formal link with a resettlement agency a qualifying relationship  refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would be refugees would qualify as  bona fide    the administration s decision likely means that few refugees beyond a   cap set by trump would be allowed into the country this year  a u s  official said that  as of wednesday evening    refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year  the state department said refugees scheduled to arrive through july  could still enter  trump first announced a temporary travel ban on jan    calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop  better security vetting  the order caused chaos at airports  as officials scrambled to enforce it before it was blocked by courts  opponents argued that the measure discriminated against muslims and that there was no security rationale for it  a revised version of the ban was also halted by courts  the state department guidance  distributed to all u s  diplomatic posts on wednesday evening and seen by reuters  fleshed out the supreme court s ruling about people who have a  bona fide  relationship with an individual or entity in the united states  it defined a close familial relationship as being a parent  spouse  child  adult son or daughter  son in law  daughter in law or sibling  including step siblings and other step family relations  a department cable said grandparents  grandchildren  aunts  uncles  nieces  nephews  cousins  brothers in law and sisters in law  fiancés   and any other  extended  family members  were not considered close family  the guidelines also said workers with offers of employment from a company in the united states or a lecturer addressing u s  audiences would be exempt from the ban  but that arrangements such as a hotel reservation would not be considered bona fide relationships
