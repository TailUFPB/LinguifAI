new york  reuters    three high ranking military officials from the obama administration on thursday joined several transgender service members in urging a u s  judge to halt president donald trump s ban on transgender people serving in the military  the former secretaries of the army  navy and air force   including former army secretary eric fanning  the first openly gay head of any u s  military service   submitted sworn statements to a washington  d c   federal court in support of a motion for an immediate injunction  the new filings came as part of a lawsuit challenging the ban  which trump first announced in a series of tweets earlier this month  the move would reverse former president barack obama s order that allowed transgender people to serve openly without fear of losing their jobs   the ban marks transgender service members as unequal and dispensable  stigmatizing them in the eyes of their fellow service members and depriving them of the unique honor and status associated with uniformed service to their country   the motion said  trump has said the ban would ensure unit cohesion and readiness  a white house spokeswoman did not immediately comment on thursday  in their statements  the former u s  military officials said the armed forces studied the issue extensively and concluded that allowing transgender people to serve would have no impact on the military s capabilities  they also echoed the plaintiffs  concern that transgender service members who relied on the obama era policy to disclose their status could now face discharge   dramatically reversing course and now using that information as a basis for separating these soldiers from their service is an unprecedented betrayal of the trust that is so essential to achieving the mission of all of the armed forces   fanning wrote  in a memorandum last week  trump directed the military not to accept transgender recruits and not to pay for sex reassignment surgeries for active personnel  white house officials have not made clear whether the directive would allow active transgender members to continue serving  u s  defense secretary jim mattis on tuesday said the obama administration s policy would remain in place until a panel of experts provided him with recommendations regarding trump s directive  after which he would offer his own advice to the president  the lawsuit s plaintiffs include five active service members  who filed anonymously  as well as a current naval student and a first year college student enrolled in the reserve officers  training corps  two other lawsuits challenging the ban were filed earlier this week by civil rights groups
