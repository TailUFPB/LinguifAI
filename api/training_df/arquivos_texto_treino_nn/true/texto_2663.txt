washington  reuters    republicans will consider using planned tax reform to eliminate one of the biggest taxes in obamacare  if the senate fails to overturn the healthcare law  a senior republican in the u s  house of representatives said on wednesday   kevin brady  the top republican on tax policy in the house as chairman of the ways and means committee  said republicans will look at the   percent net investment income tax in discussions aimed at unveiling a tax reform plan in september  the levy is a weight on economic growth  he said in an interview with reuters  efforts by republicans to overhaul or repeal the affordable care act  known as obamacare  collapsed in the senate on tuesday in a major setback for republican president donald trump  given a wholesale repeal or overhaul now seems imperiled  republicans are looking at other ways to attack a law they have vowed to overturn since it was signed by democratic former president barack obama seven years ago  brady said tax legislation was unlikely to be able to include the repeal of other obamacare taxes  doing so would result in about   trillion in additional revenue losses over a decade  cutting into efforts to avoid adding to the federal deficit in the overall tax package  he said    will we look at the net investment income tax provision  yes  mainly because it is incredibly anti growth the way it is today   brady said  but he was cautious about a full repeal of the tax  given the large revenues involved and the fact that some senate republicans resisted overturning it as part of the healthcare bill that was under consideration  the tax raises    billion in revenue over  years to fund obamacare  including health insurance subsidies for individuals   its repeal is viewed by critics  including some moderate republicans  as a tax cut for the wealthy since the tax hits individuals who earn more than    a year and married couples with more than    in earnings  brady said he was most concerned about the investment tax s effect on small businesses    it doesn t just affect high earners  it goes across a broad spectrum of small business and captures too much of their activity as well  so we will take a look at that   he said  however  he noted   you ve got to ask the question  if it couldn t pass the senate in healthcare  can it pass the senate in tax reform    but he added   leaving that in place  from an economic standpoint  is a mistake
