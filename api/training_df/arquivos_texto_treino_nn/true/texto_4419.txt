washington  reuters    the republican head of a congressional inquiry into alleged russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election said he would temporarily step aside from the probe on thursday because he is under investigation for disclosing classified information  devin nunes  chairman of the house of representatives permanent select committee on intelligence and an ally of republican president donald trump  characterized charges that he made unauthorized disclosures of classified information as  entirely false and politically motivated    several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the office of congressional ethics   he said in a statement  the surprise disclosure that nunes was under investigation injected new uncertainty into the wider russia probe by his committee  the investigation is one of several in congress examining whether russia tried to influence the election in trump s favor  mostly by hacking democratic operatives  emails and releasing embarrassing information  or possibly by colluding with trump associates  russia denies the allegations  which trump also dismisses  the house ethics committee issued a statement saying it would investigate allegations nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information  in violation of house rules  law  regulations  or other standards of conduct   nunes said in a statement he had decided to step aside from the russia investigation to fight the allegations and wanted  to expedite the dismissal of these false claims   he remains committee chairman  representative mike conaway  the second ranked republican on the intelligence committee  will now lead the probe  while he was a strong trump supporter last year  the seven term congressman was not a member of trump s transition team  unlike nunes   the intelligence panel s top democrat  representative adam schiff  said nunes  decision to step aside was made in  the best interests of the committee  and i respect that decision   schiff had called on nunes to recuse himself  conaway  who is also chairman of the house agriculture committee and a former house ethics chairman  is respected as an administrator and investigator   i have great admiration and respect for mr  conaway and look forward to continuing to work on that together   schiff told reporters  democrats  and some republicans  had said the house panel risked losing all credibility after nunes received information at the white house that information about trump aides had been swept up in routine surveillance  held a news conference and briefed trump on it   all before sharing it with other members of his committee   lawmakers said nunes  decision was welcome   we need to move on  we need to have an independent  credible investigation that makes progress   representative eric swalwell  a democratic committee member  said in an interview  trump praised nunes as  honorable   calling both him and conaway  high quality  people in comments to reporters traveling to florida on air force one  the ethics investigation stems from whether nunes disclosed classified information while publicly discussing the contents of foreign intelligence reports  jane harman  a former top house intelligence democrat who is now president of the wilson center think tank  said she hoped  the committee could  overcome the paralysis  gripping the investigation   most people recognize that the house as an institution needs to do serious oversight here and that the house is on trial   she said  house republican leaders  including speaker paul ryan  praised nunes   he s just making sure that as he works through this other  ethics  process and makes sure that people understand he didn t do anything wrong  he s fully cooperating  and i believe he will be cleared   representative cathy mcmorris rodgers  who leads the house republican conference  told reporters   but until that happens  it protects the integrity of the russia investigation   she said  trump sparked a controversy in march when he tweeted  without giving evidence  that obama had wiretapped him as he  competed with democrat hillary clinton in   two and a half weeks later  nunes held the news conference saying an unidentified source had shown him intelligence reports containing  unmasked  names of trump associates incidentally caught up in routine foreign surveillance  immediately afterward  critics said he had disclosed classified information in what many saw as an effort to provide cover to trump s wiretapping claim and distract from the wider russia investigation  a day after fbi director james comey confirmed at a hearing that his agency was investigating the matter  nunes said surveillance of trump associates appeared legal but expressed concern that americans  names may have been improperly revealed  that allegation kicked off an evolving  unsubstantiated controversy about whether the obama white house spied on the incoming trump administration  u s  foreign intelligence activities are classified  but the president can authorize the release of information about them  it is not clear whether trump authorized nunes to discuss the foreign surveillance
