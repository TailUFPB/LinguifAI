washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans narrowly agreed on tuesday to open debate on a bill to end obamacare  but the party s seven year effort to roll back democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law still faces significant hurdles  the senate deadlocked   on moving forward with the healthcare debate  forcing vice president mike pence to cast the tie breaking vote  senator john mccain  who was diagnosed this month with brain cancer and has been recovering from surgery at home in arizona  made a dramatic return to the u s  capitol to cast a crucial vote in favor of proceeding  the outcome was a huge relief for president donald trump  who had pushed his fellow republicans hard in recent days to live up to the party s campaign promises to repeal the  affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  minutes after the vote  trump called it  a big step   but the narrow victory on a simple procedural matter raised questions about whether republicans can muster the votes necessary to pass any of the various approaches to repeal  moderates are worried repeal will cost millions of low income americans their insurance and conservatives are angry the proposed bills do not go far enough to gut obamacare  which they consider government overreach  in a first vote of the many likely to come this week  the plan to repeal and replace obamacare that senate republicans have been working on for months failed to get the  votes needed for approval on tuesday night  the vote was  in favor and  against  nine republicans  ranging from moderates such as susan collins of maine to conservatives such as rand paul of kentucky  voted against the bill  which would have made deep cuts to medicaid  the health insurance program for the poor  and reduced obamacare subsidies to lower income people to help them defray the cost of health insurance  earlier mccain    received an ovation from his fellow senators when he entered the chamber to cast a vote to open debate  after that vote  he decried growing partisanship in the senate and urged members to learn how  to trust each other again   collins and senator lisa murkowski were the only republicans to oppose the measure to open debate  and with republicans controlling the senate by a   majority  those were the only votes the party leadership could afford to lose  democrats were united in opposition to the motion to proceed  republican senator ron johnson  who cast the last and deciding vote to open debate  engaged in a heated discussion with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell before casting his vote and ending the suspense  a loss on the vote to open debate on tuesday could have been a death blow for republican efforts to repeal obamacare and cast doubt on trump s prospects to achieve any of his other top legislative agenda items  including tax reform   we have a duty to act   mcconnell told senators before the vote  reminding republicans they had promised to repeal obamacare in four straight elections   we can t let this moment slip by   republicans have found it difficult to fulfill their campaign promises to repeal obamacare  which enabled  million more americans to get health insurance  polls show obamacare is now far more popular than the republican alternatives  the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated the senate s replacement bill could lead to as many as  million fewer americans being insured  the health industry has watched the debate nervously  and after the vote some groups urged the senate to reconsider its approach  america s essential hospitals  a group representing safety net hospitals  said in a statement it strongly opposed all the republican plans and feared the big cuts in medicaid in the bills  would jeopardize the health and financial security of millions of working people and families   shares in health insurer centene corp  cnc n  turned sharply lower after the senate vote  earlier on tuesday  the company had reported a better than expected profit as it benefits from a strong obamacare business      as the debate vote opened  more than two dozen protesters in the senate chamber chanted  kill the bill  before they were removed  senators said several approaches have been discussed  including a straight repeal of obamacare with no replacement plan  or repealing and replacing the law while also overhauling medicaid  senate republicans also could consider a shortened version of repeal  called a  skinny repeal   which would end the mandates in obamacare on individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance  and a medical device tax  a senate aide and a lobbyist said   some of us want clean repeal  some of us want the senate leadership bill  they re both going to get a vote early on and i think that s a fair way to do it   republican senator rand paul said   if either one of them fails and another one succeeds  maybe we can find something in between that actually succeeds   republican senator bob corker said the goal was to gain enough votes to get a bill through the senate and send it to the house of representatives  which passed its own bill to replace obamacare in may  for negotiations   everybody understands this is just a first step   he said  several of the democrats opposing the motion for debate were from conservative states that backed trump in  and face tough re election bids next year  including senators joe manchin of west virginia  heidi heitkamp of north dakota and jon tester of montana   we have a good chance to beat this   senate democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters after the vote  dick durbin  the no   senate democrat  praised collins and murkowski for taking a principled stand against the republican move to open debate   that wasn t easy   durbin said   that was an act of political courage on their part  i m sure they were under tremendous pressure
