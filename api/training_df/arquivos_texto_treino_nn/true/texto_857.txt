washington phnom penh  reuters    just days after the killing of a prominent cambodian government critic last year during a crackdown by the country s longtime leader  president barack obama dispatched washington s chief human rights envoy to phnom penh to attend the activist s funeral  in meetings with cambodian authorities  then assistant secretary of state tom malinowski warned the military not to intervene in the political turmoil or else crucial u s  ties would suffer  sending a clear message that america stood behind the opposition  it was one example of the kind of high level  rapid response u s  diplomacy that president donald trump has so far avoided in cambodia even as the southeast asian nation   together with many of its neighbors   has lurched increasingly away from the democratic path  as trump prepares to depart on his first asia tour  which will bring him face to face with a number of leaders with poor human rights records  his administration has been taking a more muted approach than his predecessor to such concerns  said current and former u s  officials  rights activists and diplomats  in addition to the situation in cambodia  they cite what they see as a slow  overly cautious response to myanmar s rohingya crisis  trump s failure to publicly call out autocratic leaders he meets over rights abuses  an eagerness to engage with the philippines  controversial president  rodrigo duterte  and a less vocal approach to human rights in china   national security adviser h r  mcmaster pushed back against the notion that trump would downplay human rights on his nov    trip  saying he would speak out  about the importance of promoting freedom and individual rights   when asked why trump condemns u s  adversaries such as syria and venezuela on human rights grounds but not the philippines  turkey and russia  mcmaster told reporters on thursday   how much does it help to yell about these problems  it hasn t really delivered in recent history anyway   the dominant view within trump s white house is that under his  america first  world view human rights concerns related to allies and strategically important countries should be managed gently to avoid impeding job creating business deals or undercutting security efforts such as isolating north korea  several trump aides said  soft pedaling human rights may also help washington avoid alienating countries in southeast asia that it wants to keep from moving further into china s orbit  those aides said   beijing puts little pressure on its neighbors over such issues  this approach  however  has sown frustration among some u s  diplomats who deal with human rights and disappointed dissidents in several countries  according to reuters interviews with more than a dozen people involved in these matters in washington and asian capitals  the failure so far to fill several senior asia and human rights posts at the state department is a further handicap  they say  obama s former top asia adviser  evan medeiros  is one of those critical of what he sees as the trump administration s lower key approach to human rights   it s a false dichotomy to say that somehow a focus on human rights detracts from american security or economic well being   he said  even under obama  however  there were some in the human rights community who at times found fault with u s  actions   while the nobel peace prize laureate was praised for stressing human rights in asia pacific trade negotiations  he faced criticism that he suspended sanctions on myanmar prematurely and lifted a ban on the sale of lethal arms to vietnam   he spoke eloquently and sometimes delivered   said john sifton  asia advocacy director for human rights watch   but he also didn t fully use the carrots and sticks of american power   though trump has said little on human rights beyond condemning adversaries such as north korea and venezuela  united nations envoy nikki haley has been one of the few top aides who have spoken out more broadly  she visited sub saharan africa and pressed leaders to tackle political and humanitarian problems  trump set the tone in saudi arabia in may when he told an audience that included monarchs and strongmen from the muslim world   we are not here to lecture   he has hosted several autocratic leaders   including thai prime minister prayuth chan ocha  who had been frozen out of white house visits since leading a  military coup   but has steered clear of publicly criticizing their records on human rights  such visits under obama usually included addressing rights concerns  the democratic president s former aides said  mcmaster insisted that trump preferred to deal with such issues  quietly in every relationship   one closely watched meeting will be with philippines president rodrigo duterte  trump praised him in a phone call in april for a bloody anti drugs campaign  an administration official told reporters human rights would be part of their  frank and friendly discussions   but the government in manila has been feeling less heat from the trump administration about extrajudicial killings linked to drugs crackdown  according to a foreign ministry official   it s a very different white house under president donald trump  not like under president barack obama  who pushed human rights hard during his term   the official told reuters   we are not hearing this from the white house     another issue expected to be front and center is myanmar s rohingya crisis  trump s critics  including democratic lawmakers  have chided the administration for what they have seen as a halting response  u s  officials have been reluctant to label the situation as  ethnic cleansing  even though the united nations has used the term  myanmar rejects that accusation  saying  action was needed to combat terrorism  two months after an outbreak of violence that sent more than half a million rohingya muslims fleeing into bangladesh  washington has now sent a senior delegation  announced a planned visit by tillerson on nov    and is threatening modest sanctions  when kem ley  a popular cambodian political commentator  was killed by a gunman in july   malinowski  the state department official  flew to phnom penh just days later and met top aides to prime minister hun sen  who has ruled for more than three decades  malinowski s stern words helped give local diplomats leverage to press rights concerns behind the scenes  said one u s  official involved in southeast asia diplomacy  this year hun sen has intensified his crackdown  including the arrest of opposition leader kem sokha  while also stepping up rhetoric against washington   the state department has largely limited its response to statements of  deep concern   cambodian government spokesman phay siphan said cambodia had not felt pressure from washington and trump was clearly taking a different approach than obama   their tone is lighter  before  they would bully   said ruling party parliamentarian sok eysan  the change under trump  he added   means we are on the right path towards democracy   an assertion that contradicts human rights advocates who say the political climate has deteriorated  in vietnam  dissident nguyen quang a expressed pessimism about trump s visit  nguyen  who was detained by authorities on his way to meet obama during a visit last year  said   i don t think trump will talk about human rights  just look at his words and actions   the white house has not signaled that trump plans to meet any dissidents during his asia trip  something obama frequently did in his foreign travels  there has been frustration among some u s  diplomats in beijing over perceptions that botched messaging from the united states signaled a retreat on human rights  but some u s  officials said that behind the scenes the administration has been supportive of work in china on behalf of chinese dissidents  a beijing based diplomat from another western country said  however  that u s  participation in meetings between western allies to coordinate strategy on human rights was much reduced  for example  when it came to putting out joint statements on issues of concern  china has been  relieved  to see trump giving human rights less weight  according to a chinese diplomat in washington  but foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said   as for human rights  we are always willing to have constructive dialogue with countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect
