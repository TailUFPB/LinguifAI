washington  reuters    the u s  senate on thursday delayed voting on a republican tax overhaul as the bill was tripped up by problems with an amendment sought by fiscal hawks to address a large expansion of the federal budget deficit projected to result from the measure  the senate debated the legislation late into thursday and adjourned  putting off any votes until friday morning  it was unclear if a decisive vote on the bill would occur then  the delay underscored nagging concerns among republican fiscal conservatives about the deficit impact of the bill  that set up the possibility that its deep tax cuts might have to be moderated  that future tax increases might be built in  and that some conservatives might seek to attach spending cuts  all approaches that could throw up new political problems  white house legislative affairs director marc short told reporters in the capitol   i don t think tax cuts are going to be scaled back  i think it would still be historic tax relief for corporations and for middle income families    the tax bill is seen by republicans as crucial to their prospects in the november  elections  when they will fight to keep control of the senate and the house of representatives  since taking office in january  president donald trump and  republicans now in control of congress have yet to pass major legislation  a fact they hope to change with their proposed tax  code overhaul  which would be the biggest since the   democrats  expected to unanimously oppose the tax bill  have dismissed it as a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations  republican senator bob corker and others had tried to add a provision to the bill to trigger automatic future tax increases if the tax cuts in the bill did not boost the economy and generate revenues sufficient to offset the deficit expansion  but the senate parliamentarian barred corker s  trigger  proposal on procedural grounds  the trigger amendment was needed to win corker s vote and those of others worried about the deficit   worries that intensified when congressional analysts said the bill would not boost the economy enough to offset the estimated deficit expansion  as the trump administration had said it would  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch told reporters in the capitol that it had not been easy to accommodate corker  senator jeff flake and other fiscal hawks   it s been pretty hard to make them happy so far  we re going to keep working on it     and we re going to do it   hatch said  senate republicans were considering making a proposed corporate income tax rate cut temporary  instead of permanent  so the rate would rise back to an unknown level after six or seven years  said one republican senator and an aide  by that time  trump might no longer be in office and a future congress might change the law  when asked if the tax bill was in trouble  republican senator mike rounds told reporters   no  i don t think so  it s just a matter of once again trying to make the bill work   optimism had reigned earlier in the day  when the bill won the backing of republican senator john mccain  stocks surged on hopes that a key tax overhaul vote was imminent  the s p  hit a record closing high and the dow jones industrial average topped the   mark for the first time  but the joint committee on taxation  or jct  a nonpartisan fiscal analysis unit of congress  said the bill as passed earlier by the senate finance committee  would generate only   billion in new tax revenue from increased economic growth  jct had earlier estimated the tax bill would balloon the   trillion national debt by    trillion over  years  the new estimate  counting  dynamic  economic effects  put the deficit expansion at   trillion  far short of assertions by some republicans that the tax cuts would pay for themselves  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said the new jct estimate showed  no amount of dynamic scoring fairy dust will fix the catastrophic deficits of the gop tax scam   mccain  a key player in july s collapse of a republican effort to gut obamacare  backed the tax bill  while  far from perfect   the party s  presidential nominee said it would boost the economy and help all americans  republican senator susan collins  who also played a role in the failure of the obamacare rollback  told reporters she was still not committed to the bill  several republicans were withholding support while pushing for including a federal deduction for up to    in state and local property taxes and bigger tax breaks for  pass through  companies  including small businesses  as drafted  the senate bill would cut the u s  corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent after a one year delay and reduce the tax burden on businesses and individuals  while ending many tax breaks  but would still expand the deficit  trump wants to enact tax cuts before january  the house approved its own tax bill on nov    it would have to be merged with the senate bill  if it is approved  before any final measure could go to trump for his signature   republicans have  votes in the  member senate  giving them enough to win if they hold together  with democrats opposed  republicans could lose no more than two of their own votes  with vice president mike pence able to break a   tie  trump has attacked corker and flake on twitter  both senators are not seeking re election  in early october  the president called corker   liddle  bob corker  in a tweet  corker tweeted that the trump white house was an  adult daycare center   days later  he called trump a liar who had damaged u s  standing in the world  trump tweeted back saying corker  couldn t get elected dog catcher   trump earlier this month tweeted that flake s political career was  toast   in a dramatic senate speech  flake said u s  politics had become inured to  reckless  outrageous and undignified  behavior from the white house
