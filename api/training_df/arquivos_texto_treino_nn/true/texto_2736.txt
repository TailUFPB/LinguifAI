washington  reuters    president donald trump turned up the heat on friday on fellow republicans in the u s  senate to pass a bill dismantling the obamacare law  but with their retooled healthcare plan drawing fire within the party even one more defection would doom it  majority leader mitch mcconnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation  unveiled on thursday  and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the   yes  votes needed for passage  republicans control the senate by a   margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united democratic opposition  but two republican senators already have declared opposition   after all of these years of suffering thru obamacare  republican senators must come through as they have promised   trump  who made gutting obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year  wrote on twitter from paris  where he attended bastille day celebrations  the top u s  doctors  group  the american medical association  on friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare  hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill   the revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of americans losing health insurance coverage   ama president dr  david barbe said  referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled  a major test for mcconnell s legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan congressional budget office  which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in  million americans losing  insurance over the next decade  a day after that cbo analysis was issued  mcconnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party  including moderates and hard line conservatives  while the bill s prospects may look precarious  the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the house of representatives  republican house speaker paul ryan called off a vote in march in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on may   vice president mike pence sought to shore up support among the nation s governors at a meeting in rhode island  but a key republican governor  ohio s john kasich  came out strongly against the revised bill  saying its medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market  kasich s opposition could put pressure on rob portman  a  republican senator from ohio  who has not yet taken a position on the bill  if the current senate legislation collapses  some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the affordable care act  democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement  commonly known as obamacare   there are changes that need to be made to the law   dick durbin  the no   senate democrat  told msnbc  citing  a bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue   moderate susan collins and conservative rand paul already oppose the revised senate bill  other republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal  including portman  mike lee  shelley moore capito  john mccain  dean heller  john hoeven  lisa murkowski  jeff flake  ben sasse  cory gardner  todd young and thom tillis  republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy floated an alternative plan  the new version was crafted to satisfy the republican party s various elements  including moderates worried about americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance  a provision championed by republican senator ted cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap  bare bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under obamacare  but two major health insurance groups  america s health insurance plans and the blue cross blue shield association  called on mcconnell to drop the cruz proposal  saying it would undermine protections for pre existing medical conditions  raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market  the bill retained certain obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated  a step moderates could embrace  but it kept the core of the earlier bill  including ending the expansion of medicaid that was instrumental in enabling obamacare to expand coverage to  million people  and restructuring that social safety net program  john thune  a member of the senate republican leadership  said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week  senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on tuesday or wednesday  a move that requires a majority vote
