washington  reuters    the trump administration publicly released on wednesday its rules for deciding whether to disclose cyber security flaws or keep them secret  in an effort to bring more transparency to a process that has long been cloaked in mystery  the move is an attempt by the u s  government to address criticism that it too often jeopardizes internet security by stockpiling the cyber vulnerabilities it detects in order to preserve its ability to launch its own attacks on computer systems  the revised rules  published on whitehouse gov  are intended to shed light on the process for how various federal agencies weigh the costs of keeping a flaw secret  said rob joyce  the white house cyber security coordinator  speaking at an aspen institute event in washington  joyce said the rules were the  most sophisticated  in the world and that they set the united states apart from most other nations   private companies  he said   are not getting tips from china  russia  north korea  iran  about flaws in their technology  under former president barack obama  the u s  government created an inter agency review  known as the vulnerabilities equities process  to determine what to do with flaws unearthed primarily by intelligence agencies such as the national security agency  nsa    the process is designed to balance law enforcement and u s  intelligence desires to hack into devices with the need to warn manufacturers so that they can patch holes before criminals and other hackers take advantage of them  the new trump administration charter on the process explains how it functions and names the agencies involved in the vulnerability reviews  they include intelligence agencies in addition to several civilian departments  including the departments of commerce  treasury  energy and state  the nsa is listed as the  executive secretariat  of the inter agency group  tasked with coordinating debate over flaws submitted by the various agencies if there is disagreement about whether to disclose them  if disagreements are not reconciled the group will vote on whether to disclose or retain the flaw  the rules also require an annual report  portions of which will be made public  that provides metrics about the amount of flaws discovered  retained and disclosed   decisions to retain vulnerabilities must be reconsidered every year  according to the charter     the publication of the charter is  a major improvement   said ari scwhartz  coordinator of the coalition for cybersecurity policy and law and a former obama administration cyber official  the obama administration sought to release a similar document before the end of last year but ran out of time  schwartz said  some security experts have long criticized the process as overly secretive and too often erring against disclosure   joyce said on wednesday more than  percent of flaws are ultimately disclosed  though some critics say they are not shared quickly enough and that the most severe flaws are too often stockpiled  the criticism grew earlier this year when a global ransomware attack known as wannacry infected computers in at least  countries  knocking hospitals offline and disrupting services at factories  the attack was made possible because of a flaw in microsoft s windows software that the nsa had used to build a hacking tool for its own use   but in a breach u s  investigators are still working to understand  that tool and others ended up in the hands of a mysterious group called the shadow brokers  which then published them online  suspected north korean hackers spotted the windows flaw and repurposed it to unleash the wannacry attack  according to cyber experts  north korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries  asked about the wannacry attack  joyce declined to say whether the windows flaw detected by the nsa went through the vulnerability review process
