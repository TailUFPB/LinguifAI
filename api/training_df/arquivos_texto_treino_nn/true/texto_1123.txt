washington  reuters    u s  senate democrats on thursday failed to pass a measure to block oil and gas drilling in part of the arctic national wildlife reserve  losing to republicans who believe production  there would provide jobs and wealth   an amendment blocking the development failed    mostly along party lines  a lone republican  senator susan collins of maine  supported the measure  the only democrat to vote against it was joe manchin from west virginia  conservationists and many democrats treasure the alaskan reserve  also known as anwr  as one of the planet s last paradises  established by congress in   it is home to tribes and a habitat for sensitive wildlife including caribou  polar bears and hundreds of species of migratory birds   republicans  who now control congress and the white house  have long wanted to open a portion of anwr called the  area  senator lisa murkowski  the chair of the senate energy committee and an alaskan republican  called the  portion a  non wilderness area  because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration  the u s  geological survey estimates the area on the prudhoe bay in northern alaska has up to  billion barrels of recoverable crude   a senate budget measure introduced this fall instructed murkowski s committee to raise   billion over  years  she hopes some of that money will come from energy company royalties after opening the  area to drilling  murkowski urged senators to see the  instruction as an opportunity to do something constructive  and focus on boosting energy output from federal lands that have long been off limit   the failed amendment  sponsored by senator maria cantwell the top democrat on the senate energy committee  would have eliminated the directive from the budget resolution seeking to raise funds  republicans led a  sneak attack  that turned  public lands over to polluters   cantwell said  senator jeff merkley  another democrat  has said there is  something cynical and sad  about the effort to open anwr because it would boost oil output from the state feeling the fastest effects of climate change  which a majority of scientists link to carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and development   the battle is not over  the house of representatives will next have to pass its version of a plan to raise revenues from the drilling  a final budget package would then be worked out by leaders from the two chambers   petroleum interests have long lobbied to explore in the area and say technology advances mean the impact of operations in the reserve would be small  murkowski said oil companies could use infrared cameras to detect and avoid polar bear dens while exploring for oil and gas  it is uncertain whether energy companies that have faced years of static crude prices  amid a wealth of oil in the continental united states would be willing to increase drilling in the harsh and frigid arctic   environmentalists vowed to keep up their fight   congress cannot sneak this through the back door when they think nobody is looking   said jamie williams  president of the wilderness society  anwr  is simply too fragile and special to drill  and we have a moral obligation to protect it for future generations of americans
