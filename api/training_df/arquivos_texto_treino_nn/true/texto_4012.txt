 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on thursday spurned the taiwanese president s suggestion that the two leaders hold another phone call  saying he did not want to create problems for chinese president xi jinping when beijing appears to be helping efforts to rein in north korea   in a white house interview  trump brushed aside the idea after taiwanese president tsai ing wen told reuters on thursday she would not rule out talking directly again to the u s  president  an act certain to incense china  the status of self ruled taiwan is possibly the most sensitive issue between washington and beijing    look  my problem is i have established a very good personal relationship with president xi  i really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation   trump told reuters  referring to signs that china may be working to head off any new missile or nuclear test by pyongyang  beijing s neighbor and ally    so i wouldn t want to be causing difficulty right now for him   trump added   i think he s doing an amazing job as a leader and i wouldn t want to do anything that comes in the way of that  so i would certainly want to speak to him first    reuters recommends racism on the rise  reuters poll how north korea gets its oil from china as president elect in early december  trump took a congratulatory phone call from tsai  it was the first contact between a leader of taiwan and an incumbent or incoming u s  president in nearly four decades  and trump cast doubt on washington s longstanding policy of acknowledging beijing s  one china  policy  which asserts that taiwan is a part of china   the call angered beijing because it fears contacts between taiwan and leaders of other countries would confer sovereignty on the island  democratic taiwan  self ruled since   has no interest in being ruled by autocratic china   trump agreed to honor the  one china  policy in february and then hosted xi at his florida resort earlier this month   trump s dismissal of tsai s suggestion underscored the importance he is placing on enlisting china s help in defusing tension with north korea  which has become his biggest national security challenge since taking office in january   days ago come saturday   on friday  in response to trump s remarks  taiwan s presidential office said it had no plans  at this stage  to hold a call  and that it understood the united states had priorities in handling regional affairs   in a statement  tsai s spokesman  alex huang  said the government would not  overly limit  itself  but would pursue the island s best interest   in beijing  chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang urged taiwan to pay attention to the united states  reaction    we consistently oppose countries which have diplomatic relations with china having any form of official exchanges with taiwan   geng told a daily news briefing on friday    this position is very clear and very firm    f  request  tsai told reuters on thursday taiwan s ties with the united states have been improving  she said taiwan may need to buy from its sole arms supplier the f  fighter jet  the most advanced stealth warplane in the u s  arsenal    we have the opportunity to communicate more directly with the u s  government   tsai said   we don t exclude the opportunity to call president trump himself  but it depends on the needs of the situation and the u s  government s consideration of regional affairs    tsai said   we don t rule out any items that would be meaningful to our defense and our defense strategy and the f  is one such item    but when told taiwan s president had said the island might want to buy f  aircraft  trump said   oh  i haven t been informed  i d have to think about that  i d have to speak to my people about that  they  the taiwanese government  do buy a lot of equipment from us    china s defence ministry said on thursday it was resolutely opposed to any country selling arms to taiwan   u s  officials told reuters last month that the trump administration was crafting a big arms package for taiwan that could include advanced rocket systems and anti ship missiles to defend against china  a deal sure to anger beijing   but one of the officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said at the time the administration was not considering selling the f  to taiwan   the package is expected to be significantly larger than one that was shelved at the end of the obama administration   valued at around   billion   but completion of a new deal could take months and possibly into next year  the official said   the global times  an influential chinese communist party backed tabloid  called tsai s government  a naughty child  in an editorial on friday and said it would  strongly counter  any move to sell taiwan advanced fighter jets    each time the tsai ing wen authorities step out of line they will pay the price  like a naughty child in class getting a stern reprimand for shouting out or smashing the glass at school   it said
