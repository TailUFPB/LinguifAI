 reuters    a federal judge has rejected senator robert menendez s request to allow breaks in his corruption trial beginning next wednesday so the new jersey democrat could travel to washington to cast critical senate votes  in a decision made public on friday  u s  district judge william walls in newark  new jersey  rejected menendez s claim that he deserved special treatment because he had a  constitutional duty  to be in washington for his constituents  walls said he suspected the request was part of a strategy to  impress the jurors  with menendez s importance  but that it was speculative to suggest the senator would miss key votes   the court will not serve as concierge to any party or lawyer   walls wrote   the motion   from a practical perspective   is nigh frivolous   abbe lowell  a lawyer for menendez  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the senator s press secretary had no immediate comment  menendez    is charged with accepting improper campaign donations and gifts  including luxury trips and private jet flights  from co defendant salomon melgen in exchange for lobbying on the wealthy florida ophthalmologist s behalf  both men have pleaded not guilty to fraud and bribery  menendez is running for a third senate term next year  the senator had sought permission to pause the expected six  to eight week trial for such votes as raising the federal debt ceiling  rewriting the tax code  and renewing the national flood insurance program  for people like victims of hurricane harvey  but the judge said menendez deserved  no more and no less deference than any other defendant   and that college professors  construction workers  and even orthopedic surgeons needed in the operating room would not be excused  walls also said requiring him to decide when to stop the trial for key votes would force him to make  explicitly political determinations  and improperly thrust him into the legislative process   there is no possibility that the defendant will be subjected to a facially unconstitutional trial   walls wrote   he merely faces the reality  clearly contemplated by the founders  that criminal prosecution may interrupt congressional duties   if menendez were convicted and forced from the senate  while new jersey governor chris christie was still in office  the republican could appoint a replacement and add to the gop s thin senate majority  christie s term ends on jan      the case is u s  v  menendez et al  u s  district court  district of new jersey  no   cr
