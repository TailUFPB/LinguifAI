washington  reuters    president donald trump unveiled a one page plan on wednesday proposing deep u s  tax cuts  many for businesses  that would make the federal deficit balloon if enacted  drawing a cautious welcome from fiscal conservatives and financial markets  while the proposed tax cuts would please those helped by them  such as multinational corporations and wealthy taxpayers  trump s package fell far short of the kind of comprehensive tax reform that both parties in washington have sought for years  as his milestone  day in office on saturday nears  trump has been scrambling to show progress on his agenda  the tax plan  though meager in detail  matched up closely with the promises he made during his victorious  election campaign  investors  who had been awaiting tax plan details for months  largely shrugged off the news  with many saying it was still short on specifics and faced a long road to enactment   wake me up when something actually gets signed into law    said greg mcbride  chief financial analyst at bankrate com in west palm beach  florida  only congress can make major tax law changes  and democrats immediately attacked the republican president s plan as fiscally irresponsible   president trump s tax plan is short on details and long on giveaways to big corporations and billionaires   said nancy pelosi  the top democrat in the house of representatives  house speaker paul ryan  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and the top republicans on the congressional tax writing committees welcomed the trump proposals  while leaving space for details to change as legislation evolves   the principles outlined by the trump administration today will serve as critical guideposts  as congress and the administration work on tax changes  they said in a statement  u s  stocks pared gains on wednesday after the plan was unveiled  while wall street has been optimistic about the prospect of corporate tax cuts since trump s election in november  the stocks rally has stalled lately because of a lack of clarity about trump s policies and concern over his failure to push through a healthcare bill   the benchmark dow jones industrial average of blue chip stocks  dji on wednesday closed down one tenth of  percent  some analysts said investors were aware of the long road ahead before any tax bill is passed   we have a pretty good idea that he  trump  is targeting lower corporate taxes  lower individual taxes and a simplification of the process  but all that is in an ideal world   said andre bakhos  managing director at janlyn capital in bernardsville  new jersey  in the plan  unveiled at the white house by trump economic adviser gary cohn and treasury secretary steve mnuchin  trump proposed cutting to  percent both the income tax rate paid by public corporations and that paid by  pass through  businesses  including partnerships  s corporations and sole proprietorships  the top corporate rate is now  percent  though few multinational companies pay it  thanks to loopholes that allow them to lower their effective tax rates  despite this  corporations have pushed for a tax rate cut for many years  and trump has obliged   the top rate for pass throughs  which account for most small businesses  is   percent  the same top rate paid by individuals  unlike corporations  the profits of  pass through  businesses flow directly onto their owners  tax returns  in another concession to long standing demands from corporate america  trump called for bringing corporate profits being held offshore by multinationals into the country at a rate well below the current  percent rate now owed on  repatriated  earnings  he did not say what that rate would be  but said the administration was working with congress on a low rate  about    trillion in profits are being held tax exempt abroad by u s  multinationals under a rule that says they are only taxable if brought into the united states  if enacted  the repatriation tax holiday would produce a one time surge in government revenue  if it were dedicated to infrastructure spending  it could attract votes from democrats  the plan also urged adoption of a  territorial  corporate tax system that would largely exempt foreign profits of u s  based corporations from federal taxation  ryan expressed optimism about trump s plan  even though it excluded a  border adjustment  tax on imports he has promoted  that idea was part of initiatives floated by house republicans as a way to offset revenue losses resulting from steep tax cuts  for average u s  taxpayers  trump proposed help by doubling the standard deductions for individuals who do not itemize  simplifying tax returns by reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven  and providing unspecified tax relief for families with child and dependent care expenses  he also called for repealing inheritance taxes on estates and the alternative minimum tax  both measures that would help a handful of wealthy taxpayers  trump s laundry list of tax cuts would reduce revenues for the u s  government  which is already running a deficit and deeply in debt  he offered few proposals to offset those losses  democrats and fiscal hawk republicans will be concerned about how much trump s proposals would expand the deficit  to minimize that  republicans will rely heavily on  dynamic scoring   an economic modeling method that attempts to predict economic growth and new tax revenues resulting from tax cuts  mnuchin said the revenue losses would also be offset by killing many tax loopholes  he said at a briefing that trump s plan would kill most tax deductions  except those for charitable giving  retirement savings and mortgage interest  cohn said at the briefing that one deduction on trump s chopping block is for state and local tax payments  which is estimated to cost the u s  treasury   billion this year  ending it would raise about that much in revenue  such a move would hurt high tax states  which tend to vote democratic  such as new york and california  where the state and local tax deduction is a major item  said some tax analysts  like all of trump s proposals  this one would face intense scrutiny in congress    the no   democrat in the senate  dick durbin  attacked the tax proposal and the fact trump  a wealthy new york real estate developer  had declined to make public his personal tax returns   president trump should release his own tax returns if he wants to have any credibility in a debate about america s tax code   durbin said  mnuchin said on wednesday that trump did not intend to release his tax returns
