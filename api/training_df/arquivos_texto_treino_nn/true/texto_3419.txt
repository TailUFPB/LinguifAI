washington  reuters    robert mueller  the special counsel investigating possible ties between the trump election campaign and russia  is expanding his probe to assume control of a grand jury investigation into former national security adviser michael flynn  three sources told reuters  the move means mueller s politically charged inquiry will now look into flynn s paid work as a lobbyist for a turkish businessman in   in addition to contacts between russian officials and flynn and other trump associates during and after the nov   presidential election       federal prosecutors in virginia are investigating a deal between flynn and turkish businessman ekim alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe  according to a subpoena seen by reuters   alptekin s company  netherlands based inovo bv  paid flynn s consultancy    between september and november to produce a documentary and research on fethullah gulen  an exiled turkish cleric living in the united states  turkish president tayyip erdogan blames gulen for a failed coup last july   alptekin  an ally of erdogan  told reuters he hired flynn to provide research on how gulen is  poisoning the atmosphere  between turkey and the united states  gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses turkey s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization  the grand jury in virginia has issued subpoenas to some of flynn s business associates involved in the work for inovo  two people familiar with the probe say  the subpoena seen by reuters seeks bank records  documents and communications related to flynn  his company  flynn intel group  alptekin and inovo  flynn s lawyer  robert kelner  did not respond to questions about flynn s work for inovo or mueller s investigation  a spokesman for mueller declined to comment  alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed   mueller s move to take over the virginia grand jury s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel  reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened  but its existence has been previously reported  until now the investigation has been led by brandon van grack  an espionage prosecutor in the justice department  and federal prosecutors from the eastern district of virginia  it is not clear whether van grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so  deputy u s  attorney general rod rosenstein appointed mueller  a former fbi director  on may  to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between russia and individuals associated with the trump campaign  rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue  any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation   some members of congress have asked the justice department to define the scope of mueller s inquiry  mueller s appointment followed an uproar over trump s firing of fbi director james comey  who had been investigating alleged russian meddling in the  election  democrats and some of the president s fellow republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether russia tried to sway the outcome of november s election in favor of trump and against democrat hillary clinton  trump  who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and russia  has decried the investigation as a  witch hunt   one of trump s most trusted aides during the election campaign  flynn had a long career in the military  he set up the flynn intel group  an alexandria  virginia based intelligence consultancy  after president barack obama dismissed him as head of the military s defense intelligence agency in   mueller  who takes over leadership of an fbi investigation that began last july  can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses  trump fired flynn in february after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with russian ambassador sergei kislyak in december  just after the obama administration imposed new sanctions on russia for what u s  intelligence agencies had concluded was a kremlin led effort through computer hacking  fake news and propaganda to boost trump s chances of winning the white house   flynn s work for inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on election day calling gulen a  radical islamist  who should be extradited to turkey  along with the editorial  the flynn intel group also produced a  page report on gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made  according to three people familiar with the project  alptekin  who is chairman of the turkey u s  business council  told reuters he was satisfied with flynn s research because it had helped him understand how gulen s network operates in the united states  he said the    payment to flynn s firm came  mostly  from his personal funds  the rest came from inovo s corporate revenues  alptekin said      on nov    the day after flynn was appointed trump s national security adviser  trump transition team lawyer william mcginley raised concerns on a call with the flynn intel group and others involved in the inovo project over who had paid for  flynn s commentary  according to two people with knowledge of the conversation  flynn did not participate in that call  they said      at the time of the call  flynn had not disclosed that his work for alptekin meant he was being paid to represent turkish interests during the election campaign  flynn intel group had said in a september  filing that it was lobbying for inovo but did not disclose its turkish links  in march  flynn retroactively registered under the foreign agents registration act  in a letter accompanying the march filing  flynn s lawyer  kelner  said the disclosure was being made because flynn s work for inovo  could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of turkey   which he noted was seeking to extradite gulen      the house of representatives intelligence committee  which is also investigating  russian interference in the election  subpoenaed records from flynn on wednesday  the senate s intelligence committee  which has a separate probe under way  has also served subpoenas on flynn and two of his businesses  and earlier this week flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials
