washington  reuters    president donald trump and congressional republicans  fresh from their failed push to repeal obamacare  are now tackling a project that has eluded washington for  years   tax reform  tax staffers are meeting in the house of representatives and the senate through the august break to work on legislation that is expected to be unveiled next month  some analysts are skeptical that the fractious republicans are up to comprehensive tax reform  even though the party controls both chambers  and say republican may have to settle for a handful of tax cuts  here are some of the key tax issues ahead  americans pay a top individual tax rate of   percent  trump wants to cut that top rate to  percent  house republican leaders have proposed cutting it to  percent  in proposals to simplify taxes  trump wants to shrink the number of tax brackets to three from seven and double the standard deduction  a set level of income exempt from tax  the latter move  analysts say  would sharply reduce the number of taxpayers who can claim certain narrower deductions  such as the ones for mortgage interest and charitable donations  trump has also promised  without providing much detail  more help for families with child and dependent care expenses and to eliminate targeted tax breaks that benefit wealthy people  in two proposals that would help mainly high income and wealthy taxpayers  trump and congressional republicans want to repeal the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax  the estate tax  which republicans call the  death tax   is a tax on the assets left to heirs by people when they die  it is paid by very few americans because it currently applies only to inheritances exceeding    million per person  the alternative minimum tax is a way to make sure that mostly high earners who have many deductions pay some taxes  an effort by trump and congressional republicans to repeal former president barack obama s affordable care act and the taxes that support it failed in july  those taxes  including a   percent surtax on investment income and a   percent payroll tax to support the medicare healthcare program for the elderly  remain on the books for now   americans can deduct taxes paid to state and local governments from their federal tax bills  trump and house republican leaders want to end this  the proposal would most hurt states where democrats dominate because those states tend to charge higher state and local taxes and provide more government services  with the result that their residents take larger federal deductions  but the proposal is opposed by at least  house republicans  reducing its chances of enactment  tax deductions for interest paid on mortgages and donations to charities are probably safe  trump has promised to protect them  yet  there has been discussion of lowering the cap on the mortgage interest deduction to    from   million  analysts say that would generate enough revenue to cut the corporate tax rate by three percentage points  but such a move would pit upper middle class and wealthy homeowners against multinational corporations    lobbyists for real estate businesses and philanthropies say  that  if the standard deduction doubled  fewer taxpayers would be able to claim the mortgage interest and charitable giving deductions  that could undermine home buying and donations to philanthropies  they say  corporations pay  percent of their profits in taxes  at least on paper  trump wants to slash that to  percent  house republicans want  percent  some lawmakers say  percent might be achievable  no consensus on the rate has been reached  pass through businesses trump wants a special  low tax rate for  pass through  businesses  which are private companies that pass their profits through to owners as income that is taxed at the individual rate  most u s  businesses are pass throughs and range from family run shops to large businesses  the idea of a special tax rate for them raises the prospect of a new wave of tax avoidance schemes with wage earners funneling income into  pass through  structures  under republicans  plans  about    trillion in corporate profits now parked abroad would be repatriated  or brought into the united states  and taxed at   percent to   percent payable over eight years  that rate would be way below the  percent tax that is owed now on those profits  but that is payable only if they enter the country  republicans also want to change the corporate income tax so companies are no longer taxed on foreign profits by adopting a so called  territorial  system  replacing the  worldwide  system in which u s  companies are taxed on profits globally  the u s  tax code allows corporations to defer tax payments on foreign profits held overseas  corporations have been stockpiling profits abroad to avoid paying the  percent u s  corporate rate  which under current law they would owe when the money is returned to u s  soil  a house republican  border adjustment  tax proposal meant to discourage imports and encourage exports has been dropped  tax cuts generally reduce federal revenue and raise the budget deficit  the deficit is estimated in fiscal  to hit   billion  or   percent of u s  gross domestic product  gdp   up from   percent in   with that in mind  republican deficit hawks could make it hard for trump to push through any deficit expanding tax measures  some republicans want congress s nonpartisan  professional tax and budget analysts to make more use of  dynamic scoring  in estimating the impact of tax changes on the budget  the approach tends to assume an increased economic stimulus effect from tax cuts  resulting in smaller projected increases to the deficit
