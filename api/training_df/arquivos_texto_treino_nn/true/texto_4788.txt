garner  iowa mexico city  reuters    farmers in the u s  agricultural heartland that helped elect donald trump are now pushing his administration to avoid a trade dispute with mexico  fearing retaliatory tariffs that could hit over   billion in u s  exports  the value of exports at risk is based on a reuters analysis of a tariff list which mexico used in a trucking dispute six years ago and which mexican officials have said could serve as a model if president trump sets new barriers to mexican goods       pork producers contacted trump s transition team soon after the nov   election to stress that tariff free access to mexico has made it their top export market by volume  said john weber  president of the national pork producers council  the council has sent the administration multiple letters  including one signed in january by  agricultural organizations  and is arranging for several hog farmers to fly to washington next month to talk to officials   we just keep pounding them on how critical trade is to us   said weber  who fears mexico could revive the list of mostly agricultural products it successfully used to push washington into letting mexican truckers on u s  highways in    pork products topped that list and  if revived  the tariffs would apply to over   million of annual pork exports  according to data compiled by ihs markit s global trade atlas   we ll be the first to take the hit   weber said   the lobbying effort by u s  businesses which rely on the mexican market shows how mexico can press its case in washington despite having an economy   the size of america s and relying on the u s  market for nearly  percent if its exports  in iowa  where pigs outnumber people seven to one  hog and grain farmer jamie schmidt voted for trump in part on his promise to cut regulatory burdens for businesses  now he and others who farm the flat  rich land around garner  iowa  worry about trade  schmidt gets about half of his income from hogs  earning    for each of the  pigs he sells per week  usually to a tyson foods  tsn n  packing plant in nearby perry  iowa   tariffs from mexico could depress u s  wholesale prices and wipe out his profits  schmidt said   it would be devastating    in december  after fears of a trade dispute fueled a deep peso mxn  slump  mexico started mapping out u s  states that are most reliant on its market  replicating the strategy it used in the trucking dispute  said two senior mexican officials  mexican officials also prepared briefs  seen by reuters  on mexico s own risks in a dispute  including losing much of its cost advantage in building cars  such as the ford fusion  f n  made in hermosillo  mexico   reuters could not verify a complete list of products and states mexico considered targeting this time around  but the country s foreign minister said last month tariffs could target iowa  which raises a third of u s  hogs and exports about a quarter of its pork production    million of which went to mexico last year  the minister also said tariffs could aim at wisconsin  the center of u s  cheese production  and has singled out texas for its  notable  trade surplus with mexico  all three states voted for trump in the  election  with the president taking iowa and wisconsin by slim margins  trump has accused mexico of destroying u s  jobs and has vowed to leave the  north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico if he cannot renegotiate better terms with mexico  united states went from running a small trade surplus with mexico in the early  to a   billion deficit in   besides pork  cheese was also a top target in the trucking dispute in which mexico retaliated with tariffs against rules that banned its trucks from u s  roads  some   million in current annual exports of cheese would be targeted if the tariff list were revived  according to the ihs database  which the u s  government uses to measure the impact of trade disputes  the full tariff list would apply to    billion in current u s  exports  john holevoet  the director of government affairs at wisconsin s dairy business association  said he has attended multiple meetings with wisconsin federal lawmakers this year where risks of mexican trade were discussed  weber of the pork producers group said he believed the trump administration  gets it  when it comes to the vulnerability of u s  farm exports  republican congressman steve king  who represents iowa s agriculture focused fourth district  also pointed out that iowa s role as the first state to hold presidential primaries helps keep farm interests in washington s view  but king told reuters he was worried the white house is still not taking trade risks seriously enough   a possible  percent tax on mexican imports  which white house spokesman sean spicer has said could also pay for trump s proposed border wall  would cause a trade war  he said  king said he has been in contact with the white house on the matter but has yet to secure a one on one meeting with the president   i m making sure that here in washington they know what this means
