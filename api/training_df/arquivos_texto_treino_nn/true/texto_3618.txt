new york  reuters    the trump administration is proposing to sell off in the coming fiscal year the entire gasoline reserve created in the aftermath of hurricane sandy  according to its budget proposal unveiled on tuesday  the u s  northeast gasoline supply reserve  ngsr  was established in  to minimize the impact of sudden supply interruptions  such as occurred in  during sandy  the second costliest hurricane in the country s history  the gasoline reserve was established as part of the strategic petroleum reserve  spr   it consists of  million barrels of gasoline blendstock and is stored in commercial storage terminals in maine  massachusetts and new jersey    the ngsr has not been utilized and does not have the operational functionality that was envisioned post sandy   the budget proposal said  it noted that the ngsr s leased commercial storage contracts expire in the early part of fiscal   a sale would offset   million of discretionary spending  with any additional proceeds going to the u s  treasury s general fund for deficit reduction  the proposal says   sandy battered the northeastern u s  coast at the end of october   destroying homes and buildings  closing refineries and disrupting gasoline supplies  the u s  east coast accounts for over a third of national gasoline consumption   the gasoline market is not likely to be affected significantly if the budget proposal is approved in its current form by congress  said robert campbell  head of oil products markets at consultancy energy aspects  but it would leave the region at risk if another disaster struck   nothing has changed very much  since      if we were to get in a situation where we once again have refinery closures on the east coast  it would be a much more vulnerable market   he said  the budget proposal for the fiscal year starting oct   also calls for selling half of the  million barrels of oil in the spr  the nation s emergency crude stockpile  that would represent about  days of u s  oil imports of oil but only about three days worth of global production   in some ways it seems more logical now to have a gasoline reserve than a separate crude reserve   said david thompson  executive vice president at energy specialized commodities broker powerhouse in washington   there is a time component involved in making and distributing gasoline  so if the northeast refineries or the colonial  pipeline  were affected by a major incident  it would take time to develop an alternative supply chain   he said  traders also said the gasoline reserve had been created so recently that its liquidation was unlikely to be approved by lawmakers quickly   under the trump budget proposal  the existing northeast home heating oil reserve of  million barrels would continue to operate
