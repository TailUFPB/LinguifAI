lowellville  ohio  reuters    on a sweltering evening in a rural corner of ohio  the struggle for the soul and identity of the democratic party is playing out over wine  meatballs and recriminations about hillary clinton s defeat in last year s presidential election  joe schiavoni  the former top democrat in the ohio state senate  is talking to a crowd at a fundraising event for his fledgling bid to become their next governor  he believes leaders of his party in washington have lost touch with voters  it s a familiar refrain among democrats in a state that helped catapult republican donald trump into the white house in november   you can t just talk about things and send out press releases   says schiavoni  a former boxer who revels in his blue collar roots  many in the crowd  a few miles from the rust belt city of youngstown  nod in vigorous agreement  meeting voters and hearing their daily concerns is vital  he says  in ohio  as in other politically competitive  swing  states that democrats won in  but lost in   democrats are struggling to come up with a clear message and identity to win back the voters they lost  listening to voters is the key to moving forward  some three dozen democratic party members across ohio said in interviews  but there was little consensus on how to win over those voters  many of those interviewed said the party s national leaders have not learned the lessons of last year s defeat  when many voters rejected the party as too elitist and out of touch with working americans   david pepper  chairman of the state party  dismissed that criticism in an interview  saying he and his team have been traveling around ohio  talking to voters and visiting their homes  they have been especially focused on two groups  the people who voted twice for president barack obama and then trump  and democratic voters who sat out the last election  democrats across america  as in ohio  are desperate to win again as they look ahead to next year s congressional elections  the stakes are high  without a significant shift in voting patterns  the party will fail to recapture the house of representatives and could lose more seats in the senate  where they are already in the minority  on monday  the national democratic party unveiled an economic platform they said would help u s  families  called  a better deal   it was the first major step by the party to try to reconnect with voters since the election  the plan called for creating  million jobs over five years and cracking down on monopolies and big corporate mergers   but the plan was missing a vital piece   said alan melamed  a longstanding member of the ohio democratic party s executive committee and a political consultant who has worked on dozens of campaigns for more than  years   we need to show we are fighting for people  the plan failed to do that   since clinton s defeat in november  tom perez  the head of the democratic national committee   the body which runs the national party   has conducted a nationwide  listening tour  to hear why so many traditionally democratic voters defected to trump last year  yet when he came to ohio  some democrats said  he didn t do much listening   just a lot of talking  in june  the listening tour came to youngstown  about  party stalwarts paid   each to attend a  pizza with perez  event at a local pizzeria   what i saw was a typical campaign event  with the audience doing the listening while democratic operatives touted their positions   said john russo  the former co director of the center for working class studies at youngstown university and a political analyst   we paid   to be told by perez what he thought we were thinking   michael tyler  a spokesman for perez  disputed that account  saying perez had done a lot of listening at the event   too many in ohio and elsewhere feel politically homeless because for too long the national party focused solely on electing the president of the united states at the expense of local concerns   tyler said   that s exactly why ohio was among the first places tom visited when he decided to run for dnc chair   one of the national politicians unveiling  a better deal  in the town of berryville  virginia at the northern end of the shenandoah valley  was nancy pelosi  the top democrat in the u s  house of representatives  mention pelosi to democrats in ohio and many roll their eyes  a california liberal  pelosi is part of the problem  not the solution  they said in interviews  they view pelosi as part of a coastal elite that does not understand the struggles of americans in the midwest   christopher celeste  the son of former ohio governor dick celeste and a major democratic party donor at both the state and national level  said the retention of pelosi as a party leader earlier this year was  mindboggling   drew hammill  a spokesman for pelosi  said the democratic leader has raised almost   million for democrats since becoming part of the party leadership in   and was a master legislator and strategist   while some may find it politically advantageous to engage in a circular firing squad  leader pelosi isn t in congress on a shift  she s on a mission to protect the affordable care act   said hammill  referring to obama s healthcare reform law which trump wants to repeal  joyce beatty  a congresswoman from central ohio  also defended pelosi   to just blame nancy pelosi is not only wrong  but it s wrong for democrats to do it  if there has been a failure we all need to own it   angered by last year s defeats up and down the ballot in ohio  a group of political consultants circulated a memo to every member of the state party s executive committee in december  the memo  which has not been previously reported  lambastes the party leadership for the  electoral carnage  of    read the memo here tmsnrt rs   clinton lost ohio  a key battleground  by over eight points  only one democratic presidential candidate in the past  years   walter mondale in    won fewer counties in ohio than clinton  ohio democrats also lost the u s  senate race  both democratic nominees for the ohio supreme court were defeated  and state races were lost  ohio s democratic congressional delegation in washington is at its lowest in decades and republicans control the governor s mansion and both the state house and senate   the status quo cannot stand   the memo says  it calls for   new messages   and more effective strategies for delivering them   the memo does not make clear what those messages should be  a source close to the state party leadership dismissed the memo as sniping by disgruntled consultants  pepper  the ohio party leader  does not want to relitigate the past   we need to go and talk to voters and win them back   he said
