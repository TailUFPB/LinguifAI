washington new york  reuters    president donald trump brushed off the first indictments in the probe of his campaign s ties to russian election meddling  but the charges sent a clear signal to the white house and other trump associates  robert mueller means business  by going after trump s campaign manager and another aide on money laundering charges and securing a guilty plea from a third campaign adviser  the special prosecutor showed he would delve deeply into the past in search of criminal activity and use his broad powers aggressively  that left some trump associates worried about what or whom mueller would target next  despite the white house s public dismissal of the developments as unrelated to the president and his campaign   they re flexing their muscles for anybody that they approach in this investigation and letting them know we really mean it   said former federal prosecutor patrick cotter   so if we come to you  you should talk to us  manafort didn t and look what happened to him   manafort and rick gates are charged with money laundering  tax fraud  conspiracy to defraud the united states  and other counts  they pleaded not guilty on monday  the indictments  which closely detail the alleged crimes  appeared to be an opening salvo from mueller  he was appointed by u s  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in may after trump fired fbi director james comey  who had led an investigation into whether the trump campaign colluded with russia to influence the  election  mueller was given a mandate to probe potential collusion and  any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation   trump has denied any collusion with russia and at times described the investigation as a  hoax  and a  witch hunt       russia has denied interfering with the  election  with the first indictments on monday  mueller showed he was not afraid to use his powers  and trump officials noticed   one thing i m worried about in a bigger scale is that rosenstein  by giving mueller this wide berth  has created this monster   said one former white house official  who spoke on condition of anonymity   a former trump campaign adviser fretted that the probe could  as a result  touch on trump s businesses  too   in a new york times interview in july  trump indicated that mueller would be crossing a red line if he investigated trump s family business      legal experts said mueller would not be swayed by trump s view of the proper scope of the investigation   i don t think prosecutors concern themselves with what politicians say about red lines being drawn   said former federal prosecutor robert capers  jens david ohlin  a professor of criminal law at cornell law school  said mueller could be targeting alleged financial crimes by manafort and gates to gain their cooperation and uncover wrongdoing elsewhere  a number of lawyers said the guilty plea of george papadopoulos  announced by mueller s team on monday  could ultimately provide a closer link to the campaign and pressure others to open up  while the charges against manafort and gates were not related to their campaign work  papadopoulos admitted he lied to the federal bureau of investigation about his contacts with foreign nationals he believed to be tied to the russian government while he was a campaign adviser  prosecutors said they arrested papadopoulos in july and that he was cooperating with the government    god knows what this guy s going to say now   said the former trump campaign adviser   since he s cooperating  he could set any perjury traps up for others   cotter said mueller s unveiling of papadopoulos  guilty plea  was to head off any arguments that the case against manafort and gates is not about russia    frank montoya  a former senior fbi agent  said manafort s indictment and papadopoulos  plea indicated mueller was not going to bow to white house pressure and would keep pushing hard to uncover wrongdoing   it is pretty much a road map   we are going to be looking at the money laundering  we are going to be looking at the failure to report income  we are going to be looking at the general criminal conspiracies  this is also about trump s red line   we are going to cross it  and we are going to keep looking at the so called collusion  or the coordination with the russians to undermine democracy   montoya said
