washington  reuters    president donald trump s proposals to slash federal aid to the poor  the sick and people living in rural areas reflect conservatives  demands for a smaller federal government but target many of the very people who voted for him last november  in his first detailed budget submission to congress on tuesday  trump requested major reductions to programs that help poor families afford groceries and poor and disabled people get healthcare   job training for unemployed coal miners would be threatened and drug treatment programs would face cuts at a time when heroin and prescription pill addictions are tearing at rural america  subsidies for commercial air travel in rural areas would be cut by more than half  the white house said many of the proposed cuts were aimed at ineffective programs and that the savings were needed to help balance the budget in  years and finance increased spending for defense and other programs  some republicans in congress cheered trump s budget  representative mark meadows  who heads the house of representatives  hard right freedom caucus  called it  a great step forward  for conservatives  adding   it s all about economic growth    but many other republican lawmakers  seeing a budget they think will be tough to sell back home  greeted it warily   these cuts that are being proposed are draconian  they re not mere savings  they re really deep  deep cuts   said republican representative hal rogers  whose eastern kentucky  district relies heavily on federal aid  trump trounced democrat hillary clinton in the  election in kentucky   percent to  percent  winning every region except the urban louisville and lexington areas  rogers  a  year congressman  said the republican president remained popular in his district  but added   we have not yet had a chance to see how  voters  will react to his budget proposals   it is unclear if the republican controlled house and senate will be able to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting on oct    democratic votes would also likely be needed to pass the fiscal  spending bills needed to carry out budget priorities  but the proposed reductions could trigger a backlash for republicans  complicating efforts to keep control of the u s  congress in the  midterm elections  trump s own base of political support also could be undermined  republican representative tom cole  who represents an oklahoma district that the almanac of american politics described as  countrified   predicted  congress would look at some of those things differently  from the trump administration s budget  cole oversees spending on health and social welfare programs as chairman of a house appropriations panel and has a medical research facility important to his district that relies on federal funding   the national institutes of health is not likely to be cut  i think cdc  centers for disease control  is not likely to be cut  i think that is ill advised personally   cole told reporters  atop rogers  list of worries is trump s proposed elimination of the   million appalachian regional commission that has helped bring projects such as job training to unemployed coal miners  a broadband technology center to kentucky and high tech medical equipment to impoverished regions  the food stamp program  which helps low income and disabled people buy groceries  would be reduced by   billion over  years  according to u s  department of agriculture figures  bedrock republican states that trump won have long food stamp rolls    million people in texas    in vice president mike pence s home state of indiana    in alabama and   million in georgia  for example  trump got broad support in last november s election in counties with high numbers of white voters who receive food stamps  he was victorious in  of the   counties studied by the u s  census bureau where the percentage of white households receiving food stamps exceeds the national average  overall  according to a reuters analysis  states would see federal aid shrink under the proposals by  percent in the next fiscal year  with cuts falling more heavily on states that voted for clinton  states that voted for trump would see federal aid decline by   percent  while those that supported clinton would collectively see a drop of   percent  liberal california would be hit hardest  with a   percent drop  kentucky  a conservative state that signed on to the affordable care act s medicaid expansion  would also be hit hard  with assistance dropping by   percent   some republican lawmakers welcomed the budget cuts   i think we re way over in the number of people who have been able to qualify for food stamps   said john carter  who represents a central texas district  trump s proposed budget cuts would help pay for a  percent buildup in defense spending for next year  and help finance a wall on the southwest border that trump previously had promised would be paid for by mexico  something the mexican government has adamantly said it will not do  the medicaid healthcare plan for the poor is slated for about an   billion cut  reversing the expansion that former democratic president barack obama s signature affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  brought to republican states like west virginia  arkansas and kentucky with large populations of poor people   most of the  budget  cuts will focus on programs for low  income folks and public investments   said maya macguineas  president of the committee for a responsible federal budget  which pushes for long term fixes to washington s debt problems  levi russell  spokesman for americans for prosperity  the conservative group backed by billionaire charles koch  applauded trump s call to balance the budget within  years  cut taxes and roll back regulations   moves he said would stimulate job growth   it sends all of the right signals for the first time in nearly a decade   a budget that actually is focused on the best interests of the american taxpayer rather than what s popular in washington   he said
