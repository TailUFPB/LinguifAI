san francisco  reuters    a u s  judge on tuesday blocked president donald trump s executive order that sought to withhold federal funds from so called sanctuary cities  dealing another legal blow to the administration s efforts to toughen immigration enforcement  the ruling from u s  district judge william orrick iii in san francisco said trump s jan   order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional  the republican president s moves on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups  along with democratic city and state governments  to oppose them in court  the administration suffered an earlier defeat when two federal judges suspended executive orders restricting travel from several muslim majority countries  the government has appealed those decisions  reince priebus  trump s white house chief of staff  told reporters the administration was taking action to appeal the ruling  adding   the idea that an agency can t put in some reasonable restrictions on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually    it s the  circuit going bananas   priebus said  referring to the west coast judicial district where the judge ruled   we ll win at the supreme court level at some point   a formal white house statement on the ruling was withering in its criticism of orrick  saying  an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation  and handed  a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country    this case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single  unelected district judge   the white house said  the u s  justice department said in a statement it would  follow existing federal law with respect to sanctuary jurisdictions  as well as enforce conditions tied to federal grants  sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws  dozens of local governments and cities  including new york  los angeles and chicago  have joined the growing  sanctuary  movement  supporters of the sanctuary policy argue that enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities  trust in local police  particularly among latinos  the trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes  the executive order by trump  who made cracking down on illegal immigration a cornerstone of his  presidential campaign  directed such funding to be restricted once the homeland security department determines what constitutes a sanctuary city  santa clara county  which includes the city of san jose and several smaller silicon valley communities  sued in february  saying trump s order was unconstitutional  san francisco filed a similar lawsuit  the justice department threatened last week to cut some funding to california as well as eight cities and counties across the united states  the department singled out chicago and new york as two cities  crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime   even though new york city is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say chicago s recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration  santa clara county receives about    billion in federal and federally dependent funds annually  about  percent of its total revenues  the county argued it was owed millions of dollars of federal funding every day and that its budgetary planning process had been thrown into disarray by the order  the justice department said the counties had taken an overly broad interpretation of the president s order  which it said would affect only justice department and homeland security funds  a fraction of the grant money received by the counties  in his ruling  orrick said the language of the order made it clear it sought to withhold funds beyond law enforcement    and if there was doubt about the scope of the order  the president and attorney general have erased it with their public comments   orrick wrote  the judge cited comments from trump calling the order  a weapon  to use against jurisdictions that disagree with his immigration policies   federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves   orrick wrote  dave cortese  president of the santa clara county board of supervisors  said in a statement   the politics of fear emanating from the trump white house has just suffered a major setback
