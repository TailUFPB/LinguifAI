washington  reuters    the threat of a u s  government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede on tuesday after president donald trump backed away from a demand that congress include funding for his planned border wall with mexico in a spending bill   even if the fight over wall funding is over  republicans and democrats still have difficult issues to resolve as they face a friday night deadline when existing money expires for many federal agencies   there was growing sentiment among lawmakers that they would need to pass a short term extension of current spending  possibly of one week s duration  in order to finish negotiating longer term legislation for funding the government through the end of september   yeah  it looks like it   said republican senator lisa murkowski  an appropriations committee member  when asked about the likelihood of a short term extension  but on tuesday night  some leading republicans and democrats in the house and senate expressed optimism that congress could pass the longer term bill and avoid having to rely on another temporary extension of last year s funding levels   we re really close   said republican representative mario diaz balart  a senior member of the house appropriations committee   he added that leadership would make the final decision on which course congress takes this week  trump removed a crucial sticking point when he said on monday he may wait until republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on oct   to seek wall funding  the president s fellow republicans control both chambers of congress  but the current spending bill will need  votes to clear the  member senate  where republicans hold only  seats  democratic leaders had said they would not support a bill that included funds for the wall  the border wall was one of trump s signature election pledges last year  with the republican touting it as best way to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country  if no spending measure covering april  to sept   is in place before   a m    gmt  on saturday  government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country s several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off  trump had run the risk of being blamed by democrats for a shutdown  which would start on his  day in office  representative steny hoyer  the second most powerful democrat in the house  said he would advise colleagues to support a short term funding proposal only if a longer term fix was imminent  short term funding measures  known as continuing resolutions and covering periods of days or weeks  have been used to avert shutdowns in the past  but in   conservative republicans forced a  day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal then president barack obama s healthcare law  the affordable care act  senate democratic leader chuck schumer welcomed trump s monday night comments and noted there were republican opponents of the wall too   it s really good news that the president seems to be taking the wall off the table   schumer said on the senate floor on tuesday   it would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that members of both parties don t support   late on tuesday  however  white house budget director mick mulvaney told cnn that trump would not agree to other concessions that democrats had sought   cost sharing healthcare subsidies for  million americans  the subsidies are part of the affordable care act health insurance law  commonly called obamacare   mulvaney said the white house had offered democrats to include the obamacare subsidies in exchange for funding the wall     but they said no to that and we agreed to put that off for another day   he said  by dropping his call for immediate funding for the wall  trump may clear a path to a spending bill  but he will lose an opportunity to display serious progress on accomplishing his agenda since taking office on jan     there is also no guarantee that congress will want to fund the wall later on  given skepticism running through the republican party    republican senator jeff flake  who represents the border state of arizona  told reporters on tuesday there was a need for a wall in some border locations and alternative deterrents in others   a lot of us have been pushing for additional border security funding for a while  but a solitary   mile wall has never been a must have for anybody in a border state   he said   trump said he had not changed his stance  tweeting on tuesday   it will get built and help stop drugs  human trafficking etc   trump has said mexico will eventually repay the united states for wall construction  but the mexican government has been adamant it will not do so  and trump has not laid out  plans to compel repayment  internal department of homeland security estimates have put the cost at    billion  republican senator roger wicker said there was a  substantial figure  in the spending bill dedicated to border security  such spending  not explicitly for a wall  would likely be acceptable to both parties
