new york  reuters    there is at least one approved device and scores of experimental treatments being tested that could improve the odds of longer term survival for patients with the type of extremely aggressive brain cancer afflicting u s  senator john mccain  while the  year old arizona republican  who was re elected to a sixth senate term in november  recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot found to be associated with the cancer  he and his medical team will explore treatment options   that  recovery  usually takes about  to  days before starting therapy   said dr  maciej lesniak  chair of neurological surgery at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago  mccain was diagnosed with glioblastoma  a brain cancer with very poor prognosis that took the life of former u s  senator edward kennedy in   surgery is performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible  but cancer cells are left behind that infiltrate the brain and quickly grow  the survival rate with standard treatment is generally about  months  with only about  percent of patients alive after two years  standard treatment is a combination of  doses of radiation administered over six weeks along with the oral chemotherapy temodar  temozolomide  sold by merck   co  mrk n   after a three to four week break  additional four week cycles of temodar are given  mccain has vowed to return to his senate duties soon  experts said he may well be able to do so   the treatment is usually very well tolerated  lesniak said   generally  people can maintain normal quality of life during therapy including their work in the majority of cases   doctors interviewed who are not involved in mccain s care said further combination therapies were likely needed to sharply improve patient outcomes  debates over when to begin such  therapies are ongoing   many people feel we need to push the envelope and look at combination therapy as early as possible in addition to the standard of care   lesniak said   there are about  clinical trials for glioblastoma under way  most at very early stages  and the majority for patients for whom initial therapy has stopped working  mccain could be a candidate for a trial in newly diagnosed patients   current immunotherapies that have shown great promise against melanoma  lung cancer and other cancers are unlikely by themselves to work in glioblastoma because the tumors tend not to present the proper target for those drugs   glioblastoma tumor cells are incredibly heterogeneous  no two tumor cells are alike   said dr  john de groot  professor of neuro oncology at the university of texas md anderson cancer center  adding that a multi pronged approach was likely needed  one promising approach being tested in early stage clinical trials by various institutions and companies involve injecting viruses into the tumor to destroy cancer cells and spur an immune system attack  duke university generated publicity last year with reports of early success using the polio virus against brain cancer  md anderson developed a viral therapy that it outlicensed to a company called dnatrix for further development  de groot said  a trial at northwestern is using neural stem cells to help improve the performance of a cancer fighting virus   stem cells when loaded with the virus can travel to areas we can t resect to deliver the virus throughout the tumor mass in a more uniform fashion   lesniak said  in a study published in may in the journal nature  duke researchers reported early success with a vaccine that delivers high doses of temodar to the tumor  among  patients in that study  the median survival was   months  versus   months for the standard treatment  dr  roger stupp  co director of the northwestern brain tumor institute  who is credited with pioneering the radiation temodar combination therapy for glioblastoma  said patients like mccain might be helped by a now approved device shown to extend survival  called optune and sold by novocure ltd  nvcr o   it  delivers an electromagnetic field that interferes with cancer cells  ability to divide and survive  said stupp  who led trials of the device  it involves electrodes placed on the scalp operated by a small battery pack  with optune worn nearly  hours a day  the two year survival rate in the trial that led to its approval jumped to  percent  with some patients living four years or more   my recommendation is to use it early in the disease course   stupp said
