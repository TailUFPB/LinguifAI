washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans agreed to talks with the house of representatives on sweeping tax legislation on wednesday  amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self imposed dec   deadline    the republican led senate voted    along party lines with democrats opposed  to begin formal conference negotiations to reconcile rival house and senate tax bills passed last week  the move  which follows similar house action this week  brings congress a step closer to sending president donald trump a tax overhaul that he can sign into law  house and senate negotiators will need to work out differences on issues ranging from business taxes to the repeal of the obamacare mandate that americans obtain health insurance or face a penalty before lawmakers can pass a final version  but john cornyn  the no   senate republican  said he was optimistic house and senate tax negotiators would be able to work out an agreement within the next two weeks   given the similarities between the house and the senate bills  i think there are some obvious targets where they need to focus their attention but obviously they won t be rewriting the bills   cornyn said  republican negotiators must be careful not to agree to changes that could diminish support in the senate  where they can afford to lose support from no more than two party members  there has been no major tax overhaul since   when republican ronald reagan was president    while there are significant differences between the house and senate bills  both would cut the u s  corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  provide tax relief for  pass through  enterprises including small businesses where earnings are taxed at individual rates  and both benefit the wealthiest americans and reduce the tax burden for most middle class taxpayers   republicans claim the legislation will spur enough economic growth to pay for the tax cuts with new revenue  but the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation estimates that senate bill would still add   trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade  even with an economic upswing  u s  stock prices have rallied on growing optimism that tax legislation will become law  but on wednesday  the head of sovereign credit ratings at s p global told reuters that the rising deficit and looser fiscal policy could prompt negative action on u s  credit ratings unless washington addressed long term budgetary issues    if u s  tax reform is approved  it seems certain to increase the federal budget deficit   moritz kraemer  s p s sovereign global chief rating officer  said in an interview   a meaningful relaxation of fiscal policy without countervailing measures to address the longer term fiscal challenges of the u s  could lead to a negative rating action   senate republicans later voted down a democratic motion instructing tax negotiators to produce a deficit neutral bill    passage of the tax bill would provide a badly needed legislative victory for trump and republicans after their failure earlier this year to enact legislation repealing president barack obama s signature healthcare law  trump and his republican allies see enacting the tax overhaul that they promised voters as crucial to their strategy for the  u s  congressional elections  when all  seats in the house of representatives and  seats in the  member senate will be up for election  democrats have been united against the bill  calling it a handout to corporations and the rich that would drive up the federal deficit  in an early sign of progress on reconciling the house and senate versions  senator orrin hatch  chairman of the tax writing finance committee  said he did not think that the final bill would retain a corporate alternative minimum tax  amt   the house bill calls for a repeal of the corporate amt  which is designed to limit the ability of corporations to reduce their payments through tax breaks and credits  corporate amt repeal is not part of the senate version  getting rid of the corporate amt would be popular with many businesses and would also be a concession toward the house bill  but repeal would also require lawmakers to replace the   billion in revenues that retaining the corporate amt would raise over a decade  increasing the corporate income tax target from  percent is seen as one way to pay for the amt repeal and other potential changes   i ll keep it at  if i can  but there s a drive to get it to   they want more money  that s why   hatch told reporters
