washington  reuters    president donald trump outlined a plan on monday to privatize the u s  air traffic control system to modernize it and lower flying costs  but his proposal drew immediate criticism from democrats who said it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines  trump s proposal to spin off air traffic control from the federal aviation administration  faa  was part of a weeklong white house focus on infrastructure  the administration is looking to shift the spotlight back onto trump s agenda and away from a growing probe into alleged ties between his campaign and russia   we re proposing reduced wait times  increased route efficiency and far fewer delays   trump said   our plan will get you where you need to go quickly  more reliably  more affordably  and yes  for the first time in a long time  on time   executives from united airlines  hawaiian airlines   american airlines and southwest airlines  all represented by the airlines for america lobbying group  attended the trump speech  the group praised the trump plan  which most airlines back   the proposal  which would require congressional approval  is opposed by many democrats and some republicans  the faa spends nearly   billion a year on air traffic control funded largely through passenger user fees  and has spent more than    billion on next generation air traffic control reforms in recent years  trump said current air traffic reform efforts have failed and were a  total waste of money   it is unclear if privatization would speed the rollout of new  systems such as satellite based aircraft tracking that replaces ground radar dating back to world war two  proponents say a private entity could sign contracts with vendors more quickly than if deals are put through the faa s procurement process  which also is subject to budget instability   opponents  including delta air lines  say the u s  system is so large that privatization would not save money  and would drive up ticket costs and could create a national security risk  opponents also say technology upgrades would be sidetracked while the private entity was set up  potentially adding years to awarding contracts   there also are concerns that airlines would dominate the private company board and limit access to airports by business jets   the new systems would represent major wins for u s  companies that have been positioning for the shift  technology company harris corp is a leading candidate to supply the faa with real time aircraft tracking data in partnership with satellite operator iridium communications inc  harris already provides a similar data feed using  ground based antenna towers  and the faa is its largest customer  chief executive bill brown said in an interview  iridium has a joint venture that has partnered with air traffic control authorities in canada  italy  ireland and denmark to provide air traffic surveillance  in cooperation with harris   under trump s proposal  a board made up of airline  union and airport officials would oversee the nonprofit entity that would assume oversight after a three year transition  house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement that trump was recycling  a tired republican plan that both sides of the aisle have rejected  and would  hand control of one of our nation s most important public assets to special interests and the big airlines   the aircraft owners and pilots association said it will not support a plan that imposes fees on small plane owners   the u s  has a very safe air traffic system today and we don t hear complaints from our nearly   members about it   said mark baker  the group s president  the infrastructure push comes as the white house seeks to refocus attention on core promises to boost jobs and the economy trump made last year during his presidential campaign  those pledges have been eclipsed by the furor over russia s alleged meddling in the election  that drama will come to a head on thursday when former federal bureau of investigation director james comey  who was leading the russia probe until trump fired him last month  testifies before a senate panel  trump has denied any collusion between russia and his campaign  he has struggled to keep the spotlight on plans that could give him a political boost  on wednesday  trump will travel to cincinnati to talk about improvements to the   miles    km  of inland waterways  dams  locks and ports critical for shipping farm products
