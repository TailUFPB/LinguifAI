washington  reuters    president donald trump is considering recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital  a move that could upend decades of american policy and ratchet up middle east tensions  but is expected to again delay his campaign promise to move the u s  embassy there  u s  officials said on thursday  after months of intense white house deliberations  trump is likely to make an announcement next week that seeks to strike a balance between domestic political demands and geopolitical pressures over an issue at the heart of the israeli palestinian conflict   the status of jerusalem  home to sites holy to the jewish  muslim and christian religions  trump is weighing a plan under which he would declare jerusalem the capital of israel  the officials said  deviating from white house predecessors who have insisted that it is a matter that must be decided in peace negotiations  the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state  and the international community does not recognize israel s claim on the entire city  such a move by trump  which could be carried out through a presidential statement or speech  would anger the palestinians as well as the broader arab world and likely undermine the trump administration s fledgling effort to restart long stalled israeli palestinian peace talks  it could  however  help satisfy the pro israel  right wing base that helped him win the presidency and also please the israeli government  a close u s  ally  trump is likely to continue his predecessors  policy of signing a six month waiver overriding a  law requiring that the u s  embassy be moved from tel aviv to jerusalem  the officials said  but among the options under consideration is for trump to order his aides to develop a longer term plan for the embassy s relocation to make clear his intent to do so eventually  according to one of the officials  however  the u s  officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity  cautioned that the plan has yet to be finalized and trump could still alter parts of it   no decision has been made on that matter yet   state department spokeswoman heather nauert said on thursday  trump pledged on the presidential campaign trail last year that he would move the embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  but trump in june waived the requirement  saying he wanted to  maximize the chances  for a peace push led by his son in law and senior adviser  jared kushner   those efforts have made little if any progress  the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks in achieving peace between israel and the palestinians  israel captured arab east jerusalem during the  middle east war and later annexed it  a move not recognized internationally   palestinian leaders  arab governments and western allies have long urged trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation  which would go against decades of u s  policy by granting de facto u s  recognition of israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital  however  if trump decides to declare jerusalem as israel s capital  even without ordering an embassy move  it would be certain to spark an international uproar   a key question would be whether such a declaration would be enshrined as a formal presidential action or simply be a symbolic statement by trump  some of trump s top aides have privately pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy a range of supporters  including evangelical christians  while others have warned of the potential damage to u s  relations with muslim countries
