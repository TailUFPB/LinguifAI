washington  reuters    the u s  justice department on friday asked the supreme court to block a judge s ruling that prevented president donald trump s travel ban from being applied to grandparents of u s  citizens and refugees already being processed by resettlement agencies  in a court filing  the administration asked the justices to overturn thursday s decision by a u s  district judge in hawaii  which limited the scope of the administration s temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six muslim majority countries  the latest round in the fight over trump s march  executive order  which he says is needed for national security reasons  came after the supreme court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans  which were blocked by lower courts  the supreme court said then that the ban could take effect  but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a u s  person or entity could not be barred   the administration had narrowly interpreted that language  saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members  prompting the state of hawaii to ask hawaii based u s  district judge derrick watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted  he ruled for the state late on thursday  in the court filing  the justice department said the judge s ruling  empties the  supreme  court s decision of meaning  as it encompasses not just  close  family members but virtually all family members  the conservative leaning supreme court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests  the administration s application could be directed either to justice anthony kennedy  who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states  or to the nine justices as a whole  if the court as a whole is asked to weigh in  five votes are needed to grant such a request   the truth here is that the government s interpretation of the supreme court s stay order defies common sense   said omar jadwat  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union involved in challenging the ban   that s what the district court correctly found and the attorney general s misleading attacks on its decision can t change that fact   in his decision  watson harshly criticized the government s definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense   watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the united states because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation  in the court filing  the justice department said watson s ruling on refugees would make the supreme court s decision on that part of the executive order  effectively meaningless   the ruling  if left in place  means refugees can continue to be resettled in the united states  beyond a cap of   set by the executive order  that limit was reached this week   the supreme court s decision last month revived parts of trump s march  executive order banning travelers from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  as well as refugees for  days  the court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the u s  constitution
