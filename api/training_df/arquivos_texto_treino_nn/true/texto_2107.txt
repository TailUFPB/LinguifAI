washington  reuters    the departure on friday of steve bannon  the white house s top economic nationalist  will likely tip the trade policy scales in favor of the trump administration s  globalist  faction  which could soften the stance toward two of trump s favorite targets  china and the north american free trade agreement  but after news that trump had fired bannon from his post as chief strategist  trade experts said it may take some time for national economic council chairman gary cohn  treasury secretary steven mnuchin and agriculture secretary sonny perdue to start winning more debates on trade policy  bannon and white house trade and manufacturing office director peter navarro were often allied in taking hardline anti china stances over currency manipulation  steel tariffs and other trade issues  often opposed to cohn  mnuchin and perdue  according to lobbyists who been involved in the debates  the cohn led group proved more influential in the administration s decisions in april not to label china a currency manipulator and to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement instead of terminating it   more recently  they have pushed for a delay in a decision on the imposition of broad steel tariffs      with bannon gone   there s not a replacement for that voice in internal debates   said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue   without steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so called  globalists   it s easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles   the official said  in the short term  the trade policy trajectory won t change much  said derek scissors  a china trade expert at the american enterprise institute  a pro business conservative think tank in washington  many of trump s views on trade pre dated bannon s arrival on his campaign in any case  the u s  trade representative s office announced on friday that it will proceed with a planned investigation into whether china is misappropriating u s  technology and intellectual property through unreasonable investment rules  scissors said bannon s departure will show in what decisions the administration makes following a year long study of the issue     it s about the final choices on do we go forward with these very difficult sanctions on the chinese or do we look to make a tradeoff on a security issue  and bannon would have been in the first camp   scissors said  the struggle for influence in trump s white house  has been something of a battle between the finance guys and the economic nationalists  and the most important economic nationalist just left   scissors added  the offices of ustr robert lighthizer and commerce secretary wilbur ross  who have been pushing for stronger trade policies to reduce u s  trade deficits with china  mexico and other countries  declined to comment on bannon s departure  referring policy questions to the white house  but industry lobbyists  who have been whipsawed by economic policy twists over trade and an ill fated border tax proposal  were skeptical that much would change   two lobbyists on the sidelines of nafta talks in washington said that even without bannon  they will assume the status quo on trade policy as long as fierce china critic navarro is in the white house  bonnie glaser  senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies  said the administration s efforts to develop an effective strategy to retaliate against china s unfair trade practices will survive  largely because there is a widely held view in the administration and the corporate sector that china s trade practices are a problem   i doubt this effort will evaporate  though it may evolve   she said
