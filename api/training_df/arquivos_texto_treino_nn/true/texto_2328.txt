rockville  md   reuters    the  democratic women who packed into a suburban maryland conference room recently for a one day training on how to run for political office were more than activists eager to battle president donald trump and his fellow republicans  the teachers  students and business leaders were also a window into the future for a democratic party desperate for new blood  and into the booming effort to turn the left s grassroots anti trump activism into a new wave of democratic officeholders  as thousands of potential first time candidates explore  political bids in what democratic veterans say is an unprecedented surge of activity  a broad but informal network of groups is beefing up efforts to train them for the task  the goal  turning neophytes into successful politicians who can win  giving the party a deep and diverse bench of up and coming progressive talent at all levels of government   this era of trump has made everybody just want to run for office  and it s not easy   said josh morrow  executive director of  action  which since its founding last year has heard from about   scientists  engineers and mathematicians exploring  political runs and trained nearly  of them   no matter how accomplished people are  they need help when they first run   morrow said  the surge of interest has given dispirited democrats  long criticized as a top heavy party lacking fresh faces  hope for a renaissance at the local and state levels after repeated setbacks under president barack obama  building from the ground up  from the school board to the statehouse  is a party priority after losing nearly   state legislative seats in the last eight years  republicans also control the white house  both chambers of congress and  governor s offices  the most in nearly a century   local offices matter  and as democrats we have sort of forgotten that   said amanda litman  a staffer on democrat hillary clinton s presidential campaign who founded the group run for something after the  election to recruit and prepare millennials for office  for first timers  the initial enthusiasm for public service can quickly give way to worried questions about the logistics of building a fundraising list  utilizing social media and crafting a message   i knew i had a steep learning curve   said thereasa black  a lawyer and navy veteran running for the u s  congress from maryland  she attended the rockville session run by emerge america  which prepares women for office   this is a way to find people who are like minded and going through what you are  and can help you   she said  a republican spokesman said democrats would need more than training and fresh faces to gain ground in next year s midterm elections given the losses of first time democratic candidates in special congressional races in georgia and montana earlier this year   the challenges that democrats face go much deeper and come down to fundraising and messaging   said rick gorka  a spokesman for the republican national committee  which sponsored a training program for about   volunteer field staff and operatives last year  geoffrey dittberner    said he had volunteered on campaigns before deciding to run for the minnesota legislature  but he was still unprepared for being a candidate before he was accepted into run for something s training program   there were so many things i didn t know   fundraising  setting up a campaign organization   but they made it pretty easy   he said  the group s slack application gave him access to a variety of resources  from tutorials to mentors and peer networks  discussion groups and on call experts  he said  aside from new groups like  action and run for something  about a dozen established organizations that have long offered training to progressive candidates also have been flooded with interest since trump s election  emily s list  which for years has trained women candidates who favor abortion rights  has hired five more staffers this year for a reconstituted training unit  it already has heard from   women interested in becoming candidates this year  compared to  in   emerge america has seen applications jump by  percent and added five new state chapters  the maryland state chapter  which ran the one day course in rockville  had trained  women by mid year  last year  it trained   at emerge s rockville session  candidates were encouraged to listen more than they talk and delve into their own experiences to explain what motivated them to run   when we tap into our own personal story  we relate better to people in our community   diane fink  executive director for emerge maryland  told the class  she asked them to put together a three minute story that explains how they got started  while democrats nationally have battled over their core message  most of the training programs say they avoid telling candidates specifically what issues to emphasize   first and foremost you should be talking about what matters to voters  not to you   said veteran democratic strategist kelly dietrich  who founded the national democratic training committee last year to offer free online training for any democrat running for any office  so far  more than   have signed up
