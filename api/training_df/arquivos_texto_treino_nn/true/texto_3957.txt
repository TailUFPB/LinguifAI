tallahassee  fla   reuters    a republican  a democrat and a lobbyist for leading businesses in florida huddled this spring at the state capitol  mapping out the next move in a campaign to enact the first statewide lgbt anti discrimination law in the u s  south  a record number of republican lawmakers had thrown their support behind proposed protections for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people  and hundreds of companies backed the cause  while the bill has so far fallen short with time running out on the legislative session  its lead backers were heartened by their progress and determined to retool for next year   we definitely need to ramp up the grassroots   said joseph salzverg  a lobbyist for florida competes  a group of more than  state businesses supporting lgbt protections   there s a lot of republicans that agree with the policy but are worried about the effect it has back home   a year after transgender bathroom access erupted as a u s  culture wars flashpoint  florida is among the conservative statehouses where lgbt activists see momentum building for affirmative legislation  the nation s third most populous state  florida could offer the next breakthrough in a national movement to advance lgbt civil rights protections  viewed by advocates as stepping stones to their ultimate goal of federal anti discrimination law  only  states  mostly concentrated in the u s  west and northeast  and the district of columbia have laws that fully guard against lgbt people being fired from jobs  kicked out of housing or denied services in restaurants  hotels and other businesses  this fight continues even after a u s  supreme court ruling in june  that legalized same sex marriage nationally  florida s strategy  years in the making  aims to build bipartisan support with economic arguments and the passage of similar measures locally that show the lgbt protections can succeed  the bill s backers must convince a republican controlled state legislature that all of florida benefits from lgbt protections   it s really about the math of being based here in florida  but competing on a global market   said john  j t   tonnison  president of florida competes   tonnison is chief information officer of tech data corp  a technology distributor  in the state capital of tallahassee this spring  he told legislators about a prized recruit reluctant to relocate from california  concerned about a gay son visiting a state without strong protections     it sets us apart in a less than positive light   tonnison said  local lgbt protections are now in place in communities representing  percent of florida s more than  million residents  in conservative north florida  the state s largest city  jacksonville  recently passed a nondiscrimination policy after a fight that lasted years  local successes helped convince  republican legislators to join  democrats this year to cosponsor legislation that would add sexual orientation and gender identity to florida s civil rights statutes  just shy of a majority in the  member legislature  representative joe gruters  an anti abortion activist who co chaired president donald trump s state campaign  was among the first republicans to sign on  perhaps an unlikely lgbt ally  the first term lawmaker said the case made by advocates  and a prominent conservative colleague s support  resonated with him   i will continue to fight for this  and for any type of right  that treats people fairly   gruters said   it s going to happen    by contrast  the florida family policy council  advocating for conservative social values  decried the legislation as an intrusion on religious freedoms and public safety by allowing men into women s bathrooms and private facilities  such lgbt measures are  weapons to punish christians for simply acting out their faith in the marketplace   said its president  john stemberger    people are trying to force other people to do things   he added   why can t we just disagree   but backers see florida as a model for other states engaged in long term legislative efforts  including ohio and pennsylvania   attracting bipartisan support really proves this isn t an urban versus a rural issue  or a republican versus democratic issue   said dan rafter  a spokesman for the advocacy group freedom for all americans  florida  and most other states  avoided fights this year over transgender bathroom access  possibly dissuaded by the national boycotts organized against north carolina before its recent roll back of restrictions enacted in   nonetheless  florida s lgbt protection bill never got a hearing during this session  which will end within days  the legislature s leaders did not comment on what stalled the measure  supporters are reorganizing for next year with a more pointed message   inaction is not neutral   said hannah willard  public policy director for the advocacy group equality florida  during the strategy meeting last month at the state capitol  republican representative rene plasencia proposed mobilizing business supporters to engage legislators in their hometowns   we are protecting people s rights to live freely  to not be disadvantaged economically  because of the personal choice of who they love   he said  looking over a list of lawmakers not yet on board  the lead democrat behind the house bill agreed   we need to persuade people before they get to tallahassee   representative ben diamond said   that s the challenge
