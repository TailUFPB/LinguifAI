washington  reuters    when president donald trump fired white house chief strategist and former campaign manager steve bannon on friday  it was almost like bidding goodbye to a part of himself  trump s most polarizing stances on matters such as immigration and national security closely tracked bannon s  america first  anti globalist worldview  despite their close alignment  trump was always reluctant to credit bannon with the stunning electoral victory of november   often noting bannon    came late to the campaign  joining only after trump had secured the republican nomination  he rewarded bannon  nonetheless  giving him a top job in the administration  but as the white house grew increasingly chaotic in the early months of trump s presidency  bannon clashed with more mainstream advisers  including  most crucially  the president s son in law jared kushner and daughter ivanka trump   trump was reportedly unhappy with the attention that bannon got early on as the architect of trump s campaign  and with bannon s tendency to promote himself  as he operated an almost independent power center within the west wing   ultimately  bannon wore out his welcome  trump fired him at the urging of his new chief of staff  john kelly  who has been working to reorganize the white house and limit access to trump  the dismissal could have political repercussions  bannon was viewed as the administration s conduit to trump s rabid political base  bannon s departure may antagonize some of trump s most passionate supporters  who fear that without bannon  trump will move closer to the republican political establishment   we are extremely disappointed   rick manning  president of americans for limited government  a conservative advocacy group  said in a statement  on specific policies  bannon was credited with helping craft the administration s  travel ban   which restricted emigration to the united states from some mostly muslim countries  as well as trump s opposition to the trans pacific partnership trade pact and the paris global climate accord  bannon has been seen as wary of u s  intervention abroad  arguing against sending more u s  troops to afghanistan  in recent months  bannon has battled for influence inside the white house with trump s national security adviser  lieutenant general h r  mcmaster  a tension that was destabilizing trump s team of top advisers  senior officials have told reuters  trump himself has suggested bannon s influence was overstated  while bannon was viewed as perhaps responsible for trump s initial response to the violence last weekend in charlottesville  virginia  when he blamed both sides for the confrontation  trump said this week that he never spoke to bannon about the matter  bannon may return to the provocateur role he played at the right wing breitbart news website  where he spearheaded its shift into a forum for the  alt right   a loose online confederation of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites  under bannon s leadership  the breitbart site presented a number of conspiracy theories about former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  as well as republicans deemed to be lacking in conservative bona fides  whether he returns to breitbart and uses it to challenge the so called  cucks  and  globalists  he disdains   and perhaps trump himself   will be closely watched in coming weeks  bannon is a former u s  navy officer  goldman sachs investment banker and hollywood producer  almost immediately after bannon s departure became public  breitbart published a piece calling him  the conservative spine  of the administration and questioning whether trump would now move in a more moderate direction  another breitbart editor  raheem kassam  posted a picture of bannon on twitter with the caption bannon   seemingly suggesting that bannon  not trump  should be president
