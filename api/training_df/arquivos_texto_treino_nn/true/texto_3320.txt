new york  reuters    former fbi director james comey s testimony that u s  president donald trump expected loyalty and hoped comey would drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against trump  several legal experts said   such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings  some of the analysts said  any such step would face a steep hurdle  however  as it would require approval by the u s  house of representatives  which is controlled by trump s fellow republicans  according to written testimony posted on the senate intelligence committee s website on wednesday  comey said trump told him during a one on one feb   conversation that former national security adviser michael flynn was a  good guy  and hoped that comey could see his  way clear  to letting go a probe into ties between flynn and russia  trump had fired flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the russian ambassador to the united states   comey s account  released ahead of his appearance before the committee on thursday  could show that trump intended to impede the flynn investigation  said michael gerhardt  a professor of constitutional law at the university of north carolina school of law    the express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting   and could heighten speculation that the  president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the russia investigation   gerhardt said  comey  who was fired by trump on may   was leading an fbi investigation of flynn as it looks into allegations of links between russia and trump s  presidential campaign  moscow and trump have both denied any collusion  trump s lawyer  marc kasowitz  did not immediately respond to a reuters query about whether comey s testimony would support an obstruction case  but he said in a statement that trump felt  vindicated  by comey s confirmation he was not under investigation in any russia probe      to build a criminal obstruction of justice case  federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent  it does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation   while a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution  obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment   bruce green  a professor at fordham university school of law  said it would be difficult to show trump intended to impede the flynn investigation  he said trump could say he was merely vouching for flynn s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president  alan dershowitz  a professor emeritus at harvard law school and well known defense lawyer  added that trump s comments to comey were  ambiguous statements  and  not even close to obstruction of justice    other legal experts said  however  that details surrounding the feb   conversation could indicate that trump intended to interfere with the flynn probe    according to comey  trump told his close advisers  including attorney general jeff sessions and jared kushner  to leave the room so he could speak to comey privately   asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing   said andrew wright  a professor of constitutional law at savannah law school  wright said there were other damaging details in comey s testimony  including that comey did not document his conversations with former president barack obama but  felt compelled  to do so after his first conversation with trump  comey s testimony does  maximum damage  to trump  wright said  gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to trump  saying   some people who weren t concerned before should be concerned now
