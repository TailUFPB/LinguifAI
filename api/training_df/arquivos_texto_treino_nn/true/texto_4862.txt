washington  reuters    u s  republican congressional leaders have refused democrats  calls for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate possible links between president donald trump s campaign and russia  saying investigations by congressional committees are sufficient  u s  intelligence agencies said in january that russian president vladimir putin had ordered hacks of the democratic national committee s and hillary clinton s campaign chairman s computers to influence the election on trump s behalf  russia has denied this  three u s  agencies   the cia  national security agency and federal bureau of investigation   as well as the justice department  launched investigations into the matter under democratic president barack obama  in addition  here are some of the ways that congressional committees are looking into the matter  house intelligence committee   the house permanent select committee on intelligence began its investigation of potential russian influence on the  presidential race before trump took office on jan    the panel s chairman  republican representative devin nunes  played a leading role in trump s transition  which prompted some critics to question whether he was too close to the republican president to conduct a fair investigation  some of nunes  statements contributed to their concerns  including his confirmation that he had spoken to journalists at the white house s request to dispute reports that trump s campaign had contact with russia   nunes has also said he does not want the investigation to turn into a  witch hunt  like the  mccarthy congressional hearings into some americans  alleged links with communism  the committee members had to push for full access to information collected by the cia  fbi and other agencies  but more recently they have said their access has improved  the panel will hold its first public hearing on the matter on march   fbi director james comey and the leaders or former leaders of most of the major u s  intelligence agencies have been invited to testify  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the committee  said he does not know yet whether the panel is capable of conducting a credible investigation  senate intelligence committee   the u s  senate select committee on intelligence is conducting its own investigation  also started before trump took office  it is considered the most robust congressional action  its chairman  richard burr  was re elected in november in the republican sweep that carried trump into office and preserved republican control of congress  although he was a trump supporter during the campaign  he is not as closely linked with the president as nunes is  but he also made calls to reporters as the white house tried to dispute allegations about campaign contacts with russia  senator mark warner  the committee s democratic vice chairman  said he had  grave concerns  about the independence of the committee s probe after the report that burr had helped the white house dispute the stories  burr and warner have expressed fewer concerns than members of the house committee about the amount of information that intelligence agencies have provided to them          the senate intelligence committee will hold an open hearing on russian efforts to influence campaigns more generally  on march   the witness list includes experts  not current trump administration or intelligence community officials  senate judiciary committee   republican senator lindsey graham  chairman of the panel s subcommittee on crime and terrorism  and sheldon whitehouse  its ranking democrat  announced that they  too  would investigate russian attempts to influence the election  they also have asked the fbi and the justice department to produce any information that supports trump s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped him during the  campaign  the full judiciary committee is also investigating  its chairman  chuck grassley  and top democrat  dianne feinstein  have had officials brief panel members  grassley and feinstein also sent a joint letter to comey asking for a briefing and transcripts and documents of calls between michael flynn  trump s former national security adviser  and russian ambassador sergei kislyak  house judiciary committee   committee democrats tried to force the committee to ask the department of justice to produce records of its investigation into whether trump or his campaign had ties to russia  but panel republicans blocked the effort  the committee s chairman  representative bob goodlatte  said instead that he would urge the government to continue its investigation  however  goodlatte said he had asked the justice department to brief the committee  and had not had a response  house oversight committee   jason chaffetz  the committee s republican chairman  has resisted calls to investigate the trump administration  after michael flynn resigned as trump s national security adviser because of his calls to russia s ambassador  chaffetz said his panel would not look into the issue  he has  however  signed letters seeking related information  and he was among the first lawmakers to call for attorney general jeff sessions to recuse himself from russia related investigations because of his contacts with kislyak
