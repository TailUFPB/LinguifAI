washington  reuters    a second u s  federal judge has blocked parts of president donald trump s latest travel ban on people entering the united states from eight countries  dealing another legal blow to the administration s third bid to impose travel restrictions  u s  district judge theodore chuang in maryland  in a ruling issued overnight  said the policy as applied to six majority muslim countries likely violates the u s  constitution s prohibition on religious discrimination  he also ruled the ban ran afoul of immigration law  trump s ban would have taken effect on wednesday but was blocked on tuesday by a u s  federal judge in hawaii in a separate challenge   together  the pair of rulings set up a high stakes battle over the president s executive authority that is expected to ultimately wind up before the u s  supreme court  trump s latest order targeted people from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  as well as certain government officials from venezuela  neither of the court rulings lifts the restrictions on north korea and venezuela  in the maryland ruling  chuang questioned the government s argument that the restrictions are needed until the affected countries provide more information on travelers to the united states   he cited various statements made by trump  including his  call for a  total and complete shutdown on muslims entering the united states   chuang wrote that the president s public statements  not only fail to advance  but instead undermine  the position that the primary purpose of the travel ban now derives from the need to address information sharing deficiencies    the latest ban  announced last month  was the third version of a policy that targeted muslim majority countries but had been restricted by the courts  the maryland case was brought by the american civil liberties union  which represents several advocacy groups  including the international refugee assistance project   like the two versions before it  president trump s latest travel ban is still a muslim ban at its core  and like the two before it  this one is going down to defeat in the courts   said aclu lawyer omar jadwat  on tuesday  u s  district judge derrick watson in honolulu said hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that the policy  violated federal immigration law  the white house called the ruling flawed and said it would appeal  unlike the hawaii ruling  the maryland decision would lift the restrictions only for people with family connections to the united states  white house representatives had no immediate comment
