 washington  reuters    public pension funds in at least seven u s  states have invested millions of dollars in an investment fund that owns a new york hotel and pays one of president donald trump s companies to run it  according to a reuters review of public records  that arrangement could put trump at risk of violating an obscure constitutional clause  some legal experts say   the trump soho hotel and condominium in manhattan is an upscale  story property owned by a los angeles investment group  the cim group  through one of its real estate funds   read the most recent amendment to the trump soho s offering plan  tmsnrt rs    the possible problem for trump lies in the fact that state  and city run pension funds have invested in the cim fund and pay it a few million dollars in quarterly fees to manage their investments in its portfolio  which includes the trump soho  according to state investment records   in return for marketing and managing the hotel condo  cim pays trump international hotels management llc   percent of the soho s operating revenues annually   that payment chain merits closer scrutiny because it could put trump at risk of falling foul of a little known constitutional rule prohibiting the flow of money from states to the pockets of a sitting president  five ethics and constitutional law experts interviewed by reuters said   graphic on trump soho payment chain  tmsnrt rs    no other public pension fund investments in trump affiliated businesses have been reported   the white house referred comment to the trump organization  the parent conglomerate for trump s businesses  which did not respond to repeated calls and emails for comment   while trump turned over management of the trump organization in january to a trust controlled by his two elder sons  he still earns revenue from the soho  that s because he still owns the businesses in the trump organization  including trump international hotels management llc   article ii of the u s  constitution bars the president from receiving additional payments beyond his salary from state governments  this so called  domestic emoluments clause  prohibits  any other emolument from the united states  or any of them    this clause and a  foreign emoluments clause  prohibiting similar payments from foreign governments have been thrust to the fore because of trump s vast  complicated network of businesses  which ethics experts say has created unprecedented conflicts of interest   a group of constitutional and ethics experts have filed a lawsuit alleging trump was violating both clauses by letting his hotels and other businesses accept payments from public officials  trump said the suit was without merit  the lawsuit does not refer to the cim fund   the group s april complaint cited dozens of violations  including foreign government leases and purchases at trump s properties in the united states  which have resulted in unknown amounts being paid to trump since he was inaugurated   the soho hotel condo management contract is a significant revenue generator for trump through his hotel management company  in  and the first five months of   trump international hotels management llc drew at least    million from the soho  and trump received    million in income from the hotel management company  hotel records and campaign filings show   read the  and  financial statements for the trump soho  tmsnrt rs    cim said its policy is not to comment on its private funds  agreements  or the operations of its funds  investments   the state  or city run pension funds are in california  new york  texas  arizona  montana  michigan and missouri  they have more than  million members   from state lawmakers in california to teachers in texas and police officers in new york  they include the california public employees  retirement system  the nation s largest public pension fund   the pension funds  money accounts for about half of the total capital cim raised from its investors to invest in the properties in the fund  including the trump soho  according to the pension funds  financial records and sec filings  cim declined to disclose how many properties are in the fund   some of the  pension funds contacted by reuters declined to comment on the payment chain between them and trump  others referred the question to cim  saying their investment in the cim fund does not give them control over its asset acquisitions   reuters presented its findings to six lawyers with expertise in constitutional law and emoluments issues   one of the lawyers  david rivkin jr   associate white house counsel during the george h  w  bush administration  said the public investments do not put trump at risk of violating the constitution   payments clearly related to non official activities that  have nothing to do with the discharge of duties in office  are not emoluments  rivkin said   three  however  said if trump financially benefited from a business whose owner drew millions of dollars in fees from u s  states   in this case cim   this presented a serious argument for a domestic emoluments violation    if you take a step back and look at this transaction  it s a payment chain from state pension funds to president trump   said jed shugerman  a law professor at fordham university   this looks like an emolument to me    two other lawyers said the arrangement raised significant questions  but all depended on how broadly a court interpreted the constitutional clause    we re in largely uncharted territory on that front given that past presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the kinds of issues we re now confronting   said brianne gorod  chief counsel at the constitutional accountability center  a washington research organization and public advocacy law firm   none of the  pension funds contacted by reuters said they were prepared to divest from the cim fund  for instance  the teacher retirement system of texas  which has invested   million in the cim fund  said it was  not our practice to comment on questions of this nature    one member of the texas teachers  pension fund  byron hildebrand    state secretary for the association of texas professional educators  however  said he would alert teachers across his state to the pension fund s exposure to the trump hotel and call on the state to consider divesting   divesting from the cim fund would likely force the public pension funds to sell their cim shares at a loss  said tom lopez  the chief investment officer of the los angeles fire and police pensions  one of the pension funds in the cim fund  which is also known as a real estate partnership   even though the partnership s returns on investment are overall quite strong  trying to sell interest in a  year old partnership is like  trying to sell a used car   he said   lopez noted that all the public funds invested in the cim fund long before it acquired the soho   and long before anybody thought trump would become president
