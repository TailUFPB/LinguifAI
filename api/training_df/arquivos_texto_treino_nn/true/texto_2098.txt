washington  reuters    defense secretary jim mattis travels to the middle east and eastern europe next week to play the increasingly familiar role of reassuring allies that the united states is committed to them despite mixed messages from president donald trump       mattis will visit jordan  turkey  and ukraine to address concerns about the fight against islamic state and give a message that washington will not tolerate russia s annexation of eastern ukraine       the informal portfolio of soothing traditional u s  friends upset by trump s often sharp comments and tweets on foreign policy is one that the retired marine general is becoming used to    there is no one in the administration  maybe with the exception of vice president mike pence  that has to shoulder the responsibility of trump s rhetoric more than mattis   said joshua walker  a former u s  diplomat and current fellow at the german marshall fund of the united states  a think tank   earlier this month  trump said that a u s  military option was being considered for venezuela as the country is torn by political and economic upheaval  within a few hours  the pentagon publicly announced that it had not received any orders on venezuela  lowering the temperature slightly   mattis  along with secretary of state rex tillerson  sent a conciliatory message to north korea last weekend in an op ed piece in the wall street journal after trump had threatened  fire and fury  if pyongyang tried to attack the united states      the two officials wrote that the united states  has no interest in regime change or accelerated reunification of korea   addressing some of north korea s fears that washington ultimately intends to replace its leadership    it is certainly true that to some extent if you look at both mattis and tillerson  who travel a lot  they are both explainers and people who both manage to moderate and reassure   said anthony cordesman at the center for strategic and international studies think tank  mattis served as the head of u s  military s central command from  to   and foreign leaders  especially in the middle east  trust him  said cordesman  on a trip to iraq earlier this year  mattis grabbed headlines when he said the u s  military was not there to  seize anybody s oil    that was an attempt to calm iraqi worries after trump had told cia staff in january  when referring to the u s  invasion of iraq in    we should have kept the oil  but okay  maybe you ll have another chance   trump has also upset nato allies by demanding they increase their defense spending and by seeking better relations with russia    i do think that secretary mattis finds himself spending time  putting president trump s statements into a broader context    in some cases that does mean defining them more narrowly  or more precisely as to what they mean   christine wormuth  a former number three at the pentagon  said  on the trip that starts this weekend  mattis will make the first visit to ukraine by a u s  secretary of defense since   he will try to reassure kiev that the united states remains committed to restoring ukraine s sovereignty after russia annexed crimea in   questions were raised when tillerson said in june that the trump administration did not wish to be  handcuffed  by the  minsk accord to end fighting in ukraine  that agreement  signed by russia and ukraine  calls for a ceasefire  the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern ukraine more autonomy  while it is not a close u s  ally  ukraine has counted on american support against russia since a pro western government took power following street protests in  that ousted a kremlin backed president  trump s comments during the election campaign last year  from praise of russian president vladimir putin to appearing to recognize crimea as part of russia and contemplating an end to u s  sanctions on moscow  stoked fears in kiev that trump would mend ties with russia at ukraine s expense  the pentagon is awaiting white house approval for a proposal to send  defensive  weapons to ukraine  including anti tank missiles  a u s  official said  michael carpenter  a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the region  said the trip would be important because it would send a signal to kiev that the united states remained committed and the approval of the lethal weapons would be a tangible sign of that   mattis believes that this is a security issue that goes beyond europe  that this is about international norms  sovereignty and territorial integrity   carpenter said      the pentagon says mattis will also emphasize the commitment of the united states to turkey and help ankara  address its legitimate security concerns  including the fight against the  kurdistan workers party    however  mattis will have to address a number of differences  including the pentagon s decision to arm kurdish ypg fighters to support an operation to retake the syrian city of raqqa from islamic state   ankara views the ypg  fighting within a larger u s  backed coalition  as the syrian extension of the kurdish pkk militant group  which it is fighting in southeastern turkey
