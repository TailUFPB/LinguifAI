washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday ended a fraught month long search for an fbi chief after firing james comey by selecting christopher wray  who has prosecuted and defended white collar crime cases and represented new jersey s governor in a political scandal  wray  who must be confirmed to the post by the senate  and comey served together in the justice department under former president george bush  and both worked on the government s case in the enron corp fraud scandal in the early to mid   trump s announcement that he will nominate wray as director of the federal bureau of investigation came a day before comey s eagerly anticipated public testimony before a senate committee  in written testimony released by the panel on wednesday  comey said trump told him on jan   that  i expect loyalty   and in a feb   meeting asked him to back off from a probe into former national security adviser michael flynn s ties with russia  the republican president s search for a replacement for comey after firing him may  was difficult  leading candidates including former senator joe lieberman took their names out of consideration  and trump interviewed a series of contenders  in a statement  trump called wray  an impeccably qualified individual  who will serve  as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity   the white house has given shifting explanations on why trump fired comey during an fbi investigation into whether trump campaign associates colluded with the russians to help him with the  presidential election  trump has said he was thinking of  this russia thing  in dismissing comey  wray served from  to  at the justice department under republican former president george w  bush as an assistant attorney general in charge of its criminal division and oversaw the department s enron task force  wray and comey helped bring the case against kenneth lay  the former enron chairman convicted in   also involved in the enron matter was robert mueller  then fbi director and now special counsel named after comey was fired to investigate the russia affair  as well as andrew weissman  who is now working for mueller  the web of enron connections underscores the reliance in washington  even under a president who vowed to  drain the swamp   on an elite corps of corporate lawyers whose varied careers often intersect and who sometimes present conflict of interest issues  for instance  after he left the justice department and joined top international law firm king   spalding  wray represented republican new jersey governor chris christie in the so called bridgegate scandal over massive traffic jams created as political punishment for a local mayor  that case and others taken on by wray while in private practice could pose problems  said american civil liberties union national political director faiz shakir in a statement   christopher wray s firm s legal work for the trump family  his history of partisan activity  as well as his history of defending trump s transition director during a criminal scandal makes us question his ability to lead the fbi   shakir said  wray represented christie in a scandal that resulted in two of the governor s aides being convicted  christie  who was a close adviser to trump during the  presidential campaign and whose name was floated as a possible comey replacement  was never charged  christie on wednesday called wray  an outstanding choice  a non political choice  to head the fbi  wray works as a king   spalding litigation partner and represents companies and individuals in a white collar criminal and regulatory enforcement matters  king   spalding has represented russian companies including state gas monopoly gazprom  according to its website  according to the website  the firm s energy practice also has represented businesses taking part in deals involving russian entities including state owned oil major rosneft  the firm has previous ties to trump  bobby burchfield  a partner in its washington office  serves as ethics adviser for the trust set up in january to isolate trump from the day to day operations of the trump business organization  the agreement has been criticized by some ethics experts as inadequate  apart from possible conflicts  another question about wray is whether the longtime white collar lawyer is equipped to take over an agency that is increasingly focused on detecting and combating terrorism  espionage and cybercrime   there are questions about whether he is experienced enough in intelligence  counter terrorism  counter narcotics  computer crimes  and issues like that   said one senior u s  law enforcement official who asked not to be identified   the biggest test the bureau is likely to face is not another enron   the official said  trump announced his selection of wray in a surprise  early morning twitter message  some democratic lawmakers said the president s timing seemed intended to distract from comey s scheduled testimony   it is imperative that the next fbi director be of unimpeachable integrity and independence   nancy pelosi  the top house of representatives democrat  said   in light of the president s constant efforts to block the truth  the nomination of christopher wray should be subject to the utmost scrutiny   republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said wray s  impressive credentials make him more than ready  to lead the fbi  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan said he did not know wray but that his resume suggests he is  the perfect kind of person  for the job
