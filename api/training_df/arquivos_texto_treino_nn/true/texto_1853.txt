washington  reuters    when president donald trump spoke to reporters on air force one on wednesday  he went out of his way to praise democratic congressional leaders he had met earlier at the white house  he failed to mention mitch mcconnell or paul ryan  the two leaders of his own republican party who also took part  it could have been a snub or mere oversight   the white house did not say immediately   but in the context of recent events  it was a reminder of trump s lingering frustration with republicans who control congress  even as he takes his first steps with democrats to break a congressional gridlock   trump  who has branded democrats as obstructionists  on wednesday embraced a proposal from senate democratic leader chuck schumer and his counterpart in the house of representatives  nancy pelosi  for a three month extension of the u s  debt ceiling  rejecting a republican plan for a longer extension  by contrast  at a meeting on tuesday with mcconnell  the senate majority leader  and ryan  speaker of the house of representatives  both fellow republicans  there was little personal interaction in the presence of reporters   a close trump associate said that trump  a  year old brash former reality tv star who had never held public office before he entered the white house in january  had yet to comprehend the need to improve his relationship with mcconnell  a  year old dour legislative tactician with more than  years in the u s  senate  his legislative priorities hanging in the balance  trump is under pressure to improve ties with mcconnell and salvage what he can of an increasingly jeopardized agenda that includes a healthcare overhaul  immigration  infrastructure and tax reform   you want to go blow up the majority leader  that s your prerogative  but it doesn t get your agenda done  if you want to get things done  you have to make nice to him   the source said      a senior white house official said on wednesday that trump and mcconnell had a  great working relationship  and the president respected his grasp of senate rules and procedures  but aides say trump privately has expressed annoyance at the slow pace of legislative action on his priorities and blames his own party  especially mcconnell  for the failure  a republican close to the white house said what trump  doesn t understand is he needs mitch mcconnell more than anyone else in this town  because he runs the senate and sets the agenda    mcconnell is a master of the senate and he could and should be trump s biggest asset   the republican said  trump spent part of recent months feuding with mcconnell  after a healthcare overhaul effort collapsed in the senate in july  trump and mcconnell traded accusations  mcconnell said in his home state of kentucky that trump had  excessive expectations  of how much could get through congress in a short period of time and suggested trump was inexperienced  clearly annoyed  trump questioned mcconnell s competence   senator mitch mcconnell said i had  excessive expectations   but i don t think so  after  years of hearing repeal   replace  why not done   trump tweeted  a source familiar with trump s thinking said the president  had a lot of respect for mcconnell   he just doesn t like to be criticized and he viewed mcconnell s comments as demeaning   the source said  an associate of mcconnell said mcconnell considered the usual drama surrounding trump to be  totally irrelevant  to doing business with him and that from a  practical standpoint  all mcconnell wanted to do was get work done   he s pretty drama free   said the associate   i have yet to encounter a single situation where he allows his personal feeling or animosity or any kind of emotional response affect the way he does business   mcconnell  whose wife  elaine chao  is trump s transportation secretary  has said he has no hard feelings after trump s criticism of him   we have a lot of work ahead of us  and we are committed to advancing our shared agenda together and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation   mcconnell had said
