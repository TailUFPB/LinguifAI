washington  reuters    the republican led u s  senate finance committee unanimously on thursday approved president donald trump s pick for the treasury department s top tax policy job  sending the nomination on to consideration by the full senate  david kautter  a former senate legislative aide and long time tax policy expert  would play a key role in the republican push to overhaul the u s  tax code this year  if confirmed by the  seat chamber as assistant treasury secretary for tax policy    i m hoping that he can be confirmed by the full senate in short order   said senator orrin hatch  the finance committee s republican chairman    no floor vote has been scheduled    kautter was most recently a tax partner at the firm rsm  which provides tax and audit services  he was also director of american university s kogod tax center and had a long career at the auditing and consulting firm ernst   young llp  republicans are trying to pursue tax reform along partisan lines though a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation  which would allow them to pass tax legislation by a simple majority in the senate  republicans control the chamber by only a   margin and would need  votes for tax reform without reconciliation  democrats reject the republican approach to tax reform  which they say would benefit corporations and the wealthy but do little for middle class families      senator ron wyden  the finance panel s top democrat  said he decided to support kautter because he believed the nominee would work to make tax reform a bipartisan effort between republicans and democrats   bringing both sides together on the tax reform question is the key to a major set of economic reforms that will help us create more good paying jobs and grow wages for working class families   wyden said   it is my hope that mr  kautter can help bring republicans and democrats together   democrats initially criticized kautter for not doing more as national tax director at ernst   young to prevent a tax avoidance scandal involving tax shelters for wealthy clients that led to criminal charges more than a decade ago   kautter told lawmakers in a hearing this week that he regretted not doing more
