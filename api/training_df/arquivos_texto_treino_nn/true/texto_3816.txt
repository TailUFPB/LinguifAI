washington  reuters    a major challenge to the u s  watchdog for consumer finances fizzled on thursday  as congress missed a deadline to repeal the agency s new rule on prepaid cards  late last year  the consumer financial protection bureau issued a rule requiring greater disclosures and overdraft limits for the cards sold by companies such as mastercard inc   ma n  and greendot and frequently used in place of paychecks  the timing made the rule eligible for congress to repeal it under the congressional review act  cra   but lawmakers only had until thursday to kill the regulation by passing a disapproval resolution in both chambers with simple majorities  republican senator david perdue of georgia  one of the agency s biggest critics  had introduced a resolution that he tried to speed through his chamber  but congressional aides and advocacy groups said he could not gather enough votes  perdue has repeatedly said the cfpb  created in the  dodd frank wall street reform law to protect individuals against fraud  oversteps its authority  earlier this week he said he intends to keep up pressure on the agency   the resolution s failure indicates that future regulations from the cfpb  reviled by many republicans  may have shots at survival  the agency is led by democrat richard cordray  was created by former president barack obama  a democrat  and was originally conceived by massachusetts senator elizabeth warren  a leader in the liberal wing of the democratic party  the cfpb was expected to soon finalize restrictions on the fine print in contracts known as  mandatory arbitration clauses  that require consumers to give up their rights to class action lawsuits as a condition of buying a service or product  but the rule s fate has been caught in limbo  congress is expected to kill it swiftly with a cra resolution once it is official  while the first half dozen cra resolutions flew easily through congress  repealing a wide spectrum of obama era regulations  the final resolutions faced a tougher time  one limiting methane emissions from oil and gas production on public lands failed on wednesday  all told  congress killed  regulations since feb    lawmakers could still vote after this week to repeal rules that obama finished in the last six months of his administration  but they will need super majorities in each chamber  which is nearly impossible to achieve in the more closely divided senate
