washington  reuters    members of the house freedom caucus called on congressional leaders friday to introduce a formal tax reform proposal by the end of july  and suggested they could support a  budget deal in exchange for adding welfare reform to any tax overhaul  the conservative bloc  which has enough members to stymie legislation in the republican controlled house of representatives  will play a key role in efforts to agree on a  fiscal plan that could determine whether president donald trump and congress can deliver the biggest tax reform since the reagan era  the caucus has already called on republican leaders to secure a tax reform deal by keeping congress in session through august  when lawmakers are due to take a lengthy summer break     we need to get tax reform done sooner than later  and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of july   representative chairman mark meadows  chairman of the freedom caucus  told a heritage foundation forum  meadows recommended that republican leaders acknowledge that there is no consensus on the controversial border adjustment tax proposal favored by house speaker paul ryan to move the tax debate forward   a border adjustment tax on imports has been promoted as a way both to attack the u s  trade deficit and generate revenues that would help avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit  trump  however  did not include a border adjustment tax in his proposed budget  representative jim jordan  freedom caucus co founder  said tax reform could have trouble moving forward because house republicans are having trouble agreeing on a budget with reconciliation instructions needed to allow republicans to bypass democrats in passing a tax overhaul   if you don t get a budget agreement  you can t get reconciliation  if you don t have reconciliation  you can t get tax reform   jordan told the forum  he suggested that freedom caucus members could agree to higher budget spending levels if reconciliation instructions included welfare reforms intended to save   billion in spending over a decade    we think that is the key to unlocking this road block that we re in  i don t see any other way out of it to get a budget agreement   jordan said  meanwhile  meadows voiced support for allowing u s  corporations to repatriate an estimated    trillion in cash held overseas at a reduced  percent tax rate  meadows said the caucus does not plan to support a proposal that would allow full expensing for corporations  a policy backed by house republican leaders  the policy  which would allow companies to write off capital investments immediately  would be too expensive without the border adjustment tax and revenue raising proposals that caucus members oppose
