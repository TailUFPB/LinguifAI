washington  reuters    the u s  house of representatives on wednesday passed a    trillion spending bill to fund the government through september and avoid federal agency shutdowns on saturday when existing money is depleted  with the   vote in the republican controlled chamber  the legislation now goes to the senate  which is expected to pass it before a midnight friday deadline  the pentagon is a big winner in the legislation  with defense spending rising significantly  while the bill cleared the house easily  dozens more democrats voted for it than republicans  many of whom oppose most spending measures  this was the first major legislation to pass the house this year with bipartisan support and marks republican president donald trump s first legislative victory  even though he railed against some of its provisions  the legislation bulks up federal funding for border security but does not pay for starting construction on a u s  mexico border wall that trump promised to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs  trump had said he would make mexico pay for the wall  but the mexican government refused  making it necessary for the new administration to ask congress for the money  democrats and many republicans have argued that a wall is an ineffective and wasteful way of securing the southern border  another battle over the barrier is expected when congress tries to pass a spending bill for the fiscal year starting oct    trump already has begun focusing on that upcoming fight  in a tweet on tuesday  he taunted lawmakers  saying   our country needs a good  shutdown  in september to fix mess   the legislation would add    billion this fiscal year for the pentagon  with another    billion available after trump gives details on his plans for defeating the islamic state militant group  it ignores many of the spending cuts on domestic programs the white house had sought and adds   billion for the national institutes of health    million for puerto rico s underfunded medicaid healthcare for the poor and   million to fight fires in western states  but the legislation is late in coming  the fiscal year began last oct   and for the last seven months federal agencies have been operating mainly on simple extensions of the previous year s funding and the priorities that came with that
