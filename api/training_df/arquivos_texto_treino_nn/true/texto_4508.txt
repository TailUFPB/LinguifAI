washington  reuters    democrats on monday corralled enough support to hold up a senate confirmation vote on president donald trump s supreme court nominee but republicans threatened to change the senate rules to ensure conservative judge neil gorsuch gets the lifetime job  the senate judiciary committee voted   along party lines to send gorsuch s nomination to the full senate  setting up a political showdown this week between trump s fellow republicans and the opposition democrats that appears likely to trigger a change in long standing senate rules to allow his confirmation  democrats  portraying gorsuch as so conservative he is outside the judicial mainstream  have amassed  senators in support of a procedural hurdle called a filibuster requiring a super majority of  votes in the republican led   seat senate to allow a confirmation vote  even before the panel voted  committee member christopher coons put the democrats over the threshold as the  senator backing the filibuster bid   graphic   where senators stand on bid to block gorsuch vote tmsnrt rs    the senate s republican leaders insist gorsuch will be confirmed on the senate floor on friday regardless of what the democrats do  republicans hold a   senate majority  in the face of the filibuster  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell would be expected to force a confirmation vote by having the senate change its rules and allow for a simple majority vote for confirmation of supreme court justices  a move sometimes called the  nuclear option  that trump favors  senate democratic leader chuck schumer  leading the filibuster effort  said mcconnell should have the  vision and courage to see past this impasse  and not  go nuclear   suggesting that trump replace gorsuch with a new consensus nominee chosen after meeting with democrats  senate confirmation of gorsuch    would restore the nine seat high court s conservative majority  fulfilling one of trump s top promises during the  presidential campaign  trump in january nominated gorsuch  a conservative appeals court judge from colorado  he could be expected to serve for decades  on the senate floor  mcconnell called the democratic strategy  a new low   saying there was no principled reason to oppose a judge as well qualified and widely respected as gorsuch  he did not explicitly say he would use the  nuclear option   but several republicans said that would happen  white house spokesman sean spicer said the decision would be mcconnell s  republican senator john mccain  a long time opponent of senate rules changes  told reporters he would support the move  judiciary committee republicans blasted democrats for pursuing what they called the first  partisan filibuster  of a supreme court nominee   there was a successful bipartisan filibuster five decades ago against a democratic president s nominee   and said it would come to naught because of the threatened rule change  but it was senate republicans who last year refused to even consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump has selected gorsuch to fill   democrats  including me  are still furious at the way judge merrick garland was treated last year  but the traditions and principles that have defined the senate are crumbling  and we are poised to hasten that destruction this week   coons said  gorsuch was nominated to fill a vacancy created by the february  death of conservative justice antonin scalia  democrats have accused gorsuch of being insufficiently independent of trump  evading questions on key supreme court rulings of the past including on abortion and political spending  and favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans  republicans control the white house and congress for the first time in a decade  the inability of senate republicans to coax enough democratic support to avoid the  nuclear option  reflected the intense partisan divide in washington and the trump administration s failure to win the cooperation of the opposition party  senators dianne feinstein  the committee s top democrat  and panel member patrick leahy  along with fellow democrats mark warner and ben cardin  also announced filibuster support on monday  spicer accused democrats of partisan obstruction that sets  a very dangerous precedent  and told a briefing that  we re obviously disappointed that the overwhelming majority of them are still playing politics with the nation s highest court   the actual confirmation vote would be by a simple majority if the filibuster is stopped  to date  four democrats oppose a filibuster  four short of the eight that republicans needed  with the failure of republican healthcare legislation in congress and with courts blocking the president s ban on people from several muslim majority nations from entering the united states  winning confirmation for gorsuch has taken on even more importance for trump  the  vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has over the decades forced the senate to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments  republican committee member lindsey graham said   if we have to  we will change the rules  and it looks like we re going to have to  i hate that  i really  really do   while gorsuch s opponents would fight a senate rule change  it was the democrats who in  changed the senate rules to limit filibusters after republicans used the procedure against obama s appeals court nominees   the senate  then led by democrats  barred filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices  even if republicans do change the rules  legislation  as opposed to appointments  would still need to meet a  vote threshold
