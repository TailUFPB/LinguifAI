washington  reuters    president donald trump survived one of the biggest threats to his presidency when thursday s hugely awaited congressional testimony by the fbi chief he fired did not yield any explosive new disclosures about his campaign s alleged ties with russia  but former fbi director james comey s remarks to a packed hearing of the senate intelligence committee left the republican president far from unscathed  comey recounted in vivid detail conversations with trump that he viewed as an effort to undermine an investigation of possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia  he also said trump s comments after firing him on may  that the fbi was in disarray and that its members had lost confidence in comey  were lies  plain and simple   still  comey handed trump and his supporters some fresh ammunition when he confirmed he had told the president the investigation was not focused on him personally  even senator marco rubio  who was among a number of republicans who battled trump for the  republican presidential nomination  seemed to be advocating for him at times during the hearing  rubio asked comey why he did not directly tell trump that he thought the president was making inappropriate requests of him  comey replied that he did not know   i was a bit stunned  and didn t have the presence of mind   he said  a republican close to trump said the president felt very good about comey s testimony  particularly since it bore out his earlier statement that the former fbi director had told him he was not under investigation  but the cloud from the russia probe still hangs heavily over trump s white house   comey s firing set the stage for the appointment of a special counsel  robert mueller  who has taken over the investigation  congressional probes  including one by the senate intelligence panel  are ongoing  russia has denied interference in last year s presidential campaign  the white house has denied any collusion with moscow  but senator dianne feinstein  a democrat who sits on the intelligence committee  said the matter was nowhere near over   it s a big investigation  and these are facts      you have to dig for  and do a lot of analysis   several democrats said trump s conversations with comey seemed to build a case of obstruction of justice   the lawyers are going to dig into obstruction of justice   senator ron wyden  a democrat on the intelligence panel  said after the hearing   i believe the evidence just keeps piling up that there has been a very real presidential abuse of power   but paul ryan  the republican speaker of the house of representatives  said trump s interactions with comey may have reflected his lack of political experience rather than an effort  to pressure the fbi director  ryan said trump may not have been  steeped  enough in the fbi s independence from the white house   he s new in government  and so therefore i think he s learning as he goes   he told reporters   i m not saying it s an acceptable excuse  it s just my observation   trump could face even more problems over the coming months if the stream of details leaking out about the russia investigation continues to grab the spotlight at a time when the white house wants to focus on priorities such as rolling back the obamacare healthcare law and overhauling the tax code   it distracts the administration and gives republicans in the house and the senate  many of whom have not been trump supporters from the beginning  a reason to keep their distance and not get behind him   said andy smith  director of the university of new hampshire survey center  which conducts political polling   it s going to be a long summer   smith said  trump s core supporters are hunkering down for a fight  great america alliance  one pro trump group  spent    this week running ads attacking comey  said eric beach  who runs the group  the ad lambasted comey as  just another d c  insider  and included images of militant attacks abroad to suggest comey had not been focused enough on protecting americans  but the investigation has contributed to a steady erosion of trump s political capital  according to a reuters ipsos opinion poll taken from june  to   even before the comey testimony    percent of americans said they approved of trump  versus  percent who disapproved    i think the situation is getting much more serious for mr  trump   said jon bond  a political science professor at texas a m university   the mueller investigation is going on  i suspect that information that came out in today s hearings is going to feed into that investigation  it looks like to me that the president is in increasing jeopardy
