washington  reuters    former fbi director james comey said on wednesday that u s  president donald trump asked him to drop an investigation of former national security adviser michael flynn as part of a probe into russia s alleged meddling in the  presidential election  in written testimony released the day before he appears before the senate intelligence committee  comey said trump told him at a meeting in the white house in february   i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go  to letting flynn go   the testimony puts more pressure on trump  a republican  whose presidency has been overshadowed by allegations that moscow helped him win last year s election  some legal experts said comey s testimony could strengthen any impeachment case built on obstruction of justice  but u s  markets shrugged off the news from the testimony for lack of any major disclosures  to build a criminal obstruction of justice case  federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent  it does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation  while a sitting president is very unlikely to face criminal prosecution  obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment  comey said he had told trump on three occasions he was not being investigated  confirming an earlier account from the president  trump  who spent part of wednesday in ohio talking about the need to fix the nation s crumbling infrastructure  ignored reporters  shouted questions about comey  on returning to the oval office  trump went into a meeting with top advisers  including chief of staff reince priebus  later  his outside counsel released a statement saying trump felt  completely and totally vindicated  by comey s account   the president is pleased that mr  comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any russian probe   marc kasowitz  trump s attorney  said in a statement  several congressional committees  as well as the fbi and a special counsel  are investigating whether russia tried to tilt last november s election in trump s favor  using means such as hacking into the emails of senior democrats  trump and the kremlin have separately denied any collusion  trump abruptly fired comey  who was leading the federal bureau of investigation s probe  on may   comey painted a vivid picture for senators of awkward encounters with trump in seven pages of testimony  comey described a private dinner in the green room of the white house on jan    where trump asked him whether he wanted to stay on as fbi director  telling him   i need loyalty  i expect loyalty    i didn t move  speak  or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed  we simply looked at each other in silence   comey said in his testimony  explaining he became concerned that trump was trying to create  some sort of patronage relationship   on feb    after an oval office briefing on counterterrorism  trump asked comey to stay behind  dismissing attorney general jeff sessions and his son in law jared kushner  who lingered  and waving off priebus  who peeked through the door   when the door by the grandfather clock closed  and we were alone  the president began by saying   i want to talk about mike flynn    comey said in his testimony  trump had fired flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the russian ambassador to the united states  the fbi has been investigating flynn as it looks into allegations of links between russia and the trump campaign  comey quoted trump as telling him   i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go  to letting flynn go  he is a good guy  i hope you can let this go   on march   trump phoned comey and asked what  we could do to lift the cloud  of the fbi s russia investigation   he said he had nothing to do with russia  had not been involved with hookers in russia  and had always assumed he was being recorded when in russia   said comey  who had briefed trump on  salacious material  that had arisen in a counter intelligence investigation  michael cohen  a lawyer for trump  said in a statement that the uncorroborated dossier of compromising material that russian operatives allegedly collected on trump has been  debunked     comey s statement released today needs to be carefully scrutinized as his testimony claims the president was concerned about the dossier   said cohen  cohen  along with flynn  has been subpoenaed by the house intelligence committee  which is also conducting a russia probe  some legal experts said comey s written statement could be used to show that trump engaged in obstruction of justice   it shows the president was doing everything he could to shut down the flynn investigation   said andrew wright  a professor of criminal law at savannah law school   bruce green  a professor of law at fordham university school of law  said it would be difficult  however  to show that trump intended to obstruct justice  trump could say he was merely vouching for flynn s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function effectively as president  green said  democrats jumped on the testimony  expressing concern that trump had inappropriately meddled with the probe   it s certainly very possible that this is evidence  in combination with other actions by the president  that could amount to obstruction  it s certainly an effort to interfere in the investigation   the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  representative adam schiff  told cnn  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan  asked about trump s request for loyalty from comey  said it was  very  very critical  that fbi directors remain  independent   but republican senator richard burr  who heads the senate intelligence panel  said he did not take issue with trump s request   i don t think it s wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody in an administration   burr said
