washington  reuters    since mid   u s  house speaker paul ryan has carried around a  postcard  that he has said shows how easy it will be for americans to file their taxes once republicans are finished their tax overhaul  and as recently as thursday president donald trump touted americans being able to  file their taxes on a single  little beautiful sheet of paper       with lawmakers finalizing the biggest tax reform in  years and the president ready to sign it into law before the end of the year  the moment should be near when ryan s postcard stops being a rhetorical prop and becomes a reality  right   it s kind of crazy to say you can file on a postcard when  first  no one is going to put their social security number on a postcard  and second  you already have a giant postcard in the form of the    mark mazur  a director of the nonpartisan tax policy center  said  citing a  line internal revenue service  irs  tax form  representatives from the   billion u s  tax preparation industry said that the legislation so far seemed unlikely to render their services unnecessary   i don t think you re going to have millions of people filing their taxes on a cell phone   said mark steber  chief tax officer at jackson hewitt tax service inc    i think the demise of the tax business is a bit premature   the irs would not discuss changes that might come from the proposed tax overhaul  however  the irs estimates that  despite its efforts to make filing taxes easier   percent of americans use tax preparation services such as jackson hewitt  h r block inc and liberty tax inc or tax software such as turbotax from intuit inc      if congress enacts the republican plan into law  it would not affect  tax year returns filed in   but in    millions of middle class americans would no longer gain from a wide range of deductions  credits and other tax breaks  a key driver of this  according to independent analyses  would be a proposed doubling of the standard deduction and a curtailment of the deduction for state and local tax payments  in combination  these two changes would mean that about  million people would no longer benefit from itemizing  so they would stop writing off their charitable donations  mortgage interest and state and local tax payments  according to the institute on taxation and economic policy  a think tank  itemized deductions for medical expenses  investment interest  unreimbursed employee expenses and tax preparation fees could also be dropped by many   personal exemptions for individual taxpayers  which now take up a lot of space on tax forms  would also be eliminated   such changes would mean simpler taxes and possibly allow a number of taxpayers to use shorter forms  the irs expects  million people in  to file the longest and most widely used irs form today  the form   which is  lines long  about   million people will use the  line   wealthy americans likely would still itemize under the republican plan  owning businesses  homes and other factors could also lead to taxes being more complicated than what filers could describe on a postcard   even though we re talking about simplification for a large number of taxpayers  there s still many taxpayers who will have complicated tax situations and we ll be there to help them as well   said david williams  chief tax officer for turbotax   adds first name  title in  paragraph
