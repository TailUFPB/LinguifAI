washington  reuters    u s  democrats took to the senate floor on monday to throw a spotlight on behind the scenes efforts by the republican majority to repeal former president barack obama s healthcare law  known as obamacare  in a series of floor motions  inquiries and lengthy speeches  democrats criticized the closed door meetings that republicans have been holding to craft a replacement for obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  they called for open committee hearings and more time to consider the bill before a senate vote  which republicans say could come in the next two weeks  although a draft bill has yet to emerge publicly  lacking the votes to derail or change the republican process  the maneuvers by the democratic minority seemed more aimed at highlighting republican efforts on a controversial issue  polls have said that a majority of americans disapprove of the obamacare replacement that has passed the house of representatives and that senate republicans are now considering  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said that the closed door republican meetings on healthcare amounted to  the most glaring departure from normal legislative procedure that i have ever seen     republicans are writing their healthcare bill under the cover of darkness because they are ashamed of it   schumer charged  the resulting legislation would likely throw millions out of health insurance  he said  while granting  a big fat tax break for the wealthiest among us   senators are not obligated to hold meetings in the open  but democrats pointed out that there were lengthy committee meetings and many days of floor debate on obamacare before it passed in   several democrats moved for the healthcare legislation to be referred to senate committees for hearings  but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell refused  mcconnell said all republican senators have been involved to some degree in healthcare meetings and that democrats would have a chance to amend the legislation they produce  once it is brought to the senate floor   we re going to have a meeting on the senate floor  all hundred of us  with an unlimited amendment process   mcconnell said   so there will be no failure of opportunity   senate republican leaders would like a vote on healthcare legislation in july  before the july  recess if possible  but republicans have struggled to coalesce around a bill  with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions  senate republicans also face pressure from the right  in the house  conservatives have written to mcconnell to express concern about reports that say the senate may water down the house bill
