 reuters    u s  president donald trump took office on jan   with a long list of promises for his first  days  his record has been mixed  here are the main issues he has confronted and what he has achieved ahead of saturday s  day   a pledge to repeal and replace the  affordable care act  president barack obama s signature domestic policy  was among trump s central  election campaign promises  it is also one of the biggest failures of his first  days   a bill in the house of representatives was withdrawn in late march when republicans could not muster enough votes for passage even though they control the chamber   a reworked plan this week has drawn support from the house freedom caucus  the conservative bloc that helped sink the original bill  that improves the chances of a deal in the house though it is unclear if it can win enough support from moderate republicans  and it would face tougher challenges in the senate    trump repeatedly promised the biggest tax reform since the   this week he proposed legislation to slash the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  cut the top personal income tax rate to  percent  repeal the inheritance tax  and temporarily slash the rate on overseas profits repatriated to the united states  the plan  however  is vague and even senior republican lawmakers described it as offering only  guideposts  for legislative changes   trump s foreign policy has been marked by major shifts  russia  trump spoke admiringly of russian president vladimir putin during the campaign and indicated he wanted a rapprochement with moscow  but the administration has not been able to fend off a controversy that has led to a congressional investigation into russian meddling in the  election  including possible links between trump s campaign and moscow  trump has cooled considerably toward putin  putin condemned trump s decision in early april to launch cruise missile strikes on syria in punishment for a chemical weapons attack by the syrian government  and trump said the relationship with russia  may be at an all time low    north korea  a growing nuclear and missile threat from north korea is perhaps trump s most serious security challenge  he has vowed to prevent north korea from being able to hit the united states with a nuclear missile  a capability experts say pyongyang could have some time after   trump s administration aims to push north korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure  he has pressed china  north korea s biggest trading partner  to do more to curb pyongyang s nuclear program   nato  trump alarmed u s  allies during the election campaign by calling nato  obsolete   in mid april he lavished praise on nato and said it is not obsolete   syria  trump had vowed to avoid entanglements in middle east conflicts and  in his first days in office  said he did not want the united states dragged deeper into the syrian conflict  but he responded to the chemical weapons attack  which killed dozens of people  by ordering strikes on a syrian air base  that won praise from allies in europe and from u s  lawmakers   trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigrants entering the united states and the deportation of illegal immigrants living in the country  especially those with criminal records  he also pledged to build a wall along the border and to get mexico to pay for it   the approach and strong rhetoric have had an effect with the number of migrants caught trying to enter the country illegally hitting a  year low in march  the number of children traveling with a guardian and apprehended at the southern u s  border plunged by more than  percent in march from december  trump insists he will build the border wall  but in order to lift the threat of a government shutdown  he gave way on his demand this week that congress include full funding for it in a spending bill   trump campaigned on a promise to bar the entry of muslims into the united states  casting it as part of the fight against the islamic state militant group  on jan    he ordered a temporary ban on the entry of nationals from seven muslim majority countries  including syria  he also indefinitely banned refugees from syria and temporarily banned refugees from all other countries  a federal judge temporarily halted the ban  and a federal appeals court upheld that ruling  trump issued a revised travel ban in early march  only to see it again blocked in federal court  similarly  a federal judge this week blocked his order to withhold federal funding from so called sanctuary cities  which offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants   this is one of trump s clearest wins  his promise to select a like minded successor to justice antonin scalia  who died early last year  was kept with the nomination of neil gorsuch  the senate confirmed gorsuch despite democratic opposition  restoring a conservative majority on the court   trump withdrew the united states from the trans pacific partnership trade deal just days after his inauguration  keeping a campaign promise  trump had both threatened to withdraw from or renegotiate the north american free trade agreement  nafta   blaming it for an exodus of u s  jobs to mexico  the threats of withdrawal had jolted financial markets at various times  on thursday  trump extended an olive branch  saying he would not terminate nafta after the leaders of mexico and canada asked him to work on a new trade deal    trump also ordered a review of the causes of u s  trade deficits  such as dumping of products below cost  unfair subsidies   misaligned  currencies  and  non reciprocal  trade practices   trump had vowed to name china a currency manipulator  meaning the united states could then impose tariffs on chinese goods  but in mid april he changed course and said that china was not a currency manipulator  trump has acted aggressively on his promise to eliminate regulations that he said were hurting the u s  economy  he issued a permit for the controversial keystone xl pipeline  he also rescinded obama era climate change regulations  including the clean power plan  a ban on coal leasing on federal lands  and rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production   as part of a push to open up more federal lands to drilling  mining and other development  trump ordered a review to identify national monuments that can be rescinded or resized  legal challenges are expected   his administration has approved a dozen measures rolling back regulations passed in the final months of the obama administration on the environment  energy  education and financial services  trump has pledged to keep u s  companies from shipping jobs overseas  before taking office  trump used the muscle of his election victory to threaten companies about moving jobs abroad  he claimed victories with the carrier unit of united technologies corp  utx n  and with ford motor co  f n   though carrier still cut hundreds of jobs in indiana and ford said it scrapped plans for a mexican factory because of declining demand for small cars in north america  the jury is still out on how successful he can be in keeping jobs from going overseas  trump ordered a review of the h  visa program  which brings highly skilled foreign workers into the united states  he says he wants to modify or replace the current lottery system with a merit based system for highly skilled workers   this was one of trump s rallying cries during the campaign  saying he would change washington by cracking down on the influence of special interests and political elites  he criticized democratic opponent hillary clinton for her paid speeches to wall street bank goldman sachs but has named several former goldman executives to his inner circle  he did ban appointees of any executive agency from lobbying for five years after leaving government employment and permanently banned future former appointees from activity on behalf of any government or political party abroad
