moscow  reuters    russia risks being saddled with u s  sanctions for decades  curbing economic growth and preventing it from regaining its status as a leading economic power  an adviser to president vladimir putin said in an interview  alexei kudrin told reuters that the current proposed tightening of sanctions in washington should not have any serious impact  but he called for a major structural reform program after the  presidential election  he said that was the only way for russia to return to growth of more than  percent a year  putin has not yet said whether he will run for re election next year  but is widely expected to do so and to win what would be a fourth term as president  putin has tasked kudrin  who has known putin since they worked together in the st petersburg mayor s office in the   with devising a strategy to lift russian economic growth after   whereas putin oversaw several years of growth in excess of  percent in his early presidential terms  the russian economy suffered two years of contraction in  and  and is forecast to grow by a little over  percent this year  in may gdp rose by   percent year on year  but that pace is not expected to last  the slowdown has put putin under pressure  u s  lawmakers earlier this week voted to impose new sanctions on russia   on top of earlier penalties over its role in the ukraine conflict   and kudrin said the mood in washington meant it would be difficult for u s  president donald trump to ease sanctions in future   in its current form the tightening of sanctions under discussion wouldn t seriously affect the russian economy  there aren t serious changes with the version that exists  but the hope that sanctions would be canceled in the coming years has now faded   kudrin said   we are likely to end up with the story with the old jackson vanik amendment   even when all the conditions had already changed  they couldn t cancel it   he said  jackson vanik  a  provision to a u s  federal law that punished former communist bloc countries for restricting human rights  was only repealed in  under previous u s  president barack obama  it was a major sticking point in relations between moscow and washington  trump was widely perceived to be the kremlin s favored candidate in last year s u s  presidential race  and his white house victory raised hopes in moscow that sanctions could be relaxed as early as this year  but trump s administration has since become bogged down in investigations into possible ties between his campaign and russia  trump has said his campaign did not collude with russia  which flatly denies allegations it meddled in the u s  vote  kudrin  who served as finance minister from  to   won praise from foreign investors for building up russia s formidable fiscal buffers during an era of high oil prices  he  was one of relatively few liberal voices among top officials  he now heads the centre for strategic research  an analytical group founded on putin s initiative to draft policy ideas  kudrin said western sanctions in their current configuration were knocking off around   percent from russian gross domestic product  down from  percent in the year after they were introduced in   russia had a  window of opportunity  after the  election in which to enact meaningful reforms to counteract the effects of sanctions  he said  but for now a populist camp around putin appeared to have the upper hand over those calling for reform   to what extent the president will use that   we don t know   kudrin said   after previous elections that window for reforms wasn t used   among the reforms kudrin is calling for are greater public control over law enforcement officials  raising the retirement age  reducing government stakes in large companies  and improving revenue collection from the shadow economy  he said he thought the state should sell government stakes in russian oil companies in stages over the next six to  years  and that it could sell a portion of its majority holding in the country s largest bank sberbank in the same time period  with such reforms  kudrin said russia could increase its economic growth rate to   percent in five to six years  even with sanctions staying in place  without reforms  russia will not notice the damage from sanctions before it is too late  he said   in the next six to seven years we could not notice the decline in the areas of productivity and technological development  in the end we will see it  because others will grow faster  but by then it will be difficult to change something
