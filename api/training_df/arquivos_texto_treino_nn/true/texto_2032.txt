washington  reuters    u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan on thursday rejected speculation that future tax legislation could include temporary tax cuts for businesses  saying macro economic elements of tax reform including rates must be permanent   we very passionately believe that permanence is very  very important  so the big decision making provisions in the tax code    that stuff s got to be permanent   ryan said in an interview with cnbc television   there are other things you can do that can have time dates on it  to make sure that the numbers work  but the big macro economic policies   the rates and things like that   that stuff has to be made permanent   ryan also said republicans intend to keep a popular homeowner deduction for mortgage interest payments that some have talked about capping to help pay for tax cuts  but he indicated the deduction could change   we recognize  acknowledge and believe you need to maintain the mortgage interest deduction  whether it can be improved and how it works  that s a discussion we ll have on an ongoing basis   ryan said  president donald trump and republicans in congress have vowed to slash business tax rates and overhaul the u s  tax code before year end  with a republican only strategy that requires a special parliamentary procedure to get legislation through the senate on a simple majority  republicans control the senate by only a   margin  but they have struggled to find ways to pay for lower rates without violating senate rules by expanding the federal deficit outside a  year budget window  lobbyists say closed door discussions between congress and the trump administration have considered an approach that would make tax cuts sunset after a decade  avoiding a senate rule violation  but without permanent tax rates  ryan said that businesses would be less likely to make the multi year  multibillion dollar investments necessary for driving economic growth  which republicans say is their ultimate goal   there are some who have said that because of our budget process  we might want to go temporary  it doesn t actually work that way   he said   permanence works  permanence is necessary and permanence is absolutely doable
