washington  reuters    if democrats thought it was hard to stop president donald trump s first u s  supreme court nominee  it promises to be even tougher for them if he gets to fill another vacancy  potentially to replace the most influential justice  anthony kennedy  kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the court s liberals in key cases such as on gay rights and abortion  is one of three justices  or older  justice stephen breyer is  and fellow liberal ruth bader ginsburg is   former kennedy supreme court clerks said the justice  who turns  in july  may be pondering retirement either this year or in   that would give trump a further chance to shape the court after his first nominee  neil gorsuch  was sworn in on monday for the lifetime job to replace the late conservative justice antonin scalia after overcoming fierce democratic opposition in the senate confirmation process  kennedy administered gorsuch s judicial oath at a white house ceremony  and trump heaped praise on a justice who has spent nearly three decades on america s top court  calling him  a great man of outstanding accomplishment   gorsuch is one of kennedy former clerks  kennedy is planning a reunion of his clerks in june rather than next year as had been expected  kennedy  through a court spokesman  declined to comment on his plans  the implications for the court if kennedy were to step down are enormous  for the past decade he been its swing vote in major cases  gorsuch s confirmation restored the court s   conservative majority  if whenever kennedy leaves the bench he is replaced by a stalwart conservative  that would move the court further to the right  republicans possess a   majority in the senate  in order to secure gorsuch s confirmation  they voted to prohibit a procedural roadblock called a filibuster that had required a super majority of  votes to allow a confirmation vote for supreme court nominees  leaving the minority democrats with little ammunition for the next nomination fight   i think it will be very hard for democrats to get much traction to derail a future trump nominee without the threat of a filibuster   george washington university political scientist sarah binder said  but democrats and republicans still are predicting a fierce fight over the next court vacancy   for the life of me i don t understand why the democrats made such a fuss about this one  they look stupid   republican senator orrin hatch said last week of gorsuch s nomination   i expect armageddon on the next one because that s going to change  assuming trump gets another one  the direction of the court  it would certainly keep the court in a more conservative mode for a long time   a democratic congressional aide added   the opposition to gorsuch could look weak compared to what a similarly conservative nominee would face  if it would tip the balance on the court    kennedy is the longest serving of the nine justices  he was nominated by republican president ronald reagan in  and confirmed by the senate in  after democrats thwarted reagan s first choice  outspoken conservative robert bork  and his second pick  douglas ginsburg  withdrew from consideration  although he has sided with his conservative colleagues on many issues  kennedy has supported liberal causes such as gay rights  culminating in writing the landmark  ruling legalizing same sex marriage nationwide  he also joined the liberals in upholding abortion rights  in   kennedy joined the court s four liberal justices in a ruling striking down a texas abortion law imposing strict regulations on doctors and facilities in the strongest endorsement of u s  abortion rights in more than two decades  he also authored a  ruling upholding the consideration of race in college admissions  joined by the court s liberals  university of georgia school of law professor lori ringhand said republicans may be wary of defending an extremely conservative court nominee with the midterm congressional elections coming up in   if another vacancy arises   it s not clear it would be to the electoral advantage to republicans to have a hotly contested supreme court nomination right before the midterms that highlighted a nominee s extremely conservative positions on social issues that the majority of the public have actually accepted   ringhand said
