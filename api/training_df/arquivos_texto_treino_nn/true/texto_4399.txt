 reuters    u s  president donald trump said on thursday he ordered a targeted military strike against an airfield controlled by syrian president bashar al assad s forces  a deadly chemical attack was launched this week from that base   this action was appropriate and just    resolving the years long crisis in syria is a complex task  but bashar al assad must be held accountable and his enablers must be persuaded to change course  i look forward to the administration further engaging congress in this effort     building on tonight s credible first step  we must finally learn the lessons of history and ensure that tactical success leads to strategic progress  that means following through with a new  comprehensive strategy in coordination with our allies and partners to end the conflict in syria    it is critical that assad knows he will no longer enjoy impunity for his horrific crimes against his own citizens  and this proportional step was appropriate  as we move forward  it will be important for the administration to engage with congress and clearly communicate its full strategy to the american people    assad was warned  repeatedly  by the u s  and the u n  that the intentional targeting of innocent men  women and children is intolerable  now assad has been caught red handed carrying out another abhorrent chemical attack  and the administration has taken a measured response   representative adam schiff  ranking member  house intelligence  i will be reintroducing an authorization for use of military force against isis and al qaeda when congress returns to session  congress cannot abdicate its responsibility any longer and should vote on any use of force not made in self defense  this is necessary whether action is taken against terrorist groups or  as here  against regime capabilities    making sure assad knows that when he commits such despicable atrocities he will pay a price is the right thing to do   it is incumbent on the trump administration to come up with a strategy and consult with congress before implementing it   senator ben cardin  top democrat on senate foreign relations  i cannot emphasize this enough  any longer term or larger military operation in syria by the trump administration will need to be done in consultation with the congress  furthermore  it is the president s responsibility to inform the legislative branch and the american people about his larger policy in syria  as well as the legal basis for this action and any additional military activities in that country   senator marco rubio  republican on senate foreign relations  what must follow is a real and comprehensive strategy to ensure that assad is no longer a threat to his people and to u s  security  and that russia no longer has free rein to support his regime    while we all condemn the atrocities in syria  the united states was not attacked  the president needs congressional authorization for military action as required by the constitution  and i call on him to come to congress for a proper debate  our prior interventions in this region have done nothing to make us safer  and syria will be no different    my preliminary briefing by the white house indicated that this was a measured response to the syrian nerve gas atrocity  any further action will require close scrutiny by congress  and any escalation beyond air strikes or missile strikes will require engaging the american people in that decision    while i m encouraged that the trump administration has felt compelled to act forcefully in syria against the assad regime  i m gravely concerned that the united states is engaging further militarily in syria without a well thought out  comprehensive plan  frankly  the president s actions today generate more questions than answers
