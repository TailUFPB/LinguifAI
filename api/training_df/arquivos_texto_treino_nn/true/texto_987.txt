washington  reuters    president donald trump is leaning toward nominating federal reserve governor jerome powell to be the next head of the u s  central bank  two sources familiar with the matter said on friday  the sources cautioned that while powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five  trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind   i will be announcing it sometime next week   trump said in a video statement on instagram   it will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job  i have someone very specific in mind and i think everyone will be very impressed    trump has said he has been considering powell  as well as stanford university economist john taylor  for the post  he also has said he has not ruled out renominating current fed chair janet yellen  whose term expires in february      he is expected to announce his pick  which would need to win senate approval  before he departs on a trip to asia on nov    the term of current fed chair janet yellen ends in february   though her term as a federal reserve board governor does not expire until   trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser  gary cohn  and former fed governor kevin warsh  a senior administration official said on wednesday that trump was unlikely to nominate cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in congress    trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank  which has dimmed the prospect of him giving a new term to yellen  another source said  in an interview with fox business network last friday  trump indicated he could nominate both powell and taylor for top jobs at the central bank  a vice chair post is currently open
