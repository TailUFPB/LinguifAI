aspen  colo   reuters    former cia director john brennan on friday criticized as  disgraceful  president donald trump s efforts to play down u s  intelligence agencies  assessment that russia meddled in the  u s  election  trump s administration has been dogged by investigations into allegations of russian interference in last year s u s  presidential election and possible ties with his campaign team  speaking one day before his first meeting with russian president vladimir putin in hamburg earlier this month  trump said he suspected russian interference in the election but that no one knows for sure   these types of comments are just disgraceful     and the person who said them should be ashamed of himself   said brennan  cia chief under former president barack obama  at the aspen security forum  special counsel robert mueller and several u s  congressional committees are investigating whether russia interfered in the election and colluded with trump s campaign to try to swing the race in his favor over democratic rival hillary clinton   those probes are focused almost exclusively on moscow s actions  lawmakers and intelligence officials have said  and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries  moscow has denied any interference  and trump has said that  his campaign did not collude with russia  brennan said he was disappointed by the president s handling of security issues in his first six months in office   i must say there are disappointments that i see in terms of what mr  trump is doing on the international stage that i think pose serious questions about how he is keeping safe our national security   brennan said  speaking at the same event in aspen  james clapper  the former director of national intelligence under obama  was also critical of trump s administration  asked if jared kushner  trump s son in law and top adviser  should have his security clearance canceled for initially failing to list on a disclosure form contacts he had with russians  clapper said it should be suspended pending a review   i do think the appropriate thing here is take a pause and at least suspend a clearance until you ve had the opportunity to investigate and then decide whether the clearance should be restored or not   clapper told the same panel  brennan and clapper also criticized trump s remarks in a tweet earlier this year about u s  spy agencies in which he accused them of practices reminiscent of nazi germany    that  tweet  was a terrible insulting affront not to me or john  we get paid the big bucks to take that  but i m talking about the rank and file  the people in the trenches  men and women  the patriots in the intelligence community and that was completely inappropriate   said clapper
