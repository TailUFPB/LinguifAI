washington  reuters    a grand jury has issued subpoenas in connection with a june  meeting that included president donald trump s son  his son in law and a russian lawyer  two sources told reuters on thursday  signaling an investigation is gathering pace into suspected russian meddling in the  u s  election  the sources added that u s  special counsel robert mueller had convened the grand jury investigation in washington to help examine allegations of russian interference in the vote  one of the sources said it was assembled in recent weeks  russia has loomed large over the first six months of the trump presidency  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that russia worked to tilt the presidential election in trump s favor  mueller  who was appointed special counsel in may  is leading the probe  which also examines potential collusion by the trump campaign with russia  moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign  while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witch hunts    at a rally in huntington  west virginia  on thursday night  trump said   most people know there were no russians in our campaign      we didn t win because of russia  we won because of you   mueller s use of a grand jury could give him expansive tools to pursue evidence  including issuing subpoenas and compelling witnesses to testify  the wall street journal earlier reported a grand jury was impaneled   a spokesman for mueller declined comment  a grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who  working behind closed doors  considers evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing that a prosecutor is investigating and decides whether charges should be brought   this is a serious development in the mueller investigation   said paul callan  a former prosecutor    given that mueller inherited an investigation that began months ago  it would suggest that he has uncovered information pointing in the direction of criminal charges  but against whom is the real question    a lawyer for trump  jay sekulow  appeared to downplay the significance of a grand jury  telling fox news   this is not an unusual move   u s  stocks and the dollar weakened following the news  while u s  treasury securities gained  it was not immediately clear to whom subpoenas were issued and the sources did not elaborate   some lawyers said it would put pressure on potential witnesses to cooperate with mueller s investigation    when someone gets a subpoena to testify  that can drive home the seriousness of the investigation   said david sklansky  a professor at stanford law school and a former federal prosecutor   in   a grand jury convened by special counsel patrick fitzgerald returned an indictment of lewis  scooter  libby  a top aide to then vice president dick cheney   a special counsel can bring an indictment and it has happened before   said renato mariotti  a partner at the law firm thompson coburn and a former federal prosecutor  news last month of the meeting between donald trump jr  and a russian lawyer who he was told had damaging information about his father s presidential rival  democrat hillary clinton  fueled questions about the campaign s dealings with moscow   the republican president has defended his son s behavior  saying many people would have taken that meeting  trump s son in law and white house senior adviser jared kushner and former trump campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting  one of the sources said major russian efforts to interfere in the election on trump s behalf began shortly after the june meeting  making it a focus of mueller s investigation  ty cobb  special counsel to the president  said he was not aware that mueller had started using a new grand jury   grand jury matters are typically secret   cobb said   the white house favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly      the white house is committed to fully cooperating with mr  mueller   john dowd  one of trump s personal lawyers  said   with respect to the news of the grand jury  i can tell you president trump is not under investigation   a spokesman for manafort declined to comment   lawyers for trump jr  and kushner did not immediately respond to requests for comment  trump has questioned mueller s impartiality and members of congress from both parties have expressed concern that trump might dismiss him  republican and democratic senators introduced two pieces of legislation on thursday seeking to block trump from firing mueller   sekulow denied that was trump s plan   the president is not thinking of firing bob mueller   sekulow said  one source briefed on the matter said mueller was investigating whether  either at the meeting or afterward  anyone affiliated with the trump campaign encouraged the russians to start releasing material they had been collecting on the clinton campaign since march   another source familiar with the inquiry said that while the president himself was not now under investigation  mueller s investigation was seeking to determine whether he knew of the june  meeting in advance or was briefed on it afterward  reuters earlier reported that mueller s team was examining money laundering accusations against manafort and hoped to push him to cooperate with their probe into possible collusion between trump s campaign and russia  it is not known if the grand jury is investigating those potential charges
