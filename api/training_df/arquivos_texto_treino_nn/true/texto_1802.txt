 reuters    republican lawmaker devin nunes  investigation into whether obama administration officials used classified intelligence reports to discredit donald trump s  campaign team could backfire on the congressman   and the president  sources familiar with the reports said  the reports contain no evidence that any aides to former democratic president barack obama acted improperly  the sources said  but they do indicate some trump associates may have violated an obscure  law  the logan act  which prohibits unauthorized u s  citizens from negotiating with a foreign government that has a dispute with the united states  the spying reports also are relevant to the investigation by special counsel robert mueller into conclusions by u s  intelligence agencies that russia worked to tilt last november s election in republican trump s favor  said the sources  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  mueller s office declined to comment  russia  under u s  sanctions for rights abuses and its  annexation of crimea  has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling  trump has denied any possible collusion between his campaign and moscow  an issue that has loomed over the new presidency  nunes  chairman of the u s  house intelligence committee and a trump ally  met secretly earlier this year with a white house intelligence aide and then accused obama officials of having requested the names of u s  citizens seen in intercepts of communications with russians and other foreigners  the white house did not respond to requests for comment  the names would have been routinely censored from intelligence agency intercepts  but nunes charged that obama s aides had leaked the information to try to undermine trump while he was running for president  a spokesman for then united nations ambassador samantha power  whom nunes and other republicans accused of digging for political dirt  said she read intelligence reports only as part of her normal duties  a spokesman for former obama national security adviser susan rice  whom republicans also accused of misusing intelligence  did not respond to requests for comment  mueller is investigating meetings and conversations between trump associates and russian and other foreign officials and businessmen  they include trump s adviser and son in law jared kushner  the president s eldest son donald trump  jr   former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and former national security adviser michael flynn    an obvious question is how all these meetings and conversations were set up   said one of the sources   who set them up  what was their purpose  what were the agendas  who approved them  who was briefed on them afterward  signals intelligence might shed some light on that   representatives for the trump associates did not respond to requests for comment  democratic lawmakers have said that nunes and others have made the assertions about the leaks to distract attention from two congressional investigations and mueller s probe into the russian matter  the national security agency masks the names of u s  citizens in intercepts  but officials with the necessary security clearances can request them for intelligence purposes           unmasking americans is extremely sensitive  and unmasking political opponents is really problematic   said a congressional official  also speaking on the condition of anonymity  if obama officials asked for the names or failed to justify any requests  that warranted investigation  the official said    asked for hard evidence that power or other aides misused intelligence for political purposes or leaked such information to the media  the official declined to comment
