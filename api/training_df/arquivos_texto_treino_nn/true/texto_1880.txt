 reuters    financial markets have fretted about the fiscal situation in washington  with deadlines looming in late september and early october to keep the u s  government open and raise the debt ceiling  as congress returned on tuesday  aiding those affected by hurricane harvey and responding to president donald trump s decision to scrap a program shielding immigrants brought to the u s  illegally as children from deportation added to their already packed agenda  here is what you need to know about fiscal and other politically connected issues in play this month  the  debt ceiling  is a legal cap on how much money the u s  government can borrow through bonds and other debt issued by the u s  treasury  it now stands at about    trillion  very close to the actual national debt   once the ceiling is hit  congress must raise it  if it does not  the government cannot keep borrowing  this matters because the government spends more than it collects in taxes and washington continually borrows money to cover its bills  legislation to raise the debt limit will need to be adopted by early october at the very latest  the treasury  however  has said that congress must increase the debt ceiling by sept    since march  the treasury has been using  extraordinary measures  to stave off hitting the ceiling and likely could be stave off default a few more weeks by using such extraordinary measures  analysts have said   if the debt ceiling is not raised and the government can no longer pay its bills  default would result  along with a likely downgrade in the u s  credit rating  this has never happened before  but there have been some close calls  a standoff in august  cost the country its top notch bond rating from the credit ratings agency standard   poor s and caused the most jarring two weeks in financial markets since the   global financial crisis  congress is supposed to pass annual spending bills around the end of the federal fiscal year on sept   to fund most of the u s  government  but disagreements often prevent this  when that happens  lawmakers usually pass a temporary bill extending current spending levels with no changes for a short period  it is expected this will happen again at the end of this month  likely extending current funding levels into december  congress returned from its long summer recess having only about  working days to pass a spending measure  probably a short term patch  known as a continuing resolution  to keep the government open  if even a short term patch cannot be agreed upon in congress  or if the president decides to veto either a long term or short term spending measure  the government would shut down  the last time the government shut down was in october  for about two weeks  in the    and   there were  shutdowns  shutdowns hurt federal workers  rattle markets and shake confidence in the united states abroad  but they have done little lasting economic damage  the two move on separate tracks but could get tangled together as some analysts have said that congress may try to tackle both issues at the same time  perhaps in a single piece of legislation  passing an initial tranche of federal aid  expected to be about   billion  for individuals affected by hurricane harvey now tops the congressional agenda   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday that raising the debt ceiling  keeping the government open and passing an assistance package for harvey victims were three  critically important things  that congress needed to get done quickly   there has been some speculation that harvey aid could be tied to a short term continuing resolution or a measure raising the debt ceiling  or that all three could be linked in some way  separate from harvey assistance is the national flood insurance program  operated by the federal emergency management agency  which expires on sept     the program provides insurance policies for homeowners that cover up to    in damages  congressional disagreements over changes to the program  which operates in debt to the treasury  have complicated plans to restructure the program in the past  it is not yet clear how harvey  which will generate additional claims made to the cash strapped program  will affect the timing and scope of its renewal  trump on tuesday scrapped an obama era program known as deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  that protects from deportation those who were brought illegally to the u s  when they were children   trump has delayed implementation of his decision for six months  saying it would give congress time to figure out a legislative fix that would affect almost   young people who participate in the program  known as dreamers  it is not yet clear whether congress will work to quickly pass a measure affecting the dreamers or pursue a larger scale overhaul of the immigration system  the chances that the republican led congress will continue making a priority of repealing and replacing former president barack obama s signature healthcare law are slim after previous efforts ended in defeat  but important obamacare related deadlines loom  the trump administration has been making obamacare payments to insurers that reduce out of pocket costs for lower income americans on a month to month basis and must decide before the end of september whether to make october s payment  if it does not  congress could step in to approve the payments with additional legislation  related to but not a part of obamacare is the children s health insurance program  chip  a federal insurance program for millions of lower income children and pregnant women that requires congressional reauthorization by sept    chip reauthorization is not typically contentious as the program receives bipartisan support  but lobbyists and industry officials have said any healthcare related legislation has become more complicated in the wake of the obamacare repeal and replace failure  trump kicked off the new legislative session s tax reform effort on tuesday by inviting key republican leaders to the white house  an outline of the plan being developed could come as early as the week of sept    senate republicans want to use a special process known as budget reconciliation to pass tax reform  because then they would only have to find a simple majority of  senators to pass it instead of the  votes that typically required in the  seat senate  where republicans hold  seats   but to use this process  republicans will first have to pass a  budget resolution  which they so far have been unable to do
