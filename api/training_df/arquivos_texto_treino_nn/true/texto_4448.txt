washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump has told visitors that his mar a lago retreat is set up perfectly for foreign visits  but the chinese side was initially hesitant when word came that trump would like to meet chinese president xi jinping there  according to administration officials  even after seeing images of japanese prime minister shinzo abe s back slapping sessions with trump at mar a lago in february  chinese officials thought the oceanfront  spanish style club in palm beach  florida  lacked the symbolic significance of the white house itself   they thought  no  it has to be the white house  the symbolism of that   a senior administration official told reuters   they were ultimately convinced that this was worth doing  it s unusual because most foreigners realize that being invited to the president s personal place is a big deal   trump and xi are to hold their first summit encounter beginning on thursday at mar a lago  a property that original owner marjorie merriweather post s estate willed to the u s  government for use as a diplomatic and presidential retreat after her death in       chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told reporters in beijing that the chinese side was fine with having the meeting there   president trump  after taking office  announced that mar a lago would be the winter white house  the u s  proposal to hold the u s  china heads of state meeting there  i think  represents the importance that the u s  side places on this meeting  china respects the u s  side s arrangements   she said  no matter where the heads of state meet   the most important thing is to develop china u s  relations and make contributions to both countries and the world   she said  topping the agenda at mar a lago will be u s  china trade ties and u s  requests for china to help rein in its nuclear armed neighbor north korea   trump bought the estate in  and turned it into an exclusive club  which now boasts a membership fee of    and is a haven for the tony palm beach set who pull up to the gate in bentleys and rolls royces               it s a place where he feels comfortable and at home  and where he can break the ice with xi jinping without the formality  really  of a washington meet up   said another senior white house official  xi and his wife  peng liyuan  will join trump and his wife  melania  for dinner on thursday night then trump and xi will have a series of meetings there on friday  the entire visit will last less than  hours   what matters is that the two of them get together for a successful summit  even if it s on the moon   said former u s  ambassador to china  max baucus    however  i do think that mar a lago will probably help enhance conversation between the two of them  president trump can show president xi around  show him the digs  trump is very proud of that  and president xi will be interested in seeing all of that       the two leaders are not expected to make public appearances but there are likely to be occasions for a pool of the news media to see them  no joint news conference was expected   past u s  presidents have often turned to settings away from the trappings of washington to conduct delicate diplomacy  george h w  bush had his seaside estate in kennebunkport  maine  and george w  bush frequently played host to foreign leaders at his ranch in crawford  texas  trump s immediate predecessor  barack obama  used the sunnylands retreat in rancho mirage  california  as a site for an informal summit with xi in   while trump treated abe to golf  no such outing is planned for the leader of china   mar a lago has already been the scene of some controversy for trump  when a north korean missile test disrupted abe s visit there  trump and the japanese leader were seen at a dinner table on the terrace discussing how to respond  as club members looked on from nearby tables
