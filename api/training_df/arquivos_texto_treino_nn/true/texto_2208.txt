bedminster  nj  reuters    president donald trump said on friday he was being sarcastic when he thanked russian president vladimir putin for saving the united states money by ordering cuts in u s  diplomatic staff in russia  asked whether he was being sarcastic  trump told reporters   in order to reduce our payroll  absolutely  i think you know that   trump said without explicitly criticizing the move  breaking nearly two weeks of silence on putin s july  order cutting u s  embassy and consulate staff by nearly two thirds  trump said on thursday   i m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll   adding  there s no real reason for them to go back   trump s remarks rekindled criticism of his kid glove handling of putin  especially as he has not shied away from being highly critical of members of his own party  including attorney general jeff sessions and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  putin  reacting to new sanctions imposed by the u s  congress and reluctantly signed into law by trump  ordered washington to cut its diplomatic and technical staff by  people by sept    many of those affected likely will be local russian staffers  it was also a reaction to former president barack obama expelling  russian diplomats from the united states last december over the intelligence agency reports   i was just speaking to the secretary  of state rex tillerson  and we re talking about coming up with an answer     by september  we ll have a response   trump said  congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating the conclusions of u s  intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the  election campaign by hacking and other methods to help trump  a republican  they are also looking into possible collusion between the campaign and russian officials  moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and trump denies any campaign collusion  during his campaign and since becoming president  trump has consistently called for better ties with russia  declined to criticize putin and refused to unequivocally embrace the conclusions of the intelligence agencies  trump s remarks were immediately denounced by current and former u s  officials who have served both republican and democratic administrations  the remarks also raised some eyebrows in europe   i would have to say in my experience  it is  one of the most bizarre things i have ever heard from any government official  not just the u s    ojars kalnins  chairman of the foreign affairs committee at the latvian parliament  told reuters earlier on friday   thanking another foreign leader for firing people from their embassy is unprecedented  it s bizarre
