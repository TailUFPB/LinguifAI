 washington  reuters    president donald trump on thursday ran into resistance for calling ousted fbi chief james comey a  showboat   an attack that was swiftly contradicted by top u s  senators and the acting fbi leader  who pledged that an investigation into possible trump campaign ties to russia would proceed with vigor   in his first interview since firing comey on tuesday  trump appeared to try to underscore that comey s dismissal was about his performance at the federal bureau of investigation and not about the russia probe   trump faces accusations from democrats that he fired comey to hinder the fbi investigation into u s  intelligence agency allegations that russia meddled in the  presidential election to benefit trump  the probe has hung over trump s presidency since he took office in january and threatens to overwhelm his policy priorities    he s a showboat  he s a grandstander   trump told nbc news   the fbi has been in turmoil  you know that  i know that  everybody knows that    trump s characterization was at odds with that of the top republican and democratic lawmakers on the senate intelligence committee   at a hearing on thursday  the republican chairman of the panel  richard burr  and the top democrat  mark warner  praised comey  warner said he was offended at trump s remarks   acting fbi director andrew mccabe  testifying in place of comey  contradicted trump s appraisal of turmoil at the fbi  saying that comey had  broad support  from the rank and file  and still does to this day    a white house spokeswoman on thursday morning had said that trump was expected to soon visit fbi headquarters  but msnbc later reported that plan had been thrown out after agency officials told the white house that trump would not be greeted warmly following his firing of comey   several candidates are being considered to replace comey  a senior white house official said  including mike rogers  a former republican representative  trey gowdy  a republican representative and former federal prosecutor  alice fisher  assistant attorney general in the george w  bush administration  and ray kelly  former commissioner of the new york police department   the nominee must be confirmed by the u s  senate   mccabe promised to tell senators of any white house meddling into the agency s probe on russia  democrats have called for a special counsel to look into the matter    it is my opinion and belief that the fbi will continue to pursue this investigation vigorously and completely   mccabe told the senators   moscow has denied interference in the election  and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia   in firing comey  trump said he knew he ran the risk he would  confuse people  and  lengthen out the investigation  into ties to russia    in fact when i decided to just do it  i said to myself  i said   you know  this russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story  it s an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they should have won   he told nbc   trump said in the interview that he never pressured comey into dropping the fbi probe  adding   if russia did anything  i want to know that   trump said there was no  collusion between me and my campaign and the russians   but that  the russians did not affect the vote    his explanation of why he fired comey ran counter to previous administration explanations of comey s dismissal   the white house and vice president mike pence had said trump fired comey on the recommendation of attorney general jeff sessions and no   justice department official rod rosenstein   on thursday  trump said he would have taken the action regardless   i was going to fire comey  my decision   trump said   i was going to fire regardless of recommendation    rosenstein  who met privately with some senators on thursday  was invited to brief all  senators next week  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said  schumer said he hoped that sessions would also speak to senators separately on the firing of comey   in the house of representatives  justin amash  a republican member of the conservative house freedom caucus  said on twitter that he had signed onto democratic sponsored legislation calling for an independent  bipartisan commission to probe russian meddling in last year s u s  election campaign   u s  intelligence agencies concluded that russian president vladimir putin ordered an effort to disrupt the election that included hacking into democratic party emails and leaking them  with the aim of helping trump   leaders of the u s  intelligence agencies  including director of national intelligence dan coats and cia chief mike pompeo  testified to the senators on thursday that they agreed with that finding   trump  in his interview  also gave further details of his account that comey had told him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation in the russia matter   trump said he had asked comey once over dinner and twice by telephone   i said   if it s possible  would you let me know  am i under investigation    trump told nbc   he said   you are not under investigation     trump said the dinner with comey was at the white house and comey wanted to discuss staying on as fbi chief   we had a very nice dinner  and at that time  he told me   you are not under investigation     white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said she believed it was not a conflict of interest for a president to ask the fbi chief such a question   comey has not publicly discussed any conversations he had with trump   at the senate hearing  mccabe testified it was not typical practice to tell people they were not a targets of an investigation   republican chairman burr asked mccabe whether he ever heard comey tell trump that the president was not the subject of investigation  mccabe sidestepped the question  saying he could not comment on an ongoing probe   warner  the top democrat on the panel  said it was  hard to avoid the conclusion  that trump s firing of comey was related to the russia investigation    and while it s clear to me now more than ever that an independent special counsel must be appointed  make no mistake our committee will get to the bottom of what happened during the  presidential election   warner said
