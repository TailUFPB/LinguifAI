washington  reuters    senator lisa murkowski  an alaska republican  won a decades long battle on wednesday to open part of an arctic wildlife reserve in her state to oil and gas drilling  but democratic senators and conservationists vow the war has only begun   the tax bill passed by congress contains language pushed by murkowski and supported by president donald trump to hold two lease sales in the   million acre    hectare   area on the northern coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife refuge  or anwr   democrats and environmentalists deplore the prospect of development in anwr  home to polar and grizzly bears   species of birds  and where gwich in natives depend on migrating herds of porcupine caribou   senator maria cantwell  a democrat  said the fight over the drilling was not over   in fact i would say today is the beginning   said cantwell adding that democrats would make sure the trump administration follows all environmental laws before allowing drilling  murkowski said anwr oil would provide jobs  reduce u s  imports of crude and help fill the trans alaska pipeline  a source of oil for the u s  west coast  the pipeline is now operating at a quarter of its capacity  after alaskan production slumped in recent years   trump  expected to quickly sign the tax bill into law  said he had not been aware that fellow republican politicians had long been trying to get at the oil in anwr    a friend of mine who is in the oil business said   i can t believe it  anwr  they ve been trying get it for  years    trump said at the start of a cabinet meeting  trump said opening anwr  a move supported by some members of the native i√±upiat tribe  would put the country  already the world s top oil and natural gas producer  at a new level  but environmentalists said there were many stages  such as applications by companies to conduct seismic tests in the refuge  at which they could block drillers with lawsuits over endangered species and other environmental laws   suzanne bostrom  a lawyer at trustees for alaska  a nonprofit environmental law firm  said opponents would scrutinize applications by energy companies for exploration  development  leasing and oil and gas production   we will be working every step of the way to make sure that the coastal plain is protected   said bostrom  the interior department will carry out environmental reviews of the lease sales  one to be held within four years and another within seven years  that opponents will track   environmental lawyers have had success in stopping drilling in the harsh and frigid arctic  in   royal dutch shell ended a   billion quest to find oil offshore alaska partly because environmental groups uncovered a little known law that limited the number of drilling wells  analysts at british bank barclays said environmentalists could delay the lease sales and project approvals and  may discourage investment  entirely  still  the bank said if new surveys show promising anwr deposits  the region could attract producers that drill in frontier regions in latin america and the middle east  senator edward markey  a longtime opponent of arctic drilling  said the republican tactic of including the drilling in a bill that only needed  votes in the senate could backfire and help democrats pick up seats in the  congressional elections  nobody knows how much oil the refuge contains  but the u s  geological survey estimated in  that the  area held about   billion barrels of recoverable crude   but a global oil glut that has kept domestic oil prices at levels below   a barrel may prevent wide success in anwr  in a lease sale this month for land in arctic alaska  less than  percent of the   million acres    million hectares  received bids from oil companies
