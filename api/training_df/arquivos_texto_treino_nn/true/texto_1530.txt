 washington  reuters    the trump administration is making it more difficult for skilled foreigners to work in the united states  challenging visa applications more often than at nearly any point in the obama era  according to data reviewed by reuters      the more intense scrutiny of the applications for h  visas comes after president donald trump called for changes to the visa program so that it benefits the highest paid workers  though he has not enacted any such reforms   data provided by u s  citizenship and immigration services shows that between jan   and aug    the agency issued   challenges  or  requests for evidence   rfes   to h  visa petitions   a  percent increase over the same period last year  the total number of h  petitions rose by less than  percent in the same period   the challenges  which can slow down the issuance of visas by months  were issued at a greater rate in  than at any time in the obama administration except for one year    according to the uscis data  which has not been previously reported   the trend is likely to cheer supporters of trump s hardline stance on immigration  they say visas for skilled foreigners undercut american workers by replacing them with low paid employees shipped in from abroad  but major tech companies  universities and hospitals contend the visas allow them to fill highly specialized jobs for which there are sometimes few qualified americans   h  visas allow foreign workers  generally with bachelor s degrees or higher  to work for three years at a time  often in the technology  healthcare and education sectors  microsoft  msft o   amazon  amzn o   google  googl o   apple  aapl o   intel  intc o   oracle  orcl n  and facebook  fb o  were heavy users of h  visas in   according to uscis data   the uscis inquiries typically challenge the basis of the original petitions and assert that the employers do not qualify for the visas  employers and their lawyers must then provide further evidence to prove their need and eligibility for the visas   to be sure  the obama administration also issued a large number of h  challenges   nearly     from january through august   and a similar number in    immigration attorneys have for years complained about redundant and burdensome challenges to high skilled employment visas  but they say they are seeing a new trend in the trump era   in addition to querying applications more often  the trump administration is targeting entry level jobs offered to skilled foreigners  the lawyers say this violates the law governing h   because it allows for visa holders to take entry level jobs   several attorneys said they view the increase in challenges and focus on entry level jobs as a stealth campaign by the administration against the h  program in the absence of public regulatory changes or changes passed by congress  which could be debated and decided in the open    one way to have an immigration policy that s consistent with the policy that s been articulated by the trump administration is to put more scrutiny on h  cases   said cyrus mehta  a new york based immigration attorney   uscis spokesman robert c  langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyers or the sharp spike in rfes this year  in an email  he said the agency is applying  currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirements to evaluate petitions    partners healthcare is a healthcare system that includes massachusetts general hospital and brigham and women s hospital  two prestigious teaching hospitals for harvard medical school  it has received more than  rfes from uscis so far this year  compared to fewer than  all of last year in response to a similar number of h  petitions  said anthony pawelski  an immigration attorney who handles h  applications for partners   uscis questioned the hospitals  connection to the university even though their applications included proof of their non profit status  a  agreement between harvard medical school and the hospitals and even text from the hospitals  website referencing a  year history with the university  pawelski said    they re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudications and in their mind close any perceived loopholes   he said   langston declined to comment on specific h  petitions   it is still unclear how the increase in challenges will affect the number of visas issued this year  in the  fiscal year  uscis approved  percent of  b petitions  by june  of this year  the agency had approved  percent of h  petitions  although that number is incomplete because it does not take into account the last three months of the  fiscal year  when a large portion of h  applications are processed   both democratic and republican lawmakers have criticized h  visas  because the biggest beneficiaries are outsourcing firms  which critics say use the program to fill lower level information technology jobs and replace american workers  members of both parties have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa s use   in an april executive order  trump directed a review of the  b program  aimed at ensuring the visas  are awarded to the most skilled or highest paid  applicants  the order itself did not implement changes but directed agencies to suggest reforms    what the trump administration has done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that companies are misusing the h  system   said russell harrison  director of government relations at ieee usa  the american branch of the institute of electrical and electronics engineers   the group opposes the h  program but supports giving more high skilled foreigners employment based permanent residence   many of the government challenges for visas for entry level jobs either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job does not count as a  specialty  occupation  as required by the h  program  according to a review of hundreds of rfes by the american immigration lawyers association provided to reuters   entry level jobs are positions for fresh university graduates with little or no work experience  such jobs can pay  level   wages  the lowest of four tiers    an rfe may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position   said langston  the uscis spokesman   the uscis data did not specify what positions the rfes challenged or the reasons for the challenges   lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by uscis in the challenges   that specialty jobs cannot be entry level  they point to young doctors and engineers  for instance  who may not have work experience but have spent years learning technical skills   though the challenges can come across all industries  the aila review showed software developers and computer systems analysts were challenged more often than other jobs   silicon valley tech giants either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment on whether they had been receiving more rfes   the requests can increase legal fees associated with each h  visa by as much as half  attorneys said  government fees for h  visas can run upwards of     and standard fees paid to lawyers per application can easily reach    or more   the increased costs and hassle could discourage employers from hiring such foreign workers especially at junior levels  immigration lawyers said   jeffrey gorsky  an attorney with berry appelman   leiden llp  one of the largest corporate immigration firms in the country  said one of the firm s clients  a mid sized tech company  was hit with six rfes from uscis in a single day this year   between late  and the end of   the company received just one rfe on an h  visa petition  he said
