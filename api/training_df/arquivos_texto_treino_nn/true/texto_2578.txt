washington  reuters    president donald trump made a last ditch plea to u s  senate republicans on monday to  do the right thing  and fulfill seven years of campaign promises to repeal and replace former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  the senate will vote on tuesday on whether to open debate on an overhaul of the law  with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell promising an open amendment process and a  robust  debate   to every member of the senate i say this  the american people have waited long enough  there s been enough talk  and no action  now is the time for action   trump said on monday at the white house  standing in front of families who he said had been hurt by the law popularly known as obamacare  trump said   so far  senate republicans have not done their job in ending the obamacare nightmare   even as it remained unclear on monday whether mcconnell had enough votes in the senate to open debate  he said the vote would take place regardless   i know many of us have waited years for this moment to finally arrive  and  at long last  it finally has  i would urge every colleague to join me   mcconnell said  senator john mccain  who has been battling brain cancer in his home state of arizona  is expected to return to the senate to cast a vote  his office said on monday       moderate senator susan collins  who has vocally opposed mcconnell s efforts so far  said on monday she would vote  no  on a motion to proceed   republicans have been under heavy political pressure to make good on their longstanding campaign promises to gut the  law  which they view as a government intrusion in the healthcare market  but the party is deeply divided between moderates concerned the senate bill would eliminate insurance for millions of low income americans and conservatives who want to see even deeper cuts to the obamacare legislation  senate republicans have been unable to reach consensus on an approach  with mcconnell failing to secure enough votes for either a repeal and replacement of obamacare or a straight repeal  republicans hold a   majority in the  member senate  with democrats united in opposition  mcconnell can only afford to lose two republican votes    the question for every senator  democrat or republican  is whether they will side with obamacare s architects  which have been so destructive to our country  or its forgotten victims   trump said  while trump has repeatedly called on republicans to repeal and replace obamacare  he has shown little interest in the policy specifics  trump last week initially suggested he was fine with letting obamacare collapse  then urged republican senators to hash out a deal  his remarks on monday were among the lengthiest statements he has made regarding healthcare   obamacare is death  that s the one that s death   trump said   and besides that  it s failing so you won t have it anyway   mcconnell will ask senators whether to begin debate on the healthcare bill passed in may by the house of representatives  if that procedural vote succeeds  the house bill would then be open for amendment on the senate floor  the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated the senate s replacement bill could lead to as many as  million fewer americans being insured  a plan to repeal obamacare without replacing it could cost  million americans their health insurance by   cbo estimated  at the same time  premiums on individual insurance plans would rise  percent next year and double by  if obamacare is repealed  cbo said  uncertainty over the future of healthcare has left health insurance companies and u s  states as well as hospitals and doctors unclear about future funding and coverage  public opinion polls also show americans worried about potential changes to the healthcare system
