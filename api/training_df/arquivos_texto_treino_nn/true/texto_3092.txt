washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  congress  unable so far to resolve deep disagreements over spending for the fiscal year starting on oct    are mulling whether to seek a bipartisan budget deal with democrats similar to one reached nearly four years ago  with only  working days to go before a lengthy august recess  some republican lawmakers say a bipartisan agreement could help clear a legislative schedule crammed with other top priorities  including a separate budget resolution  tax reform  infrastructure and an increase in the federal debt limit  in december   republican representative paul ryan  now speaker of the house of representatives  and democratic senator patty murray worked out a two year deal that canceled some spending cuts in fiscal  and  in return for some longer term spending reductions  the ryan murray agreement was promptly enacted into law  a bipartisan deal could avert a restrictive spending plan that would cap funding for u s  agencies and a government shutdown threatened by president donald trump   i think what we need is another ryan murray sort of proposal   said republican representative mike simpson  a senior member of the house of representatives  appropriations committee  which is in charge of writing annual spending bills  speaking to reporters after a house republican meeting  simpson said the idea was in the early stages  republicans  who control the house and senate  have lashed out at deep spending cuts that trump has proposed  but they are divided over how much top line spending should be appropriated next year  including for a military buildup trump wants  a bipartisan negotiation is just one of several options  another would rush one massive spending bill for fiscal  through the house in july  instead of the dozen separate appropriations bills that congress tries to write every year  doing so would allow republicans to tout an accomplishment to their constituents in august during a year that has so far seen few legislative achievements  given the limited time to write such a bill  ryan might have to resort to just passing a  national security  spending bill that would fund the military and other security activities  some republicans want to boost military spending to   billion  which would require deep cuts to non defense programs that are popular among republican moderates    congress must also pass a budget resolution to facilitate tax reform legislation  the house budget committee hopes to mark up such a measure before june   panel members said
