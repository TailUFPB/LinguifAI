seoul  reuters    the escalating threat arising from nuclear armed north korea s recent series of missile tests is prompting south korea to beef up its military muscle and experts warn it could spur an arms buildup elsewhere in northeast asia  south korea and japan are accustomed to the north s frequent threats to attack  but the war of words between washington and pyongyang has raised fears of a sudden clash along the world s most militarised border dividing the two koreas  which might quickly escalate to all out war  after north korea s second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile  icbm  on july   south korean president moon jae in ordered a speedy deployment of the controversial u s  thaad anti missile defense system  reversing his earlier decision to postpone it pending an environmental review   this week  the u s  defence department said it was  actively  considering revising bilateral ballistic missile guidelines with south korea to allow seoul to build more powerful missiles   at the south s request  moon told u s  president donald trump in a telephone conversation on monday south korea also wants to build a nuclear powered submarine  presidential officials said   all of this could lead to further militarization of south korea   said yang uk  a senior research fellow at the korea defence and security forum  south korea  which spends around a tenth of its annual budget on defense  is already home to some   local soldiers and more than   u s  troops  the country  still technically at war with the north after the   korean war ended in a truce and not a peace treaty  has deployed the u s  built patriot missile defense system  as well as the terminal high altitude area defence  thaad  system  trump warned the north and its leader kim jong un against attacking guam or u s  allies on friday  a day after the isolated country said it was finalizing by mid august a plan to launch four intermediate range missiles toward waters off the u s  pacific territory   if north korea actually launches hwasong  missiles towards guam  they re going to do it with all their other missiles  artillery and tanks ready for action   said kim dong yub  a military expert at kyungnam university s institute of far eastern studies in seoul   and we should be prepared too   even before the latest spike in tensions  south korea was seeking to enhance its missile defense capabilities in the face of the unprecedented pace of north korean missile tests  japan  worried its ballistic missile defenses could be overwhelmed by swarm attacks or circumvented by warheads launched on lofted trajectories  is likely to acquire a ground based version of the aegis missile defense system  it is also mulling the acquisition of munitions that would allow it to strike north korea missile sites   the greatest threat to both states remains shorter range artillery  artillery rockets and stockpiles of short to medium range missiles  the focus will primarily remain upon bolstering defensive rather than offensive capabilities   said reed foster  a defense analyst for ihs jane s   i don t believe that there will be any significant altering of east asian procurement strategies  despite the rhetoric emanating from north korea  principally because for them the threat hasn t altered drastically   reed added  conservative lawmakers in seoul in recent days have even called for a  nuclear balance  on the peninsula  saying seoul should ask washington to redeploy u s  nuclear weapons if south korea is unable to develop its own  the united states withdrew nuclear weapons from south korea in   when the two koreas agreed to make the peninsula nuclear free  in violation of that agreement as well as u n  security council resolutions  north korea has conducted five nuclear tests   now is the right time to actively look at bringing back tactical nuclear weapons   chung woo taik  floor leader of the main opposition liberty korea party  told reuters   north korea broke the denuclearisation agreement a long time ago   reintroducing nuclear weapons remains an unlikely scenario  as that would undermine demands from seoul and washington for north korea to abandon its nuclear programs  for now  officials are instead focused on changing the missile guidelines  which allow seoul to have ballistic missiles with a flight range capped at  km   miles   topped with a maximum  kg    pounds  warhead  south korea is less focused on increasing the flight range  as that could face opposition from neighbors including china  russia and japan  and the  km range limit covers all of north korea in any case  senior government officials said  rather  seoul wants to double the maximum payload to   kg or greater  powerful enough to target underground bunkers or nuclear sites within the north  the officials said  that s still a fraction of the size of  the mother of all bombs   which the united states dropped on a suspected islamic state target in afghanistan in april  the   pound gbu  bomb is one of the largest non nuclear devices used in combat
