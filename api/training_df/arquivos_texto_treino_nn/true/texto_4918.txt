tokyo  reuters    the escalating threat from north korea s nuclear program shows a clear need for a  new approach   u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday  although he did not say what the trump administration planned  it was the first time that tillerson  who was speaking at a joint news conference in tokyo after talks with japanese foreign minister fumio kishida  had taken questions from the media since taking office in early february  two decades of diplomatic and other efforts  including u s  aid for north korea  had failed to achieve the goal of denuclearizing pyongyang  said tillerson  a former oil executive with no prior diplomatic experience  at the start of his first trip to asia as secretary of state   so we have  years of failed approach   tillerson said   that includes a period where the united states has provided    billion in assistance to north korea as an encouragement to take a different pathway    in the face of this ever escalating threat  it is clear that a different approach is required  part of the purpose of my visit to the region is to exchange views on a new approach   he said  a japanese foreign ministry official said u s  officials had discussed potential new approaches regarding north korea  but he declined to elaborate  as tillerson presses the chinese to do more to rein in north korea s nuclear and missile programs  he is expected to tell them the united states intends to increase missile defense in the region  despite beijing s strong opposition  a u s  official told reuters in washington  an advanced u s  anti missile system is being installed in south korea  and the official said the trump administration wants to discuss similar improvements with japan  tillerson visits south korea and china later in the week   tillerson is also likely to raise the prospects for imposing  secondary sanctions  on chinese banks and other firms doing business with north korea  the official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  it is among the options being considered in a full review of north korea policy expected to be completed by late march or early april  the official said state department spokesman mark toner said on wednesday tillerson will have  substantive  hard  talks on next steps in dealing with north korea but that his visit was not likely to produce an immediate specific response  in beijing  chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying repeated foreign minister wang yi s proposal last week that north korea should stop its nuclear and missile tests and south korea and the united states should stop joint military drills and seek talks instead   we welcome all parties  including the united states  to come up with their own proposals   hua told a daily news briefing   as long as these proposals are conducive to ameliorating the present tense situation on the korean peninsula and are beneficial to maintaining regional peace and stability     china will have an open attitude   tillerson made it clear he expected china  north korea s sole major ally  to do more   we will be having discussions with china as to further actions we believe they might consider taking that would be helpful to bringing north korea to a different attitude about its future need for nuclear weapons   he said  tillerson s comments in japan were eagerly watched by international observers for indications as to what they meant for the trump administration s foreign policy  japan is seeking clues to washington s policies both on north korea and china s increasing military and economic clout  while hoping to steer clear of trade rows  tillerson also held talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe and had dinner with kishida  u s  president donald trump made it a hallmark of his campaign to call on allies  including japan  to pay more for hosting u s  forces and other elements of american protection  tillerson issued a far gentler message at the conference  underscoring the  long standing  u s  japanese alliance   while the security environment in this region can be challenging  the united states is committed to strengthening our role  and we welcome an increased japanese commitment to their roles and responsibilities in our alliance   he said  tillerson is the second member of trump s cabinet to visit japan  defense secretary jim mattis visited last month  and vice president mike pence is due in april  underscoring u s  concerns surrounding north korea s missile and nuclear programs  abe was the first foreign leader who met trump after his november election win  north korea last week launched four ballistic missiles  the latest in a series  and is developing nuclear tipped missiles that can reach the united states  in defiance of u n  security council resolutions and sanctions  washington has said all options  including military  are on the table in its review of policies toward north korea  in the final months of the obama administration  u s  officials warned it would blacklist chinese companies and banks that do illicit business with north korea if beijing failed to enforce u n  sanctions against pyongyang  the united states has begun deploying the terminal high altitude area defense missile defense system in south korea  a move china objects to strongly because it sees the system s radar as a threat to its security  pak myong ho  a north korean embassy official speaking in beijing on thursday  said the deployment  will destroy the balance in northeast asia and the pacific region    the radar is not aimed at just us   pak said   it is also aiming for china and russia   china s assertiveness in the east china sea  where it has a territorial row with japan  and the south china sea  where it has disputes with the philippines and several other southeast asian nations  were also on the agenda
