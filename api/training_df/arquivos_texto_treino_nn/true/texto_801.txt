tokyo  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on monday that japan would shoot north korean missiles  out of the sky  if it bought the u s  weaponry needed for doing so  suggesting tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now  north korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of u n  security council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  it has fired two missiles over japan  trump  speaking after a summit with japanese prime minister shinzo abe  repeated his mantra the  era of strategic patience  with north korea was over  and said the two countries were working to counter the  dangerous aggressions   trump also pressed japan to lower its trade deficit with the united states and buy more u s  military hardware   he  abe  will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the united states   trump said  referring to the north korean missiles   the prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment  as he should  and we make the best military equipment by far   abe  for his part  said tokyo would shoot down missiles  if necessary   trump was replying to a question that was posed to abe   namely how he would respond to a quote from trump from a recent interview in which he said japan was a  samurai  nation and should have shot down the north korean missiles  japan s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an  existential threat  to japan because it was aimed at a u s  target  the u s  president is on the second day of a  day asian trip that is focusing on north korea s nuclear missile programs and trade   most importantly  we re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in north korea   trump said  calling  pyongyang s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over japan  a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability    some people said that my rhetoric is very strong  but look what s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last  years  look where we are right now   he added  north korea s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of trump s presidency  the u s  leader  who will visit south korea on the trip  has rattled some allies with his vow to  totally destroy  north korea if it threatens the united states and with his dismissal of north korean leader kim jong un as a  rocket man  on a suicide mission  abe  with whom trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls  repeated at the same news conference that japan backed trump s stance that  all options  are on the table   saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on north korea and the two countries were   percent  together on the issue  chinese foreign ministry spokesman hua chunying  in  response to abe s comments  said that the north korean  situation  was  already extremely complex  sensitive and weak    we hope that under the present circumstances  all sides  words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the north korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations   she said  trump said he was committed to achieving  free  fair  and reciprocal  trade and wants to work with japan on this issue   america is also committed to improving our economic relationship with japan   trump said   as president  i m committed to achieving fair  free  and reciprocal trading relationship  we seek equal and reliable access for american exports to japan s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with japan   earlier  speaking to japanese and u s  business executives  trump praised japan for buying u s  military hardware  but he added that  many millions of cars are sold by japan into the united states  whereas virtually no cars go from the united states into japan   japan had a   billion trade surplus with the united states last year  according to the u s  treasury department  the united states was japan s second biggest trade partner after china  while japan was the united states  fourth largest goods export market in   japanese officials have countered u s  trade complaints by noting tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the u s  deficit than in the past  while china s imbalance is bigger  in a second round of economic talks in washington last month  u s  vice president mike pence and japanese finance minister taro aso  who doubles as deputy premier  failed to bridge differences on trade issues  the two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks  with tokyo pushing back against u s  calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement  trump also said earlier that an indo pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the trans pacific partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced washington would abandon soon after he took office  the  remaining nations in the tpp  to which japan s abe is firmly committed  are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the united states  trump met emperor akihito  exchanging a handshake and nodding  before his lunch and talks with abe  he also met relatives of japanese citizens abducted by north korean agents decades ago to help train spies  calling the kidnappings a  tremendous disgrace  and pledging to work with abe to bring the victims  back to japan where they want to be    i think it would be a tremendous signal if kim jong un would send them back   trump said   if he would send them back  that would be the start of something  something very special     abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career  the families hope their talks with trump   the third u s  president they have met   will somehow contribute to a breakthrough  although experts say progress is unlikely  abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least  worshippers at a church in texas  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump had no plans to change the schedule for his  day asian trip  which will also take him to seoul  beijing and danang  vietnam  trump s visit to asia  tmsnrt rs
