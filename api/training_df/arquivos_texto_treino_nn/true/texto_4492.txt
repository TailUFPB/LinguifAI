washington  reuters    senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said on tuesday he would soon file a motion seeking to cut off an expected democratic filibuster of supreme court nominee neil gorsuch  setting the clock ticking toward a showdown vote later in the week  the motion would set up a vote  likely on thursday  to try to cut off the filibuster  which would require a super majority of  votes in the  seat senate to end debate on gorsuch s nomination and move to a final up or down vote on confirmation  enough democrats have agreed to support a filibuster to block a final vote under current senate rules  and mcconnell is expected to seek a rule change to get the nomination approved by friday
