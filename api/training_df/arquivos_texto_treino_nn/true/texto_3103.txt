new york  reuters    federal investigators probing the lobbying work of ousted national security adviser michael flynn are focused in part on the role of bijan kian  flynn s former business partner  according to a person interviewed by the fbi   investigators are also looking at whether payments from foreign clients to flynn and his company  the now inactive flynn intel group  were lawful  according to two separate sources with knowledge of the broad inquiry into flynn s business activities  that includes payments by three russian companies and a netherlands based company  inovo  controlled by turkish businessman ekim alptekin  they said  the fbi s interest in kian has not been previously reported  kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the inovo contract  two people with knowledge of that project said   it is not clear whether kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how flynn s company operated  a person recently interviewed by the fbi in connection with the flynn investigation said agents from the bureau s criminal division had asked as much about kian and his work on the project with alptekin as they had about flynn   kian did not respond to repeated requests for comment  nor did the lawyer he recently hired  robert trout  the fbi declined to comment  flynn s lawyer  robert kelner  did not respond to requests for comment  alptekin declined to comment for this story but last month told reuters that he was satisfied with the work done by flynn intel group and denied any wrongdoing   the fbi has been investigating whether flynn s consulting firm lobbied on behalf of turkey   after being paid    by inovo   without making the proper disclosure  reuters reported earlier this month  the federal investigation is being run by special counsel robert mueller  mueller has a mandate to investigate contacts between russia and trump s  election campaign team and any related matters  flynn was fired by the trump administration in february after officials said he mischaracterized a series of phone calls with russia s ambassador last december    the top democrat on the house committee on oversight and government reform  which has separately been looking into whether flynn made false statements in applying for security clearance  said he was also scrutinizing kian    i have an interest in bijan kian and his interactions with general flynn based on specific documents already obtained by the committee   elijah cummings told reuters in an email   kelner has sought immunity for flynn in exchange for his testimony  saying his client  certainly has a story to tell      in private conversations with potential clients  kian portrayed himself as a rainmaker for flynn  tapping into  connections cultivated during a five year tenure as a director at the u s  export import bank  according to one person who worked with the firm  alptekin told reuters in may that his firm hired flynn intel group to research muslim cleric fethullah gulen s activities in the united states  which he suspected were  poisoning  relations between the united states and turkey  like turkish president tayyip erdogan  alptekin blamed a failed coup in turkey last july on followers of gulen  gulen  who has lived in self imposed exile in pennsylvania since   has denied involvement in the attempted coup and dismisses turkey s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization  kian oversaw key elements of the project that emerged  including a still unfinished documentary on gulen  according to two people involved in the project  inovo paid flynn intel group a total of     starting in september  according to a justice department filing by the company in march  flynn intel group paid    to inovo in  consultancy fees   according to the filing  which does not provide more detail on why payments were made in both directions  on sept    kian and flynn met in new york with turkey s foreign minister and energy minister  who is erdogan s son in law  according to a person with knowledge of the meeting    in late october  kian invited staff of the house homeland security committee to flynn intel group s headquarters in virginia  the meeting was called to show off new mobile phone security technology  but kian also used the opportunity to try to get a congressional hearing on gulen  according to a person at the meeting   at that point  the flynn intel group had only disclosed its work for alptekin s inovo in a filing with congress  it had not mentioned inovo s ties to turkey  when justice department officials became aware months later that kian and other flynn intel group officials had met with turkish officials they insisted on a fuller disclosure  people involved in those discussions said  the flynn intel group made the more detailed disclosure in its march filing with the justice department under the foreign agents registration act that said the work that flynn and kian did for inovo  could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of turkey
