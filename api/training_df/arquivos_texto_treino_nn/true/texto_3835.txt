  this story corrects reference to russian ambassador in paragraph    by steve holland and jeff mason washington  reuters    the anger behind donald trump s firing of fbi director james comey on tuesday had been building for months  but a turning point came when comey refused to preview for top trump aides his planned testimony to a senate panel  white house officials said  trump  attorney general jeff sessions and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein had wanted a heads up from comey about what he would say at a may  hearing about his handling of an investigation into former democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s use of a private email server  when comey refused  trump and his aides considered that an act of insubordination and it was one of the catalysts to trump s decision this week to fire the fbi director  the officials said    it gave the impression that he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties   one official said  previews of congressional testimony to superiors are generally considered courteous  comey  who testified for four hours before the senate judiciary committee  said it made him feel  mildly nauseous  that his decision to make public his reopening of a probe into clinton s handling of classified information might have affected the outcome of the nov   presidential election  but he said he had no regrets and would make the same decision again  trump s sudden firing of comey shocked washington and plunged trump deeper into a controversy over his campaign s alleged ties with russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency  democrats accused the republican president of firing comey to try to undermine the fbi s probe into russia s alleged efforts to meddle in the  election and possible collusion with members of the trump campaign  and demanded an independent investigation  some of trump s fellow republicans called his dismissal of comey troubling   the trump administration said on tuesday comey was fired because of his handling of the clinton email probe  before he axed comey  trump had publicly expressed frustration with the fbi and congressional probes into the russia matter  moscow has denied meddling in the election and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia  a former trump adviser said trump was also angry because comey had never offered a public exoneration of trump in the fbi probe into contacts between the russian ambassador to washington  sergei kislyak  and trump campaign advisers last year  according to this former adviser  comey s senate testimony on the clinton emails likely reinforced in trump s mind that  comey was against him     he regretted what he did to hillary but not what he did to trump   the former trump adviser said of comey  clinton has said that the comey decision to announce the renewed inquiry days before the election was a likely factor in her loss to trump  aides said trump moved quickly after receiving a recommendation on monday to terminate comey from rosenstein  who began reviewing the situation at the fbi shortly after taking office two weeks ago  trump s move was so sudden that his white house staff  accustomed to his impromptu style  was caught off guard  stunned aides scrambled to put together a plan to explain what happened  white house spokesman sean spicer ended up briefing reporters about the move in the dark on tuesday night near a patch of bushes steps away from the west wing  comey  who was in los angeles meeting with fbi employees on tuesday and returned later to washington  has made no public comment on his firing  many questions remained about what caused trump to move so quickly  two former senior justice department officials said it made little sense to fire comey while the justice department inspector general was still doing a review of the fbi s handling of the clinton email investigation   i take rod  rosenstein  at his word that be believed everything in that memo but he must know that it s going to be used as a fig leaf to fire comey   one former official said   u s  senator dianne feinstein  the top democrat on the senate judiciary committee  told reporters it was her  understanding  comey had been seeking more resources for his investigation into the tangled russia controversy  white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said trump had pondered dumping comey as soon as he took office on jan    but decided to stick with him  trump shrugged off the political firestorm he created with comey s dismissal as he met with former u s  secretary of state henry kissinger in the oval office on wednesday  asked by reporters why he fired comey  trump said   he wasn t doing a good job  very simply  he wasn t doing a good job
