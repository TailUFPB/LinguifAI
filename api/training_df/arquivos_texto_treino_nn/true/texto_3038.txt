colorado springs  colo   reuters    officials with the conservative u s  political network overseen by the koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the senate this week and will lobby for changes to it  at a weekend event with conservative donors  top aides to charles koch  the billionaire energy magnate  said the senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  also known as obamacare   we have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal   said tim phillips  president of americans for prosperity  a grassroots advocacy group backed by charles koch and his brother  david  the senate s  page proposal  worked out in secret by a group led by senate majority leader mcconnell  aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of president donald trump to repeal obamacare  which has provided coverage to  million americans since its passage in   republicans view the law  formally called the affordable care act  as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing  phillips and other aides to the koch network told reuters they want to see the senate bill do more to roll back obamacare s expansion of the medicaid program for poor and disabled americans  they also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the u s  healthcare system and cut costs  the aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote  similar concerns helped steer the house s version of the bill in a more conservative direction  a primary mover of that effort  mark meadows  a republican congressman from north carolina  attended the koch donor event  meadows  chairman of the conservative freedom caucus in the house  said he is prepared to support the senate bill if it clears that chamber  a sign that quick action to land the legislation on trump s desk is possible  however  meadows said the senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on obamacare s insurance exchanges to offer less expensive plans that do not comply with that law s coverage requirements  republican senator ted cruz of texas  who currently opposes the senate bill  has offered an amendment along those lines  cruz attended the koch event here  as did senators jeff flake of arizona and ben sasse of nebraska  who remain undecided  meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes  senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week  ahead of the july  congressional recess  which would then send it back to the house  if the senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the house  meadows said it is conceivable the house could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the senate and house bills  that  he said  could result in sending the bill to trump s desk for his signature before the recess  getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult  five senate republicans  including cruz  have publicly voiced their opposition to the current senate draft  no senate democrats are expected to back it  which means mcconnell cannot afford to lose more than two senate republicans  as a sign of the koch network s influence  phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as   million before next year s congressional elections to advocate for the network s conservative causes
