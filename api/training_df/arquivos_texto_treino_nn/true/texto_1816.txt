washington  reuters    u s  republican party lawmakers warned on friday that president donald trump s legislative deal with democrats to help hurricane victims and keep the government running for another three months could complicate his next big priority   tax reform  trump s sudden shift in strategy hands a clear victory to senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi and that could slow the republicans  legislative agenda  they said   this kind of creates complications relative to tax reform   said representative ryan costello from pennsylvania   it seems to me that there s an element of unpredictability from one issue to the next and this week is sort of a reflection of that     there was a lot of work going into how this was going to take shape in september  and that was entirely undermined   seemingly very spontaneously   following trump s deal with democratic leaders  the house of representatives on friday approved legislation that provides    billion in emergency disaster aid for the victims of hurricane harvey  which battered coastal areas of texas and louisiana last week  and hurricane irma  which is expected to pound florida in coming days  already approved by the senate on thursday  the deal also raises the u s  government s debt ceiling and allows it to continue financing federal spending programs until dec    the new deadline for a deal on both issues  but some republicans fear the democrats will be able to use their negotiating clout in early december to resist changes on key tax issues  especially the corporate tax rate  which     trump wants to cut from  percent to  percent  republican senator ben sasse said the experience of watching trump empower democrats had been  embarrassing  for a republican controlled congress and that the deal made schumer  the most powerful man in america   sasse was one of  senate republicans who voted against the deal on thursday  in the house  all   no  votes came from republicans but the deal passed comfortably with  democrats and  republicans in favor   the white house said trump s shift in strategy this week clears away complicated issues like the debt ceiling and government funding  both of which had to be resolved in september  so congress can concentrate more fully on tax reform  which republicans want to complete by the end of the year   after the failure of republican efforts to overturn former president barack obama s affordable care act in july  trump and lawmakers need a legislative victory to shore up their hopes of maintaining republican majorities in next year s midterm elections   some house republicans are already frustrated by a lack of details on tax reform from the administration  they hope to see  more as soon as next week  though some are skeptical   my expectations are low  i think if they had something big they d be floating elements of it now   said representative darrell issa   how house republicans respond to the tax plan will help determine the challenges they may face passing a fiscal year  budget resolution that is critical to the republican strategy for tax reform   the budget contains a procedural rule that would allow republicans to enact tax legislation with a simple majority in the senate  which they control by a   margin  republican aides said house leaders had expected to bring the budget to the floor next week  but the document now needs changes to include government revenue projections that take into account current tax policy and the failure to repeal obamacare   aides say  members of the conservative house freedom caucus  a formidable bloc in the house  have said they will not support the budget until they see the tax reform plan and want the resolution to contain more cuts to federal spending than the   billion over a decade that it already contains    it was not clear whether the budget resolution could now suffer from conservative anger over friday s vote  many conservatives have long called for lawmakers to couple any measures that raise the u s  debt ceiling with reforms to cut spending  the deal that passed on friday did the opposite by attaching an increase in the debt ceiling to more spending to keep the government open  as well as adding money for hurricane relief without making any spending cuts elsewhere   i love president trump and i m with him probably  or  percent of the time  but i don t think it s appropriate to raise the debt ceiling with a   trillion public debt and not have any effort to change the way we spend money here in washington   said joe barton  a house freedom caucus member  mark meadows  who chairs the house freedom caucus  said he did not feel betrayed by trump and that the legislation was a  unique situation  brought about by the massive storm damage in texas and louisiana   because of hurricane relief  there wasn t a whole lot of options   meadows said on msnbc   but  he added   our grassroots are very confused
