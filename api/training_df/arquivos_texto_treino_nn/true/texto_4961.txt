new york  reuters    a group advising u s  president donald trump on infrastructure has proposed an arbitration style pilot program to slash the current  years it often takes to break ground on projects  without short changing environmental standards  the group  led by billionaire new york real estate developers richard lefrak and steve roth  made the suggestion to trump and others in the white house last week  lefrak told reuters on monday  builders  unions and others often rue a permitting processes that can last a decade or more   a potential snag in trump s plan to launch a  year    trillion infrastructure building program to create jobs and bolster the world s biggest economy  lefrak said the advisory council is looking at a pilot program comparable to the arbitration process used in bankruptcy court to speed up proposals  reduce red tape and halt litigation that can tie up infrastructure projects in court for years   somebody in authority would make the decisions  all the mitigation that should be coming out of it  whether it s environmental mitigation  other mitigation  gets decided at that moment and that s it   he said   it s just a proposal  we re asking them to try it   the council is not empowered to pick projects or make decisions about how to streamline the project permitting process for projects  he said  any pilot program would be up to state and federal officials and congress  he said  lefrak added that the proposal would not allow projects for bridges  roads or airports to side step regulations  such as environmental rules  the idea would be to hammer out differences and objections faster in an arbitration like setting so that projects could get underway in less time   australia  canada and germany typically take two years to approve infrastructure projects compared with  years in the united states  he said  a shortened review process could leave projects open to worries from environmentalists and others that an expedited permitting system could short change environmental protections  environmental groups are skeptical of trump s promise to overhaul government regulations without jeopardizing america s water and air quality  when trump unveils his budget on thursday  he is expected to slash the budget of the environmental protection agency by  percent  the sierra club  nature conservancy and other environmental groups as well as the office of house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi were not available for comment   permitting and other regulatory hurdles can delay projects for years  a potential liability for a program that seeks to put money   and people   to work immediately   there s got to be some way without abrogating anybody s rights to get all this on the table much more quickly   said lefrak  who is chairman and chief executive of the lefrak organization  a leading developer and property owner in the new york metro area and south florida   lefrak pointed to the replacement within  months of a bridge that collapsed in minneapolis in  killing  people as an example of how projects can get done without compromising standards  lefrak also said the committee wants to use private funds to soak up cost overruns and keep projects maintained after completion  he suggested  as well  one possible solution to the key question of how to pay for trump s infrastructure program  a higher federal gas tax   if not  funding will have to come from general tax revenue  he said  local and state government pay for about  percent of infrastructure projects in the united states  with the remainder funded by the federal government   the american society of civil engineers last week recommended an   cents per gallon federal tax on gasoline be raised at least to  cents per gallon to fill a funding deficit for infrastructure it said was   trillion   i m saying somebody s going to have pay for it  it doesn t come for free   lefrak said   i wish i was powerful enough to impose a gas tax  but i m not
