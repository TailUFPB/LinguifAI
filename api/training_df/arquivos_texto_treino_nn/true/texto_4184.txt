 washington  reuters    when u s  president donald trump boasted early last week that he had sent an  armada  as a warning to north korea  the aircraft carrier strike group he spoke of was still far from the korean peninsula  and headed in the opposite direction   it was even farther away over the weekend  moving through the sunda strait and then into the indian ocean  as north korea displayed what appeared to be new missiles at a parade and staged a failed missile test   the u s  military s pacific command explained on tuesday that the strike group first had to complete a shorter than initially planned period of training with australia  but it was now  proceeding to the western pacific as ordered   it said   the perceived communications mix up has raised eyebrows among korea experts  who wonder whether it erodes the trump administration s credibility at a time when u s  rhetoric about the north s advancing nuclear and missile capabilities are raising concerns about a potential conflict    if you threaten them and your threat is not credible  it s only going to undermine whatever your policy toward them is  and that could be a logical conclusion from what s just happened   said north korea expert joel wit at the  north monitoring group  run by johns hopkins university s school of advanced international studies   the u s  military initially said in a statement dated april  that admiral harry harris  the commander of pacific command  directed the carl vinson strike group  to sail north and report on station in the western pacific    reuters and other news outlets reported on april  that the movement would take more than a week  the navy  for security reasons  says it does not report future operational locations of its ships   defense secretary jim mattis initially appeared to play down the deployment on april   saying the vinson was  just on her way up there because that s where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time     there s not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we re sending her up there   he said   but even mattis initially misspoke about the strike group s itinerary  telling a news conference that the vinson had pulled out of an exercise with australia   the pentagon has since corrected the record  saying the ship s planned port visit to fremantle  australia  was canceled   not the exercise with australia s navy   on april   the u s  navy even published a photo showing the vinson transiting the sunda strait  here from april    the website www gonavy jp cvlocation html reported that the vinson was in the indian ocean   a u s  military official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the vinson carried out the exercises after passing through the sunda strait and wrapped them up this week
