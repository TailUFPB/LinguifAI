by police as  year old james hodgkinson from the st  louis suburb of belleville  illinois   fired repeatedly at the men playing on the baseball field on wednesday morning   congressmen at the ballpark described hearing loud noises like the sound of firecrackers and  to  people lying on the ground and realizing they had only baseball bats to defend themselves against bullets   when he started shooting  he was shooting to kill people  and thank god he wasn t a very good shot   said representative joe barton  the republican team s manager  also wounded were a congressional aide and one former aide who now works as a lobbyist  officials said  one capitol hill police officer suffered a gunshot wound and another officer twisted an ankle and was released from a hospital  police said   it was not only chaotic but it was a combat situation   alexandria police chief mike brown told reporters  while police and the federal bureau of investigation said it was too early to determine whether it was a deliberate political attack  the shooting intensified concerns about the sharp divide and bitter rhetoric in u s  politics  fbi special agent tim slater declined to comment on whether the gunman had a vendetta against republicans   we continue to actively investigate the shooter s motives  acquaintances and whereabouts that led to today s incidents    slater told reporters  no one else was in custody  he said  the gunman was believed to have been in the alexandria area since march  slater said  investigators believe that the suspect had been living out of his vehicle  wednesday s shooting revived debate about gun rights in america  virginia s democratic governor  terry mcauliffe  urged gun control measures   scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures  hodgkinson had raged against trump on social media and was a member of anti republican groups on facebook including   the road to hell is paved with republicans    terminate the republican party   and  donald trump is not my president   a search of his facebook profile showed  as businessman trump rose to become the republican nominee in the  presidential election  his brash style and outspoken views on immigration and other policies led to mass protests  including on the weekend of his inauguration in january   the charity ballgame between a republican team and a democratic team will go ahead as scheduled on thursday at nationals park  home of the washington nationals major league baseball team  representative tim ryan  who early on wednesday was practicing for the ballgame with fellow democrats  told reporters that washington politicians needed to cool their rhetoric   we ve got to get back to     where things aren t so personal and we re so judgmental of each other  it s got to stop  a member of the u s  congress got shot because they didn t like  his  political views   ryan said  trump  who announced the gunman s death  called for unity   we are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good   he said  in a show of bipartisanship  republican house speaker paul ryan said on the floor of the house   an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us   the house s top democrat  nancy pelosi  echoed ryan s message  the shooting happened shortly after  a m  there were  house members and two senators present  and the shooting lasted about  minutes  said barton  two lawmakers who were at the scene  representatives ron desantis and jeff duncan  indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack  duncan said that as he left the field  the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot   he asked me who was practicing this morning  republicans or democrats  and i said   that s the republicans practicing    duncan told reporters  desantis gave a similar account  senator bernie sanders  an independent who sought the  democratic presidential nomination  said he had been told that  hodgkinson had served as a volunteer with his campaign   let me be as clear as i can be  violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and i condemn this action in the strongest possible terms   sanders said  ryan  the house speaker  is reviewing rules on how rank and file lawmakers can increase their personal security  according to several lawmakers   members get threats on a regular basis and have trouble determining which are real   house democratic whip steny hoyer told reporters  the shooting took place at eugene simpson stadium park in the del ray neighborhood of alexandria  across the potomac river from washington        representative mo brooks told cnn that during batting practice  he heard a  bam  and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence  when scalise was shot  he went down on the infield between first and second base  then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded  leaving a trail of blood   brooks said  two capitol police officers who were there to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols  brooks said   but for the capitol police and the heroism they showed  it could very well have been a large scale massacre  all we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle  those aren t good odds   brooks said  wednesday s attack was the first shooting of a member of congress since january   when democratic representative gabby giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of constituents in tucson  arizona  six people were killed  giffords resigned from congress and became an activist for gun restrictions
