washington  reuters    fbi director james comey  days before president donald trump fired him  told lawmakers he sought more resources for his agency s probe into possible collusion between trump s presidential campaign and russia to sway the  u s  election  a congressional source said on wednesday  with the republican president facing a storm of criticism from many democratic lawmakers and some in his own party  the trump administration accused comey of  atrocities  on the job and denied his firing was related to the fbi s russia investigation  trump  who met russia s foreign minister at the white house on wednesday  lashed out at critics  calling democrats  phony hypocrites   and defended his decision to abruptly oust comey on tuesday from the law enforcement post he held since   in a farewell letter to staff seen by cnn  comey  who was appointed by trump s predecessor  democratic president barack obama  said he had  long believed that a president can fire an fbi director for any reason  or for no reason at all   comey added he would not spend time dwelling on trump s decision  or the way it was executed   but democrats ramped up accusations that comey s removal was intended to undermine the federal bureau of investigation probe and demanded an independent investigation into the alleged russian meddling  with some calling the firing an attempt to cover up wrongdoing related to russia  a congressional source with knowledge of the matter said comey told lawmakers within the past few days he had asked the justice department to make additional resources available   mainly more staffing   for the russia probe  comey informed lawmakers of that request after the senate intelligence committee  conducting its own investigation  had asked the fbi to speed up its russia inquiry  the source said  democrat dianne feinstein  the senate judiciary committee s top democrat  told reporters she understood comey was seeking more resources for the fbi investigation  responding to media reports that comey had asked deputy attorney general rod rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources for the agency s probe  justice department spokesman ian prior said in an email   totally false   u s  intelligence agencies concluded in a january report that russian president vladimir putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the  election that included hacking into democratic party emails and leaking them  with the aim of helping trump  russia has denied any such meddling  the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia  top u s  republicans rallied to trump s defense  but some called the action troubling  republican house oversight committee chairman jason chaffetz said in a statement on wednesday he had requested a review by the department of justice s inspector general of trump s decision to fire comey  who had more than six years left in his  year post  comey s dismissal stunned washington and plunged trump deeper into a controversy over his campaign s alleged ties with russia that has dogged the early days of his presidency  while also threatening to hinder his policy goals   he wasn t doing a good job  very simply   the republican president said of comey during a meeting with former secretary of state henry kissinger in the white house oval office  the administration said on tuesday that comey s firing stemmed from his handling of an election year fbi probe into democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state  white house officials said trump s anger at comey had been building for months but a turning point came when the fbi chief refused to preview for top trump aides his planned testimony to a may  senate hearing on the clinton email issue  an act trump and his aides took it as an act of insubordination  trump had been considering letting comey go  since the day he was elected  in november  white house spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders said  she referred to what she called comey s  atrocities in circumventing the chain of command  at the justice department  many democrats have criticized comey s management of the clinton investigation  but they questioned the timing of his dismissal  given that trump could have acted soon after taking office on jan   and that he has repeatedly criticized the fbi and congressional probes into russia s role in the election  in a flurry of twitter posts  trump said comey had  lost the confidence of almost everyone in washington  republican and democrat alike   he added   dems have been complaining for months   months about dir  comey  now that he has been fired they pretend to be aggrieved  phony hypocrites   the senate minority leader  democrat chuck schumer  said rosenstein should appoint a special prosecutor  schumer called on republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to hold closed and potentially classified briefings with all senators to question the top justice department officials  attorney general jeff sessions and rosenstein   we know director comey was leading an investigation  into  whether the trump campaign colluded with the russians  a serious offense  were those investigations getting too close to home for the president   schumer said  mcconnell accused democrats of  complaining about the removal of an fbi director who they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized  and said a special prosecutor would impede existing probes like one under way in the senate intelligence committee  paul ryan  the republican leader of the house of representatives  told fox news in an interview it was  entirely within the president s role and authority  to remove comey and that a special prosecutor was unnecessary  mark warner  the intelligence committee s top democrat  said he and the panel s republican chairman  richard burr  had asked comey to testify before the panel in private next tuesday  on wednesday evening  the intelligence panel said it had issued a subpoena requesting documents from trump s former national security adviser  michael flynn  in relation to its russia probe  the committee said it had first requested the documents in a letter to flynn on april   flynn was forced to resign in february for failing to disclose the content of his talks with sergei kislyak  russia s ambassador to the united states  and then misleading vice president mike pence about the conversations   trump said he had  a very  very good meeting  with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and they discussed syria s civil war  their meeting was the highest level public contact between trump and putin s government since trump took office   during an earlier appearance at the state department  lavrov responded in a sarcastic tone when asked about comey s dismissal  saying   was he fired  you re kidding  you re kidding   in the russian city of sochi  putin said comey s firing would not have an impact on u s  russian relations  trump s nominee as the new fbi director would need to win senate confirmation  trump s possible choices to head the fbi on an interim basis  according to a white house official  include acting fbi director andrew mccabe  assistant director paul abbate  chicago fbi agent michael anderson and richmond  virginia  agent adam lee
