day in office on saturday   nonetheless  trump said he wanted to peacefully resolve a crisis that has bedeviled multiple u s  presidents  a path that he and his administration are emphasizing by

terminate a u s  free trade pact with south korea because of a deep trade deficit with seoul   asked when he would announce his intention to renegotiate the pact  trump said   very soon  i m announcing it now    trump also said he was considering adding stops to israel and saudi arabia to a europe trip next month  emphasizing that he wanted to see an israeli palestinian peace  he complained that saudi arabia was not paying its fair share for u s  defense   asked about the fight against islamic state  trump said the militant group had to be defeated    i have to say  there is an end  and it has to be humiliation   he said  when asked about what the endgame was for defeating islamist violent extremism   trump said north korea was his biggest global challenge  he lavished praise on chinese president xi jinping for chinese assistance in trying to rein in pyongyang  the two leaders met in florida earlier this month    i believe he is trying very hard  he certainly doesn t want to see turmoil and death  he doesn t want to see it  he is a good man  he is a very good man and i got to know him very well    with that being said  he loves china and he loves the people of china  i know he would like to be able to do something  perhaps it s possible that he can t   trump said   trump spoke just a day after he and his top national security advisers briefed u s  lawmakers on the north korean threat and one day before secretary of state rex tillerson will press the united nations security council on sanctions to further isolate pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs   the trump administration on wednesday declared north korea  an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority   it said it was focusing on economic and diplomatic pressure  including chinese cooperation in containing its defiant neighbor and ally  and remained open to negotiations   u s  officials said military strikes remained an option but played down the prospect  though the administration has sent an aircraft carrier and a nuclear powered submarine to the region in a show of force   any direct u s  military action would run the risk of massive north korean retaliation and huge casualties in japan and south korea and among u s  forces in both countries   trump  asked if he considered north korean leader kim jong un to be rational  said he was operating from the assumption that he is rational  he noted that kim had taken over his country at an early age    he s  years old  his father dies  took over a regime  so say what you want but that is not easy  especially at that age    i m not giving him credit or not giving him credit  i m just saying that s a very hard thing to do  as to whether or not he s rational  i have no opinion on it  i hope he s rational   he said   trump  sipping a coke delivered by an aide after the president ordered it by pressing a button on his desk  rebuffed an overture from taiwan president tsai ing wen  who told reuters a direct phone call with trump could take place again after their first conversation in early december angered beijing   china considers neighboring taiwan to be a renegade province    my problem is that i have established a very good personal relationship with president xi   said trump   i really feel that he is doing everything in his power to help us with a big situation  so i wouldn t want to be causing difficulty right now for him    so i would certainly want to speak to him first    trump also said he hoped to avoid a potential government shutdown amid a dispute between congressional republicans and democrats over a spending deal with a saturday deadline looming   but he said if a shutdown takes place  it will be the democrats  fault for trying to add money to the legislation to  bail out puerto rico  and other items   he also defended the one page tax plan he unveiled on wednesday from criticism that it would increase the u s  deficit  saying better trade deals and economic growth would offset the costs    we will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficit  we are going to be doing trade deals that are going to be much better trade deals   trump said
