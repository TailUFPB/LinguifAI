washington  reuters    vice president mike pence took the rare step of breaking a tie in the u s  senate on thursday  casting the deciding vote to roll back protections for reproductive health funds   using the congressional review act  which allows lawmakers to repeal recently minted regulations  senators killed a rule intended to keep federal grants flowing to clinics that provide contraception and other services in states that want to block the funding  the rule was enacted in the final weeks of former president barack obama s administration  giving lawmakers the opening to nullify it under the review law  in recent years states such as texas have kept some healthcare providers from receiving the grants as part of the country s longstanding fight over abortion   it was the second time on thursday that pence used his role as the chamber s president to end a deadlock  he was called to the capitol earlier to carry the resolution through a procedural vote   saying the rule usurps states  rights  republicans argued local lawmakers should decide how healthcare money is distributed   their main concern is that federal money is being used to provide abortions  although the grants are specifically barred from funding those procedures  republicans  including president donald trump  generally oppose abortion   this regulation is an unnecessary restriction on states that know their residents  own needs best   said republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  democrats said the resolution was an attack on women s health  contending the rollback will make it harder for low income and rural women to obtain screenings for cancer and other diseases  as well as contraception  most resolutions killing recent obama era regulations have sailed through the republican controlled congress  they need to win only simple majorities in both chambers to go to the president for signing  the congressional review law was used only once successfully until this year  the family planning resolution marked the  time it has been deployed effectively since the beginning of february  as well as the first time a resolution has come within a hair s breadth of failing   republicans didn t listen to us   said senator patty murray of washington  the senior democrat on the health committee   they didn t listen to women across the country who made it clear that restricting women s access to the full range of reproductive care is unacceptable    the nonprofit planned parenthood  which provides abortions  and many other health and contraception services  receives some of the federal funding   noting the recent collapse of the republican healthcare bill in the u s  house of representatives  dawn laguens  executive vice president of planned parenthood federation of america  said thursday s votes were close because  people are sick and tired of politicians making it even harder for them to access healthcare
