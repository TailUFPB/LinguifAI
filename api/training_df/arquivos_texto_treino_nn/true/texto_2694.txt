washington  reuters    facebook inc  fb o   alphabet inc s google  googl o   apple inc  aapl o  and other major technology firms are largely absent from a debate over the renewal of a broad u s  internet surveillance law  weakening prospects for privacy reforms that would further protect customer data  according to sources familiar with the matter  while tech companies often lobby washington on privacy issues  the major firms have been hesitant to enter a fray over a controversial portion of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  fisa   industry lobbyists  congressional aides and civil liberties advocates said   among their concerns is that doing so could jeopardize a trans atlantic data transfer pact underpinning billions of dollars in trade in digital services  the sources said  technology companies and privacy groups have for years complained about the part of fisa known as section  that allows the u s  national security agency  nsa  to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas  though targeted at foreigners  the surveillance also collects data on an unknown number of americans   some privacy advocates have suggested it could be millions   without a search warrant  section  will expire at the end of the year unless the republican controlled congress votes to reauthorize it  the white house  u s  intelligence agencies and many republican senators want to renew the law  which they consider vital to national security  without changes and make it permanent  a coalition of democrats and libertarian leaning conservatives prefer  however  to amend the law with more privacy safeguards  reform government surveillance  a coalition of tech firms established after the  leaks by former nsa contractor edward snowden  said reforming the law remains a priority  a spokeswoman declined to comment further but referred to two letters sent earlier this year by technology companies urging congress to consider changes to the law  snowden exposed the spy agency s program that collected u s  phone call metadata in bulk and also the extent of spying under section   embarrassing some u s  technology firms  the companies  working with privacy rights activists  successfully lobbied congress two years ago to pass legislation that curtailed the nsa s bulk collection of call records  for example  facebook chief executive mark zuckerberg wrote on his facebook page that he had personally called then president barack obama to express  frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future   now  however  silicon valley s reduced involvement frustrates civil liberties groups because of a widely held view that section  poses a far greater threat to privacy than the telephone program  which did not harvest actual content  facebook declined comment  google and apple did not respond to requests for comment  the companies  relative inactivity is explained by several legal challenges in europe to an agreement between the united states and the european union  known as the privacy shield  the sources said  the litigation hinges on whether u s  surveillance practices afford enough privacy safeguards  a coalition of human rights organizations has urged europe to suspend privacy shield unless section  is substantially reformed  u s  technology companies have privately bristled at those efforts  three industry lobbyists said  in part because expectations that  reforms will pass congress are low   if you link them and you lose one  you lose both   said one of the lobbyists  who like the others requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with technology companies   the lobbyist added that several major firms were more interested in making deals with the trump administration that could affect their bottom lines  such as tax repatriation  than getting caught in politically charged fights over government surveillance  another industry lobbyist said section  surveillance is  not a c suite issue  that concerns chief executives in silicon valley like other issues  including encryption  companies have also been limited in how they can lobby for changes to the law because no comprehensive reform bill has been introduced yet in congress  said alex abdo  a privacy advocate and staff attorney at the knight first amendment institute at columbia university   a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the house judiciary committee is not expected to introduce such legislation until after congress returns from its august recess  the schism between tech companies and privacy groups was on display earlier this year in litigation in ireland   facebook argued customer data was sufficiently protected from u s  spying programs  while an attorney for the american civil liberties union testified that more protections were needed  snowden s leaks showed that section  collects content of digital communications directly from the internet backbone and through a program formerly code named prism where the nsa gathered data directly from several companies  including facebook  google  apple and microsoft corp  msft o   the statute also allows the fbi and others to query pools of data collection for u s  information in what critics have derided as a  backdoor search loophole  that evades traditional warrant requirements   the tech industry may become more engaged once the public debate becomes clearer  abdo said  he added that a stronger position  would be enormously helpful to those that want to impose meaningful constraint on nsa surveillance    this version of the story has been refiled to add dropped word  said  in paragraph
