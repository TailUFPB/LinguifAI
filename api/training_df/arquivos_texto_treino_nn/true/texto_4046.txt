washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s tax cut plan will generate growth  but not nearly enough to replace trillions of dollars in lost revenues  while rising deficits could even take back some of the economic gains  fiscal experts said on wednesday  core principles of the plan  unveiled on wednesday  rely heavily on so called  dynamic scoring   a budget analysis method that assumes tax cuts will boost economic activity  thus generating more revenues  such assumptions have been at the heart of republican tax orthodoxy since ronald reagan used them to justify massive tax cuts in  that were derided at the time by critics as  voodoo economics   on wednesday  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said trump s plan would  pay for itself with growth  and closing of some deductions and credits   from the details released so far  maya macguineas  who heads the committee for a responsible federal budget  crfb   said the plan could add   trillion to more than   trillion to the federal deficit over five years   no credible dynamic score is going to show that this bill is paid for   macguineas said   the growth effects  which are real and important  add decimals of percentage points to growth  not full percentage points   her budget watchdog group estimates that to pay for the plan  u s  growth would need to be sustained at   percent annually  a level not seen on a sustained basis since the late  and early   mnuchin has said that he expects the plan to boost sustained u s  growth above  percent  but crfb estimates that even this level would require massive increases in productivity and that a rapidly retiring baby boom generation is working against high growth rates  doug elmendorf  former director of the congressional budget office  one of the agencies that provides cost estimates for legislation  said he sees little chance of congress finding  politically acceptable  offsets to pay for the plan  and the rise in borrowing could work against trump s goals   the resulting increase of the deficit will have a dampening effect on the economic activity that will offset at least part of the stimulative effects of lower tax rates   said elemendorf  now dean of harvard university s john f  kennedy school of government  the higher federal debt load will  crowd out  capital for private use  dampening economic activity in the long run  elmendorf said  republicans in congress are hoping to use budget procedural rules that allow a  vote threshold in the senate to pass tax reform  which would limit the cuts to  years   but if the plan creates deficits in the years beyond the first decade  it could also run afoul of another procedural rule that could require  votes in the senate     tax cuts that expire in a decade could cause another u s  fiscal crisis like the one in   when tax cuts passed under george w  bush expired   what the trump administration has proposed is not permanent tax reform  but a ten year tax cut and the creation of the most phenomenal fiscal cliff ever in    chris krueger  a political analyst at cowen and co in washington  said in a note to clients
