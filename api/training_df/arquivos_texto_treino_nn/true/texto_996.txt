washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump on thursday ordered the unveiling of   documents related to the  assassination of president john f  kennedy but yielded to pressure from the fbi and cia to block the release of other records to be reviewed further   congress had ordered in  that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into kennedy s death should be fully opened to the public through the national archives in  years  by oct      except for those the president authorized for further withholding  trump had confirmed on saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once classified records  amounting to tens of thousands of pages   subject to the receipt of further information   but as the deadline neared  the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next  days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted  the law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations  national defense  law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public s interest in full disclosure  more than   uncensored documents were posted immediately to the national archives website on thursday evening   a staggering  disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators  scholars and conspiracy theorists  the rest will be released  on a rolling basis   with  redactions in only the rarest of circumstances   by the end of the review on april     the white house said in a statement  in a memo to government agency heads  trump said the american people deserved as much access as possible to the records   therefore  i am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted   he wrote  adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now   a central intelligence agency spokesman told reuters that every single one of approximately   remaining cia records in the collection would ultimately be released  with just  percent of the material left redacted  cia director mike pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the white house for keeping some materials secret  one senior administration official said  while kennedy was killed over half a century ago  the document file included material from investigations during the  through the   intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent  law enforcement equities  and other materials that still have relevance  the official said  trump was resistant but  acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months   the official added  academics who have studied kennedy s slaying on nov      said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that lee harvey oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president s open limousine that day in dallas from an upper window of the texas book depository building overlooking the motorcade route  they likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long held conspiracy theories that the  year old democratic president s killing was organized by the mafia  by cuba  or a cabal of rogue agents  of the roughly  million pages of jfk assassination related records held by the national archives   percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late   and  percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted  only about  percent have remain withheld in full  according to the national archives  thousands of books  articles  tv shows and films have explored the idea that kennedy s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy  none have produced conclusive proof that oswald  who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing kennedy  worked with anyone else  although they retain a powerful cultural currency   my students are really skeptical that oswald was the lone assassin   said patrick maney  a professor of history at boston college   it s hard to get our minds around this  that someone like a loner  a loser  could on his own have murdered kennedy and changed the course of world history  but that s where the evidence is   kennedy s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings  including those of his brother robert f  kennedy and civil rights leader martin luther king jr   that stunned the united states during the turbulent   he remains one of the most admired u s  presidents
