new york san francisco  reuters    legal challenges to president donald trump s temporary travel ban on people from some muslim majority countries heat up again next week when two u s  appeals courts consider whether it is constitutional  the legal fights may end up at the u s  supreme court perhaps in the fall  many months after trump first issued an executive order in january saying there was an urgent need to halt some immigration to the united states for  days while officials reviewed the visa process           trump dropped the original travel order after unfavorable legal rulings and replaced it with a more limited ban which is itself now being challenged in appeals courts on two coasts  arguing that the united states needed to tighten national security measures  trump s attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office  the fate of the ban is one indication of whether the republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security  omar jadwat  an attorney at the american civil liberties union  who will be arguing the case at the  u s  circuit court of appeals in virginia on monday  said the fact that so much time has passed since the ban was issued is proof that there was no pressing national security need for it in the first place  the court fight will give those challenging the order an opportunity to argue that the government never intended for the travel pause to be temporary  said buzz frahn  an attorney at simpson thacher   bartlett in palo alto  california whose firm has been closely tracking the ongoing litigation   now almost  days after the original travel ban  the government says the period of  days was reset when the administration issued the new order in march  the department of homeland security  is  and will be  continuously examining ways to enhance the screening and vetting process to shut down terrorist and criminal pathways into the united states   agency spokesman david lapan said   some improvements will be classified  others will be public  but the department has only just begun ways to enhance the security of our immigration system   he said in an email  opponents   including states and civil rights groups   say that both the first ban and the revised ban  which also put a halt to all refugee admissions to the country for four months  discriminates against muslims   the government argues the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks       the  circuit will decide the fate of a ruling from a maryland district judge that struck down a section of the revised executive order barring visitors from syria  iran  libya  sudan  yemen and somalia   the hearing will take place before  full time judges of the appellate court  ten of them were appointed by democrats  and four by republicans   then  on march   a three judge panel at the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals will review a decision from a hawaii judge that halted not just the travel portion of the ban but also the section that barred refugees  the judges   who will sit on a panel in seattle   have been assigned but their identities have not been made public  the  circuit blocked trump s first ban in february  in a unanimous vote by one republican appointed judge and two democratic appointees  trump lashed out at the ruling on twitter and said he is ready for a fight at the supreme court  the nation s highest court is more likely to hear a case if the federal appeals courts reach opposite rulings or if the issue is of great national importance  according to legal experts        but the supreme court s session ends in june  and if it take the case it would probably not be heard until after the justices return in october
