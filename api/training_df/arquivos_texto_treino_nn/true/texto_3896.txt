washington  reuters    a draft of president donald trump s new counterterrorism strategy demands that u s  allies shoulder more of the burden in combating islamist militants  while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated  the  page draft  seen on friday by reuters  said the united states should avoid costly   open ended  military commitments   we need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of american  blood and treasure  in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals   states the document  which is expected to be released in coming months   we will seek to avoid costly  large scale u s  military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups   it says  however  it acknowledges that terrorism  cannot be defeated with any sort of finality   michael anton  spokesman for the white house national security council  said   as part of its overall approach  the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire u s   national security strategy  to include the counterterrorism mission   which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since    the process is aimed at ensuring  the new strategy is directed against the pre eminent terrorist threats to our nation  our citizens  our interests overseas and allies   anton said   moreover  this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals  and guiding principles   combating islamic extremism was a major issue for trump during the  presidential campaign  the draft strategy paper   which officials said was still being fine tuned at the white house  describes the threat from islamic militant groups in stark tones       it remains to be seen how trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving u s  troops in iraq  syria  afghanistan  yemen and elsewhere  rather than scale back u s  commitments  he has so far largely adhered to former obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like yemen and somalia  trump may soon reverse years of obama ordered drawdowns in afghanistan  his administration is now considering boosting by   to   soldiers the   strong u s  contingent helping afghan forces fight a resurgent taliban  current and former u s  officials say  a senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to u s  forces in iraq and syria under trump  at the discretion of his military commanders    if you do see additions elsewhere  they will be in keeping with this  draft  strategy   said the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  the increased pace of u s  military operations has seen a recent spate of american casualties  the latest came in somalia  where a navy seal died and two others were wounded in an attack by al shabaab militants  u s  officials said on friday  since president barack obama released the last u s  counterterrorism strategy in  before the emergence of islamic state  the threat has  diversified in size  scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago   the draft strategy said  in addition to islamic state  the united states and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al qaeda  groups such as the haqqani network and hezbollah  as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online  it said  bruce hoffman  director of georgetown university s center for security studies and who reviewed the document at reuters  request  said the draft strategy  paints   and i think accurately   a more dire picture  of the threat than the obama document  which sounded a  triumphalist  tone following al qaeda leader osama bin laden s death in a  u s  raid in pakistan  the senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat islamic state that trump also has ordered   the draft strategy seen by reuters appears to flow from trump s  america first  foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden sharing by allies and alliances such as nato  it does not include a signature phrase from trump s  campaign   radical islamic terrorism   instead  it says that jihadist groups  have merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale   the draft s first guiding principle is that the united states  will always act to disrupt  prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation  our citizens  our interests overseas and our allies  this includes taking direct and unilateral action  if necessary   the administration would boost u s  homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders   ideologues  technical experts  financiers  external operators and battlefield commanders   the draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and  degrade their efforts to develop and deploy  chemical and biological weapons  yet it provides few details on how the united states  which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the sept      attacks  can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries  many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities  the draft makes little mention of promoting human rights  development  good governance and other  soft power  tools that washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism  in contrast  the obama counterterrorism strategy made  respecting human rights  fostering good governance  respecting privacy and civil liberties  committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law  the foremost of its guiding principles   soft power has a role to play  but not to the exclusion of kinetics   or military action  said hoffman  he called the draft  a very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it
