lower merion  pa   reuters    in pennsylvania state senator daylin leach s bid to win a seat vital to the democratic party s chances in  elections of taking control of the u s  congress  his opponents may not be his biggest obstacle  leach is running in one of the country s most gerrymandered congressional districts  one with such a twisting  winding shape that it has earned the derisive nickname  goofy kicking donald duck   the  congressional district has become a national poster child for critics of gerrymandering  the process by which one party draws district boundaries to ensure an advantage among voters  democrats say the lines have helped republicans like u s  representative patrick meehan  the four term incumbent leach seeks to unseat  to stay in office  that could soon change  however  on monday in state court in harrisburg  one of three lawsuits challenging those boundaries heads to trial  the outcome could shift several battleground districts in pennsylvania and in turn boost the democrats in the u s  house of representatives  where they last held the majority from january  to january   the  district is so precisely engineered that at one point it narrows to the width of a single seafood restaurant  snaking past two other congressional districts so it can link two far flung republican leaning areas   three congressional districts all converge on this spot   leach said from the parking lot at creed s seafood and steaks last week  as cars whizzed overhead on the pennsylvania turnpike   this is the sixth  over there is the seventh  and down that road is the    he said  pointing in several directions   this is what gerrymandering looks like on the ground   leach has at least four opponents to defeat in the democratic primary before he would run against meehan  a spokesman for the republican did not respond to requests for comment on the trial over gerrymandering  critics of gerrymandering say it helps explain why pennsylvania has sent  republicans and only five democrats to the u s  house since the  redistricting  despite being a closely divided swing state  republican legislators counter that the lines were drawn in accordance with the law and that their candidates have prevailed in elections thanks to superior policy ideas  the democrats have targeted six republican held districts in the state as part of their quest to pick up the  house seats they need to overturn the republicans  who also have a senate majority and president donald trump in the white house   democrats need to win the nationwide popular vote by at least  points in  to do so  in part because of gerrymandered lines  according to michael li  a redistricting expert and lawyer at new york university s brennan center for justice   pennsylvania is probably the most aggressive of the gerrymanders   he said   you look at some of the maps in the philadelphia suburbs  and it looks like a  year old just slapped paint around   the non partisan league of women voters of pennsylvania sued the state in june  arguing the maps violate the state constitution by depriving residents of a meaningful vote  the litigation is part of a growing set of legal challenges to partisan redistricting  including a u s  supreme court case out of wisconsin that could for the first time establish a constitutional standard to measure the legality of such map making  the high court is scheduled to decide that case by june   five months before the midterm elections   the politicians are not supposed to pick their voters  the voters are supposed to elect their leaders   said mimi mckenzie  an attorney with the public interest law center who represents the league of women voters and other pennsylvania voters  spokesmen for the state s republican legislative leaders  defendants in the case  said the redistricting followed the process laid out in the state constitution and that the u s  supreme court has said political considerations can play a role   they just can t understand how republicans can actually beat their candidates   stephen miskin  a spokesman for pennsylvania house speaker mike turzai  said of the legal challengers  in addition to the state case  two pending federal lawsuits also challenge the district lines as unconstitutional  legal observers consider the state lawsuit the most likely to succeed in time for the voting next november  the democratic majority state supreme court has ordered the presiding judge to render his decision by dec    the high court will then determine whether to accept his ruling or issue its own conclusions  the state lawsuit asserts the redistricting included numerous examples of blatantly partisan lines  democrat dominated reading  one of the most economically depressed cities in the state  was carved out of the  district and placed into the reliably democratic   a move the plaintiffs said was intended to render the city s votes meaningless  montgomery county  where state senator leach lives  has approximately   residents  slightly more than the   needed for a single congressional district  but has been sliced into five separate districts  leach said he would make gerrymandering a campaign issue   it s theft of democracy   leach said   this is horribly destructive   the story was refiled to correct paragraph  to say that democrats held majority in u s  house of representatives from  to   not  to
