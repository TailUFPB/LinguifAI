chicago  reuters    the city of chicago asked a federal judge on monday to bar president donald trump s justice department from denying public safety grants to so called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation with a federal immigration crackdown  the nation s third largest city sued u s  attorney general jeff sessions in august  the lawsuit was filed after sessions announced the justice department would bar cities from getting certain grants unless they allowed immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and provided  hours  notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations   trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign and presidency  including vowing to build a wall on the u s  mexican border  the federal government has also sought to crack down on sanctuary cities  on monday  chicago attorney ron safer argued in u s  district court for a preliminary injunction that would apply nationwide while the court challenge proceeds  safer argued that sessions lacked authority to attach conditions that would force chicago to choose between funding for crime fighting equipment and programs  and adopting an unconstitutional policy that would shatter trust with immigrant communities needed to solve crimes   this is a tremendously dangerous precedent to set   safer said  arguing that it could be applied to other grant programs to pressure cities to alter other local policies  acting assistant attorney general chad readler countered that the program was voluntary and tha funding amounted to less than  percent of chicago s public safety budget   the government had the authority to attach such conditions  and cited the previous administration attaching requirements that the money not be spent on military style weapons  he said   the courts have routinely recognized that the government can put conditions on spending to achieve things that they couldn t otherwise directly achieve   he said   u s  district judge harry leinenweber did not say when he would rule but told both sides they would hear from him soon  during oral arguments  leinenweber said there were conflicting statistics on whether such policies help or hurt crime  he asked questions about the justice department s authority to set such conditions as well as the city s larger stance on illegal immigration   you don t disagree that the united states should prevent illegal immigration  do you   he asked  safer acknowledged that the city did not support the practice of people coming to the united states without permission  the trump administration has requested   million in funding next year for grants for police equipment and programs to hundreds of cities  chicago and nearby suburbs have applied for    million this year
