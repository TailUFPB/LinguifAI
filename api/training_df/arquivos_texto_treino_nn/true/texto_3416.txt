 reuters    u s  president donald trump s picks for two open spots on the federal reserve s board of governors may push for tighter monetary policy if they receive the senate confirmation needed to join the fed s rate setting panel  their records suggest  trump will nominate carnegie mellon university professor marvin goodfriend and former treasury department staffer randal quarles to fill two of the three open seats on the federal reserve s board of governors  the new york times said on friday  citing unnamed people with direct knowledge of the decision    the conservative picks come as fed chair janet yellen continues to slowly raise interest rates and lay out plans to shed some of the trillions of dollars of bonds bought in the wake of the financial crisis   goodfriend in particular has been skeptical of the fed s bond buying programs  saying that it is too close to fiscal policy  goodfriend and quarles did not immediately respond on friday to requests for comment  a white house spokeswoman said officials were not ready to make an announcement yet      goodfriend    a former richmond fed policy advisor  also has urged the central bank to adopt simpler rules governing policy decisions   that view has support among many congressional republicans  though yellen has strongly opposed their proposed legislation on grounds that it would tie the fed to make mechanical decisions that would harm the economy  the rule at the center of that legislation suggests the fed should be raising rates more aggressively than the three annual rate hikes policymakers currently expect for both  and   that could make for an interesting dynamic with bond investors increasingly skeptical of faster rate hikes amid uncertainty over the outlook for tax cuts under trump s young administration   after friday s report that employers added fewer than expected jobs in may  short term interest rate futures traders were still pricing in a june rate hike  but treasury yields fell as investors reduced bets on subsequent hikes    one area goodfriend may agree with yellen is on the fed s plan to start shrinking its    trillion balance sheet before the end of the year  though the fed has not published its plan in detail  policymakers have said the portfolio would shrink as if on  autopilot   in an interview with reuters last november  goodfriend appeared to also support such a preset plan   the fed should choose a rule for shrinking the balance sheet so that  as it sold off its assets  it was pre committed and markets could anticipate sales and prepare for them   he said  despite differences of opinion with yellen  he said then   if there is interest in my point of view and my  something years of thinking  writing  and teaching about the fed and central banking  then i would have to consider serving    a lawyer by profession  quarles    worked on financial regulation at the u s  treasury for years  including during the   financial crisis  reuters had earlier reported he was a leading candidate to be trump s pick for the fed s vice chair in charge of banking supervision    many market participants have been barking up the wrong tree  arguing that trump is an easy money guy because he borrowed a lot when he was a real estate tycoon   said stephen stanley  amherst pierpont s chief economist  who worked for goodfriend when he was at the richmond fed   if these two nominees are eventually confirmed  the tone of the fed board will instantly swing to a far more hawkish tenor
