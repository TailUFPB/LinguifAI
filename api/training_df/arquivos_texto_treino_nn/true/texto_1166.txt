washington  reuters    u s  secretary of defense james mattis this week asked congress to halt pending legislation that would compel the u s  to alert foreign governments when the pentagon has decided to combat certain cyber attacks  according to a letter sent to lawmakers   the letter  sent to members of congress on tuesday and seen by reuters  comes as lawmaker s finalize the department of defense s  spending plan  also known as the national defense authorization act for fiscal year   or ndaa    the nature of cyber attacks is ever evolving  and we need to maintain our ability to take decisive action against this increasingly dangerous threat   mattis wrote  language in a draft of the ndaa says that when a cyber attack transits a third party country s infrastructure or relies upon its networks the u s  should encourage that nation to take action to eliminate the threat  however  the draft ndaa say the u s  reserves the right to act unilaterally if needed  mattis  letter  dubbed the  heartburn  letter because it highlights the pentagon s concerns with the budget  has often been used by previous pentagon chiefs to attempt to influence lawmakers  legislation while it is still under consideration   in the letter  mattis repeated an earlier request to congress that they consider closing bases in   for an estimated savings of   billion annually  congress  fearful of the economic impact from base closings in their districts  are generally not sympathetic to those efforts   mattis also said he opposed the formation of an additional military service dubbed space corps  which he called an  additional organizational layer   space corps would be a new military branch and absorb the air force s military efforts in space  the u s  senate passed its version of a   billion defense policy bill in september backing president donald trump s call for a bigger  stronger military but setting the stage for a battle over government spending levels  the house of representatives passed its version of the ndaa at a similar spending level in july  the two versions are now being reconciled before congress can consider a final version  a fight over spending is expected because senate democrats have vowed to block big increases in funds for the military if spending caps on non defense programs are not eased as well   the two versions of the bill increase military spending well beyond what current spending caps allow
