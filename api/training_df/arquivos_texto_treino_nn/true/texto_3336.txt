 reuters    former fbi director james comey will testify to the u s  senate intelligence committee on thursday about russian involvement in the  presidential election   president donald trump s abrupt firing of comey on may  renewed attention to allegations by u s  intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the election to benefit trump  it also raised questions about the motivations behind comey s dismissal   the following describes what is publicly known and not known about u s  investigations into meddling and possible collusion between russia and members of the trump campaign   how did the investigations begin  former president barack obama ordered u s  intelligence agencies to assess whether russia tried to intervene in the election after a cyber attack on the democratic national committee in july  and the publication of thousands of hacked personal emails from hillary clinton s campaign manager in the month before the nov   election  obama told intelligence officials to deliver a report on possible foreign interference before he left the white house in january    what did the intelligence agencies find  the central intelligence agency  the federal bureau of investigation and the national security agency concluded in a report declassified in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign not just to undermine confidence in the u s  electoral system but to affect the outcome   the agencies said putin and the russian government had a  clear preference  for trump to win the white house  putin s associates hacked information  paid social media  trolls  and backed efforts by russian government agencies and state funded media to sway public opinion  the agencies said   the report stopped short of assessing whether russia succeeded in swaying the election result   putin and other russian officials have repeatedly denied interfering in the u s  election   how many u s  probes are there into russia s election meddling  comey told the house intelligence committee on march  that the fbi was investigating moscow s role in the election  including possible collusion with trump s campaign   the justice department announced on may  that it has appointed robert mueller  a former fbi director  as special counsel to lead an independent russia probe  mueller would  if the evidence merits  work in tandem with the fbi to handle any related criminal prosecutions   in addition there are multiple committees in the senate and house of representatives investigating various aspects of russian election meddling   what has trump said about russia s role in the election  trump has not taken a clear public position    i will tell you this  russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   trump said at a july  news conference  in reference to an fbi probe into clinton s use of a private email system when she was secretary of state and emails that had possibly been deleted   trump subsequently dismissed reports  including from u s  intelligence officials  that russia had attempted to intervene in the election on his behalf   the first time trump said he accepted the findings of the intelligence agencies was at a jan   news conference ahead of his inauguration   as far as hacking  i think it was russia   trump said  although he added   it could have been others also    trump said in may that china may have hacked the emails of democratic officials to meddle with the election  offering no evidence and countering the view of intelligence officials   trump has made clear on multiple occasions he believes the russia investigations have run their course and should be closed   the russia trump collusion story is a total hoax  when will this taxpayer funded charade end   he wrote on twitter on may    on may   trump wrote on twitter   russian officials must be laughing at the u s    how a lame excuse for why the dems lost the election has taken over the fake news    did the fbi probe continue after comey s dismissal  there is no evidence that the fbi ended or paused its investigation after comey s departure   fbi acting director andrew mccabe  who is leading the agency  promised the senate intelligence committee that comey s firing would not affect the investigation and that he will notify the committee of any attempt to delay or derail it   trump on june  tapped former u s  justice department official christopher wray  who represented new jersey governor chris christie in the so called bridgegate scandal  to be the next fbi director  wray will need senate confirmation   why was comey fired  the white house cited a may  letter to trump from attorney general sessions that attached a memo from rod rosenstein  the deputy attorney general  on  restoring confidence in the fbi  that recommended comey s dismissal   rosenstein s memo said comey erred in july  by announcing the fbi had been examining clinton s use of a private email server and that the case should be closed without prosecution  rosenstein s view was that comey s decision to make a public statement broke with longstanding fbi precedent and should have been handled by the then u s  attorney general  loretta lynch   trump called comey a  showboat  and  grandstander  in an interview with nbc news on may   saying that he would have fired comey regardless of rosenstein s recommendation   in an unorthodox move  great america alliance  an offshoot of a pro trump super pac devoted to promoting the white house agenda  developed a television ad called  showboat  to air as comey testifies  the ad claims comey was  consumed with election meddling  at the expense of fighting terrorism   was comey s firing related to the fbi s russia probe  whether comey believes his firing was linked to the fbi s russia probe will likely be a main focus when he testifies on thursday   trump asked comey to end the agency s investigation of michael flynn  his former national security adviser  and also to make some sort of public statement that he was not personally under investigation in order to clear  the cloud  hanging over his presidency  according to comey s prepared testimony   comey found it  very concerning  that trump would ask him to drop the agency s probe of flynn and declined to state publicly that trump himself was not under investigation  in part because it would create a  duty to correct  if that changed  according to the testimony    i need loyalty  i expect loyalty   trump told comey at a january  dinner  according to the testimony   less than a week before he was fired  comey told a congressional panel that it made him  mildly nauseous  that he may have affected the outcome of the election by publicly re opening  and then re closing  the clinton email probe days before the election   has there been any fallout for trump associates over contacts with russia before  during or after the election campaign  flynn was fired in february  the white house said he had misled vice president mike pence about the contacts he had with russia s ambassador to the united states  sergei kislyak  before trump took office   on may   federal prosecutors issued grand jury subpoenas seeking business records from people who worked with flynn when he was a private citizen  on may   the senate intelligence committee issued the first subpoena in its russia investigation  demanding documents from flynn  he provided the first batch on june    sessions had to recuse himself from involvement in russia related probes at the justice department because he had not told congress of his own contacts with kislyak in   rosenstein is handling matters related to russia and it is he who appointed mueller as special counsel   is trump himself under investigation  in the short letter trump sent to comey dismissing him from the fbi  he thanked comey for informing him on three separate occasions that he was not under investigation  comey confirmed in his written testimony that he told trump that he was not personally under investigation
