phoenix  reuters    u s  president donald trump revved up supporters on tuesday with a defense of his response to a white supremacist organized rally in virginia and a promise to shut down the u s  government if necessary to build a wall along the border with mexico  under fire for saying  both sides  were to blame for the violence between white supremacists and left wing counter protesters in virginia on aug    trump accused television networks of ignoring his calls for unity in the aftermath   i didn t say i love you because you re black  or i love you because you re white   trump said   i love all the people of our country   police used pepper spray to disperse crowds after protesters threw rocks and bottles outside the convention center where trump spoke  police said  trump  who often uses news organizations as a foil  repeatedly singled out the media for criticism of how it covered the violence in the virginia college town of charlottesville and the resulting political fallout   these are truly dishonest people  they re bad people  i really think they don t like our country   trump said   the only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media   adopting a glib tone  trump said many reporters ignored his condemnation of white supremacists  including the ku klux klan    i hit  em with neo nazi  i hit  em with everything     kkk  we have kkk  i got  em all   he said  james clapper  a former director of u s  national intelligence  expressed concern at trump s performance  calling it  downright scary and disturbing    i question his fitness to be in office   clapper told cnn  funding for the border wall has flagged in the u s  congress as many lawmakers question whether trump s main promise during the  presidential election campaign is really necessary  but with a budget battle looming  trump said he would be willing to risk a politically damaging government shutdown in order to secure funding for the wall   he visited the border region in yuma  arizona  earlier on tuesday   if we have to close down our government  we re building that wall   trump said   we re going to have our wall  the american people voted for immigration control  we re going to get that wall   with thousands of supporters cheering him on  trump also weighed in on another racially charged issue  hinting he would pardon former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio  arpaio    who battled illegal immigration in the phoenix area  was found guilty last month of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a  court order in a racial profiling case  trump covered the gamut of issues  from nafta trade talks to the u s  showdown with north korea  during a raucous  rambling and defiant political speech lasting an hour and  minutes   he said he might terminate the nafta treaty with mexico and canada to jumpstart negotiations  and said the standoff with north korea over its weapons programs might have taken a positive turn  however  it was unclear whether the speech would help lay the foundation for a comeback from the deep political crisis trump finds himself in after only seven months in office and an approval rating below  percent  he expressed frustration that the republican controlled congress was unable to approve healthcare legislation that failed to pass the senate by one vote last month  one of the votes against the legislation was cast by  republican senator john mccain of arizona  who was recently  diagnosed with brain cancer  without mentioning their names  trump criticized both mccain and his fellow arizona republican  senator jeff flake  neither mccain nor flake attended the event  trump complained repeatedly about the  one vote  that stopped the senate from repealing and replacing obamacare  the signature domestic policy of his predecessor  barack obama   one vote away  i will not mention any names   very presidential  and nobody wants me to mention your other senator  who s weak on border  weak on crime  nobody knows who the hell he is  see  i haven t mentioned any names  so now everybody s happy   he said  the white house had said earlier when asked about arpaio that  there will be no discussion of that today    that did not stop trump from raising the subject   do the people in this room like sheriff joe   trump asked  sparking loud applause and a chant of  pardon joe    was sheriff joe convicted for doing his job   trump asked  before predicting that arpaio would be just fine   i won t do it tonight because i don t want to cause any controversy  but sheriff joe can feel good   he said  trump drew broad criticism for blaming both white nationalists and counter protesters for the deadly violence at the charlottesville rally  which was organized by neo nazis and white supremacists  one woman was killed  he mocked left wing protesters in his speech  protesters outside tuesday s rally yelled   shame  shame  shame  and  no trump  no kkk  no fascist usa  as the trump supporters began filing into the phoenix convention center  supporters  who lined up for hours in the arizona heat ahead of the event  chanted   build the wall   many wore red hats with trump s campaign slogan   make america great again    trump has held a series of  re election campaign stops despite only having taken office in january   phoenix mayor greg stanton  a democrat  had asked him to postpone tuesday s event while the nation healed from outrage and division after the deadly rally in charlottesville  a heavy police presence was deployed around the phoenix venue for trump s first trip as president to arizona  which he won in the  election
