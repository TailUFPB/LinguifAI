washington  reuters    while democrats and immigration advocates recoiled at hard line immigration proposals unveiled this week by the white house  they see a chance to force republicans  hand on legislation to help young  dreamers  brought to the country illegally as children  their focus  a spending bill that congress will need to pass in december in order to keep the u s  government open  republicans  who control both houses of congress  may need democratic votes to approve the legislation because of divisions within their party over fiscal restraint   democrats are considering insisting on help for the dreamers as their price for providing the votes that may be required to prevent a government shutdown  republican president donald trump ended the obama era daca program last month that protected the dreamers  and gave congress six months to find a solution   this is all heading towards a december deal on dreamers as part of an omnibus or spending package   said frank sharry  executive director of america s voice  a liberal leaning immigration advocacy group   if trump embraces the nativists in his base and says   no deal unless i get everything   there won t be many if any democratic votes for a spending package that excludes dreamers   house of representatives democratic leader nancy pelosi told the washington post on monday she did not rule out withholding democratic support for the spending bill if needed to obtain a deal to protect the nearly   dreamers in the united states  asked about the possibility of including action on dreamers in the spending measure  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said the administration was not focused on the implementation process at the moment but would get into that at meetings this week after releasing the president s priorities on sunday night  in december  trump and congress face the expiration of a three month deal struck on sept   to prevent a government shutdown   that surprise deal between trump and congressional democrats maintained federal government funding at levels then in place until dec    another stopgap bill will likely be needed to replace that  setting up further fiscal and legislative drama in washington  republican leaders in the house have struggled in recent years to get a consensus within their party on budget deals  members of the conservative freedom caucus have often demanded deep budget cuts unpalatable to more moderate republicans  if enough republican lawmakers break ranks on the budget  house leaders would need democratic votes to help make up the difference and avoid a government shutdown   deal making        trump as a businessman had a reputation for working to get deals by opening with an aggressive list of demands and later leaving the door open to compromise     administration officials want his immigration priorities implemented in conjunction with a plan to give dreamers legal status  the wish list includes funding for a wall on the u s  border with mexico and a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the united states from central america  pro immigration advocates dismissed those demands as non starters and largely brushed off their release as immaterial to the debate because they were unacceptable to democrats and many republicans   i don t think that the ideas that were presented on sunday really change the discussion or complicate things at all   said tom jawetz  vice president of immigration policy at the center for american progress  advocates say there is bipartisan support for measures to prevent dreamers from facing deportation and allow them to secure work permits after trump ended the deferred action for childhood arrivals program enacted under former democratic president barack obama  the white house and many trump supporters are eager  however  to see key campaign promises on border security enacted in exchange for any such fix  that has advocates focused on the spending  or omnibus bill  as an avenue for dreamer legislation that could pass both chambers unencumbered by demands related to immigration enforcement    it s highly unlikely that a stand alone bill could ever reach the president s desk   said tyler moran  managing director of the dc immigration hub  a strategy organization for pro immigration groups   the only vehicle is the omnibus bill    this story was refiled to fix typographical errors in final paragraph
