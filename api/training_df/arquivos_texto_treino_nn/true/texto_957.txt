washington  reuters    an obscure trump campaign adviser pleaded guilty to lying to fbi agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top russian officials  in the first criminal charges alleging links between the campaign and moscow  said court documents released on monday  george papadopoulos  who joined the trump presidential campaign in march   lied in january about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then republican presidential candidate donald trump and russian president vladimir putin  special counsel robert mueller said in the documents  the documents said an unidentified campaign official advised papadopoulos around may  that trump himself  is not doing these trips  but that  it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal   while not mentioned in the documents  top trump campaign advisers  including trump s eldest son  donald trump jr   his son in law  jared kushner  and campaign manager paul manafort met at trump tower in new york in june  with russians claiming to have derogatory information on democratic rival hillary clinton  it was not known whether that meeting resulted from papadopoulos  efforts  the special counsel said papadopoulos   a chicago based international energy lawyer   lied to federal bureau of investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that russia claimed to have  dirt  in the form of  thousands of emails  on clinton  prosecutors said papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined trump s campaign  in fact  they said  papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders on monday played down papadopoulos  campaign role  saying it was  extremely limited  and that he was a volunteer   he asked to do things  and  he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way   she told a news briefing   any actions that he took would have been on his own   papadopoulos  lawyers said in a statement it was  in the best interest of our client      that we refrain from commenting on george s case    the documents were released just after indictments charging manafort and business associate rick gates with multiple offenses  including money laundering  conspiracy against the united states and failing to register as foreign agents  none of the charges against manafort and gates  however  directly relate to mueller s investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and what u s  intelligence agencies concluded was a russian bid to boost trump s candidacy  the prosecutors said papadopoulos had been emailing with a  campaign supervisor    senior policy adviser  and a  high ranking campaign official   an official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and russia said the senate intelligence committee already had copies of an extensive file of trump campaign emails that included emails between papadopoulos and the campaign  one email shows manafort had been discussing papadopoulos  efforts to arrange a trump visit to russia with at least one other campaign official  papadopoulos pleaded guilty on oct    according to a court statement by mueller s office  as part of a plea deal  papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a  materially false  fictitious and fraudulent statement  to fbi agents   through his false statements and omissions  defendant papadopoulos impeded the fbi s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the campaign and the russian government s efforts to interfere with the  presidential election   a court document said  the fbi arrested papadopoulos on july  after he arrived at dulles international airport near washington  in an oct   letter to the chicago man s lawyer  mueller and his team noted that papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to     but they agreed  to bring to the court s attention at sentencing the defendant s efforts to cooperate with the government  on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors  the document said  court documents said papadopoulos lied to the fbi shortly after trump s jan   inauguration  when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged russian government efforts to interfere in the  campaign  in addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor  prosecutors said papadopoulos mischaracterized his contacts with that individual as  inconsequential    in truth and in fact  however  defendant papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high level russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in moscow  before telling papadopoulos about the  dirt  on clinton  said the prosecutors  the prosecutors said papadopoulos also lied to the fbi in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in london with an unidentified russian woman with ties to senior russian officials occurred before the chicago man joined the campaign  the meeting took place on or about march     and the russian woman was introduced to papadopoulos as a relative of putin  although it turned out that she was not related to the russian leader  according to the documents  papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the russian woman to set up the putin meeting  and kept other trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts  they said  in one email  the documents said  the russian woman told papadopoulos that  the russian federation would love to welcome him  trump  once his candidature would be officially announced   the prosecutors said that on or about march  papadopoulos attended a  national security meeting  in washington with then candidate trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers  when he introduced himself to the group  the prosecutors said   he stated  in sum and substance  that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate trump and president putin   in mid april  the professor introduced papadopoulos via an email to an individual in moscow who the documents dubbed the russian mfa connection   mfa being the initials for the ministry of foreign affairs  the pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the  groundwork  for a trump putin meeting
