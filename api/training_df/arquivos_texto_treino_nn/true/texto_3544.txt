brussels washington  reuters    once u s  president donald trump returns from his overseas trip  the white house plans to launch its most aggressive effort yet to push back against allegations involving russia and his presidential campaign  tackling head on a scandal that has threatened to consume his young presidency  trump s advisers are planning to establish a  war room  to combat mounting questions about communication between russia and his presidential campaign before and after november s presidential election  while bringing new aides into the white house  administration officials and persons close to trump told reuters  the strategic shake up comes as republicans in washington increasingly have fretted that the probe  continued chaos in the west wing and trump s steady slide in opinion polls will derail the president s drive to reform healthcare  cut taxes and rebuild the nation s infrastructure  upon trump s return  the administration will add experienced political professionals  including trump s former campaign manager  and possibly more lawyers to handle the russia probe  which has gained new urgency since the justice department appointed a special counsel to head the investigation  the sources said  beyond pushing back at suggestions that moscow is unduly influencing trump s administration  the messaging effort will also focus on advancing trump s stalled policy agenda and likely involve more trips out of washington that will feature the kind of raucous rallies that were the hallmark of trump s campaign  a person in regular touch with the white house said it needed a different structure to focus on the  new reality  that there would be continued leaks to the media from the law enforcement and intelligence communities  leaks that have increased in frequency since trump fired former federal bureau of investigation director james comey on may    since the firing of comey  that really exposed the fact that the white house in its current structure     is not prepared for really a one front war  let alone a two front war   the person said   they need to have a structure in place that allows them to stay focused  while  also truly fighting back on these attacks and these leaks   the white house declined to comment on plans for a  war room  but said trump will be looking to expand on momentum it believes it has built up during the president s trip to saudi arabia  israel  and europe  a white house official confirmed plans to hold more rallies  trump returns to washington on saturday from his first trip abroad as president   the president has had an incredibly successful trip overseas and the white house looks forward to continuing an aggressive messaging strategy to highlight his agenda when we return to d c    said white house spokeswoman sarah sanders  jared kushner  a senior adviser to trump  will be involved in the new strategic messaging operation  as will steve bannon  another top adviser who specializes in managing trump s populist appeal and shaping his political image  the sources said  bannon and trump s chief of staff  reince priebus  have been laying the groundwork for the plan this week  they added  on thursday  nbc news and the washington post reported that kushner  who held several meetings with russian officials following the election  is a focus of the probe  making him the first current white house official to be caught up in it  although kushner  who is trump s son in law  has not been accused of any wrongdoing  corey lewandowski  trump s former campaign manager  is also expected to be part of the effort  lewandowski  who has been seen in the white house recently  could join the administration as early as next week  a source close to him said  lewandowski was fired by trump in june  over concerns that he was not experienced enough to oversee the general election fight against democrat hillary clinton  but has remained a trusted adviser to trump and a steadfast defender of the president on news programs  this month  the justice department named robert mueller  a former fbi director  as an independent special counsel in the probe  trump has been frustrated of late that his communications team hasn t done a more effective job at making the case that he isn t implicated in the russia probe and highlighting his administration s successes  sources close to the president said  the white house declined to comment on the president s frustrations  another republican close to the white house said the new team is taking a page out of former president bill clinton s playbook  when clinton faced impeachment in the late   he assembled a crisis management operation that dealt with fallout from his affair with monica lewinsky while allowing the rest of the white house to deal with day to day policy matters    the goal of the white house is to try and contain the crisis and media coverage of the special counsel   the republican said  christopher ruddy  chief executive of newsmax media and a trump friend  said he expects the president will travel more when he returns from overseas and encouraged the white house to focus on issues that pump up his base voters   from my perspective  i think the president should be doing the stuff that he does best  which is talking about his agenda  jobs  trade and security   ruddy said   trump has scheduled a political rally for next week in cedar rapids  iowa  the white house said other similar events are in the planning stages  republicans in congress are aching for trump to leave the distraction of the russia probe aside and focus on legislation and nominating officials to fill the hundreds of vacant slots across the administration    what we really want to be able to do is tend to our business   mike rounds  a republican senator from south dakota  told reuters   we ve got a healthcare bill we re working on  we ve got tax reform that we think is important   some of trump s donors  too  say they are concerned  stanley hubbard  a billionaire radio mogul from minnesota  said he worries that the white house continues to be distracted by the russia scandal  but laid some of the blame on trump himself    he talks when he shouldn t   he said  former u s  house speaker john boehner said this week that trump s time in office has been a  complete disaster  aside from foreign affairs  boehner  a fellow republican  told an energy conference he supported efforts to  get to the bottom  of any potential interactions between trump associates and the russian government but described any calls to impeach trump as the purview of  the crazy left wing democratic colleagues of mine
