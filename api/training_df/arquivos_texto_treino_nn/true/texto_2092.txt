chicago  reuters    former white house chief strategist steve bannon s firing has been met with a collective shrug by some of president donald trump s most committed supporters who argue the controversial nationalist became an obstacle to the administration s agenda     in interviews in multiple cities this weekend  americans who voted for trump said bannon s departure on friday was the removal of an unnecessary distraction for the trump presidency  while others saw his role as largely inconsequential and possibly overblown  many expected trump to stay the course without him   bannon was becoming too big of a story and taking the spotlight from president trump   bob janda  a  year old small business owner  said in a bar in chicago   when that happens  your days are numbered  i think trump will be fine   at the same bar  frank cardone    pointed out that bannon had a brief tenure in trump s inner circle  having joined the republican businessman s presidential campaign as its chief executive less than three months before the nov   election   bannon wasn t with trump for too long so it s no big loss   said cardone  a retired electrician   before hitching himself to trump  bannon was the executive chairman of breitbart news  a hard right site  he immediately returned to that role after his exit from the white house  vowing to use it as a platform to defend trump    bannon    has touted breitbart as a conservative counterpoint to what he views as the liberal bias of u s  news outlets and a platform for the so called alt right  a loose confederation of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites  he played a key role in some of trump s most contentious policy moves including the travel ban on people from several muslim majority nations  departure from the paris climate accord and rejection of the trans pacific partnership trade deal  bannon s exit gives trump a chance to distance himself from  fringe  politics  said mike corbitt  a machinist from florida s west palm beach   he  trump  needs to be more center right because the far right and the far left is not where america is   corbitt    said at a fort lauderdale bar   steve bannon was great for getting trump elected  but now the president needs someone who can get his policies enacted   bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the trump administration in the past five weeks  leading to the appointment of retired marine general john kelly as the new white house chief of staff  while some observers have characterized the moves as a sign of chaos in the white house  others see it as a sign that trump is running his administration like a well oiled corporation   all these shakeups mean is that trump is doing his job   liz lingafelter  a  year old nurse  said in fort lauderdale   he s a businessman and is doing what s best for the organization   that view was echoed by rick weatherly  a  year old denver maintenance technician   i voted for trump  not bannon   he said
