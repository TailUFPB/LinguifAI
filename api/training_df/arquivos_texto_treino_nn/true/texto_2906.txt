washington  reuters    the trump administration will soon begin a review that will question the veracity of the climate change science used by president barack obama s administration as the basis for environmental regulations   the move by the environmental protection agency to launch public debates between scientists on climate research  known as red team  blue team exercises  would be the first major effort by the republican administration to challenge the long standing scientific consensus on human caused climate change   advocates who have petitioned the epa to reverse the scientific finding underlying u s  regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions see the proposal to scrutinize mainstream climate science as a first step in that direction   it s a way to survey the landscape before reopening the endangerment finding   said myron ebell  head of the competitive enterprise institute  one of the groups that filed a petition with the agency to undo the  scientific determination that formed the basis for the democratic obama administration s regulation of greenhouse gases  in   the supreme court ruled that the epa had authority under the federal clean air act to regulate greenhouse gases from cars if the agency determined they endangered human health   epa administrator scott pruitt has spoken several times about the merits of opening the climate change debate up to the public  the website climatewire on friday cited a senior administration official  who said pruitt plans to launch the back and forth scientific critiques formally   francis menton  a lawyer who filed an endangerment finding petition in january on behalf of the concerned household electricity consumers council  said pruitt told an event at the manhattan institute think tank in new york on friday that he would launch the debates in the next few months  menton said he asked pruitt whether he had made a decision on reopening the endangerment finding  pruitt said the agency is weighing its options  the review  can create a body of scientific work that can be trustworthy and dependable to make regulatory choices and decisions   said rob henneke  of the texas public policy foundation  a third group that filed an endangerment finding petition   unlike the other two  it has challenged the legality of the endangerment finding  not the science  environmental groups are confident that pruitt will not be successful if he tries to undo the endangerment finding because they expect the courts will side with the scientific consensus that human beings cause climate change  pruitt and the epa would need to build up a new case that shows carbon dioxide is innocuous and counter the volumes of scientific research that support the finding   if he has any grasp of scientific and legal reality  he would realize that it s a fool s errand to reverse the endangerment determination   said david doniger  climate director for the natural resources defense counsel    this could be a way for him to keep the right wing fringe groups occupied and also accomplish the goal of further confusing the public debate   he said  ebell  who was also the transition leader of the trump epa  had previously been critical of pruitt s hesitation to take on the endangerment finding because of the time and staffing it would require   the trump administration has not yet appointed second tier assistant administrators to run different policy divisions of the agency   i think  the red team  blue team process  is a logical first step  but i don t think it commits the administrator to anything yet   ebell said
