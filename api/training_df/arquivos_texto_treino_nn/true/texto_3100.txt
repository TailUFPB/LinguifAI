washington beijing  reuters    chinese efforts to persuade north korea to rein in its nuclear program have failed  president donald trump said on tuesday  ratcheting up the rhetoric over the death of an american student who had been detained by pyongyang  trump has held high hopes for greater cooperation from china to exert influence over north korea  leaning heavily on chinese president xi jinping for his assistance  the two leaders had a high profile summit in florida in april and trump has frequently praised xi while resisting criticizing chinese trade practices   while i greatly appreciate the efforts of president xi   china to help with north korea  it has not worked out  at least i know china tried   trump wrote on twitter  it was unclear whether his remark represented a significant shift in his thinking in the u s  struggle to stop north korea s nuclear program and its test launching of missiles or a change in u s  policy toward china   i think the president is signaling some frustration   christopher hill  a former u s  ambassador to south korea  told msnbc   he s signaling to others that he understands this isn t working  and he s trying to defend himself  or justify himself  by saying that at least they tried as opposed to others who didn t even try   china s foreign ministry said on wednesday that china had made  unremitting efforts  to resolve tensions on the korean peninsula  and that it had  always played and important and constructive role    china s efforts to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue is not due to any external pressure  but because china is a member of the region and a responsible member of the international community  and because resolving the peninsula nuclear issue is in china s interests   ministry spokesman geng shuang told a daily news briefing   on tuesday  a u s  official  who did not want to be identified  said u s  spy satellites had detected movements recently at north korea s nuclear test site near a tunnel entrance  but it was unclear if these were preparations for a new nuclear test   perhaps to coincide with high level talks between the united states and china in washington on wednesday   north korea remains prepared to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time when there is an order from leadership but there are no new unusual indications that can be shared   a south korean defense ministry official said  speaking on the condition of anonymity   seoul was in close consultation with washington over the matter  the official added      north korea last tested a nuclear bomb in september  but it has conducted repeated missile test since and vowed to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  putting it at the forefront of trump s security worries  u s  china dialogue the trump statement about china was likely to increase pressure on beijing ahead of wednesday s diplomatic and security dialogue  which will pair u s  secretary of state rex tillerson and defense secretary james mattis with china s top diplomat  state councilor yang jiechi  and general fang fenghui  chief of joint staff of the people s liberation army  the state department says the dialogue will focus on ways to increase pressure on north korea  but also cover such areas as counter terrorism and territorial rivalries in the south china sea  the u s  side is expected to press china to cooperate on a further toughening of international sanctions on north korea  the united states and its allies would like to see an oil embargo and bans on the north korean airline and guest workers among other moves  steps diplomats say have been resisted by china and russia  in a sign that u s  chinese relations remain stable  a white house aide said trump s daughter ivanka trump and her husband  white house senior adviser jared kushner  were invited by the chinese government to visit the country later this year  trump has hardened his rhetoric against north korea following the death of otto warmbier  a university of virginia student who died on monday in the united states after returning from captivity in north korea in a coma  in a white house meeting with visiting ukraine president petro poroshenko  trump criticized the way warmbier s case was handled in the year since his arrest  appearing to assail both north korea and his predecessor  president barack obama   what happened to otto is a disgrace  and i spoke with his family  his family is incredible     but he should have been brought home a long time ago   trump said  state department spokeswoman heather nauert said the united states holds north korea accountable for warmbier s  unjust imprisonment  and urged pyongyang to release three other americans who are detained  chinese state run newspaper the global times  published by the official people s daily  said chinese officials must be wary that warmbier s death might push washington to put greater pressure on beijing   china has made the utmost efforts to help break the stalemate in the north korean nuclear issue  but by no means will china  nor will chinese society permit it to  act as a  u s  ally  in pressuring north korea   the global times said in an editorial  if washington imposes sanctions on chinese enterprises  it would lead to  grave friction  between the two countries  said the paper  which does not represent chinese government policy  trump s tweet about china took some advisers by surprise  a senior administration official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the united states had limited options to rein in north korea without chinese assistance  white house spokesman sean spicer said a meeting between trump and north korean leader kim jong un is less likely following warmbier s death  spicer said trump would be willing to meet kim under the right conditions  but  clearly we re moving further away  not closer to those conditions   for graphic on americans detained by north korea  click  tmsnrt rs
