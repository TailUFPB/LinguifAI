 reuters    twitter inc faced questions on friday about its approach to internal security after a company employee briefly deactivated u s  president donald trump s account  the  minute blackout of the  realdonaldtrump account late on thursday drew widespread attention to the microblogging site  trump frequently uses twitter to announce policy  assail his adversaries and to tangle with countries  including north korea  over world affairs  some users voiced fears that future employee interference or technology glitches involving trump s account could threaten national security   the incident also came as twitter grapples with overall criticism of its handling of account suspensions  user abuse and ever changing terms of service    twitter said in a tweet on friday   we have implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again  we won t be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures  but we take this seriously and our teams are on it   a company representative declined to answer questions including how many employees can suspend an account or what special protections there are for high profile users like trump  trump was back on twitter soon after the account was restored  and the employee did not send or alter any tweets   cyber security experts had previously speculated twitter could have installed special protections on trump s account  such as the ability to only access it from certain devices   we have learned that this was done by a twitter customer support employee who did this on the employee s last day  we are conducting a full internal review   twitter said in a tweet late on thursday   we are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again   the company said in an earlier tweet  reuters could not determine how many twitter employees had the authority to delete accounts or if any had the ability to tamper with them in other ways  such as by sending bogus tweets    in all seriousness  we need accountability for social media sites   ken meyer  who served as digital director for former vice president joe biden  tweeted   lone employees shouldn t be able to change statements from the president   speaking on condition of anonymity  a former twitter employee said it was unlikely a worker with suspension privileges would also be able to hijack an account to send out messages     different types of access   the former employee said   i m not sure anyone at twitter can tweet from someone else s account    another person familiar with twitter operations  speaking on condition of anonymity  said employees currently cannot post from a user s account  change or even view a user s password  which is encrypted  joseph lorenzo hall  chief technologist at the nonprofit center for democracy and technology  said the suspension reflected a need for twitter to be more transparent about its ability to control accounts but also demonstrated the perils of a head of state relying on digital technology as a primary mode of communication   it would be nice to rely on older forms of policy communication with solid foundations   he said  adding that twitter should require two person controls for certain high profile accounts  the new york times on friday reported the rogue employee was in fact a contractor  citing two anonymous sources familiar with the incident   twitter and other tech companies have ramped up their reliance on contractors due to pressure to respond more quickly and thoroughly to content violations  while the companies  are desperately reliant upon human nuance and sophistication for decision making  human will is quite a risk   sarah roberts  a ucla professor who studies such contractors  said in a tweet   ain t that a bind   the company on friday separately announced minor updates to its rules  including more clarity on what actions could result in an account suspension  it was the latest in a string of iterative changes amid criticism the platform too slowly and inconsistently responds to abuse  twitter shares were up   percent in afternoon trading   trump  who has nearly  million twitter followers  responded to the temporary loss of his account by boasting about his wide reach on the service   my twitter account was taken down for  minutes by a rogue employee   trump said on twitter early on friday   i guess the word must finally be getting out and having an impact   he has used twitter to attack opponents and promote his policies  both during the  presidential campaign and since taking office in january  thursday s incident also raised questions about how twitter secures the official  potus presidential account and other accounts that could potentially influence world events  technology companies including twitter are  meanwhile  under attack from u s  lawmakers for failing to stem the spread of russian propaganda and misinformation on their platforms  twitter in particular has long been criticized for not doing enough to police its platform and respond to complaints of harassment   though the temporary deletion of the trump account sparked a flood of criticism from twitter users  many of the president s critics also said they were happy to see the account disabled   in   hackers took control of the main account for the associated press and tweeted that explosions at the white house had injured then president barack obama  causing stocks to briefly plunge
