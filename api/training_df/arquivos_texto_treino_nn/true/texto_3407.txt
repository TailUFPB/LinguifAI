singapore  reuters    the united states is encouraged by china s efforts to restrain north korea but washington will not accept beijing s militarization of islands in the south china sea  u s  defense secretary jim mattis said on saturday  the comments by mattis  during the annual shangri la dialogue  show how u s  president donald trump s administration is looking to balance working with china to restrain north korea s advancing missile and nuclear programs while dealing with beijing s activities in the south china sea  u s  allies have been worried by trump s actively courting chinese president xi jinping to restrain north korea  fearing washington might allow china a more free rein elsewhere in the region  some allies have also expressed concern that washington s withdrawal from the trans pacific trade partnership and the paris global climate accord signals the united states is diluting its global leadership role  speaking at the dialogue  asia s premier security forum  mattis said the united states remained fully engaged with its partners    like it or not  we are a part of the world   what a crummy world if we all retreat inside our borders   he said    once we have exhausted all possible alternatives  the americans will do the right thing   mattis added  paraphrasing a quotation by british wartime leader winston churchill   so we will still be there and we will be there with you   nevertheless  reversing or slowing north korea s nuclear and missile programs has become a security priority for washington  given pyongyang s vow to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  the trump administration has been pressing china aggressively to rein in its reclusive neighbor  warning all options are on the table if north korea persists with its weapons programs   the trump administration is encouraged by china s renewed commitment to work with the international community toward denuclearization   mattis said    ultimately  we believe china will come to recognize north korea as a strategic liability  not an asset   however  mattis said seeking china s cooperation on north korea did not mean washington would not challenge beijing s activities in the south china sea  the u n  security council on friday expanded targeted sanctions against north korea after its repeated missile tests  adopting the first such resolution agreed by the united states and china since trump took office  in another sign of increased pressure on north korea  japan s navy and air force began a three day military exercise with two u s  aircraft carriers in the sea of japan on thursday  japanese defense minister tomomi inada  speaking at the singapore forum  said tokyo backed the united states using any option to deal with north korea  including military strikes  and was seeking a deeper alliance with washington  but she also said she was concerned about the situation in the south china sea and in the east china sea     china s claims in the south china sea  through which about   trillion in ship borne trade passes each year  are contested by brunei  malaysia  the philippines  taiwan and vietnam  china and japan both claim islands in the east china sea  low key china  which sent only a low key delegation to the forum   said its ties with the united states were vital for the region   i believe that if china and the united states can ensure no conflict  as well as maintain mutual respect  cooperation and trust  it will contribute greatly to security in the asia pacific and the world   lt gen he lei  the head of beijing s delegation  told reporters      allies around the world have been concerned about the commitment of the united states since trump took office on jan   because of his  america first  rhetoric and expectations that he would concentrate on a domestic agenda   we are still trying to figure out his  trump s  policy in our region   said malaysian defense minister hishammuddin hussein   i would like to know very clearly what are the true intentions of the new administration      mattis sought to ease concerns for allies in the asia pacific  saying the region was a priority and the primary effort was alliance building  he added  however  that countries must  contribute sufficiently to their own security   in a sign of the u s  commitment to the region  mattis said that soon about  percent of overseas tactical aviation assets would be assigned to the region and he would work with the u s  congress on an asia pacific stability initiative  mattis said the united states welcomed china s economic development  but he anticipated  friction  between the two countries   while competition between the u s  and china  the world s two largest economies  is bound to occur  conflict is not inevitable   mattis said   while eager to work with china in dealing with north korea  mattis said the united states did not accept china placing weapons and other military assets on man made islands in the south china sea    we oppose countries militarizing artificial islands and enforcing excessive maritime claims   mattis said   we cannot and will not accept unilateral  coercive changes to the status quo
