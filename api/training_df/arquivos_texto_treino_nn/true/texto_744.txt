new york  reuters    president donald trump is more popular with likely voters than he is with the general public  according to a reuters ipsos poll that underscores why republican lawmakers have largely stuck with the polarizing president despite his plunging approval ratings  the poll  released on wednesday  shows he polls better among people who voted in the  presidential election than with the overall u s  adult population   a group that includes both voters and non voters  only about  percent of the voting age public took part in last year s election  in october  for example   percent of  voters said they approved of trump s performance in office  compared with  percent of the general population  among republicans   percent of voters approved of trump in october  compared with  percent of all republicans   graphic  tmsnrt rs   some  percent of those who voted for trump in  said they would do so again  the poll found  the findings suggest that republican candidates in the  congressional elections who shun the president risk alienating his followers  republican strategists and political scientists said  at the same time  those who embrace him in the early primary races that choose party candidates risk losing moderate voters in the general election   it s very difficult for any republican candidate to distance themselves from trump   said michael mcdonald  an expert on voter turnout at the university of florida   that dilemma played out in virginia on tuesday  when ed gillespie  the republican candidate in the governor s race  was soundly beaten by his democratic opponent  gillespie had adopted some of trump s hardline positions but had avoided campaigning with the unpopular president   gillespie s strategy had been closely watched within the party to see if it could provide a template for other republican candidates in   when control of the house of representatives and the senate will be up for grabs  gillespie s loss sparked debate among republicans on the way forward on wednesday  trump suggested in a tweet that the outcome could have been different had gillespie fully embraced him  but critics pointed out that exit polls showed that a third of virginian voters had turned out to signal displeasure with trump  double the number who cast ballots to express support for the president   tuesday s results clearly signal that opposition to trump has grown  even though he remains popular among  republican voters  said elaine kamarck  an expert in presidential politics at the brookings institution   for republicans   the hurdle won t be with getting out the base   kamarck said   it will be in getting anyone else to vote for you  in elections where republican voters are outnumbered  reuters ipsos was able to compare the opinions of voters with the general public by creating two separate surveys  a poll of voters and a poll of the public   for the voter poll  reuters ipsos reconnected with people who took its exit poll on nov      the day of the u s  presidential election  those voters were sent additional questionnaires in may  july and october that asked if they approved or disapproved of the president   their responses were then compared with the results of a separate survey   the reuters ipsos national tracking poll   that surveys all adults in the united states  in may and july  the results of both polls were nearly identical  with about  percent of voters and the general adult population expressing approval for the president  the two polls diverged in october  however  with voters expressing stronger levels of approval than the general public   jan leighley  an expert on political behavior at american university  said it makes sense that trump is more popular among people who voted in the  election  they were more likely to be white and less likely to identify with democrats than the general public  she said   the reuters ipsos poll is conducted online in english throughout the country  some   of those  voters took the  survey between may    followed by   who took the july   survey and   who took the survey between oct      individual responses were weighted so they would reflect the latest population estimates  as well as the support their presidential pick received in the election  each of the voter polls had a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of  percentage points for the entire group and  percentage points for republican voters
