sydney wellington  reuters    president donald trump s alleged disclosure of highly classified information to russia s foreign minister is unlikely to stop allies who share intelligence with washington from cooperating  officials said on tuesday  some experts added  however  that the reports could undermine trust between partners    if this really happened  it s an unfortunate episode    said adam thomson  a former british ambassador to nato and now with the european leadership network think tank in london   but they ll suck it up  why  because other countries need u s  intelligence cooperation more than the other way round    in a meeting with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and russian ambassador sergei kislyak  trump disclosed intelligence about a planned islamic state operation  which was supplied by a u s  ally  two officials with knowledge of the situation said  the name of the ally or intelligence sharing operation was not disclosed   the white house declared the allegations  first reported by the washington post  incorrect and trump said he had an  absolute right  to share facts to get moscow to step up its fight against islamic state  interfax news agency quoted the russian foreign ministry saying the reports were  fake    two of washington s allies in the intelligence sharing network known as  five eyes    which groups the united states  britain  canada  australia and new zealand   played down the impact on their relationship with washington  australian prime minister malcolm turnbull told a radio station in adelaide he would maintain  my normal circumspection and discretion  on classified matters  adding the alliance with the united states  is the bedrock of our national security   trump and turnbull met last week aboard a decommissioned aircraft carrier in new york city after beginning their relations with a testy phone call in february   new zealand foreign minister gerry brownlee noted the story had been denied   the media reports have been rejected by senior u s  officials who were in the meeting   he said in an email via his spokeswoman   if there is ever to be a resolution of the dreadful situation in syria  it will require concerted efforts from both the u s  and russia   a japanese government official said it was simply not possible to stop cooperating with washington on intelligence matters  if the report is true and mr  trump is an untrustworthy person  it doesn t necessarily mean that we don t share information with the u s  anymore   said the official  speaking on condition of anonymity  while the president has the authority to disclose even the most highly classified information at will  in this case he did so without consulting the ally that provided it  which threatens to jeopardize a long standing intelligence sharing agreement  the two u s  officials said  national security analysts said relations could be damaged   effectively  trump s actions have thrown the world s most important intel sharing relationship into doubt at best  serious jeopardy at worst   stephanie carvin  a former national security analyst for the canadian government  said on twitter  referring to the  five eyes  arrangement  james curran  professor of foreign policy at the university of sydney  said the intelligence relationships were too important and productive to be damaged by trump s alleged disclosures to the russians   no real practical impact  but i do think it will raise more eyebrows about this president s style and his cavalier attitude to this type of thing  said curran  over the long term  however  such behavior  can potentially have very serious consequences for america s intelligence relationships across the world   curran said  rhys ball  who formerly worked for new zealand s intelligence service and is now a massey university security and defense analyst  said he thought it would be  business as usual  for the  five eyes  community   clearly someone has gulped at what was discussed or exchanged  but this might be the new norm when it comes to the united states and its attitude and foreign policy approach to the likes of the russians   ball said  even before trump s meeting with the russians  washington s intelligence partners abroad have noted a barrage of reports around trump  the russians and spies  they include the investigations into his election campaign s ties to moscow  probes into russian interference in the election  the president s own expressions of disdain for the u s  intelligence community and his claim that former president barack obama spied on him  citing a media report   first the firing of the fbi chief and now this   said one nato diplomat referring to trump s decision to dismiss fbi director james comey   how do we know the u s  defense secretary won t be fired next week or that intelligence finds its way into the wrong hands    but ball said intelligence co operation was too important to be constrained   five eyes is far too significant for anyone to wash their hands of it and five eyes has weathered a few storms over the years   ball said
