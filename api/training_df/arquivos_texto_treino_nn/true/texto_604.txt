washington  reuters    one thing is definitely going right for u s  president donald trump and his fellow republicans who control congress  they are steadily getting conservatives appointed as judges  advancing their long held ambition of reshaping the federal judiciary  so concern among conservatives arose after democrats swept to victory in state and local elections in virginia  new jersey and elsewhere this month  signaling potential trouble for republicans in the november  mid term elections in which control over congress is at stake  if the party s slim   majority in the senate  which reviews and confirms federal judicial nominees  is at risk  republicans may need to move even more quickly on getting judges confirmed by the senate for their lifetime posts  some legal experts said   obviously  who gets nominated and the pace of confirmations     changes dramatically if the senate were to flip back to the democrats   said john malcolm  a former justice department lawyer and now an analyst at the heritage foundation conservative think tank in washington  republicans  should be paying particular attention to pushing through as many nominees as they can   added malcolm  also active in the federalist society  a conservative lawyers  group whose members have frequently been tapped for judicial posts by republican presidents   trump and congressional republicans have not passed any major legislation since he took office in january despite controlling the white house and congress  but after a slow start that had worried conservative activists  republicans have made major headway on judicial appointments in recent weeks  the senate has now voted to confirm  trump judicial nominees  including donald coggins on thursday as a district judge in south carolina  that includes supreme court appointee neil gorsuch  eight others on regional appeals courts ranking just below the supreme court and five on trial courts  obama had only seven confirmed at this point in his presidency  democrats  who accused republicans of impeding nominations from trump s democratic predecessor barack obama  have said republicans are trying to ram trump s nominees through the senate  including some they say lack basic qualifications  conservative groups that just last month were criticizing senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for the pace of confirmations are now applauding him  mcconnell  in a move with little precedent in u s  history  last year refused to act on obama s nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court  paving the way for trump to restore the high court s conservative majority with gorsuch s appointment   when the history books are written about the trump administration  i believe perhaps the most long lasting and significant legacy will be the men and women appointed and confirmed to the federal bench   republican senator ted cruz said at a senate judiciary committee hearing on wednesday   trump has a unique opportunity to reshape the judiciary  he inherited more than  vacancies when he took office  twice the number obama inherited  the number has since climbed above    trump generally has selected deeply conservative nominees  many in their  and  and able to serve for decades  he could name up to  percent of the federal bench in his first four year term  said leonard leo  a trump advisor on judicial nominations  having a more conservative judiciary could be pivotal on legal disputes involving presidential powers  abortion  the death penalty  religious rights  gay rights  litigation involving corporations and other matters  the main impact of this infusion of conservative jurists will be to flip the ideological breakdown of several liberal leaning federal appeals courts  said political scientist sheldon goldman  an expert in judicial selection at the university of massachusetts at amherst   federal appeals courts  divided into  geographic regions plus two based in washington  often have the final say in major legal disputes because the supreme court hears only a small number of cases annually   during wednesday s judiciary committee hearing for six trump judicial nominees  democrats said republicans were acting on too many too quickly  preventing proper questioning of the candidates  trump s appointees may be more reliably conservative than those of previous republican presidents  goldman said nearly all have a connection to the federalist society  providing a  very consistent ideological vetting process   leo  the society s executive vice president  helped compile a shortlist of supreme court nominees for trump that included gorsuch  judges will be a focus of the society s national convention that started on thursday in washington  with trump selections including gorsuch due to appear  while republican lawmakers have been divided over legislation on issues including taxes and healthcare  judicial nominees are an issue on which tend to agree   fixing obamacare is no easy task   said carrie severino  chief counsel of the judicial crisis network conservative legal advocacy group   whereas the president has done such an excellent job of choosing nominees that it s a no brainer
