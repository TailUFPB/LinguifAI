chicago  reuters    chicago on monday sued to prevent the trump administration from enforcing new policies that would withhold money from so called sanctuary cities that deny u s  immigration officials access to local jails  the lawsuit  filed in u s  district court  said the federal policies force the nation s third largest city to choose between its constitutional rights and funding for law enforcement   these new conditions also fly in the face of longstanding city policy that promotes cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities   the lawsuit said  the policies also include a requirement that local law enforcement agencies give federal authorities  hours notice before releasing anyone wanted for immigration violations  democratic mayor rahm emanuel said on sunday that the city would sue  escalating a pushback against an immigration crackdown launched by republican president donald trump s administration   we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric  the threats from this administration embodied in these new conditions imposed on unrelated public safety grants funds are breeding a culture and climate of fear   emanuel s senior legal adviser  corporation counsel ed siskel  said on monday the conditions from the justice department apply to the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grants  which provide money to hundreds of cities  chicago is expected to receive    million this year for purchasing equipment  siskel said the city will follow the initial complaint with a motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the government s imposition of the new conditions   the city will request a decision from the judge before the sept   deadline to apply for the byrne grant  siskel said  u s  attorney general jeff sessions said on monday that chicago officials have shown an  open hostility  to enforcing laws designed to reduce crime and protect law enforcement   he added that more chicagoans were murdered last year than residents of los angeles and new york combined  and that chicago needed to reverse a  culture of lawlessness    this administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety   sessions said in a statement  the lawsuit is the first to challenge the justice department over the byrne program but is not the first legal attack on the administration s sanctuary city policies   emanuel said on sunday that the lawsuit would prevent the administration from setting a precedent that could be used to target other funding  sanctuary cities in general offer illegal immigrants safe harbor by declining to use municipal resources to enforce federal immigration laws  dozens of local governments and cities  including new york and san francisco  are part of the sanctuary movement   sanctuary city  is not an official designation  the lawsuit came nearly two weeks after sessions said the justice department would bar cities from the byrne program unless they allowed immigration authorities unlimited access to local jails and give the  hours pre release notice  chicago and its high murder rate have been frequently criticized by trump  and cracking down on illegal immigration was a theme of his  presidential campaign
