san francisco  reuters    russian hacking of the  u s  election included sophisticated targeting of state officials responsible for voter rolls and voting procedures  according to a top secret u s  intelligence document that was leaked and published this week  revealing another potential method of attempted interference in the vote  the month old national security agency document outlined activities including impersonating an election software vendor to send trick emails to more than  state election officials  analysts at the nsa believed the hackers were working for the russian military s general staff main intelligence directorate  or gru  according to the document  the document s publication on monday by the intercept  a news outlet that focuses on security issues  received particular attention because an intelligence contractor  reality leigh winner  was charged the same day with leaking it  u s  intelligence agencies have previously said the kremlin tried to influence the election outcome in favor of republican candidate donald trump through leaks during the campaign of hacked emails from democratic party officials  aimed at discrediting democratic candidate hillary clinton  the new revelations suggest that u s  investigators are also still probing a more direct attempt to attack the election itself  and a federal official confirmed that is the case  however  there is no evidence that hackers were able to manipulate votes  or the vote tally  the document says at least one employee of the software vendor had an account compromised but does not cover whether any of the elections officials were also successfully compromised  if they did compromise the officials  hackers could have planted malicious software  then captured proof of the infection to suggest that there had been fraud on clinton s behalf  had she won the nov   election  experts said   if your goal is to disrupt an election  you don t need to pick the winner or actually tamper with tally result   said matt blaze  a university of pennsylvania computer science professor who has written on the security of voting machines  simply casting doubt on the legitimacy of the results could achieve the goals of a government sponsored hacking campaign  he said   u s  intelligence officials had previously stated that russian intelligence had won access to  multiple  election officials but had said that compromised machines were not involved with vote tallies  but they had not said how sophisticated and extensive the effort was or how it worked  russian president vladimir putin has strongly denied russian government involvement in election hacking  though he said last week that  patriotic  russians could have been involved  trump has denied any collusion  spear phishing on elections officials the newly leaked nsa report said the hackers used so called  spear phishing  techniques on election officials  trying to convince targets to click on links in emails that seemed to come from legitimate correspondents  the report describes just one phishing campaign  which hit state officials a week before the election  but does not give any locations or say if it was successful  although there may have been many others  security experts said one coming so late in the game would be more likely to be about sowing chaos than  trying to alter vote counts   the report did not say what the hackers were trying to accomplish  and any investigation of the computers of people who were targeted would be the jurisdiction of the fbi  an fbi spokeswoman declined to comment tuesday  as did the office of the special counsel robert mueller  who is investigating possible collusion between trump campaign officials and the russian government  the  bait  used in the spear phishing campaign involved software for managing voter registration rolls  the hackers might have been considering deleting some records and forcing officials to turn legitimate voters away  said elections technology security expert alex halderman  of the university of michigan  there were no wide reports of mass rejections of voters  so perhaps that plan was abandoned or proved too hard to execute  he said  it is also possible that the idea was to get onto the machines of officials who oversaw both registration and voting software  elections are run by counties in the united states    depending on the county s configuration and security practices and what is separated from what  they could have access to potentially every aspect  from lists of registered voters  to voting  machines  to firmware on those machines  to the ballots that are presented  to the software that controls the final tally   blaze said   this is the holy grail of what an attacker would want to compromise    members of congress said they hoped to learn more about the hacking attempts   it s important that the american people understand that the russian attempts to break into a number of our state voting processes   we talked about this in the fall   was broad based   democrat mark warner  vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee  told reporters   it s my hope in the coming days that we can get more information out about that
