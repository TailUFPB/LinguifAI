manila  reuters    philippines president rodrigo duterte attacked canada s justin trudeau at the end of a summit of asian and western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs  a topic skirted by other leaders  including u s  president donald trump  at the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on tuesday  duterte was asked how he had responded to the canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra judicial killings in his anti drugs drive   i said i will not explain  it is a personal and official insult   the philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer  although he did not refer to trudeau by name   i only answer to the filipino  i will not answer to any other bullshit  especially foreigners  lay off   earlier in the day  trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with duterte  the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange   human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit  including trump  would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by duterte after he took office in mid   his government says the police act in self defense during drug busts  but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability  there was no pressure from trump on the drugs war when he met duterte on monday and the u s  president later said the two had a  great relationship   a joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides  underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential  and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs   duterte cursed trump s predecessor  barack obama  last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the united states  a close ally of the philippines since world war two  the relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and trump  trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of rohingya during a meeting with myanmar leader aung san suu kyi  another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders  although he did not mention the muslim minority by name   this is a tremendous concern to canada and to many  many countries around the world   he said  the government in mostly buddhist myanmar regards the rohingya as illegal immigrants from bangladesh and does not recognize the term  over   rohingya have fled to refugee camps in bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by rohingya militants on aug     the plight of the rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the united nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing  there have been calls for democracy champion suu kyi to be stripped of the nobel peace prize she won in  because she has not condemned the military s actions  some countries in the  member association of southeast asian nations  asean   particularly muslim majority malaysia  have voiced strong concern over the issue recently  however  in keeping with asean s principle of non interference in each others  internal affairs  it appeared to have been put aside at the summit  which brought southeast asian nations together with the united states  russia  japan  china  india  australia  new zealand and canada  duterte reported that china had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the south china sea with asean nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource rich waterway  the group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime  trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays  but he said his marathon trip to asia had been a  tremendous  success  he told reporters on air force one that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting   trump said at least   billion  possibly triple that figure  of deals had been agreed in the trip  he did not elaborate   we ve explained that the united states is open for trade but we want reciprocal  we want fair trade for the united states   he said  trade and concern about possible protectionism under trump s  america first  agenda have come up during his visit to the region  which included stops in japan  south korea  china  vietnam before concluding in the philippines  after trump left manila  a group of asia pacific nations pursuing a separate beijing backed trade deal that does not include the united states agreed to  intensify efforts  in  to bring their negotiations to a conclusion  the regional comprehensive economic partnership  rcep  appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by trump s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership  tpp  trade agreement  to which china is not party  the two trade deals are not mutually exclusive  asean is joined in the rcep talks by china  india  australia  new zealand  japan and south korea
