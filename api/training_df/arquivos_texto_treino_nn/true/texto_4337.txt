new york washington  reuters    an attempt by u s  authorities to identify an anonymous critic of president donald trump on twitter has set off alarm bells among democratic and republican lawmakers and civil liberties advocates fearful of a crackdown on dissent   twitter inc on friday succeeded in beating back a demand for records about a twitter account called alt immigration   altuscis   which pokes fun at trump s immigration policies and appears to be run by one or more federal employees  the u s  government withdrew an administrative summons that customs agents had sent the company in march demanding the records  but the government backed away only after twitter filed a federal lawsuit accusing it of violating the first amendment s protection of free speech  customs agents could still continue the investigation using some other methods  civil liberties attorneys said  although authorities retreated  the case has laid bare the broad power of the u s  government to demand information from technology companies  sometimes with no oversight from the courts and often with built in secrecy provisions that prevent the public from knowing what the government is seeking      the summons that twitter received came from agents who investigate corruption and misconduct within u s  customs and border protection  cbp   even after it was withdrawn  some lawmakers had questions about the agency s actions   cbp must ensure that any properly authorized investigation does not disregard the rights to free speech enshrined in the first amendment to the u s  constitution   two republican u s  senators  cory gardner of colorado and mike lee of utah  wrote in a letter on friday to homeland security secretary john kelly   the senators asked whether the agency would ever ask a private company to divulge private records about a customer based solely on  non criminal speech   senate democrat ron wyden of oregon called for an investigation of whether customs agents had violated a law by retaliating against an internal critic   the department of homeland security plans to respond directly to the senators  an official said on friday  there are two primary ways the u s  government can obtain information from internet companies without a judge s approval using a law known as the electronic communications privacy act  according to experts in privacy law  agencies with enforcement power  such as the internal revenue service  can issue administrative subpoenas demanding user records  prosecutors can also ask grand juries investigating a crime to issue a subpoena   an aggressive agency  for example  might demand information about a twitter account that used an agency logo on the grounds that it is deceptive  said georgetown university law professor paul ohm  similarly  a prosecutor could ask a grand jury to issue a subpoena based on the idea that a federal employee  suspected of criticizing the administration anonymously  was misusing government resources   it doesn t take a brilliant legal mind to think of hypotheticals   ohm said  further  such subpoenas are usually kept secret  making them more difficult to challenge  some other government tools  such as a national security letter  are intended to be used for narrow purposes related to counter terrorism investigations  but they do not require judicial approval either  instead relying on internal safeguards  challenging such demands is difficult and often requires deep pockets  attorneys familiar with such orders said   it s important to keep in mind how formidable the government s range of investigatory powers is   said andrew crocker  a staff attorney with the electronic frontier foundation  which advocates for digital rights  in the case of alt immigration  twitter said it was not bound to keep the summons a secret  and the company informed the account holder of the government demand  that person then found legal representation with the american civil liberties union  aclu    esha bhandari  the aclu staff attorney representing the dissident  said she thinks the speed with which the government withdrew its summons   less than a day after twitter sued   means the customs agents will cease investigating  but she cannot be sure   it s impossible to predict  of course  but i m hopeful that this really is a recognition that people have the ability to speak online including in ways that are critical of the government   bhandari said  the department of homeland security has not said what its plans are for the investigation   after trump s inauguration in january  anonymous twitter feeds that borrowed the names and logos of more than a dozen u s  government agencies appeared to challenge the president s views on climate change and other issues  they called themselves  alt  accounts  twitter has declined to say if it has received any other government demands to reveal such anti trump critics
