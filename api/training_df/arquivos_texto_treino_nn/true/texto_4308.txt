washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson s visit to moscow this week will be an early test of whether the trump administration can use any momentum generated by a missile attack on a syrian air base to craft and execute a strategy to end the syrian war  even before trump ordered last week s strike in retaliation for a nerve gas attack  tillerson s visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues  including russian interference in the  u s  election  an apparent violation of an important arms control treaty  and seeing what cooperation  if any  is possible in the fight against islamic state  now  tillerson  a former oil executive with no diplomatic experience  is charged with avoiding a major u s  confrontation with russia while exacting some concessions from moscow  those include getting rid of syrian president bashar al assad s remaining chemical weapons and pressing assad to negotiate syria s future  the kremlin said on monday tillerson was not scheduled to meet with russian president vladimir putin during his visit  a move that could point to tensions  it may also suggest that tillerson will instead follow strict diplomatic protocol and only meet his direct counterpart  russian foreign minister sergei lavrov  the state department said last week a meeting had not been confirmed with putin  who met with tillerson when the texan headed exxon mobil  russia  along with iran  is assad s primary backer  and its intervention in syria s war has been crucial to ensuring his grip on power  although no longer over the entire country  tillerson said he had not seen hard evidence that russia knew ahead of time about the chemical weapons attack  which killed at least  people  but he planned to urge moscow to rethink its support for assad in the april  talks   i m hopeful that we can have constructive talks with the russian government  with foreign minister lavrov and have russia be supportive of a process that will lead to a stable syria   tillerson told abc s  the week  on sunday  the u s  cruise missile strike on thursday  meant to dissuade assad from using chemical weapons again  gives tillerson more credibility with russian officials and will boost his efforts  observers and former officials said     the demonstration of the administration s willingness to use force has the potential to add some leverage to the diplomacy   said antony blinken  a deputy to former secretary of state john kerry  the u s  strike   ordered less than three days after the gas attack   could make it clear to russia that the united states will hold moscow accountable for assad  blinken said  tillerson ought to be  very matter of fact  in his meetings  blinken said  sending russia a message that   if you don t rein him in  we will take further action   tillerson said on thursday that russia had  failed in its responsibility  to remove syria s chemical weapons under a  agreement  which he argued showed russia was either complicit with the gas attacks or  simply incompetent   securing a russian commitment on eliminating assad s chemical weapons is likely to be first on his agenda  said evelyn farkas  a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the obama administration  the talks will be a major test of tillerson s diplomatic skills  as a former chief executive at exxon mobil  he has experience doing business in russia  but no background in the often public negotiations that international diplomacy requires  it also is unclear if trump  who has expressed skepticism about multilateral institutions such as the european union and united nations  will have patience for the protracted negotiations that a comprehensive deal on syria would require  russia condemned the missile strike as illegal and putin said it would harm u s  russia ties  moscow also said it would keep military channels of communication open with washington  but would not exchange any information through them  it was an unforeseen turn of events for trump  who praised putin repeatedly during last year s election campaign and said he would like to work more closely with russia to defeat islamic state  just over a week ago  top administration officials were signaling that removing assad is no longer a u s  priority  but one senior official said it was significant that russia suspended  and did not cancel  cooperation with the united states after the air strike  nor did lavrov cancel tillerson s visit to moscow  suggesting russia may be willing to tolerate the single strike  as of this weekend  the talks were still on   they re going to try to draw a line around this incident   said alexander vershbow  a former u s  ambassador to russia during the george w  bush administration   they are still not giving up on working with the trump administration   the trump administration also wants to keep the focus in syria on defeating islamic state rather than opening a conflict with russia or syria s government  another u s  official said one hope is that moscow will see tillerson s visit and a discussion about how to cooperate to stop assad s use of banned weapons as a tacit acknowledgement of russia s great power status  one of putin s main ambitions   the strikes aren t necessarily a bad thing for russia   said andrew tabler  a fellow with the washington institute for near east policy   russia s had a very hard time getting president assad to come to the negotiating table in any kind of meaningful way   now  tabler said  the russians can point to more u s  strikes as the price of further intransigence by assad   this version of the story corrects paragraph  to remove sentence on tillerson meeting with putin on wednesday
