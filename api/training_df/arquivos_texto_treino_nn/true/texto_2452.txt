washington  reuters    senate republicans released their  skinny bill  that would repeal some of obamacare late on thursday  just hours before they were expected to vote on the legislation  many republican lawmakers said they did not want the eight page bill to become law  and held off supporting it until they received assurances from house of representatives speaker paul ryan that members of both chambers could set up a special committee that would craft new legislation   senate republican leaders said the bill was simply a way to keep alive the seven year promise to repeal and replace obamacare  which was also a top campaign promise from president donald trump  the senate failed to pass two major bills earlier in the week that would repeal or replace the healthcare law after spending months on both pieces of legislation   the affordable care act  known informally as obamacare  brought insurance to  million previously uninsured americans and was the signature domestic achievement of former democratic president barack obama  republicans say the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in healthcare   here s what s in the  skinny  repeal bill  formally called the health care freedom act   the bill repeals an obamacare penalty on individuals who do not purchase health insurance  it also repeals a penalty for eight years on employers with more than  employees that do not provide health insurance   the legislation repeals a   percent excise tax on medical device sales  until dec      if it were to become law  this repeal would be welcome news to manufacturers such as medtronic inc and abbott laboratories inc   the senate bill effectively defunds planned parenthood for one year by prohibiting medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled  from reimbursing the women s healthcare provider  the majority of planned parenthood patients are on medicaid   unlike previous attempts to craft legislation to repeal or replace obamacare  the skinny bill does not end the law s medicaid expansion or make changes to the federal health program
