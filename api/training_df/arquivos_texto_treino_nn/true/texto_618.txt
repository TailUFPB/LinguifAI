washington  reuters    a senate republican tax plan that would repeal the obamacare mandate and give permanent tax cuts only to u s  corporations drew fire from two republican lawmakers on wednesday in what could be a sign of trouble for the sweeping measure   republican senator ron johnson of wisconsin said he would not support the current senator proposal  or a separate tax bill being debated in the house of representatives  because he believes they unfairly benefit corporations over other kinds of enterprises  including small businesses  senator susan collins  one of three republicans who opposed a republican obamacare repeal effort earlier this year  warned that some middle income taxpayers could see tax cuts wiped out by higher health insurance premiums if the repeal of the affordable care act s mandate goes through    their views could signal problems for senate republicans  who want to pass tax legislation by december but can afford to lose no more than two votes from their ranks because they have only a   majority in the senate  democrats have called the republican tax plans a giveaway to the rich and corporations   neither the house nor senate bill provide fair treatment  so i do not support either in their current version   johnson said in a statement  adding he would still work with his republican colleagues to produce better legislation  senate republicans produced a new plan late on tuesday that would guarantee permanent tax cuts for corporations but only temporarily lower tax bills for individuals and small businesses  while tying the overall package to an effective repeal of a key part of obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law  exposing the tax cut initiative to the same political risks that wrecked a mid  anti obamacare push by republicans  senate tax committee chief orrin hatch unveiled an amendment that he defended as helpful to the middle class  collins  a maine republican  told reporters that adding the mandate repeal was a mistake   this is going to be difficult and i just don t know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the aca   she said  several moderate republicans including collins and john mccain have not said if they support the tax plan  the new republican plan  hatch said at a committee meeting  would expand the child tax credit and slightly reduce some middle class tax rates  taken together  those changes  will let us channel even more tax relief to the middle class   he said  but those changes would be temporary  while a deep cut in the corporate tax rate would be permanent under hatch s plan  which was widely expected to become the main vehicle for republicans efforts to revamp the tax code before year end  the effort is seen by republicans as critical to their prospects of retaining power in washington in the november  congressional elections  so far  republicans and president donald trump have no major legislative victories from  to show voters despite controlling the white house and congress   they are hoping the tax cut will fix that problem and have made progress in recent days while trump toured asian capitals  he returned late on tuesday and was scheduled to meet with lawmakers on thursday  the house began debating its tax bill on wednesday  with a full vote expected on thursday  the senate and house tax plans must eventually be reconciled and merged into a final plan that can pass both chambers before it goes to trump to sign into law   by including an effective repeal of obamacare s individual mandate  senate republicans likely ended any possibility of gaining support from democrats   this is not just another garden variety attack on the affordable care act  or aca  this is repeal of that law   said senator ron wyden  the finance committee s top democrat  he blasted republicans for setting a  double standard  by guaranteeing permanent tax cuts only for corporations  the individual mandate clause of obamacare requires healthy younger people to buy insurance or pay a federal penalty  the aim is to hold down coverage costs for those sick or older  by repealing that penalty  republicans would raise more than   billion over a decade to pay for tax cuts  according to the joint committee on taxation  a nonpartisan unit of congress  the nonpartisan congressional budget office separately estimated last week that repealing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured americans by  million by      trump backed the inclusion of the mandate repeal in the tax bill  as do republican conservatives in the senate and house  u s  house speaker paul ryan told cnbc on wednesday that while the house tax plan did not repeal the mandate  republicans in that chamber would likely approve a final measure hammered out with the senate that included it  hatch s senate plan would also expand access to deductions for  pass through  businesses and increase the child tax credit to    from the earlier proposed     but those benefits would expire at the end of   the changes would still allow the measure to comply with a deficit requirement that must be met if senate republicans are to pass the legislation with a simple majority  the senate tax plan is required to add no more than    trillion over  years to the federal deficit and national debt  otherwise  senate republicans would need  votes
