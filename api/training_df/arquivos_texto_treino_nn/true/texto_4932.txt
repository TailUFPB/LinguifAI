honolulu new york  reuters    just hours before president donald trump s revised travel ban was set to go into effect  a u s  federal judge in hawaii on wednesday issued an emergency halt to the order s implementation   the action was the latest legal blow to the administration s efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly muslim countries  which the president has said is needed for national security  trump lashed out at the judge s ruling  saying it  makes us look weak    trump signed the new ban on march  in a bid to overcome legal problems with a january executive order that caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before a washington judge stopped its enforcement in february  u s  district judge derrick watson put an emergency stop to the new order in response to a lawsuit filed by the state of hawaii  which argued that the order discriminated against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution   judge watson concluded in his ruling that while the order did not mention islam by name   a reasonable  objective observer     would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion   watson was appointed to the bench by former democratic president barack obama      speaking at a rally in nashville  trump called his revised executive order a  watered down version  of his first   i think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way  which is what i wanted to do in the first place   trump said  trump called the judge s block  unprecedented judicial overreach  and said he will take the case  as far as it needs to go   including to the u s  supreme court   the department of justice called the ruling  flawed both in reasoning and in scope   adding that the president has broad authority in national security matters   the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts   it said a statement      the nation s highest court is currently split   between liberals and conservatives with trump s pick   appeals court judge neil gorsuch   still awaiting confirmation   paul ryan  the republican speaker of the u s  house of representatives  said the ban was needed to improve vetting of people entering the united states in order to prevent attacks and said he had no doubt that it would be upheld by higher courts   watson s order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard  he set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended  trump s first travel order was more sweeping than the second revised order  like the current one  it barred citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen from entering the country for  days  but it also included iraq  which was subsequently taken off the list   refugees were blocked from entering the country for  days in both orders  but an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria was dropped in the new one  the revised ban also excluded legal permanent residents and existing visa holders  it provided a series of waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the united states  hawaii and other opponents of the ban claimed that the motivation behind it was trump s campaign promise of  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   the government  in its court filings cautioned the court against looking for secret motives in the executive order and against performing  judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter s heart of heart     watson said he did not need to do that  because evidence of motive could be found in the president s public statements  he said he did not give credence to the government s argument that the order was not anti muslim because it targeted only a small percentage of muslim majority countries    the notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed   the judge wrote   the case was one of several moving through u s  courts on wednesday that were brought by states  attorneys general and immigrant advocacy groups  in maryland  refugee resettlement agencies represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center argued in court for a restraining order   in washington state  a group of plaintiffs applying for immigrant visas asked u s  district judge james robart in seattle   who suspended the first ban   to stop the new order  robart was appointed to the bench by republican former president george w  bush  both judge robart and u s  district judge theodore chuang in maryland said they would issue written rulings in their cases  but did not specify a time line  washington state  joined by california  maryland  massachusetts  new york and oregon  said in court filings they supported the plaintiffs in seattle  if more judges side with watson  the government s case may be harder to make at higher courts  the  circuit u s  court of appeals upheld robart s ruling against the first ban and watson referenced that decision in his order  various groups and companies said they would be harmed by the travel restrictions  a group of  technology companies  including airbnb inc  lyft inc and dropbox inc  filed a  friend of the court  brief in the case saying the order hurt their ability to recruit the best talent from around the world   a longer list of companies  including apple inc   facebook inc  and alphabet inc s  google   filed a brief opposing the first ban in a different court challenge brought by washington state  which is ongoing  it was not immediately clear why fewer tech companies signed on to the brief this time around
