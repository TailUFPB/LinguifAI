 sacramento  calif   reuters    laura russo is just the kind of voter the republicans need  but the party s proposed tax overhaul  which includes limits on the deductions for mortgage interest  state taxes and property taxes  is pushing her away    i would be dramatically affected   she said  an airline pilot and single mother of two  she says that like many in her affluent loudoun county  virginia  neighborhood she stretched to buy her home  she fears it will become harder to sell that house or pay her other tax bills if president donald trump signs the plan into law   russo    said she had voted for the republican in every presidential race since  until last year when she picked hillary clinton  she still voted for barbara comstock  the republican who represents her district in congress    i will not do that again   she said   the tax bill is the straw that broke the camel s back    russo is one of thousands of homeowners in republican leaning areas who could be hit by the elimination or reduction of tax breaks for homeowners  a reuters analysis of federal mortgage and tax data shows  potentially opening those districts to a democratic challenge in the november  mid term elections   the plans are expected to affect mainly the democratic leaning  blue states  such as california  new jersey and new york where homes are expensive  mortgages are huge and state and local taxes tend to be high   but while these blue states will be hardest hit  county level data also shows there is a significant number of republican enclaves in districts expected to be hotly contested in next year s polls that will feel the pain  republican leaning pockets in blue or swing states  such as orange county  california  or loudoun county  virginia  tend to have high property values   and thus the higher mortgages  many of these areas also tend to have higher state and local income taxes    larry sabato  director of the non partisan center for politics at the university of virginia  estimates that there are  counties where  races will be toss ups between republican incumbents and democratic challengers   reuters data shows that almost half of those counties have an above average share of new mortgages worth more than     which is a proposed cap for tax deductions  the results are similar for districts selected as   ones by the cook political report  a non partisan newsletter that analyzes u s  elections   among those on cook s list is a district in harris county in the deep red state of texas  even though the state has no income tax  thousands of residents of the district  which includes houston  deduct taxes owed in other states because of work or business done there  and property taxes   the nation s sixth highest   democrats need  more seats to win lower house majority from the republicans  who now control the white house and both houses of congress  nancy pelosi  the house minority leader  said in a fundraising note democrats were rushing out  rapid response ads  targeting swing voters to capitalize on the concerns  while kevin brady  republican chairman of the house ways and means committee  said on cnbc on tuesday his party s leadership was working on ways to mollify republicans in blue states   that concern is felt on the ground too  will estrada  chairman of the republican party in loudoun county  said he firmly believed the tax plan would deliver savings to most people  but he said that if democrats are right and many middle class voters face higher bills   the gop is going to be toast in     the bill passed by the u s  house of representatives on nov   let homeowners who take out new mortgages deduct only the interest paid on the first    of a mortgage  it also ends deductions for state and local income taxes  and caps deductions for property taxes at      the senate s plan  passed on saturday  would keep the mortgage interest deduction as is  on any mortgage up to   million  but agrees with the house on state  local and property taxes  the two houses of congress are now reconciling the two versions   the reuters data analysis shows that  percent of the total mortgages issued in orange county in  were above    and  percent in loudon county  both include districts represented by republicans and have some of the highest rates of expensive mortgages in the country   comstock  who retained her virginia seat by  percentage points  voted for the house bill  but later asked for changes on deductions  saying through a spokesman that she sought  the best possible tax package for all of her constituents   in orange county  republican representative darrel issa voted against the house version  in part  because of how it will affect homeowners  neither california republican dana rohrabacher  who also voted against the bill  nor issa would comment on a possible backlash from voters   home buyers in expensive areas count on the mortgage interest deduction to make their payments manageable  said lawrence yun  chief economist for the national association of realtors  which opposes any changes to the deductions   yun says his analysis suggests curbing the mortgage interest deduction would lead to as much as an  percent drop in housing values nationwide  and cutting property tax deductions could lead to a further drop of up to  percent because it would make buying and selling homes more costly    not just in high cost states like illinois and california  but relatively speaking in places like wisconsin  michigan  pennsylvania  which were critical in swaying the presidential election   he said   other economists think the impact may be smaller  as refinancing of mortgages becomes less popular and consumers begin paying debt down faster  the market would rebalance  said richard green  director of the lusk center for real estate at the university of southern california  who forecasts a  percent decline in home values   california s placer county northeast of sacramento  where the median home sells for more than     remains a republican enclave  but local republicans have noticed that each year fewer residents vote republican and their web page bears the slogan   keep placer red    to do that  the party will have to keep the loyalty of republicans like rudy coscia  a  year old plastic surgeon who just took out a    mortgage to buy a four bedroom house in granite bay for    million   coscia is counting on mortgage interest and property tax deductions as he is also making payments on    worth of medical school loans and    he borrowed to get his practice started    they re hurting their base   he said   you d think they d be trying not to hurt the people who voted for them
