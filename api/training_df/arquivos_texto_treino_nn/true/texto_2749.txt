 reuters    eugene kaspersky  the ceo of the russian cybersecurity software firm that bears his name  had a big american dream   he wanted his company to go beyond selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses and become a major vendor to the u s  government   one of the world s biggest buyers of cybersecurity tools   kaspersky set up a u s  subsidiary  kgss  in arlington  virginia that would be focused on winning that business  he sponsored flashy conferences with high profile speakers  including michael flynn  who was briefly president donald trump s national security adviser   sought to join u s  trade groups and even underwrote programming on national public radio   all of this was done to burnish kaspersky s image and help it become an accepted vendor for the u s  government despite its russian roots  according to people familiar with the strategy   but eugene kaspersky was never able to overcome lingering suspicions among u s  intelligence officials that he and his company were  or could become  pawns of russia s spy agencies  kaspersky  has never helped  nor will help  any government in the world with its cyberespionage efforts   the company said   kaspersky s american ambitions were further eroded by the sharp deterioration in u s  russia relations following russia s invasion of crimea in   and later when u s  intelligence agencies concluded that russia had hacked the  u s  presidential election   testifying before the u s  congress in may  u s  intelligence chiefs for the first time publicly expressed doubt that kaspersky products could be trusted   fbi agents last month interviewed kaspersky employees  asking whether they reported to russia based executives and how much data from american customers could be seen by russian employees  according to three current and former employees  the fbi declined to comment on thursday   on tuesday  the u s  general services administration  the government agency that manages the federal bureaucracy  removed kaspersky from a list of approved vendors  saying gsa s mission was to ensure the security of u s  government systems   there is also a bill before congress that would explicitly bar the defense department from using any kaspersky products   kaspersky says his company is being targeted for political reasons    these reckless actions negatively impact global cybersecurity by limiting competition  slowing down technology innovations and ruining the industry and law enforcement agency cooperation required to catch the bad guys   he said in a statement to reuters    the arlington offices of kgss were empty when a reuters reporter visited them on thursday  a kaspersky spokeswoman said most of the staff  which number less than   often work from home   the u s  clampdown comes even though officials have offered no public evidence to suggest the company has done anything untoward or that the russian government is using its software to launch cyber attacks   two former employees and a person briefed on the fbi case told reuters that kaspersky software has at times inappropriately inspected and removed files from users  machines in its hunt for alleged cyber criminals  even when those files were not corrupted by viruses    kaspersky lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations   the kaspersky spokeswoman said in response in an email   it is extremely rare for a company to be singled out for federal buying restrictions in the absence of clear evidence of wrongdoing    this sets a really dangerous precedent  where other nations could make similar  unsubstantiated claims against u s  vendors  said robert m  lee  a former cyberwarfare operative for u s  intelligence and now ceo of cybersecurity startup dragos   the russian government has denounced the kaspersky crackdown and said it does not rule out retaliatory measures  officials at u s  tech companies with significant operations in russia say they fear they could become targets   federal contracting databases reviewed by reuters show only a few hundred thousand dollars in purchases from kaspersky  and an employee confirmed the company s federal government revenue was  miniscule    but kaspersky also sells to federal contractors and third party software companies that incorporate its technology in their products  so its technology may be more widely used in government than it appears from the contracting databases  u s  officials say   founded in   kaspersky grew rapidly through the  to become one of the world s leading anti virus software companies   kaspersky s global reach  tmsnrt rs    but the company was dogged from the start by suspicions about its ties to russia s federal security service  fsb   the main successor to the kgb  eugene kaspersky attended a kgb school and the company has acknowledged doing work for the fsb   as the company grew  kaspersky was determined to overcome those fears    we have to be more american than americans   kaspersky told reuters in   when a u s  goodwill offensive began   a cornerstone of the effort was a series of kgss hosted conferences in washington where prominent u s  officials including flynn  a former defense intelligence agency director  former cia and nsa director michael hayden and house of representatives homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul discussed cybersecurity issues   the company privately courted u s  intelligence and law enforcement officials by sending experts to brief them on nation state hacking campaigns uncovered by the firm  according to people present at those meetings    they came to us and said   we want to change our image  we know people don t trust us    said one former senior obama administration official who took part in some of those meetings   but the suspicions never subsided  when the company sought to join one washington based technology trade organization  it was  politely told it couldn t happen   according to an industry source with direct knowledge of the matter   the source said industry group officials had an inside joke   kaspersky  membership  is like having the kremlin join    not coincidentally  kaspersky s government sales effort never gained traction  in an email to reuters  the company noted  complexities associated with doing business with north america s government sector    privately held kaspersky said its u s  revenue  most of which comes from selling anti virus software to consumers and small businesses  slipped from   million in  to about   million in    some u s  national security experts say kaspersky is being treated unfairly  lee said he has long been bothered by the  public shaming  of kaspersky by people who make allegations without presenting evidence   the u s  government has the right to choose not to use kaspersky products for any reason  he said  but  the way they are doing it  is wrong    i don t believe in geographic restrictions that say   because kaspersky is a russian based company  therefore it is bad    said former white house cybersecurity policy coordinator michael daniel   you would want your decision to be based on actual corporate bad behavior
