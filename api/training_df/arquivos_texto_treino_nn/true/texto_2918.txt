washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump honored military veterans in washington on saturday at a kennedy center event that resembled both a political rally and an evangelical christian religious service ahead of the july  independence day holiday  using the podium again to lash out at the news media  trump worked to energize evangelicals in his political base  noting that the u s  currency was inscribed with the words   in god we trust    since the signing of the declaration of independence  years ago  america always affirmed that liberty comes from our creator  our rights are given to us by god  and no earthly force can ever take those rights away   he said  attendees at the event for veterans waved miniature american flags from their seats in the theater and raised their hands as a sign of praise while a large choir sang ahead of trump s remarks  the president praised veterans from each of the u s  military branches and highlighted his administration s work to reform veterans  services  trump  who is spending a long weekend at his property in bedminster  new jersey  flew back to washington for the rally but did not spend the night at the white house  preferring to return to bedminster  later  in a rare late night post on twitter  which he uses prolifically and sometimes controversially  trump wrote   we will always take care of our great veterans  you have shed your blood  poured your love  and bared your soul  in defense of our country   trump has held campaign like rallies regularly during his first few months in the white house and kicked off his own re election campaign far earlier than other incumbents in recent history  part of his strategy to connect with his supporters has included criticizing the media  and he included harsh words for the press again in his remarks   the fake media is trying to silence us  but we will not let them   he said   the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house  but i m president  and they re not
