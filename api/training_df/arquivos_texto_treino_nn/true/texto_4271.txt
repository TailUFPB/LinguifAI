washington  reuters    u s  house speaker paul ryan s tax reform blueprint appears to be losing its status as the likely framework for the first major tax overhaul since   with rival approaches emerging from the white house  senate and other quarters in congress    congressional aides  lobbyists and analysts say the changing focus could delay passage of a tax bill until late  or   potentially foiling republican efforts to score a legislative victory for president donald trump by august  following last month s failed bill to repeal and replace obamacare health insurance       like the healthcare bill  the house republican tax blueprint stems from ryan s  a better way  legislative agenda launched during the  election campaign    the house can go and do what they want to do  we are going to formulate our own policies   white house budget director mick mulvaney told cnbc in an interview posted on the channel s website on wednesday   you will have a white house  donald trump tax plan that we are going to take down to the hill and try and sell  in the meantime  senate republicans are expected to review a  tax package from former house ways and means committee chairman dave camp  as a starting point for their own tax legislation   members of the house freedom caucus  a bloc of conservative lawmakers that helped derail ryan s healthcare bill  have also suggested that expanding the deficit to stave off adding new taxes could be acceptable   the blueprint was the republican ideal  written as a campaign document  now they re dealing with the realities of a closely divided congress and a president who wants a win on this key  signature issue   said one business lobbyist  who spoke on condition of anonymity   but ryan is not giving up on the idea of forging agreement with the white house and senate leaders   our intention has always been and continues to be to coalesce around a unified gop plan and those conversations continue   said his spokeswoman  ashlee strong  business lobbyists and tax experts warn that a loss of focus could prove fatal for the tax overhaul effort  if the house blueprint disappears from the political stage      right now the blueprint is the only plan we have  there s a great amount of uncertainty about how this would play out without it  or whether this would play out at all   said john gimigliano  who heads federal legislative and regulatory services for the accounting and consulting group kpmg llp  lawmakers on the house ways and means committee say the blueprint s viability could become clearer next month  when the committee is expected to hold a series of public hearings and hopes to see a floor vote before the august congressional recess   treasury secretary steven mnuchin met this month with a bipartisan group of house lawmakers about possibly including infrastructure spending in an administration tax package  a feature that is not part of the blueprint   the house blueprint  which ryan rolled out last june  would bring sweeping change to the u s  tax code by slashing business tax rates by  percentage points  allowing companies to immediately write off capital investments and ending taxation of foreign profits of u s  based multinational corporations  but its future has become clouded by mounting opposition to two provisions that would raise a combined    trillion to pay for those tax changes  a border adjustment tax  or bat  that includes a new  percent import tax and the elimination of business deductions for interest payments  advocates of ryan s plan say it would generate revenues that would help congress avoid paying for tax cuts by expanding the national deficit
