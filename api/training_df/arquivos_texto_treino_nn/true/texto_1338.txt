 new york  reuters    a texas based chain of strip clubs would go on a buying spree  a growing technology company would move fewer jobs overseas  and a regional bank would boost its spending on cybersecurity   these are some of the uses of the tax savings that small and medium sized u s  companies say they would pursue if the trump administration and the republican controlled congress slashed corporate taxes as promised   small companies pay the highest taxes and they would be the main beneficiaries of such a trump windfall  reuters contacted the  largest companies by market value in the benchmark russell  index of u s  small and mid cap stocks as well as another  in the russell  with no analyst coverage  none of the  companies that responded to reuters queries mentioned boosting their headcount   the administration has said the tax cuts would largely pay for themselves by spurring more investment and creating jobs   but companies say they look to spend on technology that will allow them to improve productivity or make acquisitions rather than hire more workers    we want to be a company of the future  and technology is one of the key ingredients   said keith cargill  chief executive at dallas based texas capital bankshares inc  tcbi o   a bank with a market value of    billion  the tax cut would be a  huge plus  for earnings  cargill said  but with little impact on the bank s workforce   the russell  companies tend to pay the highest effective tax rates now   an average of   percent  according to thomson reuters data   and would stand to gain the most if corporate taxes are cut to  percent from  percent as the trump administration has proposed    for large companies in the s p   the average effective tax rate is  percent  a reflection of a greater share of overseas business and more leeway in reducing their tax rates   while few companies would discuss any details in public before outlining them to their shareholders  executives  chief financial officers and treasures say they are already starting to formulate plans for a tax windfall even if they are not certain whether and in what form it will pass   neil hennessy  the chief executive of novato  california based hennessy advisors inc  hnna o   a mutual fund company  told reuters he was in  acquisition mode  and would keep looking for targets in the event of a tax cut passing   one of the first firms to publicly discuss a potential tax windfall is rci hospitality holdings inc  rick o   a chain of  strip clubs headquartered in houston  texas  its chief executive eric scott langan told analysts on aug   that a tax cut would allow him to buy more clubs and boost the share price  which he complained failed to reflect the firm s organic growth    i think that s going to change and i think that s when you re going to see the multiple expansion come into play   he said during an earnings call   the tax cut would also affect companies which do not pay taxes now either because they are not yet profitable or are using past losses to offset their tax bills   paul auvil  the chief financial officer at cybersecurity company proofpoint inc  pfpt o   said that the   billion market cap company expects to start paying taxes in  when it no longer be able to offset past losses   by then the corporate tax rate would need to sink at least below  percent  auvil told reuters  otherwise proofpoint would move its intellectual property to an offshore company in europe  where corporate taxes are lower  which would mean hiring up to  back office staff there  said    these are jobs that have every reason to be in the u s  but it will require tax reform    the prospects of a tax cut have helped push the ishares russell  etf  iwm p  up about  percent over the last six weeks  compared with a   percent gain in the fund which tracks s p   spx   if the tax package does pass  large companies will be more likely to buy back their own stock  while smaller firms will probably reinvest in their businesses  said tom forte  an analyst at new york based d a  davidson    these companies are going to take every incremental cost savings from a tax cut and invest it to keep up with the amazons  amzn o  and ubers   forte said   for instance  forte expects ebay inc  ebay o  to spend most of the possible windfall on increasing its stock buyback program  a smaller company like yelp inc  yelp n  would probably invest in artificial intelligence technology to better harness its website s advertising potential  he said   grubhub inc  grub n   meanwhile  would spend more on its service that delivers from restaurants that do not have their own delivery staff  forte said  while groupon inc  grpn o  would invest more in marketing and advertising   some smaller companies are also considering share buybacks rather any significant changes to their capital allocation   thomas castellano  treasurer at drug delivery company catalent inc  ctlt n   told reuters that the    billion company would keep spending on maintaining its  locations around the globe and look for possible acquisitions  any extra money would go to share buybacks and catalent was unlikely to increase its hiring rate if a tax cut passes  castellano said    we wouldn t be adding to our headcount because that would affect our margins at a time when we would otherwise see them improving
