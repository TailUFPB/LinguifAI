 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump says he wants to build dozens of new warships in one of the biggest peace time expansions of the u s  navy  but interviews with ship builders  unions and a review of public and internal documents show major obstacles to that plan   the initiative could cost nearly   billion in government funding  take  years to complete and require hiring tens of thousands of skilled shipyard workers   many of whom don t exist yet because they still need to be hired and trained  according to the interviews and the documents reviewed   trump has vowed a huge build up of the u s  military to project american power in the face of an emboldened china and russia  that includes expanding the navy to  warships from  today  he has provided no specifics  including how soon he wants the larger fleet   for graphics on projected strength of u s  navy  shipyard employment see  tmsnrt rs    the navy has given defense secretary jim mattis a report that explores how the country s industrial base could support higher ship production  admiral bill moran  the vice chief of naval operations with oversight of the navy s shipbuilding outlook  told reuters   he declined to give further details  but those interviewed for this story say there are clearly two big issues   there are not enough skilled workers in the market  from electricians to welders  and after years of historically low production  shipyards and their suppliers  including nuclear fuel producers  will struggle to ramp up for years   to be sure  the first  and biggest  hurdle for trump to overcome is to persuade a cost conscious congress to fund the military buildup   the white house declined to comment  a navy spokeswoman said increases being considered beyond the current shipbuilding plan would require  sufficient time  to allow companies to ramp up capacity   the two largest u s  shipbuilders  general dynamics corp  gd n  and huntington ingalls industries inc  hii n   told reuters they are planning to hire a total of   workers in  just to meet current orders  such as the columbia class ballistic missile submarine   general dynamics hopes to hire   workers at electric boat this year  currently projected order levels would already require the shipyard to grow from less than   workers  to nearly   by the early   company documents reviewed by reuters show   huntington ingalls  the largest u s  military shipbuilder  plans to hire   at its newport news shipyard in norfolk  virginia  and another   at the ingalls shipyard in mississippi this year to fulfill current orders  spokeswoman beci brenton said   companies say they are eager to work with trump to build his bigger navy  but expanding hiring  for now  is difficult to do until they receive new orders  officials say    it s hard to look beyond  current orders  brenton said   smaller shipbuilders and suppliers are also cautious    you can t hire people to do nothing   said jill mackie  spokeswoman for portland  oregon based vigor industrial llc  which makes combat craft for the navy s special warfare units   until funding is there     you can t bring on more workers    because companies won t hire excess workers in advance  they will have a huge challenge in expanding their workforces rapidly if a shipbuilding boom materializes  said bryan clark  who led strategic planning for the navy as special assistant to the chief of naval operations until    union and shipyard officials say finding skilled labor just for the work they already have is challenging  demand for pipeline welders is so strong that some can make as much as    per year  including overtime and benefits  said danny hendrix  the business manager at pipeliners local   a union representing   metal workers in  states   much of the work at the submarine yards also requires a security clearance that many can t get  said jimmy hart  president of the metal trades department at the afl cio union  which represents   boilermakers  machinists  and pipefitters  among others   to help grow a larger labor force from the ground up  general dynamics  electric boat has partnered with seven high schools and trade schools in connecticut and rhode island to develop a curriculum to train a next generation of welders and engineers    it has historically taken five years to get someone proficient in shipbuilding   said maura dunn  vice president of human resources at electric boat   it can take as many as seven years to train a welder skilled enough to make the most complex type of welds  radiographic structural welds needed on a nuclear powered submarine  said will lennon  vice president of the shipyard s columbia class submarine program   the navy envisioned by trump could create more than   jobs  the shipbuilders council of america  a trade group representing u s  shipbuilders  repairers and suppliers  told reuters   the u s  shipbuilding and repairing industry employed nearly   in   labor department statistics show  the industry had as many as   workers at the height of the cold war in the early  as the united states built up a fleet of nearly  warships by the end of that decade   apart from the labor shortage  there are also serious capacity and supply chain issues that would be severely strained by any plan to expand the navy  especially its submarine fleet   expanding the navy to  ships is not as simple as just adding  ships  many ships in the current  vessel fleet need to be replaced  which means the navy would have to buy  ships between now and  to reach trump s goal  the congressional budget office said in a report in february   the shipyards that make nuclear submarines   general dynamics  electric boat in groton  connecticut  and huntington s newport news   produced as many as seven submarines per year between them in the early   but for more than a decade now  the yards have not built more than two per year   the nuclear powered virginia class and columbia class submarines are among the largest and most complex vessels to build  the first columbia submarine  which is set to begin construction in   will take seven years to build  and two to three additional years to test   retooling the long dormant shipyard space will take several years and significant capital investments  but a bigger problem is expanding the supply chain  said clark  the former strategist for the navy and now a senior fellow at the center for strategic and budgetary assessments   makers of submarine components such as reactor cores  big castings  and forgers of propellers and shafts would need five years to double production  said a congressional official with knowledge of the navy s long term planning    we have been sizing the industrial base for two submarines a year  you can t then just throw one or two more on top of that and say   oh here  dial the switch and produce four reactor cores a year instead of two   you just can t   the official said   in his first budget proposal to congress on thursday  trump proposed boosting defense spending by   billion for the fiscal  year   a  percent increase from last year  he is also seeking   billion for the defense department in a supplemental budget for fiscal   of which at least   million is earmarked for military shipbuilding   a  ship navy would cost   billion over the  year period  or   billion per year    percent more than the average funding the navy has received for shipbuilding in the past three decades  the congressional budget office said   senator john mccain  chairman of the senate armed services committee  who will have a major say in approving the defense budget  said in a statement to reuters that he supported trump s vision to increase the size of the navy to deter adversaries    however  this is not a blank check   he said    click here for a graphic on  fleet expansion  here
