washington  reuters    former goldman sachs group inc  gs n  executive and white house adviser gary cohn shocked more than a few of his former wall street colleagues this week when he showed support for reinstating a depression era law that would break up the biggest u s  banks  here are some details about the law  called the glass steagall act  and why it has returned to the spotlight  what is glass steagall  originally passed as part of the u s  banking act of   glass steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity  the law was whittled away over time as banks gained permission to engage in more trading activity  and was repealed altogether in  with the gramm leach bliley act  who supports it   since the  financial crisis  glass steagall has become a calling card for politicians eager to crack down on wall street  democratic senator elizabeth warren frequently invokes it  and senator bernie sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign  president donald trump also seized on the policy during his campaign  what does the white house say   the trump administration has not backed away from his campaign stance  but there are questions about how aggressively the president will push for a new law  the issue only tends to come up when officials are asked about it  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said he supported a modern version of glass steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing  white house press secretary sean spicer said the white house supports the proposal when asked by reporters  cohn responded favorably when asked by warren at a private meeting with senators  what would a new glass steagall look like   there are number of ideas to create what some refer to as a   century glass steagall   warren has proposed splitting commercial and investment banking  and also barring depository institutions from using modern financial instruments like derivatives  thomas hoenig  the vice chair of the federal deposit insurance corporation  has proposed a similar split  and would subject banks to a higher   percent capital requirement  neel kashkari  president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis  would force big banks to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institutions  could it happen   although many wall street critics have seized on glass steagall  efforts to change the law have garnered very little support  warren s proposal received just a handful of legislative co sponsors  and because congress and the white house are still consumed with complex fights over health care and tax reform  there seems to be little appetite for a broad  controversial overhaul of the financial system  are there risks for banks   big u s  lenders including jpmorgan chase   co  jpm n   bank of america corp  bac n  and citigroup  c n  would be most impacted  because their commercial lending and investment banking operations are closely intertwined  say analysts  goldman sachs group inc  gs n  and morgan stanley  ms n  might be less impacted  although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment banks and shed their deposit funding  but even if glass steagall does not become law  the industry may have to spend money  time and energy lobbying against the idea  when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rules
