washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump and top republicans in congress are about to show how aggressively they intend to cut the corporate tax rate  while trying to avoid the appearance of favoring the wealthy  the  big six  team of republican tax policy makers is expected to release a plan on wednesday targeting tax cuts for businesses  but offering few clues about how to replace reduced federal revenues  said lobbyists and congressional sources  under pressure from corporate america  the team is expected to call for a corporate income tax target rate possibly within a range of   percent  down from the current rate of  percent  but the big six  which includes top trump aides and congressional republican leaders  is expected to refrain from cutting the top individual tax rate of   percent  in a risky step that many republicans in the house of representatives could find hard to swallow   they re not going to cut the highest income tax rate  they re not   predicted stephen moore  a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation think tank  moore helped write trump s campaign tax plan  overhauling the tax code was a key pledge for trump in his  presidential campaign  but after eight months in office  he has made only limited progress  washington has achieved no major tax overhaul since   trump portrays lower corporate taxes as a boon to workers  saying they would lead to more jobs and higher salaries  a rate cut on corporate profits could also be used to benefit shareholders and to offer up more executive bonuses  however   the details leaking out of the big six meetings paint a clear picture of an unprecedented tax giveaway for the most fortunate and biggest corporations   senator ron wyden  top democrat on the senate finance committee  said this week  the big six   treasury secretary steven mnuchin  trump economic adviser gary cohn  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell  house of representatives speaker paul ryan and two tax committee chairmen   have been working on their plan for months   but they are still undecided on key issues  including whether to let businesses write off new investments immediately  how to lower tax rates for small businesses  and whether to cut middle class taxes simply by doubling the standard deduction for individuals and families  according to lobbyists  resolving such issues will help determine how aggressively republicans can cut corporate taxes  lobbyists said they do not expect the big six to offer many details about the tax loopholes and deductions that could be eliminated to help pay for tax cuts   our expectation is that it will be a bold transformative tax reform  that would mean a dramatic corporate rate cut  an aggressive stripping out of set asides and special interest carve outs and simplification   said tim phillips  president of americans for prosperity  a political group backed by billionaire conservatives charles and david koch  white house spokeswoman natalie strom declined to comment on the blueprint   we have always said that tax reform will include lowering rates  closing loopholes and broadening the base by ending special interest tax breaks  those priorities will be reflected in the plan   she said   the big six will likely address the estimated    trillion in u s  corporate profits held overseas by requiring companies to bring the money home at rates of   percent for reinvested profits and   percent for on cash and equivalents  lobbyists said   to offset lost revenue  the trump administration plans to forecast a flood of new tax revenue in coming years  based on aggressive assumptions of tax fueled economic expansion  but senate republicans have shown signs of moving away from such  dynamic  scoring of any tax legislation impact   two senators  including a prominent fiscal hawk  agreed this week to a  static  score that could allow tax reform to lose up to    trillion over the next decade  senate republicans also are likely to avoid budget baseline changes to generate savings for tax reform on paper  that could well mean the big six plan would balloon the federal budget deficit   without those  the price goes up  there s no other way to look at it   said john gimigliano  a former house ways and means committee tax counsel who leads federal legislative and regulatory services at kpmg llp
