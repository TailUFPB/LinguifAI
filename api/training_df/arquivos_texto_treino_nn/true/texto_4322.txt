 sandy springs  ga   reuters    after the crushing electoral losses that swept donald trump into the white house and sealed republican control of the u s  congress  the democrats  road to recovery winds through the leafy  well heeled suburbs of north atlanta   here  democrats are threatening a stunning special election upset that could signal how well the party can turn trump s low approval ratings into political gains  and they appear to have an ally in the april  vote  trump himself   in the most watched congressional race so far in the trump era  a wave of grassroots anti trump fervor has positioned democrat jon ossoff  a  year old political newcomer  to possibly capture a house of representatives seat held by republicans for decades  one of  seats democrats need nationwide to reclaim the house   more from reuters  russian naval activity in europe exceeds cold war levels  u s  admiraliran chides gulf arabsrussian computer programmer arrested in spain  embassy  the grassroots intensity here is electric  and it s because folks are concerned that what is happening in washington doesn t represent our values   ossoff said in an interview   this is a chance for this community to stand up and make a statement about what we believe    with democrats desperate for signs of hope after hillary clinton s loss to trump  ossoff s underdog  make trump furious  campaign has endeared him to national anti trump activists and pushed him well ahead of  rivals in polls  the documentary filmmaker and former congressional aide raised a jaw dropping    million in the first quarter  his campaign said    i ve never seen the democrats around here so engaged  and it s donald trump who got us so engaged   said carolyn hadaway    a veteran party activist and retired software engineer from marietta  a city of about   people in georgia s central cobb county   georgia would seem an unlikely venue for a democratic revival  trump won it by about  percentage points in november  and its voters backed republican nominees in eight of the last nine presidential contests  including the last six in a row   but demographic changes are brewing  growing minority communities and transplants from other regions have made atlanta s suburbs increasingly competitive for democrats  georgia s sixth congressional district  the location for april s special election  exemplifies changes common in booming southern cities like atlanta  charlotte and nashville   the district is white collar  educated and doing well economically  with median household incomes of    versus    statewide  and nearly  percent of adults holding a college or professional degree  more than twice the statewide average  it is also increasingly diverse  and in recent years became a magnet for well educated immigrants from india and other parts of asia   the district was about  percent white at the turn of the century  but since then  the black share of the population has grown from  percent to  percent  the hispanic share has doubled to   percent and asian representation doubled to more than  percent   about a fifth of the district is now foreign born   twice the statewide average  according to census data   though newer immigrants may not be eligible to vote  census data indicate more than  percent are naturalized citizens  potentially bringing a different set of views on issues like immigration to the table than the voters in this district who sent trump adviser and former speaker of the house newt gingrich to congress for  straight terms   april s special election fills the seat vacated by tom price  the new secretary of health and human services  it gives both parties a chance to test their messages for election battles next year in suburban districts where democrats need to make inroads and where trump s populist economic message did not sell well in november   while price sailed to re election with  percent of the vote  trump barely beat clinton in georgia s sixth district by one percentage point  in   republican mitt romney beat democratic president barack obama in the district by  points   republican candidates nationwide will closely watch the result as they calculate whether to embrace the president   the  republicans in the race have split between those who portray themselves as trump supporters and establishment candidates who keep a respectful and sometimes wary distance    i m ready to support him   former state senator dan moody  who was endorsed by u s  senator david perdue  said of trump in an interview  but  i m not going to jump over a cliff with him    grassroots democratic groups flood the district s tidy suburban neighborhoods on the weekends  busing in volunteers from as far away as maryland to go door to door on ossoff s behalf   the ossoff momentum worries republicans  say party officials  and outside help has arrived  a super pac aligned with house republican leaders put more than   million into ads painting ossoff as too young and inexperienced   ossoff played down the strategic value of a possible upset    the national implications here will be about how this affects the political calculus for folks in the republican conference in the house  not about how democrats are supposed to run in the midterms   he said   in a low turnout special election  getting supporters to the polls is vital  and democrats have voted early in greater numbers than republicans so far    we aren t panicking  but there is concern   said maggie holliman  a member of the republican state executive committee   ossoff s best chance is to win the april  vote  a  jungle primary  that features all  candidates from both parties on the same ballot  if no one reaches  percent  the top two vote getters square off on june    republicans are confident they can win a one on one race with ossoff  as the party unites with organizational and financial help pouring into the republican majority district    there is a chance ossoff can win without a runoff  but that s his only chance  he s benefiting from unified democratic support and republicans being highly divided   said georgia based republican strategist joel mcelhannon   polls show ossoff hovering in the low   not enough to avoid a runoff  the leading republican  former secretary of state karen handel  is well behind   handel has been cautious in talking about trump  she said in an interview she expected to work with him on issues such as tax reform and border security  but  first and foremost  she would be a conservative advocate for her district   by contrast republicans bob gray  a local business executive  and bruce levell  head of trump s national diversity coalition  pledge undivided loyalty to the white house  gray said he was the republican in the race who performed the behind the scenes political groundwork for trump in the district   levell pulled out his cellphone and showed a reporter text messages from trump aides kellyanne conway  sarah huckabee sanders and even trump son in law jared kushner to prove his insider status with the white house    if people are looking for someone to help trump  i m their guy   he said    this version of
