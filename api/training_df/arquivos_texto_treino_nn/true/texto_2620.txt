meeting last year between the president s eldest son and a russian lawyer  according to a source with knowledge of the request  special counsel robert mueller sent a document preservation request to the white house  saying the june  meeting that donald trump jr  had at trump tower in new york is relevant to his investigation  the source said on friday  the white house counsel s office relayed the request  a routine part of the early phase of any investigation  to other members of the white house staff on wednesday  the source said  news earlier this month of the meeting between trump jr  and a russian lawyer whom he was told had damaging information about his father s presidential rival  democrat hillary clinton  fueled questions about the campaign s dealings with moscow  the republican president has defended his son s meeting as simple politics  trump s son in law and white house senior adviser jared kushner and former trump campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting  the senate judiciary committee has called for trump jr  and manafort to testify next wednesday at a public hearing in its russia probe  the committee said in a statement late friday that trump jr  and manafort had agreed to negotiate with the panel over whether they will be interviewed by committee members and over documents it is seeking  the committee said it had not issued subpoenas for them to appear at wednesday s hearing but reserved the right to do so  the house of representatives intelligence committee said it would interview kushner on tuesday  mueller  appointed by the justice department in may  is probing allegations of russian interference in the election and potential collusion by trump s campaign  an issue that has engulfed the six month old administration  trump has long expressed frustration with a probe that he has called a political witch hunt  and he has denied any collusion  moscow has denied it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the november  vote in trump s favor  document requests of the type sent by mueller generally cover emails  text messages  voicemails  notes or records  the counsel is looking for any indication that the president knew the meeting his son had was planned and might have suggested topics for discussion  the source said  mueller would also be inquiring into whether trump was briefed on the meeting afterward  as well as what was discussed  the source said  mueller would be interested  the source said  in topics such as any discussion of u s  economic sanctions on russia  possible russian investments in the united states or elsewhere  or a possible lifting of a russian ban on americans adopting russian children  russia imposed the adoption ban to retaliate for the  magnitsky act  which imposed sanctions on russian individuals to punish russia for human rights violations  russia s ambassador to washington was overheard by u s  spy agencies telling his bosses that he had discussed campaign related matters with trump adviser jeff sessions last year  the washington post reported on friday  citing current and former u s  officials  sessions  who was a u s  senator at the time and is now the attorney general  initially failed to disclose the contacts with ambassador sergei kislyak and then said they were not about the campaign  under pressure over having not disclosed the meetings with kislyak  sessions recused himself from the russia probe in march  the recusal angered trump  who said in a new york times interview this week that he would not have chosen sessions for attorney general if he had known sessions would recuse himself   newspaper reports said trump s lawyers are reviewing ways to limit or undermine the special counsel   the washington post and the new york times on thursday cited unidentified people familiar with the strategy  a trump attorney contacted by reuters  john dowd  denied the reports and praised mueller   we think he s a straight  honest guy   dowd said  dowd said communications with mueller were productive and  we have confidence he s going to do the right thing   another trump lawyer  jay sekulow  told the times that addressing possible conflicts of interest in mueller s team would be appropriate but declined to comment on specifics  senior white house adviser kellyanne conway referred on friday to reports that members of mueller s team have made donations to the democratic party   people should know what folks  paths and motivations and political motivations are   she said in a fox news interview  according to the post  trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides  family members and even himself in connection with the russia probe  trump s lawyers have been discussing the president s pardoning powers  a second person told the newspaper  dowd dismissed the pardon report as nonsense   it s just not true   he said  separately  the spokesman for trump s legal team  mark corallo  confirmed his resignation on friday  and lead attorney marc kasowitz will take on a reduced role on the outside legal team  according to media reports  other recent changes included the hiring of veteran washington lawyer ty cobb to a white house job to handle responses to the russia probe
