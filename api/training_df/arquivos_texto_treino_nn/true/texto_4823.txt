washington  reuters    the house intelligence committee on monday held an unusual open hearing on russian interference in the  u s  presidential election and related issues  here are key quotes from the hearing  where fbi director james comey and national security agency director admiral michael rogers testified  on president trump s claim that former president obama wiretapped him   with respect to the president s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration  i have no information that supports those tweets  and we have looked carefully inside the fbi  the department of justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same for the department of justice and all its components     comey  let me be clear  we know there was not a wiretap on trump tower  however  it s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against president trump and his associates     committee chairman representative devin nunes     i have been authorized by the department of justice to confirm that the fbi  as part of our counterintelligence mission  is investigating the russian government s efforts to interfere in the  presidential election and that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the trump campaign and the russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and russia s efforts     comey on unverified claims that obama asked britain s gchq to eavesdrop on trump   that would be expressly against the construct of the five eyes  intelligence sharing  agreement that s been in place for decades      i have seen nothing on the nsa side that we engaged in any such activity   the claim  clearly frustrates a key ally of ours     rogers  numerous current and former officials have leaked purportedly classified information in connection to these questions  we aim to determine who has leaked or facilitated leaks of classified information so that these individuals can be brought to justice     nunes  leaks have always been a problem  i read over the weekend something from george washington and abraham lincoln complaining about them  but i do think in the last six weeks  couple of months  there s been     a lot of conversation about classified matters that s ending up in the media     comey  on the u s  intelligence judgment that russia favored trump over democratic opponent hillary clinton   i think that was a fairly easy judgment for the community  putin hated secretary clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much     comey  they ll be back in   they may be back in  and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord     comey on whether russian influence determined the election outcome   we will never know whether the russian intervention was determinative in such a close election      what does matter is this  the russians successfully meddled in our democracy and our intelligence agencies have concluded they will do so again     ranking committee democrat representative adam schiff
