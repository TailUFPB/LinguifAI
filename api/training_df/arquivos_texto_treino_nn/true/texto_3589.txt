washington  reuters    u s  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said on wednesday he does not yet know how republicans will amass the votes needed to pass legislation now being crafted to dismantle obamacare  but expressed some optimism on another top priority  overhauling the tax code  in an exclusive interview with reuters  mcconnell said healthcare and taxes still top the republican legislative agenda  and he added that he will not reach out to the minority democrats on either one because differences between the two parties are too stark  mcconnell also said he has not asked the white house for input as the senate devises its own healthcare legislation after the republican led house of representatives passed its version on may   but may do so in the future  excluding democratic involvement will leave mcconnell  a conservative  year old kentuckian with a reputation as a dealmaker  a narrow path to win passage of these ambitious goals  which are also at the head of republican president donald trump s policy agenda  a repeal of obamacare was one of trump s leading campaign promises last year  asked about behind the scenes work among senate republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill  mcconnell said   i don t know how we get to   votes  at the moment  but that s the goal  and exactly what the composition of that  bill  is i m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose   mcconnell said  republicans hold a   senate majority  in the event of a   tie  republican vice president mike pence would be called upon to cast a tie breaking vote  mcconnell opened the interview by saying   there s not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare   he declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank and file republican senators and gauge their support  on the other hand  he said  prospects for passage of major tax legislation were  pretty good   while this too will be difficult  mcconnell said  it is  not in my view quite as challenging as healthcare   trump and his fellow republicans in congress want to cut tax rates across the board  but a house proposal to use the tax code to boost exports and discourage imports has split the business community and some lawmakers  the house narrowly passed its legislation to overhaul the healthcare system and dismantle major parts of the obamacare law  formally called the affordable care act  that was democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement  overcoming unified opposition from democrats  on wednesday  the non partisan congressional budget office estimated the house passed bill would result in  million people losing health insurance coverage by   a sobering figure for senate republicans as they mull action  the cbo also said federal budget deficits would fall by   billion over  years under that bill  asked if he was getting any guidance from the white house on healthcare legislation  mcconnell said   honestly i haven t asked for any  i told the president there would be a point at which we might well want him and the vice president to be helpful   mcconnell said trump and pence could play an important role when it comes to  whipping  up support for whatever bill is produced  if the senate passes a healthcare bill  lawmakers would have to work out the differences in the house and senate versions and pass a compromise bill before it could go to trump for his signature  with republicans holding a slim senate majority  mcconnell likely needs the cooperation and support of hard line conservative republicans such as senator ted cruz who in the past have been difficult to corral  cruz is a member of a working group within the senate in charge of crafting the senate obamacare repeal legislation   i m grateful that he wants to help us get an outcome here   mcconnell said  republicans face a tricky balancing act  because they cannot expect any democratic support and have a razor thin majority  they must devise legislation that appeals not only to the most conservative senators but also does not drive off many republican moderates  since it became law in   republicans have railed against obamacare  arguing that it is too expensive and involves the government too deeply in americans  healthcare decisions  they have said they want to replace it with a program that repeals most obamacare taxes  reduces federal spending in the medicaid insurance program for the poor and leaves more decisions up to the states  mcconnell in the past has promised to undo obamacare  root and branch   now that republicans are in a position to do so with control of both congress and the white house  they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan  the republican leader compared the effort to solving a rubik s cube  many senate republicans have misgivings about the house passed legislation  which democrats have said would deprive millions of people of insurance  benefit the wealthy and roll back obamacare protections such as guaranteed coverage for people with pre existing conditions  mcconnell made clear that senators are writing their own bill  saying   we re working on a separate approach   in taking a republican only approach to healthcare and taxes  mcconnell said of democrats   they re not interested in doing what we re interested in doing   mcconnell expressed optimism two parties can band together to pass legislation funding the federal government in the fiscal year starting on oct    he also noted good prospects for bipartisanship on a bill to expand sanctions against iran  due for debate in the senate foreign relations committee this week  and renewal of a food and drug administration user fee program that expires later this year
