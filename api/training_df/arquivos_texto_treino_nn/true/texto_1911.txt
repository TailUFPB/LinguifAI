 reuters    ilka eren    came to the united states from turkey with her parents more than  years ago and lives in the country without legal authorization   while in college  she applied and qualified for deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca   an obama era program that  president donald trump vowed to end during his  presidential campaign  the program does not change an immigrant s legal status but rather protects from deportation and gives the right to work to so called  dreamers   young people brought to the united states as children and living in the country illegally  nearly   immigrants have received daca protection since the program s launch in   eren s daca status opened the door to several internships  and eventually to a job in new york at ovation travel group  which provides travel services to corporations  as executive assistant to the chief financial officer   daca literally changed my life   she said   i really don t know where i would be without it   paul metselaar  ovation s chief executive  doesn t know where he d be without eren   he said her job responsibilities have grown because of her abilities  he said she reminded him of his own grandparents  who immigrated to the united states to seek a better life  if eren were to lose her work eligibility it would be a blow to his company  metselaar said  but  he added   it would be much more of a blow to her family  and to who we are as a country   trump is expected to announce a decision to end daca on tuesday  according to two sources with knowledge of the situation  but with a delay of up to six months to allow congress to find a legislative solution  on the campaign trail  trump promised to quickly repeal the program  but since taking office   even as he has stepped up immigration enforcement   he has at times taken a softer tone about daca   we love the dreamers   he told reporters on friday  immigration hardliners within the republican party have pressured the president to scrap the program  nine republican state attorneys general have said they will file a legal challenge to the program if the trump administration does not end it by tuesday  many business leaders have urged the president to keep daca protections in place  including the heads of tech giants microsoft  msft o    apple  aapl o   and facebook  fb o   they have generally cited a potential hit to the economy if the program were to end  although there is scant government data on dreamers as a distinct economic group  still  with the u s  economy at close to full employment  ending daca would bring a net loss in productivity  said giovanni peri  an economics professor at the university of california  davis who studies immigration   groups that support stricter immigration enforcement say that eliminating the program would bring benefits  too   the end of daca would result in much welcomed job openings for american college graduates and other american workers who are either unemployed or underemployed and feel completely locked out of the workforce and blocked from achieving their american dream   said dave ray  communications director for the federation for american immigration reform  which favors reduced immigration   in interviews with reuters  daca recipients and their employers emphasized another aspect of what it would mean to end the program  the holes such a move would leave in lives and workplaces      georgina lepe  who runs a real estate law and probate practice from her office in rancho cucamonga  california  liked karla martinez so much she hired her twice    she first met martinez when she was busing tables at a mexican restaurant owned by lepe s family and was impressed with her work ethic  when martinez graduated from the university of southern california in december   lepe hired her to help temporarily with marketing   martinez left after a few months to work elsewhere  lepe later tracked her down and asked her to come back  this time as a full time legal assistant   even when she was working at the restaurant  i knew she would be someone   said lepe  who is  and  like martinez  from a mexican family   the difference between  us  is  my family was able to help me out financially to achieve my goals    martinez  who came to the united states with her mother when she was four  helps pay the bills in the home she shares with her mother and two younger siblings  now   she s planning to apply to law school   if daca doesn t end and she can still afford to go back to school   obviously i think about it and it s a little scary but i don t let it take over me   martinez said  lepe says if martinez s work permit is rescinded   i would keep karla until the very last second  and probably wouldn t hire a replacement   i don t think anyone can compare   she says  chuck rocha  the founder of solidarity strategies  employs daca recipient luis alcauter at his washington d c  based political consulting firm  which specializes in outreach to latinos  losing alcauter  would be devastating   rocha said   alcauter    came to the united states from mexico when he was   and attended california state university  fresno  where he developed an interest in politics  which led to his interning on capitol hill   the internship was possible  he said  because of his daca status    to be able to have the documents and be able to apply wherever you want  it really empowers you to think beyond the place you were   alcauter said   it just empowers people to be able to find a job  to get a car  to buy a house  to move around  to contribute to their families   juan ochoa  ceo of miramar group  an illinois based facilities management company that oversees   buildings nationwide  said his company will hire an attorney to try to keep daca employee jay meza    if the program ends   i have a good job now   said meza  who came to the united states from mexico with his parents and brother when he was  years old   i actually am looking forward to buying my first house  i actually have a good car   ochoa said meza started at miramar doing data entry and analyzing spreadsheets and went on to help the company build a system allowing it to track its buildings and employees   we have invested a lot of time and money in training jay  and so it would be a significant loss to us   he said   this story corrects year that martinez graduated to  instead of
