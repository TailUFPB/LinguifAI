washington  reuters    a  percent import tax  backed by republican leaders in the house of representatives  is unlikely to win enough support from the senate finance committee to be part of any senate tax reform bill  the panel s republican chairman said on tuesday  the comment by senator orrin hatch of utah is the strongest sign yet of the daunting legislative challenge that lies ahead for the border adjustment tax  or bat  a controversial house republican proposal that has already divided the business community and republicans in congress  hatch s finance committee  which consists of  republicans and  democrats  has oversight authority for tax policy and would need to approve any tax reform legislation considered in the senate   it s going to be tough to pass  i don t think we can move it through the finance committee   the utah republican told reporters after discussing the bat proposal at a meeting with treasury secretary steven mnuchin  hatch said the administration also opposes bat   they re against that     if i interpret it correctly   the proposal  which would exempt u s  export revenues from federal taxation but impose a flat  percent tax on imports  is strongly backed by house speaker paul ryan and house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady  neither ryan s office nor brady s had an immediate comment on hatch s remarks  if the house approved bat but the senate excluded it from legislation  house republicans would need to use bicameral negotiations to get it included in final legislation for president donald trump s signature  house republicans have billed border adjustment as a way to meet trump s pledge to create jobs at home while preventing american companies from moving manufacturing jobs and production facilities overseas  but it has divided u s  business by drawing enthusiastic support from exporters and fierce opposition from import dependent industries  leaving many republican lawmakers wary of the proposal  republican supporters say bat is needed to pay for steep business tax cuts  citing independent analyses that estimate it would raise more than   trillion over a decade  administration officials have called for financing tax cuts with future economic growth  some lawmakers have suggested deficit financed tax cuts instead          we have to raise revenue   hatch said   there s no question about that  and we will  we know where it all is anyway
