washington  reuters    bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda warned world policymakers against undoing the free trade and globalization that he said have brought prosperity to many economies  particularly emerging nations  kuroda also said that while japan s economic prospects were brightening  inflation was lacking momentum and justified maintaining the boj s massive monetary stimulus for some time   the global economy made great strides by consistently promoting free trade since the end of world war two   kuroda said upon arrival in washington for the group of  finance leaders  gathering and the international monetary fund meetings   my belief is that a multilateral framework promoting free trade will continue  there won t be huge changes to that   he told reporters on thursday  his comments came as world financial leaders gathered in washington with pledges to work with u s  president donald trump to fix lingering trade problems while vowing to keep their commitments to free trade and global integration  kuroda  formerly head of the asian development bank  said that while policymakers must deal with poverty and income disparities widening in some countries  that did not mean they should abandon global free trade   unwinding the more than  year postwar history of free trade and globalism isn t the appropriate approach   he said  trump s protectionist approach to trade and european political risks have overshadowed brightening prospects for the global economy  driven by a rebound in manufacturing activity  japan has benefitted from global tailwinds that boosted exports and factory output  kuroda said  describing its economy as  expanding steadily as a trend    a more upbeat view than last month  but he offered a bleaker view on japan s inflation  saying it lacked momentum with no clear sign yet it was shifting up   that s why the boj will continue its ultra easy monetary policy to achieve its  percent inflation target at the earliest date possible   he said  japan s economy has shown signs of life as exports and output rebounded thanks to a pick up in global demand  but core consumer prices for february rose just   percent from a year earlier  far from the boj s  percent target  as weak household spending discourages companies from raising prices and wages  after three years of heavy money printing failed to drive up inflation  the boj reverted its policy framework last september to one better suited for a long term war against deflation
