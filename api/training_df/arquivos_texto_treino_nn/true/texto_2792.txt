new york  reuters    donald trump jr  s meeting with a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who had incriminating information about democratic candidate hillary clinton that could help his father s presidential campaign could lead investigators to probe whether he violated u s  election law  experts said   trump jr  met the woman  lawyer natalia veselnitskaya  on june     after an email exchange with an intermediary   the emails  tweeted by trump jr  on tuesday  could provide material for special counsel robert mueller s probe into possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia during the  presidential election   in one of the emails dated june     trump jr  wrote   if it s what you say i love it   he released the tweets after the new york times said it planned to write about their contents and sought his comment  trump jr  said in his tweets that nothing came of the meeting  veselnitskaya told nbc news early on tuesday she was not affiliated with the russian government and had passed no information    in retrospect  i probably would have done things a little differently   trump jr  said in an interview on fox news   for me  this was opposition research   collusion itself is not an actual crime under the u s  criminal code  so prosecutors would look to see if trump jr  s conduct ran afoul of a specific law  legal experts said  moscow has denied interference in the u s  election  and president donald trump has said his campaign did not collude with russia  alan futerfas  trump jr  s lawyer  did not respond to a request for comment  a spokesman for mueller declined to comment   one law that might come into play is the federal election campaign act  which makes it illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a u s  political campaign  the campaign is also prohibited from soliciting such contributions  a contribution does not have to be monetary in nature  according to paul s  ryan  an attorney with watchdog group common cause  he said incriminating information about clinton could be considered a contribution under the act  ryan said trump jr  s  enthusiastic response  to the offer for information and particularly his proposal in his email to have a follow up call the next week constituted  solicitation     that to me is an indication  a concession by donald trump jr  that he wants and is requesting this information   ryan said   joshua douglas  a professor at the university of kentucky college of law  said trump jr  s emails made it  more plausible  that there could be a criminal case against him  james gardner  an election law expert at the university of buffalo law school  said the election law was intended to target donations of cash or goods and services  he said he did not believe trump jr  would have violated the law if he solicited damaging information about clinton   a federal law known as the general conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to conspire to commit a crime against or defraud the united states could also come into play if  for example  trump jr  tried to help russians hack into u s  computer networks  there was no indication that trump jr  did such a thing  andrew wright  a professor at savannah law school who was  associate counsel in the white house counsel s office under former democratic president barack obama  said he thought trump jr  s agreeing to meet with someone to discuss an illegal act would be enough to trigger a conspiracy charge    it s a very powerful tool   he said
