 reuters    former president george w  bush decried  bullying and prejudice  while defending immigrants and trade on thursday in a new york speech that appeared to be a sweeping  thinly veiled critique of president donald trump   bush    used a rare public address to discuss nationalism  racial divisions and russia s intervention in the  election  all flashpoints of his fellow republican s nine month white house tenure  he did not mention trump by name   bullying and prejudice in our public life sets a national tone  provides permission for cruelty and bigotry  and compromises the moral education of children  the only way to pass along civic values is to first live up to them   bush said at the bush institute s national forum on freedom  free markets and security  trump has used nicknames to demean opponents  such as  crooked hillary  for democrat hillary clinton and  more recently   liddle  bob corker for a republican senator who dared to challenge him  bush  president from  to   emphasized the important role of immigrants and of international trade  two policy areas that trump has cracked down on while in office   we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to america   bush said    we see a fading confidence in the value of free markets and international trade  forgetting that conflict  instability  and poverty follow in the wake of protectionism   asked whether the speech was aimed at trump  a spokesman for bush said the long planned remarks echoed themes the  president had discussed for years   the themes president bush spoke about today are really the same themes he has spoken about for the last two decades   said bush spokesman freddy ford  bush touted u s  alliances abroad  something trump has called into question  and he denounced white supremacy  which critics accused trump of failing to do quickly and explicitly earlier this year  in the speech  bush described a decline in public confidence in u s  institutions and a paralysis in the governing class to address pressing needs   discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  bigotry seems emboldened  our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication   bush said   we have seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty    trump was a longtime proponent of a false theory that democratic former president barack obama was not born in the united states  obama  trump s predecessor  was born in the u s  state of hawaii  bush said americans were the heirs of thomas jefferson  the third u s  president  as well as civil rights leader martin luther king  jr   this means that people of every race  religion  and ethnicity can be fully and equally american   he said   it means that bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the american creed   trump has had a rocky relationship with the bush family  he belittled former florida governor jeb bush  who was an early  opponent of trump for the republican presidential nomination  and has criticized george w  bush for the war in iraq and for presiding over the sept     attacks  bush said globalization could not be wished away  any more than we could wish away the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution   he also had harsh words for russia and seemed to take aim at trump for playing down moscow s intervention in the u s  election   according to our intelligence services  the russian government has made a project of turning americans against each other  this effort is broad  systematic and stealthy   he said    foreign aggressions  including cyber attacks  disinformation and financial influence  should not be downplayed or tolerated  this is a clear case where the strength of our democracy begins at home
