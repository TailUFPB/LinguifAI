beijing  reuters    the united states said on saturday it was directly communicating with north korea on its nuclear and missile programs but pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue  the disclosure by u s  secretary of state rex tillerson during a trip to china represented the first time he has spoken to such an extent about u s  outreach to north korea over its pursuit of a nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missile   we are probing so stay tuned   tillerson told a group of reporters in beijing    we ask   would you like to talk   we have lines of communications to pyongyang  we re not in a dark situation  a blackout    he said that communication was happening directly and cited two or three u s  channels open to pyongyang   we can talk to them  we do talk to them   he said  without elaborating about which americans were involved in those contacts or how frequent or substantive they were  the goal of any initial dialogue would be simple  finding out directly from north korea what it wants to discuss   we haven t even gotten that far yet   he said  trying to tamp down expectations  the state department said later there were no signs pyongyang was interested in talks   north korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization   department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement   tillerson previously had offered little detail about u s  outreach  on sept    he acknowledged only  very  very limited  contact with pyongyang s u n  envoy  when asked about tillerson s assertion and what communication there might be between pyongyang and washington  a spokesman for the north korean mission to the united nations said he  can t go further into detail   tillerson s remarks followed a day of meetings in beijing  which has been alarmed by recent exchanges of war like threats and personal insults between north korean leader kim jong un and u s  president donald trump   i think the whole situation s a bit overheated right now   tillerson said   i think everyone would like for it to calm down   obviously it would help if north korea would stop firing off missiles  that d calm things down a lot   south korean officials have voiced concerns that north korea could conduct more provocative acts near the anniversary of the founding of its communist party on oct    or possibly when china holds its communist party congress on oct    north korea is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept   and has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific    u s  officials including tillerson say beijing  after long accounting for some  percent of north korea s foreign trade  appears increasingly willing to cut ties to its neighbor s economy by adopting u n  sanctions  tillerson said china s more assertive posture was due to its realization that north korea s nuclear and missile capabilities had advanced too far   i think they also have a sense that we re beginning to run out of time and that we really have to change the dynamic   tillerson said  the goal of the sanctions would be getting north korea s kim to view nuclear weapons as a liability  not a strength   still  the u s  intelligence community does not believe kim is likely to give up his weapons program willingly  regardless of sanctions     tillerson s  working against the unified view of our intelligence agencies  which say there s no amount of pressure that can be put on them to stop   senator bob corker told a hearing at the chamber on thursday  kim sees nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles as  his ticket to survival   corker said  tillerson agreed that kim s nuclear and missile programs were aimed at ensuring his own security  and renewed assurances that the united states did not seek to topple kim s government   look  our objective is denuclearization  of north korea    he said   our objective is not to get rid of you  our objective is not to collapse your regime   it is unclear how and when any actual negotiations with pyongyang might be possible    white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster said on monday there were no set preconditions for talks  he added  however  that pyongyang s capabilities were too far advanced to simply freeze its program in return for concessions  he also dismissed the idea of negotiating with pyongyang even as it continued to develop its nuclear weapons program  tillerson in march suggested the united states would only engage north korea in negotiations once it gave up nuclear weapons   but he acknowledged on saturday that denuclearization would be an  incremental process    you d be foolish to think you re going to sit down and say  ok  done  nuclear weapons  gone  this is going to be a process of engagement with north korea   he said  trump  who is due to visit china in november  has called for it to do more regarding north korea and has promised to take steps to rebalance a trade relationship that his administration says puts u s  businesses at a disadvantage  chinese president xi jinping did not mention north korea in his opening remarks while meeting tillerson on saturday  he instead offered warm words about trump  saying he expected the u s  president s visit to be  wonderful     the two of us have also maintained a good working relationship and personal friendship   xi said in comments in front of reporters
