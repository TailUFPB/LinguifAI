washington  reuters    the leaders of the u s  intelligence community on thursday pressed congress to renew the national security agency s expiring surveillance law  warning in a rare public statement that national security may be endangered if lawmakers let it lapse  the message from the intelligence chiefs sought to apply pressure on lawmakers who appeared to abandon an effort this week to pass legislation that would have reauthorized for several years the nsa s warrantless internet spying program  which is due to expire on dec    that plan cratered late on wednesday amid objections from a sizable coalition of republicans and democrats who want to have more privacy safeguards in the program  which chiefly targets foreigners but also collects communications from an unknown number of americans  instead  house republicans unveiled a stopgap funding measure on thursday that includes an extension of the surveillance law until jan    the law  known as section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  is considered by u s  intelligence agencies to be vital to national security   there is no substitute for section    director of national intelligence dan coats  attorney general jeff sessions  and the directors the nsa  fbi and cia wrote in the joint statement  adding that failure to renew the authority would make it easier for foreign adversaries to  plan attacks against our citizens and allies without detection   section  allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states  but the program incidentally gathers communications of americans for a variety of technical reasons  including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas  those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant  including by the federal bureau of investigation  some lawmakers in both parties want to eliminate or partially restrict the u s  government s ability to review data of americans collected under section  without first obtaining a warrant  the intelligence chiefs also criticized the current plan to temporarily extend the program  saying short term extensions  fail to provide certainty and will create needless and wasteful operational complications   u s  officials recently acknowledged the end year deadline may not matter much because of a belief the program can lawfully continue through april due to the way it is annually certified   in their statement  however  the intelligence chiefs warned that the surveillance program would need to begin  winding down  well in advance of the april date
