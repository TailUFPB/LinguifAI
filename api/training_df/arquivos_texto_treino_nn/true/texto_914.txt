washington  reuters    senior u s  republican and democratic senators said on wednesday they would push ahead with efforts to reach a bi partisan deal on rolling back some financial rules introduced the  financial crisis  even after a leading democratic lawmaker walked away from talks  their comments bolstered hopes among banking lobbyists that congress may yet agree legislation to roll back some aspects of the  dodd frank law  potentially cutting billions in costs for banks  after bi partisan discussions appeared to falter  senator sherrod brown  the leading democrat on the senate banking committee  said in a statement on wednesday that he was stepping away from months long private negotiations with the committee s republican chair senator mike crapo over rolling back elements of the  dodd frank law  saying they had reached an impasse  on wednesday  however  crapo told reporters he was still working towards a regulatory reform bill and would renew efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise    i intend to move forward to build a bipartisan solution  and i hope to be able to do so soon   crapo told reporters  bank lobbyists told reuters they remained optimistic a bill still could be passed  saying brown s exit had cleared the path for several democrats more sympathetic to crapo s position to take over the negotiations  spokespeople for senators heidi heitkamp and joe donnelly  two of the banking panel s moderate democratic members  told reuters on wednesday they were open to rekindling the talks   congress needs to make the financial regulatory system work better for everyone  and i m willing to work with anyone on a deal that would accomplish that goal   heitkamp said in a statement  donnelly said in a statement he believed there was still an opportunity to negotiate a relief package for community financial institutions  while protecting consumers and ensuring the safety of our financial system   the house of representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of dodd frank legislation  but the senate will ultimately determine what  if any  relief the republican led congress hands to banks  industry expectations on a final deal had been modest because senate republicans need eight democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to dodd frank   the exact shape of a regulatory reform bill is not public  there is bipartisan support for easing requirements on smaller banks and credit unions  but reducing the number of banks that face stricter oversight because they are considered critical to the financial system has proved a point of contention  currently  banks with over   billion in assets are considered  systemically important   and must comply with stricter rules  republican lawmakers are considering raising that threshold  but this is opposed by some powerful democrats including senator elizabeth warren   after working in good faith  it s clear we will not be able to reach a compromise that protects consumers while supporting small banks and credit unions   said brown in a statement   i continue to support small banks and credit unions  but i cannot agree to gutting protections for working people and taxpayers    this version of the story was refiled to add missing word  following  in the lead paragraph
