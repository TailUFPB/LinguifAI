new york  reuters    with republican efforts to dismantle obamacare in disarray  hundreds of u s  counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in  as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months  republican senators failed this week to repeal and replace obamacare  former president barack obama s signature healthcare reform law  creating new uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to  million americans will be funded and managed in   in response  republican president donald trump on friday again suggested that his administration would let the obamacare program  implode   he has weakened enforcement of the law s requirement for individuals to buy insurance  threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations   anthem inc  cigna corp  health care service corp and molina healthcare  four of the biggest health insurers selling obamacare plans  said they are weighing whether to pull out of more markets for  rather than face financial losses  they have until sept   to finalize their plans   so far   u s  counties are expected to have no insurer offering individual coverage next year  but that number could rise by the hundreds  according to u s  government data  kaiser family foundation analysis and insurer disclosures  more than   counties  primarily in  states  currently have only one insurer participating in   anthem and hcsc are the last man standing in one third of those counties and states   putting those areas in particular at risk   right now the number of counties at immediate risk of having no insurers in  is small  but it could easily grow significantly if a couple major insurers decide to exit   larry levitt  health economist at the kaiser family foundation  said   many insurers have been waiting for an answer from trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund   billion in annual government subsidies  without assurances  many insurers plan to raise rates an additional  percent by an aug   deadline for premium prices  others say that the many unknowns will make the business too risky  the last minute drama has left millions of americans questioning whether they will have medical coverage next year  julie grady  a  year old small business owner in carson city  nevada  is currently covered by blue cross blue shield of nevada  part of anthem  which has already decided to leave the exchanges in her county and most of the state  carson city will have no insurer on the exchanges next year       grady s pays a reduced premium of   per month and a deductible under    for her plan  which is part of the affordable care act  commonly called obamacare  grady is looking at being uninsured  as she was before the law       i would have to go without health insurance   she said   i would just stay healthy  hike  eat well  i d be in trouble if something catastrophic happened  i would lose everything        anthem  the second largest u s  health insurer  sells blue cross blue shield plans in  states  it has already decided to pull out of most individual markets in nevada  ohio  indiana and wisconsin in   earlier this week  chief executive officer joe swedish said he was still weighing  participation in its other states     in states like colorado  georgia  kentucky  missouri  and virginia  anthem sells plans in more than  counties where it is the only insurer  and they could be left  bare  next year  according to government data       health care services corp is a blue cross blue shield licensee in five states and is the only obamacare individual insurer in more than  texas counties  more than  oklahoma counties  and half a dozen illinois counties  it confirmed on friday that it has submitted products for its five states but is still weighing next year       we re working through the regulatory filing process and hope to fully participate   in   however no final decisions have been made   hcsc spokeswoman kristen cunningham said      molina  which has more than  million members in obamacare plans  and cigna  with more than   participants  have said they need more certainty from the government to decide on  participation and would weigh their decisions up until the late september deadline       state insurance regulators have worked hard in recent months to replace insurers who have left  in nevada  for instance  centene corp and aetna inc entered in some counties that anthem left after the insurance commissioner said he would favor these insurers for its medicaid contract bids  but they are unlikely to find replacements for new dropouts in these final weeks  particularly if the trump administration signals it won t fund   billion in subsidies for out of pocket medical costs       there is almost no chance they would step in to participate   said kurt wrobel  a fellow at the society of actuaries and chief financial officer of the geisinger health plan in pennsylvania           some insurers say they will likely just raise rates and hope it works  blue cross blue shield of michigan filed two sets of rates with the state department of insurance  one up to  percent higher if the fate of subsidies remains unclear        we don t have any plans to pull out   said rick notter  director of the individual business at bcbs michigan   but it would certainly help to have more certainty around what the market holds
