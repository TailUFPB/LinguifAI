washington  reuters    president donald trump is expected this week to delay relocating the u s  embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv  u s  officials and a diplomatic source said on wednesday  despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move  with a deadline for a decision looming  trump is likely to  continue his predecessors  policy of signing a six month waiver overriding a  law requiring that the embassy be transferred to jerusalem  an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart israeli palestinian peace talks  the sources said  trump has yet to make his decision official but is required by law to act by friday  according to one u s  official who spoke on condition of anonymity   barring a last minute surprise  trump is expected to renew the waiver  his administration intends to make clear  however  that trump remains committed to the promise he made during the  presidential campaign  though it will not set a specific timetable for doing so  officials said  asked whether trump would sign the waiver  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters on wednesday   once we have a decision  we ll put it out   adding there would be  something very soon on that   while there have been divisions among trump s aides on the issue  the view that appears to have prevailed is that the united states should keep the embassy in tel aviv for now to avoid angering the palestinians  arab governments and western allies while the president seeks to nurture peace efforts  trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to israel and the west bank in may  despite that  most experts are skeptical of trump s chances for achieving a peace deal that eluded other u s  presidents  the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks  israel captured arab east jerusalem during the  middle east war and later annexed it  a move not recognized internationally  israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital  pro israel rhetoric the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state  jerusalem is home to holy sites of the jewish  muslim and christian religions  shifting the u s  embassy would be widely seen as washington s recognition of the israeli position on jerusalem s status  which successive u s  administrations have said must be decided in negotiations between the two sides  former president barack obama renewed the waiver in december  setting off a six month clock for trump  cnn was first to report that trump was expected to sign the waiver  on the campaign trail  trump s pro israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy  but after he took office in january  the issue lost momentum as he met arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator  some of trump s top aides have pushed for him to keep his campaign promise  not only because it would be welcomed by most israelis but to satisfy the pro israel  right wing base that helped him win the presidency  the state department  however recommended against an embassy move  one u s  official said   the president is still committed to moving the embassy   one u s  official said   it s not a question of whether but when it will be done   the jerusalem embassy act passed by congress in  mandating relocation of embassy to jerusalem allows the president to waive the requirement in accordance with u s  national security interests
