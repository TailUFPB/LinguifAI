washington  reuters    u s  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein on wednesday dismissed republican lawmakers  charges that government attorneys and agents investigating allegations of russian interference in the  election are biased against president donald trump  republicans have attacked special counsel robert mueller  who has charged four trump associates in his investigation  which is also looking into possible collusion between the trump campaign and moscow officials  testifying before the u s  house of representatives judiciary committee on wednesday  rosenstein said he was  not aware  of any impropriety by mueller s team  when the committee s ranking democrat asked if he had any good cause for firing mueller  he replied   no           russia denies the conclusions by three u s  intelligence agencies that moscow used hacking and disinformation to affect the election  and trump says there was no collusion      at the hearing  republicans on the committee increased their criticism of mueller  highlighting text messages between two federal bureau of investigation employees  including an agent on his investigating team  as evidence of bias against trump  so far  however  congressional republicans have stopped short of calling on trump to fire mueller  republicans said they had reviewed more than  anti trump text messages exchanged last year between fbi lawyer lisa page and peter strzok  an fbi agent who worked on mueller s probe  members of the committee read aloud the contents of some of the text messages between strzok and page       some texts call trump an  idiot  and a  loathsome human   according to copies of a sampling of the texts reviewed by reuters  in one july  exchange they poked fun at trump s campaign during the republican national convention   my god  i m so embarrassed for them  these are like second run stars   page responded to strzok   and wow  donald trump is an enormous d uche   the texts showed  extreme bias against president trump  a fact that would be bad enough if it weren t for the fact that these two individuals were employed as part of the mueller  dream team  investigating the very person for whom they were showing disdain   said bob goodlatte  the republican chairman of the judiciary committee  in some of the texts seen by reuters  however  strzok did not seem excited about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  either  describing himself as a  conservative democrat   he in one text openly worried about her getting elected  and at one point complained that certain news media outlets were biased for downplaying her ties to the oil and gas industry   this is clear and utter bias by the media specifically the nytimes  wapo  and cnn who if you look at all of them have large donors for clinton   he wrote         rosenstein  who appointed mueller  said the special counsel properly removed strzok from the probe after the justice department inspector general brought the texts to light  and added he was confident mueller is not letting political bias color the investigation  he also said he thinks mueller is the  ideal choice  to lead the investigation  and said that just because a person is affiliated with a political party does not mean he or she will be biased  he said he had discussed the issue of bias with mueller and that mueller  is running that office appropriately
