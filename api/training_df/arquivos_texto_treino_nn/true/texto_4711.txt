washington  reuters    u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday that he believes financial markets could improve  significantly  once they fully reflect the potential for u s  economic growth from president donald trump s economic policies  mnuchin said at an event sponsored by news website axios that optimism about u s  growth from policies such as regulatory reform and tax reform is  definitely not all baked in  to market valuations  u s  stock prices and the dollar have strengthened significantly since trump was elected in november  largely in anticipation of corporate profits rising as regulatory burdens ease and tax rates fall  some of those gains were retraced this week as republicans in congress faced stiff opposition from conservatives in passing a bill to replace the obamacare health law   i think there is some good news that s baked in  but yet  i think there is further room for significant growth in the economy that would be reflected in the markets   mnuchin said   the consequence would be that the market could go up significantly   mnuchin added  treasury secretaries in the past have shied away from publicly discussing market valuations  but mnuchin said trump s policies could produce growth of  percent to   percent  which is significantly higher than the fourth quarter reading of   percent    we re in an environment where the u s  assets are the most attractive assets to invest in on a global basis   mnuchin said he is still aiming to achieve passage of comprehensive tax reform by the time congress takes its august recess  he also said he expects the trump administration s obamacare replacement bill to pass later on friday
