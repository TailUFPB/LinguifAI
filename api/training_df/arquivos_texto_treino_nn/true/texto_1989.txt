washington new york  reuters    the frequent travels of the head of the u s  environmental protection agency  scott pruitt  to oklahoma will be investigated following congressional requests  the agency s office of inspector general said on monday  pruitt s many travels to his home state have fueled speculation that he intends to run for the u s  senate from oklahoma   administrator pruitt is traveling the country to hear directly from the people impacted by epa s regulations outside of the washington bubble   said amy graham  an epa spokeswoman   this is nothing more than a distraction from the administrator s significant environmental accomplishments   the office of inspector general said it would look into the  frequency  cost and extent  of pruitt s travels to oklahoma through july   and whether travel policies and procedures were followed  it said the investigation will also aim to determine  whether epa policies and procedures are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud  waste and abuse with the administrator s travel that included trips to oklahoma   pruitt was in oklahoma on at least  of the  days of march  april and may  according to copies of his travel records obtained by the environmental integrity project watchdog group and reviewed by reuters last month  the travel records show pruitt s schedule this spring often took him to cities in the u s  heartland where he held meetings  often with oil and gas industry representatives  made speeches and attended events before flying to tulsa for extended weekends  the records showed pruitt paid for some legs of the trips directly related to his visits home  although it was not clear he paid for all such legs  pruitt has riled environmentalists by raising doubts about climate change and by vowing to sweep away scores of obama era regulations to help business   pruitt seems to be using these visits to launch his political career   said melinda pierce  legislative director for the sierra club  an environmental group that has been deeply critical of pruitt   perhaps he should use polluter money to fund these trips if he s going to continue doing their bidding   before becoming head of the epa under republican president donald trump in february  he was oklahoma s attorney general and repeatedly sued the agency he now runs to block federal environmental rules
