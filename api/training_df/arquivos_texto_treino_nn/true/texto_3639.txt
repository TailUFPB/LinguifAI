cannes  france  reuters    u s  president donald trump cannot stop momentum to tackle climate change  former u s  vice president al gore said on monday as he promoted his latest film on global warming at the cannes film festival   an inconvenient sequel  truth to power  is the follow up to  an inconvenient truth   the documentary credited with bringing climate change into mainstream political discourse in the united states a decade ago   shot mostly before trump s election  it features the republican candidate on the campaign trail promising to abolish environmental regulations and boost the coal and oil industries  at one point trump tells a rally   we need some global warming   it s freezing   but with legal and political obstacles  gore said trump would be unable to stop the momentum that would shift society away from fossil fuels   we now know after four months of the trump administration  no one person  not even a president  can stop the climate movement   gore told a news conference at the french film festival   the courts have blocked parts of what president trump has attempted and the congress has refused to act on other parts of his agenda  the american people are determined to continue making progress and will do so   he added  since he took office  trump s administration has moved to unwind environmental rules but frustrated some conservatives by entertaining the idea of keeping the united states in a global pact to fight climate change  gore expressed hope that trump would opt not to quit the  paris deal on climate change signed by most countries in the world   i do believe that there is a better than even chance that he will surprise many by keeping the u s  within the paris agreement  i don t know that he will but i think there is a chance that he will    an inconvenient sequel  premiered at the sundance festival in january to mixed reviews   variety said it was  likely to be another event  a part of the conversation  a movie that glories  once again  in the incisive power of its inconvenience    but the hollywood reporter said the documentary s big weakness was that gore failed to tackle trump strongly enough   quite possibly  gore thinks talking at this point would jeopardize any influence he might have in the soon to be gold plated oval office   it wrote in january   but this is one area in which the movie cannot inspire hope for the future
