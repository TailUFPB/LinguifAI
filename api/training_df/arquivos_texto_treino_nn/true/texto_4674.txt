chicago  reuters    republicans may have failed to overthrow obamacare this week  but there are plenty of ways they can chip away at it  the trump administration has already begun using its regulatory authority to water down less prominent aspects of the  healthcare law   earlier this week  newly confirmed health and human services secretary tom price stalled the rollout of mandatory medicare payment reform programs for heart attack treatment  bypass surgery and joint replacements finalized by the obama administration in december  the delays offer a glimpse at how president donald trump can use his administrative power to undercut aspects of the affordable care act  aca   including the insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion that republicans had sought to overturn  the republicans  failure to repeal obamacare  at least for now  means it remains federal law  price s power resides in how to interpret that law  and which programs to emphasize and fund  hospitals and physician groups have been counting on support from medicare   the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled   to continue driving payment reform policies built into obamacare that reward doctors and hospitals for providing high quality care at a lower cost  the obama administration had committed to shifting half of all medicare payments to these alternative payment models by   although he has voiced general support for innovative payment programs  price has been a loud critic of mandatory federal programs that dictate how doctors should deliver healthcare  providers such as dr  richard gilfillan  chief executive of trinity healthcare  a    billion catholic health system  say they will press on with these alternative payment plans with or without the government s blessing  but they have been actively lobbying trump officials for support  according to interviews with more than a dozen hospital executives  physicians and policy experts  without the backing of medicare  the biggest payer in the u s  healthcare system which price now oversees  the nascent payment reform movement could lose momentum  sidelining a transformation many experts believe is vital to reining in runaway u s  healthcare spending  price  can t change the legislation  but of course he s supposed to implement it  he could impact it   said john rother  chief executive of the national coalition on health care  a broad alliance of healthcare stakeholders that has been lobbying the new administration for support of value based care  the move friday to pull the republican bill only reinforces the risk to the existing law  which trump said on friday  will soon explode     it seems that the trump administration now faces a choice whether to actively undermine the aca or reshape it administratively   larry levitt  senior vice president at kaiser family foundation  wrote on twitter   the aca marketplaces weren t collapsing  but they could be made to collapse through administrative actions   he added  the united states spends   trillion a year on healthcare   more by far than  other wealthy countries   yet has the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rate  according to a  commonwealth fund report  link to graphic  tmsnrt rs  health costs have soared thanks in part to the traditional way doctors and hospitals get paid  namely by receiving a fee for each service they provide  so the more advanced imaging tests a doctor orders or pricey procedures they perform  the more money he or she makes  regardless of whether the patient s health improves   we have a completely broken economy in healthcare   said blair childs  senior vice president at hospital purchasing group premier inc   literally  all of the incentives in fee for service are for higher cost   alternative payment models are designed to remove incentives that reward overtreatment of patients  private insurers are on board  with aetna inc  anthem inc  unitedhealth group and most blue cross insurers announcing plans to shift half of their reimbursement to alternative payment models to control costs  to promote the shift to alternative payments  the aca created an incubator program at the centers for medicare   medicaid services  cms   the cms innovation center is funded by   billion over  years to test payment schemes aimed at improving quality and cutting the cost of care   the obama administration s decision to make some of these payment programs mandatory has drawn the ire of price  a former u s  senator and orthopedic surgeon  in response to a mandatory payment program for joint replacements last september  for example  price charged that the cms innovation center was  experimenting with americans  health   in his january  confirmation  price said he was a  strong supporter of innovation   but said he believed the cms innovation center  has gotten a bit off track   president trump has already signed an executive order directing the hhs to begin unraveling obamacare  in the early hours of his presidency  trump directed government agencies to freeze regulations and take steps to weaken the healthcare law  the order directed departments to  waive  defer  grant exemptions from  or delay the implementation  of provisions that imposed fiscal burdens on states  companies or individuals  these moves were meant to minimize the costs and regulatory burdens imposed on states  private entities and individuals  david cutler  the harvard health economist who helped the obama administration shape the aca  said price could do all sorts of things to undermine the law   if he wants to blow it up  he can   cutler said in an email  but if they do  he added   they alone will own the failure
