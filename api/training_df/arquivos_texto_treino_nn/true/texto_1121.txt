the woodlands  texas  reuters    the u s  environmental protection agency will cut response times to permit requests to within six months by the end of   part of the agency s goal to reduce regulations and delays  administrator scott pruitt said on thursday  the move comes as president donald trump pushes to shrink the size of government and cut regulations  especially on the coal and oil sectors   regulatory uncertainty is the biggest reason why the u s  economy isn t growing faster   pruitt said in a panel discussion at the texas oil   gas association s lone star energy forum just outside houston   the epa has in some cases taken several years to review some permit requests  pruitt said cutting that response time was a key goal when he took office earlier this year  a task he delegated to henry darwin  his chief of staff and a former staffer at the arizona department of environmental quality   it can be done  it s just a matter of having the process in place to achieve results   said pruitt  the former oklahoma attorney general  environmentalists have consistently challenged pruitt s decisions atop the epa  saying the agency is rushing approval of some projects that could harm the environment  in his remarks to the crowd of oil and gas executives  pruitt said he did not see his role as having to chose between the economy or environmental stewardship   one of the greatest challenges we have as a country is to ask the question   what is true environmentalism    pruitt said   why can t we be about jobs and growth and environmental stewardship   earlier this month pruitt issued a notice that the agency intended to repeal the clean power plan  which it said relied on controversial calculations of economic costs and benefits  ending the rule could save   billion in regulatory costs  the epa estimated   pruitt said he did not believe the epa had the authority to regulate how electricity is generated under the clean air act    although former president barack obama s administration had taken the opposite approach  the u s  congress  pruitt said  should tell him how to proceed  vowing to take no action on the issue without legislative approval   if congress hasn t given us the authority to do something  we can t do it   he said   if they want to give us authority to regulate certain areas  they need to be specific and tell us
