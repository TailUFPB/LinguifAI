washington  reuters    by u s  president donald trump s math  renegotiating the north american free trade agreement and other deals will largely pay for the massive tax cuts his cabinet laid out earlier in the week   he is likely off by a factor of close to    or more   according to trade and tax economists who say it does not make sense to think of the world in the two dimensional  money in my pocket or money in yours way that trump did in a thursday interview with reuters   the president  for example  said that given the current   billion annual trade deficit with mexico  the united states would be better off if the two countries did not trade at all  saying  you ll save yourself a hell of a lot of money   the former real estate developer s economic assessment appeared to overlook the ways in which a total halt to trade between the two neighbors would ripple through both nations   changing prices  currency values  jobs and wages  arguably helping some industries but damaging others  the net impact of trump s calculations  which run counter to most widely accepted views of the benefits of trade  are hard to predict  said claude barfield  a trade expert at the conservative american enterprise institute   these views about the trade deficit and its alleged negative impact   are nonsense  and are views he has held since the    said barfield   it could happen   he said of a hypothetical severing of ties between the united states and mexico   but the things you would do to make it happen would be hugely disruptive  you d have to think what are the first  and second order effects   as industries reorganize and consumers adapt   in the case of mexico  the american companies that exported a quarter of a trillion dollars of goods and services to that country last year would be out a customer  and likely cut jobs  those american companies that tried to replace the   billion in mexican imports would likely do so at a higher cost   assuming they are in the united states to begin with  there is no guarantee that if trump were to seal the border with mexico that it would  save  the united states any money  said marcus noland  a trade economist at the peterson institute for international economics  it may simply reduce consumption through higher prices charged by domestic suppliers  or lead to increased imports from a different country       americans seem to really like guacamole   noland said   but the idea that we are going to have giant greenhouses and lots of avocados and limes   the fact that we are purchasing them from the mexicans rather than producing them at home tells you producing them at home is more expensive  we can stop trading with the mexicans  and have   billion less in consumption   since consumption accounts for a large part of the u s  economy  that is not an outcome trump would want  though it would be one way  economists note  to achieve the trade balance the president and his advisers regard as important   trump told reuters   there is no such thing as a trade war when you have a deficit   most economists disagree with the notion that the trade deficit matters much to a country as large and self sufficient as the united states   trade at that scale in particular is shaped by global savings and investment patterns that in recent years have favored the united states   by the statistics most widely accepted among economists  the u s  position with the rest of the world has been steadily improving as investment flows into the country from abroad and supports millions of jobs   the current account deficit   which includes trade flows  investment  and other financial transfers across borders    has been shrinking for more than a decade and is now less than  percent of gross domestic product  as far as the impact of trade on the federal deficit   a separate concept reflecting how much the government spends and how much it collects from businesses and households   trump said that he was not worried that his plan to cut taxes will result in a sea of red ink  because we will do trade deals that are going to make up for a tremendous amount of the deficits    economists  however  say any connection is circuitous  felt through channels like an increase in tax payments from new job holders or stronger corporate profits   but hard to estimate and likely small  even if trump achieved his wildest success  and eliminated the united states    billion trade deficit solely through increased exports that boosted gross domestic product on a dollar for dollar basis  it would do little to dent the estimated   trillion in government deficits his tax plan is projected to generate over the next decade   alan cole  an economist at the tax foundation  said that every dollar of gross domestic product generates about   cents in federal government revenue  meaning the   billion trade shortfall would translate into just   billion in new taxes   even that  he said  is wildly generous   you have to say where is the new production coming from  which people  which places   cole said   will it be new factories being built  and if so why haven t they been built already
