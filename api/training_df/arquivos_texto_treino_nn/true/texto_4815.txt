washington  reuters    fbi director james comey on monday confirmed for the first time that the bureau is investigating possible ties between republican donald trump s presidential campaign and russia as moscow sought to influence the  u s  election  comey and admiral mike rogers  the director of the national security agency  made clear that their investigation of moscow and november s u s  elections could last for months  appearing before a congressional panel  comey also publicly challenged trump s claim that former president barack obama wiretapped his  campaign headquarters in manhattan s trump tower  the two officials spent    hours before the house of representatives intelligence committee in testimony marked by starkly partisan divides between the panel s majority republicans and democrats  comey refused to back away from his claim that russian president vladimir putin did not simply want democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton to lose the election  he wanted donald trump to win  trump created a controversy in early march when he tweeted without giving evidence that obama had wiretapped his campaign while the businessman competed against clinton   with respect to the president s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration  i have no information that supports those tweets   comey said  leon panetta  a former u s  defense secretary and cia director during the obama administration  said in an interview that trump should  acknowledge that he made a mistake  apologize to president obama   the committee is one of several in the u s  congress  investigating whether russia tried to influence the election  mostly by hacking democratic operatives  emails and releasing embarrassing information  russia denies the allegations   comey confirmed the fbi has been investigating since july possible russian efforts to interfere in the election  including any cooperation between trump s campaign and moscow  he said that while the russian government wanted to hurt clinton s campaign and help trump s  intelligence agencies made no judgment on whether the efforts influenced the outcome  comey gave no details of the classified investigation and said the fact that it exists does not mean charges would be filed  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that russia tried to help trump by hacking leading democrats   i think that was a fairly easy judgment for the  intelligence  community   he said   putin hated secretary clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much           asked about comey  white house spokesman sean spicer read a series of quotes from officials   some from the obama administration   who have said they have seen no signs of collusion between trump s campaign and russia  in a tweet before the hearing  trump wrote   the democrats made up and pushed the russian story as an excuse for running a      terrible campaign   spicer said he was unaware of any white house official being under investigation by the fbi  trump has frequently urged better relations with russia  which has been at odds with the united states over ukraine and the syrian civil war   representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the intelligence committee  detailed activities by trump associates with ties to russia  including former campaign manager paul manafort and michael flynn  who was forced out as trump s national security adviser after talking to the russian ambassador and then misrepresenting the conversation to vice president mike pence    is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence  yes  it is possible   schiff said   but it is also possible  maybe more than possible  that they are not coincidental  not disconnected and not unrelated   trump s march  tweet about wiretapping pulled attention away from the claims of russian election interference  he issued his tweet two days after attorney general jeff sessions  who met with russia s u s  ambassador at least twice last year  said he would recuse himself from any investigation of the matter  the white house has contended in recent days that trump s claim of wiretapping referred to general surveillance of the campaign  the white house has not provided evidence of surveillance of any kind   let me be clear  we know there was not a physical wiretap on trump tower  however  it s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against president trump and his associates   said representative devin nunes  the committee s republican chairman  last week  trump s spokesman cited a media report that british intelligence was behind the surveillance  prompting ridicule in london  rogers said the allegation had strained relations with london   i think it clearly frustrates a key ally of ours   rogers said  comey warned that russia would attempt to influence the next u s  presidential election in  and perhaps congressional elections next year    they ll be back in   they may be back in   and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process   he said  clinton s fellow democrats feel comey played an inappropriate role in the  presidential contest by issuing a statement shortly before election day reviving an investigation of clinton s use of a private email server  then  just two days before the election  comey announced the fbi was sticking by a decision made months earlier that no criminal charges were warranted
