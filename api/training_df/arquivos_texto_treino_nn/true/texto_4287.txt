washington moscow  reuters    president donald trump s administration accused russia on tuesday of trying to shield syria s government from blame for a deadly gas attack  as secretary of state rex tillerson brought a western message to moscow condemning its support for president bashar al assad  trump  who has faced criticism for lacking a broader strategy to deal with the syria crisis  insisted he has no plans to  go into  the war torn country  senior white house officials  briefing reporters on condition of anonymity  said assad s government carried out the april  sarin nerve gas attack on civilians in syria s idlib province that killed  people  including many children  to put pressure on rebels making advances in the area  russia has defended the syrian leader against u s  allegations that his forces carried out the attack  saying there was no evidence  russia has blamed syrian rebels    commentary  why assad used chemical weapons  reut rs    commentary  the worrying lessons of the syria chemical attack reut rs   it s clear that the russians are trying to cover up what happened there   one white house official said  white house spokesman sean spicer later told reporters that the facts backed up the u s  version of events   russia is on an island when it comes to its support of syria or its lack of  frankly  acknowledgment of what happened   he told reporters  however  at the same briefing  spicer drew criticism after he sought to underscore the ghastliness of the gas attack by saying   you had someone as despicable as hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons   nazi germany used gas chambers to kill millions of jews during the holocaust  spicer later apologized and said he should not have made the comparison   it was a mistake  i shouldn t have done it and i won t do it again   spicer told cnn in an interview   it was inappropriate and insensitive   the white house officials said russia has frequently offered multiple  conflicting accounts of syrian government aggression including the incident in the village of khan sheikhoun to sow doubt within the international community  the united states launched  cruise missiles at a syrian airfield on thursday to retaliate after the attack  the strikes thrust trump  who came to power in january calling for warmer ties with russia  and his administration into confrontation with moscow  chinese president xi jinping told trump in a telephone call on wednesday that  any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable  and urged a political solution for syria  chinese state broadcaster cctv said of the telephone exchange    we  must persevere with moving towards a political solution for the syria issue  it is very important that the united nations security council maintains unity on the syria issue   i  hope the security council can speak with a single voice   cctv cited xi as saying     trump s ambassador to the united nations  nikki haley  said on tuesday she thought russia knew about the chemical attack in advance   they didn t look shocked  they didn t look surprised  they were so quick to defend  and then the evidence comes out  and we see exactly what it is and we know exactly what the environment was  then you realize   she said on cnn  u s  intelligence indicates that the chemical agent in the attack was delivered by syrian su  aircraft that took off from the shayrat airfield  according to a white house report given to reporters  in a four page document  the white house sought to rebut many of moscow s claims about the circumstances of the attack  it said the syrian planes were in the vicinity of khan sheikhoun about  minutes before the attack and left shortly afterward   additionally  our information indicates personnel historically associated with syria s chemical weapons program were at shayrat airfield in late march making preparations for an upcoming attack in northern syria  and they were present at the airfield on the day of the attack   the report said  washington wants russia to stop supporting assad  who has been fighting a six year long civil war against mostly sunni muslim rebels  also with the backing of shi ite muslim iran  tillerson carried a message from world powers to moscow denouncing russian support for assad  as the trump administration took on america s traditional mantle as leader of a unified west  tillerson earlier met foreign ministers from the group of seven advanced economies and middle eastern allies in italy  they endorsed a joint call for russia to abandon assad           it is clear to us the reign of the assad family is coming to an end   tillerson told reporters in italy   we hope that the russian government concludes that they have aligned themselves with an unreliable partner in bashar al assad   he said russia had failed in its role as sponsor of a  deal in which assad promised to give up chemical weapons  russia says the chemicals that killed civilians last week belonged to rebels  not assad s government  and accused the united states of an illegal aggression on a false pretext   russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday he believed washington planned more missile strikes  and that rebels were planning to stage chemical weapons attacks to provoke them    we have information that a similar provocation is being prepared     in other parts of syria including in the southern damascus suburbs where they are planning to again plant some substance and accuse the syrian authorities of using  chemical weapons  putin said  trump denied further plans in syria   we re not going into syria   he said in an interview with the new york post   our policy is the same  it hasn t changed  we re not going into syria   a senior trump administration official called putin s remarks part of a russian  disinformation campaign   the united states  britain and france have proposed a revised draft resolution to the  member u n  security council similar to a text they circulated last week pushing syria s government to cooperate with investigators      the secretary of state s role as messenger for a united  position is a turning point for trump  who in the past alarmed allies by voicing skepticism about the value of u s  support for traditional friends  while calling for closer ties with moscow  tillerson is a former chairman of oil company exxon mobil corp  which has gigantic projects in russia  putin awarded him russia s  order of friendship  in   he is due to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on wednesday  the kremlin has said tillerson has no meeting scheduled with putin this trip  although some russian media have reported such a meeting could take place   western countries have been calling for assad s departure since   the start of a civil war that has killed at least   people and created the world s worst refugee crisis  assad s position on the battlefield became far stronger after russia joined the war to support him in   the united states and its allies are conducting air strikes in syria against islamic state  but until last week washington had avoided targeting forces of assad s government directly  u s  defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday the united states  military policy in syria had not changed and remains focused on defeating islamic state
