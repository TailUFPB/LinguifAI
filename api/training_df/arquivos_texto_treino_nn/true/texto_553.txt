katy  texas  reuters    as democrats try to win control of the u s  congress in next year s midterm elections  their hopes of picking up a senate seat in republican dominated texas rest with a telegenic ex punk rocker who wants to impeach president donald trump and legalize marijuana  beto o rourke s long shot bid to unseat incumbent republican senator ted cruz illustrates the tightrope democrats must walk as they gear up for the november  elections  democrats will have to win in areas that backed trump last year in order to gain control of the house of representatives and the senate but even in texas the party s left wing base is pressing candidates to stop the president by any means necessary  o rourke  who currently represents el paso in the house  is drawing big crowds across texas as he calls for universal healthcare and new restrictions on gun ownership  at a recent rally outside houston  hundreds of supporters stood in line for up to an hour to shake his hand  o rourke    said trump s surprise victory last year was a big reason he decided to run for the senate  he said trump s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style have led him to support impeachment   i m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that donald trump is unfit for that office   o rourke told reuters in an interview   this is a moment unlike any other  certainly in my lifetime  i think in this country since the civil war  where we have to really decide who we are  and there are two very clear paths that we can take   he said  the end of the path laid out by trump  is tyranny  it is not democracy   o rourke said  o rourke s unapologetic progressivism stands out among democrats who are campaigning outside the party s liberal strongholds in the northeast and on west coast  in deeply conservative alabama  democratic senate candidate doug jones has been running as a pragmatist ahead of a dec   special election  saying he wants to be a  voice for reason  in washington  he has run ads attacking republican opponent roy moore over a sex scandal  but has steered clear of harsh anti trump rhetoric   in virginia  ralph northam denounced trump as a  narcissistic maniac  as he sought the democratic nomination for governor  but dialed back the rhetoric during the general election  telling voters ahead of his nov   victory that he would work with trump when it was in his state s interest  in congress  a handful of rank and file house democrats have filed articles of impeachment even though u s  special counsel robert mueller is still investigating whether trump s campaign worked with russia in last year s election  russia has repeatedly denied meddling and trump has called the investigation a  witch hunt   democratic house leader nancy pelosi said earlier this month that she would not make impeachment a priority if her party won the house next year but democratic senate leader chuck schumer has said it is premature to consider impeachment  even some of o rourke s supporters say impeachment talk is counterproductive as long as republicans control congress   otherwise  in my view  it s just chest beating   said nikki redpath  a houston area homemaker and o rourke campaign volunteer  o rourke is seen as the favorite to win the democratic nomination in march but analysts say his progressive views could prove a liability as he tries to reverse his party s long losing streak in the lone star state  trump finished nine percentage points ahead of democrat hillary clinton in texas last year and the state has not elected a democratic governor or senator since   democrats have lost recent statewide elections by double digit margins and have struggled to recruit top tier candidates for major races  still  o rourke s anti trump message has resonated with oil industry executive katherine stovring  who said she used to vote for candidates from both parties but now has been motivated to work for democratic candidates as a way to stop trump    i m looking for ways to engage  this is our democracy at risk   she said  texas republican strategist matt mackowiak said he thought o rourke would be trounced by cruz unless voters turn en masse against trump nationally   he s a more interesting candidate than the traditional sacrificial lamb the democrats put up   mackowiak said   but he s far too liberal to be elected statewide   in an era where differences between republicans and democrats are stark  candidates like o rourke have little incentive to moderate their positions  said james henson  director of the texas politics project at the university of texas  at this point there is little downside for o rourke to make polarizing statements on impeachment and other issues       i think you can expect to hear a lot more of that as the campaign unfolds   he said
