seattle  reuters    seattle s city council unanimously passed a pioneering income tax on the city s highest earners on monday  a measure that has become a clarion call for democrats there even though it is likely to face a swift legal challenge over violating state law  the measure created a   percent tax rate on individuals earning above    and married couples jointly earning above     the tax will add roughly   million in new annual revenue and affect fewer than   residents in the city of more than    supporters say  the proposal has become a rallying cry for democrats and activists in the liberal leaning city who used local opposition to republican president donald trump to advance long sought after local policies  washington is one of seven u s  states without a tax on personal income  and no city in the state has an income tax  supporters of the seattle proposal  including mayor ed murray  say the current tax code unfairly burdens poor and middle class residents because it relies on  regressive  taxes  such as taxes on property and sales transactions  proponents say new revenue is needed to offset any potential drop in federal funding under the trump administration   our goal is to replace our regressive tax system with a new formula for fairness  while ensuring seattle stands up to president trump s austere budget that cuts transportation  affordable housing  healthcare  and social services   murray said by e mail after the city council s   vote  earlier on monday  murray told a cheering crowd at a rally outside city hall he would sign the measure into law on friday and welcomed a legal challenge  the campaign for the new tax on seattle s richest was launched earlier this year by trump proof seattle  a coalition of community activists and residents  proceeds from the tax could be used to pay for transit services and affordable housing  murray said  the city has been grappling with soaring housing prices in recent years  fueled in part by the growth of online retailer amazon com  which is headquartered in downtown seattle  voters in olympia  the state capital  rejected a similar tax on its highest earners last year  in   washington state voters rejected a state income tax at the ballot box  jason mercier  a director at the conservative washington policy center  said seattle s tax conflicts with state law and court decisions  he said he expects the city to face a swift legal challenge after murray signs the measure into law   there s something fundamentally wrong with elected officials passing a tax they know is against state law and the constitution with the hope of being sued and having a judge overturn prior decisions   mercier said   state law blocks a county or city from levying a tax on  net  income  although net income is not defined in the statute  the washington state supreme court has found that income is treated as property under the constitution and therefore has to be taxed uniformly and at no more than  percent of its value  mercier said
