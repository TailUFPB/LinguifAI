washington  reuters    the head of the u s  environmental protection agency issued a directive to his agency on monday seeking to end the practice of settling lawsuits with environmental groups behind closed doors  saying the groups have had too much influence on regulation  epa administrator scott pruitt  who sued the agency he now runs more than a dozen times in his former job as attorney general of oil producing oklahoma  has long railed against the so called practice of  sue and settle   the epa under former president barack obama quietly settled lawsuits from environmental groups with little input from regulated entities  such as power plants  and state governments  he argues   the directive seeks to make epa more transparent about lawsuits by reaching out to states and industry that could be affected by settlements  forbidding the practice of entering into settlements that exceed the authority of courts  and excluding attorney s fees and litigation costs when settling with groups   most lawsuits by green groups on the agency seek to push the agency to speed up regulation on issues such as climate and air and water pollution  studies have shown    the days of regulation through litigation are over   pruitt said   we will no longer go behind closed doors and use consent decrees and settlement agreements to resolve lawsuits filed against the agency   pruitt s order was supported by conservative groups  daren bakst  a research fellow in agricultural policy at the heritage foundation think tank  said sue and settle has led to  egregious antics  that have  effectively handed over the setting of agency priorities to environmental pressure groups   and has led to rushed rulemaking by the agency     but pat parenteau  an environmental law professor at the vermont law school  said pruitt s directive would be  counterproductive  and costly because in the end courts could fine the agency if it does not meet compliance dates for issuing regulations   he can fight it if he wants as long as he wants  and spend as much money as he wants   parenteau said   but in the end if you ve missed a statutory deadline  you are going to be ordered  by a court  to comply and then you are going to be ordered to pay fees
