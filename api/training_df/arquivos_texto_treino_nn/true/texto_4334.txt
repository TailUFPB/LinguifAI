palm beach  fla   reuters    president donald trump pressed chinese president xi jinping to do more to curb north korea s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping u s  trade deficit with beijing in talks on friday  even as he toned down the strident anti china rhetoric of his election campaign  trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first u s  china summit   as did several of his top aides   but they provided few concrete specifics other than china s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation  as the two leaders wrapped up a florida summit overshadowed by u s  missile strikes in syria overnight  xi joined trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world s two biggest economies  trump s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about china s trade practices and said there was some headway  with xi agreeing to a  day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting u s  exports and reducing china s trade surplus with the united states  speaking after the two day summit at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson also said that xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in north korea s missile and nuclear programs   though he did not offer any new formula for cracking pyongyang s defiant attitude   trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of american jobs by china  many blue collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on nov   and trump is under pressure to deliver for them  the republican president tweeted last week that the united states could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with xi  will be a very difficult one    on friday  the unpredictable trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader   we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with china   trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large u s  and chinese flags   we will be making additional progress  the relationship developed by president xi and myself i think is outstanding   and i believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away   he added  without providing details  xi also spoke in mostly positive terms   we have engaged in deeper understanding  and have built a trust   he said   i believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations     for the peace and stability of the world  we will also fulfill our historical responsibility    well  i agree with you  percent   trump replied  china s official xinhua news agency said xi had encouraged the united states to take part in the  one belt  one road  plan  xi s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across asia  africa and europe  seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to asia strategy of trump s predecessor barack obama  xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said china and the united states should  make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries  joint staffs of the armed forces   although xinhua did not give further details  chinese state media on saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of u s  china relations  but in a sign that rough spots remained  tillerson afterwards described the discussions as  very frank and candid    president trump and president xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect   he said  after the meeting  trump took xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish spanish style complex  trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to xi  who did the same  tillerson said trump had accepted xi s invitation to visit china and that they also agreed to upgrade a u s  china dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said the chinese had expressed an interest in reducing china s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation   that s the first time i ve heard them say that in a bilateral context   he said  ross declined to say whether the united states was ready to designate china a currency manipulator  however  referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed  although trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label china a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration  he has refrained from doing so   the highly anticipated u s  china summit was upstaged by u s  missile strikes overnight against a syrian air base from which trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week  it was the first direct u s  assault on the russian backed government of syrian president bashar al assad in six years of civil war   the swift action in syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear armed north korea   and by extension  its ally china   as well as other countries like iran and russia of trump s willingness to use military force  north korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the united states  tillerson said xi agreed with trump that north korea s nuclear advances had reached a  very serious stage   he said trump also raised u s concerns about china s activities in the south china sea  beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of expansive territorial claims in the strategic waterway
