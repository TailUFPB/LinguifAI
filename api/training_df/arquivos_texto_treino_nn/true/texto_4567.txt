washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump lashed out on thursday at republican conservatives who helped torpedo healthcare legislation he backed  escalating a feud within his party that jeopardizes the new administration s legislative agenda  trump threatened to try to defeat members of the freedom caucus   a bloc of conservative republicans in the house of representatives    in next year s congressional elections if they continued to defy him   the freedom caucus will hurt the entire republican agenda if they don t get on the team    fast  we must fight them    dems  in    trump wrote on twitter on thursday morning  he later singled out three freedom caucus members by name  u s  representatives mark meadows  jim jordan and raul labrador   if  repmarkmeadows   jimjordan and  raullabrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts   reform   he said in one tweet   where are  repmarkmeadows   jimjordan and  raullabrador   repealandreplace  obamacare   he asked in another  house conservatives fought back  labrador  one of the founders of the freedom caucus  urged trump in a tweet to  remember who your real friends are  we re trying to help you succeed    most people don t take well to being bullied   said representative justin amash  who compared trump s approach to what a child does when he wants to  get his way   trump s deteriorating relationship with republican house conservatives could make it harder for him to pass his legislative agenda  which includes rewriting the u s  tax code  revisiting a healthcare overhaul and funding construction of a wall along the u s  mexican border  trump  a new york businessman who touted his skills as a dealmaker in his bid for the white house  has repeatedly criticized freedom caucus members  blaming them for the defeat of legislation to repeal and replace former president barack obama s signature healthcare law   freedom caucus members said the bill did not go far enough to dismantle the  affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  asked during a briefing whether trump s tweet about the freedom caucus was a  divide and conquer  strategy  white house spokesman sean spicer said   no  it s a math strategy  which is to get to    the number of votes currently needed to pass house legislation  the discord following the healthcare debacle was not limited to tensions between trump and the freedom caucus  in recent days  the president has been out of sync with the two highest ranking republicans in congress  house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  trump and his aides have suggested reviving the push for a healthcare bill  while ryan expressed openness to the idea  mcconnell said he thought doing so would be futile  but ryan publicly disagreed with trump when the president offered to work with democrats on new healthcare legislation   i don t want that to happen   the speaker told cbs in an interview aired on thursday  more than healthcare legislation was at stake  republican lawmakers still await key details on what trump s priorities are in the monumental tax reform effort they want to launch  passing a budget for next year could also prove challenging  trump and the freedom caucus want to dramatically shrink domestic programs  moderate republicans are aghast at proposals to cut popular programs that fund environmental cleanup and meals for senior citizens  most pressing is an april  deadline for approving new funding to keep the government running   the gop  republican  house is riven by factions that are quite ideological  trump is not   said university of virginia political science professor larry sabato   and let s throw in the fact that trump is unpopular and weak and has no democratic support in congress   add all this up  neither trump nor congressional republicans are in an ideal position to govern  and that s an understatement   sabato said  there are about three dozen members of the house freedom caucus  comprising about  percent of the  house republicans  but their clout is larger  as trump and ryan cannot afford to lose too many house republicans if they want to try to pass bills  like the obamacare repeal  that attract zero democratic support  dan meyer  a legislative affairs chief to former republican president george w  bush  said that with the freedom caucus threatening trump s agenda  the white house either had to find a way to work with the conservatives  or tack to the left  some republicans were so furious they were publicly saying things usually reserved for closed door meetings  representative chris collins  a trump ally and part of the  tuesday group  of moderate republicans  told reporters his group was so angry with the freedom caucus that it would  never  meet with it  he accused its members of trying to shift blame for the healthcare failure to moderates  senate republicans expressed alarm and urged efforts at consensus  senator john mccain  who ran for president in  and was defeated by obama  said that if he were sitting in the white house  he would try to ease intraparty tensions rather than stoking them    but that s the president   said mccain who sometimes is at odds with trump  he added this advice to trump   sit down with them and say this is an emergency situation   senator cory gardner  a republican who served in the house from  to   said his former colleagues needed to quit arguing and come to a consensus  sooner rather than later   a senior house republican aide distanced ryan from trump s strategy of upbraiding conservatives   ryan     is never going to intentionally alienate a large swath of his caucus   said the aide  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  publicly  ryan said he understood trump s frustration   the speaker also said he was encouraging republican lawmakers  to keep talking to one another   republican senator bob corker chided ryan  however  for his views about courting democrats on healthcare reform   we have come a long way in our country when the speaker of one party urges a president not to work with the other party to solve a problem   corker wrote on twitter
