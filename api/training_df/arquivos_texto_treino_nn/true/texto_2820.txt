washington  reuters    republicans lawmakers on tuesday started trying to kill a brand new u s  rule prohibiting banks and credit card companies from requiring customers who open new accounts to sign an agreement that they will not join a group lawsuit in the event of a dispute  the consumer financial protection bureau on monday finalized the new rule banning  mandatory arbitration clauses  requiring consumers to forego class action suits and instead settle disputes in negotiations overseen by arbitrators frequently hired by companies  the rule immediately ran into fierce opposition by wall street and republicans who control both congress and the white house  they have long criticized the consumer agency  which is run by a democrat  richard cordray  senator tom cotton  a member of the banking committee  has already announced he is drafting a resolution to kill the rule  his fellow republican senator pat toomey  chair of the subcommittee on financial institutions and consumer protection  said he is considering a similar step   republican lawmakers plan to eliminate the rule  using a law that allows congress to undo new regulations with simple majority votes in both chambers and a signature from the president  analysts and consumer advocates have said the agency s rule may survive the congressional challenge  still  the u s  chamber of commerce is contemplating a legal challenge and trump administration officials are also looking at ways to kill the rule  isaac boltansky  a policy analyst for the investment firm compass point research   trading  said the rule has a slightly better than  percent chance of surviving in congress  joe valenti  who tracks the issue for the liberal leaning center for american progress  said the house of representatives was unified against the rule  which opponents have argued benefits class action lawyers  not consumers   it comes down to the senate   said valenti  noting that the rule would survive if only three republicans in that chamber switched sides  that is possible  said ed mierzwinksi  the consumer program director for the u s  public interest research groups  he noted that senate republicans have struggled to gather enough votes for majorities and the calendar is swollen with pressing legislation and confirmation hearings  in addition  mierzwinksi said  senators may be leery of appearing to side with wall street against consumers  he noted that wells fargo   co used clauses in its account opening agreements to block customers from suing over its phantom account scandal  supporters of the rule say mandatory arbitration denies citizens their day in court and is rigged in favor of big firms  they say litigants banding together in a class action lawsuit have a better chance of getting companies to answer publicly for illegal activities and that fears of such a suit can discourage law breaking  the consumer protection agency wrote the rule after conducting a lengthy  multi year study of the issue  opponents of the rule say the study is flawed and that arbitration is cheaper and faster than class action lawsuits and produces better awards for consumers  the chamber is exploring a prompt legal challenge to the rule  said matt webb  senior vice president for its legal reform institute  another possible challenge could come from the acting comptroller of the currency  keith noreika  he is laying groundwork to invoke an untested provision of the  dodd frank financial reform law that allows the council of the country s top financial regulators to nullify a consumer agency rule if they decide it threatens the safety and soundness of the banking system  rohit chopra  senior fellow at the consumer federation of america and former cfpb assistant director  said a lawsuit will probably fail because the law says the agency can restrict arbitration as long as it hews to its study   he said the dodd frank provision that the comptroller s office is looking at was meant to keep risks to the financial system at bay    to suggest that this rule would cause a financial crisis is ridiculous on its face   he said
