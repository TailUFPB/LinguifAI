moscow  reuters    russia and the united states agreed to set up a working group to try to mend their battered ties on wednesday after u s  secretary of state rex tillerson held lengthy talks in moscow with president vladimir putin and the russian foreign minister  it was not clear until the last minute whether putin would grant tillerson an audience  but the fact that he did is likely to be seen as a sign that moscow has not given up on the new u s  administration and wants to try to improve ties which both sides agree are languishing at a post cold war low  a joint news conference between sergei lavrov  the russian foreign minister  and tillerson showed how much work there is to do though as the russian used many of his speaking opportunities to lambast washington over its actions in syria and what he said was its unhelpful foreign interference in the past  tillerson  on his first visit to russia in his current role  struck a more conciliatory stance  but said ties and trust levels were at a low point and restated washington s position that syrian president bashar al assad must eventually relinquish power  a position starkly at odds with russia   there is a low level of trust between our two countries   tillerson said   the world s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship   lavrov said that while russia was not placing its hopes in assad or any other individual in syria  toppling the syrian government was not an option and that a political process had to be allowed to play out    we discussed assad today   said lavrov   i don t remember any positive examples of how a dictator was overthrown and everything was just fine afterwards   differences over a u s  missile strike on a syrian air base last week also bubbled to the surface   washington says it acted to punish the syrian government for what it said was a devastating nerve gas attack damascus launched against its own people that killed scores  russia said the u s  strike was illegal though and lavrov repeated moscow s stance on wednesday  saying an international investigation should be left to determine who was to blame and what happened   it was wrong to blame assad without knowing the facts  he said   tillerson said the united states was confident that assad s forces were behind the gas attack  but said there was  no firm information  to indicate russian forces were involved in the same attack  in a move that slightly softened the atmosphere  lavrov said putin had agreed to restore a u s  russia air safety agreement covering syria which moscow suspended in retaliation for the u s  missile strikes  the agreement would be reactivated with immediate effect  viktor ozerov  the head of the russian upper house of parliament s defense committee told the ria news agency
