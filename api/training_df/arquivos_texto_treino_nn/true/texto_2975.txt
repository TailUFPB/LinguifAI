washington  reuters    the u s  senate banking committee s top two lawmakers unveiled a bipartisan piece of legislation on wednesday designed to prevent a prolonged vacancy on the federal body that determines how large insurance companies are regulated  the proposed legislation by senate banking chairman mike crapo and ranking member sherrod brown would permit roy woodall  the independent insurance expert on the financial stability oversight council  fsoc   to remain in his job until a replacement can be nominated and confirmed  or for an additional  months  the fsoc is a panel of regulators with the power to dub large financial firms  including insurers  as systemic  a tag that carries additional oversight by the federal reserve   the panel has designated a number of insurers  including prudential financial inc  american international group inc and metlife   metlife fought the designation in court and won   the other two still carry the designation  though prudential is widely expected to seek to have it rescinded  a two thirds majority vote of fsoc s sitting members is needed to rescind a designation  woodall  who previously voted against designating metlife and prudential  is the only person on the panel with insurance expertise  but his six year term expires in september   as there is no federal insurance regulator  woodall is effectively the most important figure in u s  regulation of large insurers  the fsoc is composed of heads of federal financial regulators and led by u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin  all of the fsoc s other members are allowed to continue serving in their roles on expired terms  or be temporarily replaced with an acting member if there is a vacancy   but due to a quirk in the dodd frank law  woodall cannot be held over or temporarily replaced after his term expires   a problem that could leave a gap on the fsoc  wednesday s proposed bill will provide  much needed clarity regarding the independent insurance member s term   crapo said   brown added that the fix represents a  commonsense  bipartisan measure  it is also backed by a large list of other republicans and democrats on the panel    a sign it will likely win broad support by lawmakers in congress
