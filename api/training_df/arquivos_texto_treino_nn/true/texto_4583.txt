 reuters    the chairman of the u s  senate banking committee said on thursday he wants to pass a major piece of bank reform legislation by early next year at the latest  senator mike crapo  a republican  intends to go beyond rewriting the  dodd frank financial reform legislation and craft a bipartisan bill that advances economic growth and capital formation  he told attendees at a chamber of commerce event focused on capital markets   my hope is     that is either late this year or early next year  i m not looking further than that   crapo said  crapo s agenda is being intensely watched on wall street  as his committee is widely seen as playing a critical role in crafting any rewrite of dodd frank   that  law was enacted after the financial crisis  and the industry is eager to see if republicans now in charge of the white house and congress can significantly relax its requirements  some of the dodd frank provisions that are most contentious prohibit banks from some higher risk investments and require higher capital requirements of the biggest banks   a bill that attacks dodd frank directly is set to be introduced in the house of representatives soon by jeb hensarling  the texas republican who chairs the financial services committee  but that bill is seen as a tough republican approach that may not garner enough support in the senate to be passed  crapo said meaningful reforms would require a bipartisan approach  and he is working closely with sherrod brown  the top democrat on the committee  to find areas of common ground  he also said he wants to go beyond simply revisiting dodd frank s provisions and look more broadly at all rules and policies that impact economic growth  an approach he said might encourage democrats to vote with him  he said he expects congress to address financial regulatory reform after it finishes work on a tax reform bill   crapo did concede that the current political environment is tough for passing controversial legislation in the senate  and others in his party said they intend to push some of their favored dodd frank revisions through a budget process that would not require much democratic support
