war could break out an any time  and said the north s next nuclear test would take place  at a time and at a place where our headquarters deems necessary   north korea s vice foreign minister han song ryol told the bbc that missiles would be tested on  a weekly  monthly and yearly basis    the north has warned of a nuclear strike against the united states if provoked  it has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland united states  but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology  including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead  pence said on monday the world had seen trump s resolve in the past two weeks  with a u s  missile attack on a syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non nuclear bomb on islamic state fighters in afghanistan  the trump administration has said military action remains an option for dealing with north korea  but  mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in south korea and japan  u s  officials say trump s main focus is on tougher economic sanctions  u s  officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo  a global ban on north korea s airline

diplomatic means to resolve this  as this is their first choice   he told reporters in beijing   of course i think that any country will feel that political diplomatic means are of course the first choice   wang said   pence s economic discussions in tokyo will be closely watched to see how hard a line washington is prepared to take on trade  trump campaigned on an  america first  platform  and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations such as china and japan  however  trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues  saying he would cut a better trade deal with china
