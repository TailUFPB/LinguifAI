san juan  puerto rico  reuters    puerto ricans still living largely in darkness  days after hurricane maria leveled their island reveled in small victories on sunday in what promises to be a months long slog back to some semblance of normal life   some islanders got their cell phone service back on sunday  others gathered at bars for drinking and dancing after the dry law was lifted this weekend    everyone is talking about maria   said julianna melendez    while out at a bar in guaynabo  near the capital san juan   a lot of people lost their homes  and they are still living in them  we need help   food and drinking water are still in short supply and power is down for most of the u s  territory s   million people nearly two weeks after the fiercest hurricane to hit the island in  years   u s  lawmakers urged president donald trump on sunday to stop sniping at puerto ricans and get to work helping them recover  two days before he was to visit the island  the republican president said his government was doing a  great job  to help puerto rico recover and took a new swipe at critics who said he had been slow to aid the island   we have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in puerto rico  outside of the fake news or politically motivated ingrates   he said in a twitter post   trump faces difficult weeks  if not months  in managing the u s  territory  his senior general leading military relief operations in puerto rico  lieutenant general jeff buchanan  said they were clearing roads and getting more supplies to people  but recognized  it s still a long haul   trump has intensified his praise of the federal response after the mayor of san juan made clear those efforts fell short and american media continued to broadcast images of the havoc and suffering on the island that belied his words  at the same time  he criticized san juan mayor carmen yulin cruz on saturday and said puerto ricans wanted  everything to be done for them    senate democratic leader chuck schumer told cbs   face the nation  the relief effort so far has been  slow footed  disorganized and not adequate    the president  instead of tweeting against the mayor of san juan who s watching her people die and just made a plea for help  ought to roll up his sleeves and get to work here   he said  u s  senator marco rubio  a republican  urged an end to the political fingerpointing   every minute we spend in the political realm bickering with one another over who s doing what  or who s wrong  or who didn t do right is a minute of energy and time that we re not spending trying to get the response right   rubio told cbs  trump launched his attack on san juan s mayor during a weekend stay at his golf resort in new jersey  where he was attending the president s cup tournament on sunday  he dedicated the cup trophy to victims of maria and this summer s previous major hurricanes irma and harvey   all of those people that went through so much  that we love    referring to puerto rico  trump said  we have it under really great control    maria pummeled puerto rico on sept   as a very powerful category  hurricane on the heels of irma  with roof ripping winds and torrential rains that caused widespread flooding and heavily damaged homes  roads and other infrastructure  about half of the island s people do not have access to drinking water  and  percent remain without power  according to the pentagon  nearly  percent of cell phone towers are out of service  according to the federal communications commission   impassable roads have made it hard for the federal emergency management agency and others to distribute food  water and fuel  guaynabo mayor angel perez said the situation is improving  albeit slowly  city employees are working  hour shifts  going door to door throughout the suburb of more than    taking a census on whether residents need water  ice  clothing or other basic necessities   fema is telling me i ll be getting some money in advance instead of reimbursement  so that s really going to help   p√©rez said  adding that damages to municipal buildings alone will top   million in guaynabo  carmen miranda    of luquillo  is among those who has faced long lines for gasoline  medicine and supplies  she spent  hours one day trying to buy fuel at a station that ran dry and was in line on saturday at a store that ran out of diesel   i m going to have to come back another day   she said   it s just horrible  those lines  that needs to be resolved immediately  president trump  anyone  help us   she said  at a briefing in san juan  puerto rico governor ricardo rossello reported that fuel and food supplies had begun to arrive in puerto rico   we still need to do much more   he said  rossello remains in good standing with trump  earning plaudits in the president s tweets  while cruz came under sustained fire from other washington officials   fema director brock long admonished her for not being in closer contact with relief coordinators  trump s budget director  mick mulvaney  and treasury secretary steve mnuchin both said on sunday that cruz s criticism was unfair   cruz  who has been living in a shelter since her house was destroyed by maria  pressed on with her appeal for basic necessities as insurers and politicians began to tally the costs of the storm and the size of the aid package puerto rico will need   let us not talk about the debt  let us not talk about the cost of reconstruction  let us just talk about saving lives right now   cruz said on sunday on abc s  this week  program
