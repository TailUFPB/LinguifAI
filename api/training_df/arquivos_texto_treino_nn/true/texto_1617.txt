seoul tokyo  reuters    detonating a nuclear tipped missile over the pacific ocean would be a logical final step by north korea to prove the success of its weapons program but would be extremely provocative and carry huge risks  arms control experts said on friday  north korean foreign minister ri yong ho suggested leader kim jong un was considering testing  an unprecedented scale hydrogen bomb  over the pacific in response to u s  president donald trump s threat at the united nations to  totally destroy  the country   it may mean north korea will fire a warhead tipped  intermediate range  hwasong  or hwasong  intercontinental ballistic missile and blow it up a few hundred kilometers above the pacific ocean   said yang uk  a senior researcher at the korea defence and security forum in seoul    they may be bluffing  but there is a need for them to test their combined missile bomb capability  they could have already prepared the plan and are now trying to use trump s remarks as an excuse to make it happen   said yang  such an atmospheric test would be the first globally since china detonated a device in   according to the international  atomic energy agency   tests of nuclear tipped ballistic missiles are rarer still  the united states  only test of an operational ballistic missile with a live warhead was fired from submarine far out in the pacific ocean in   china was widely condemned for a similar test with a missile that exploded over its lop nur test site in the country s west in   north korea s six nuclear tests to date have all been underground  the most recent earlier this month by far its largest   we have to assume they  could  do it  but it is exceedingly provocative   said vipin narang  an associate professor of political science at  massachusetts institute of technology    to put a live nuclear warhead on a missile that s only been tested a handful of times  overflying potentially populated centers  if it   doesn t go exactly as planned    it could be a world changing event    north korea has fired two ballistic missiles over japan s north hokkaido region in the past month as part of a series of tests that experts say have illustrated unexpectedly rapid advances   they said pacific ocean  which pretty much means firing a missile over japan   said melissa hanham  a senior research associate at the u s  based middlebury institute of international studies at monterey  california   they want to shut us all up for doubting they could build it   while a missile would be the most ideal means of delivery  it is also possible to put a bomb on a ship and detonate on the surface of the ocean or in the sea  the experts said   either way  the radioactive fallout could be significant  as well as the diplomatic backlash from around the world  north korea s recent missile launches over japan especially drew stern rebukes from tokyo and the international community   japan s chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga called pyongyang s remarks and behavior  completely unacceptable   narang said a test high enough over the ocean would limit the radioactive fallout but risks included damage from an electro magnetic pulse  something pyongyang has hinted it might employ on an attack on the united states or its allies    if it doesn t go exactly as planned and the detonation occurs at a lower altitude we could see some emp like effects for anything in the area  a lot of dead fish too   pyongyang has launched dozens of missiles this year as it spurs a program aimed at mastering a nuclear tipped missile that can strike the united states  in addition to its sept  nuclear test   if kim s threat materializes  it will be a  tipping point  for china  and may prompt many other countries to demand an  end to the regime   said david albright  founder of the non profit institute for science and international security in washington    no one has tested above ground for decades and the radioactive fallout could be terrifying to many   albright said      other experts said such an atmospheric nuclear test is unlikely for now due to its substantial technical and diplomatic risks   joshua pollack  editor of the washington based nonproliferation review  said it would be an  end to end demo of everything    but i would be surprised if this were their very next move  they have yet to test an icbm at full range into the pacific   said pollack   that will probably come first
