greenbelt  md   reuters    a u s  judge on monday questioned attorneys defending the trump administration about a classified report the government is using to justify its latest ban on citizens of some countries from entering the united states  u s  district court judge theodore chuang in maryland heard arguments for and against president donald trump s new travel ban  set to take effect on wednesday  it indefinitely limits travel from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  certain government officials from venezuela were also barred  all those countries except chad  north korea and venezuela were included in two earlier temporary versions of the travel ban  which trump s opponents called thinly veiled attempts to fulfill his campaign pledge of a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   lawyers for advocacy groups including the international refugee assistance project  iranian alliances across borders and the council on american islamic relations urged chuang to block implementation of what critics call trump s  muslim ban   opponents say the ban violates the u s  constitution because it discriminates against muslims while overstepping the bounds of u s  immigration law by discriminating by nationality  trump has said the restrictions are needed to tighten security and prevent terrorist attacks  the third ban came in a sept   presidential proclamation that trump issued after acting homeland security secretary elaine duke provided him with a classified report recommending the travel restrictions  chuang asked hashim mooppan  the attorney representing the government  if there were inconsistencies between the homeland security report and trump s proclamation  mooppan declined to discuss details of the classified report  and said the government does not have to explain whether trump s advisers disagreed about the ban   we stand by the factual representations in the proclamation   mooppan said  on friday  in a separate case against the ban in hawaii  the government said the judge can review the classified report only in a secure setting  chuang struck down an earlier iteration of the ban  which was only partially restored by the u s  supreme court in june  an attorney from the american civil liberties union  omar jadwat  argued that the new version is a  a bigger  tougher version of the same ban  that trump originally wanted  trump could have achieved the same national security goals with  far more targeted measures  similar to the restrictions on venezuelan government officials  rather than broad bans against certain nationalities  argued justin cox  an attorney at the national immigration law center  mooppan argued that because the new version of the ban went in place after a thorough review  it does not constitute a  muslim ban   the third version of the ban omitted iraq  which was included in the first ban and sudan  which was in the second version   the proclamation dropped multiple muslim countries and exempted multiple types of non immigrant visas even from the muslim countries   he said   that is strong evidence that this is not some kind of muslim ban in disguise   chuang said he would rule later on whether to grant the challengers  request for an injunction
