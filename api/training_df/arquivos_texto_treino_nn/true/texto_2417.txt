washington  reuters    as fellow republicans labored to repeal obamacare this week  u s  president donald trump repeatedly swerved off topic  escalating concerns in his party about his ability to govern the country six months after taking office  while senators grappled with healthcare  trump banned transgender people from the military  he regaled a boy scout jamboree with a tale from a new york cocktail party  he indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director  in the end  the senate s efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on friday  magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around trump  the constant storm of tweets  the white house infighting  the self inflicted wounds   we re seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments   said republican strategist alice stewart  a top aide to senator ted cruz s presidential campaign last year  in the latest twist  trump late on friday named u s  homeland security secretary john kelly as his new white house chief of staff  replacing reince priebus  who has been in a feud with trump s new communications director anthony scaramucci  among some establishment republicans  there were signs that patience with trump was wearing thin  his national security team  seen as a bedrock of normality  increasingly is frustrated  national security adviser h r  mcmaster and secretary of state rex tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the white house  defense secretary james mattis was coming to grips with trump s abrupt decision on wednesday  via a tweet  to ban transgender individuals from military service  the pentagon  said it would not execute the order without more guidance  republican strategist charlie black said trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between russia and his  campaign run its course and not keep talking about it  russia denies meddling  and trump denies any collusion  the russia probe has fed public spats with attorney general jeff sessions  quarreling among aides and attacks on robert mueller  the special counsel running the investigation   he should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while   black said   there are still some good things that could get done in congress like tax reform  he can help further those things if that s what he talks about   in the senate healthcare fight  trump phoned republican senators and urged them to support repeal of obamacare  but the effort fizzled  a sign there was little political retribution to fear from a president with a sub  percent approval rating  a moderate house republican said trump let down the obamacare rollback effort by not going out and selling a plan  for trump  a businessman and former reality tv show host  the presidency is his first elected office   this issue was outsourced to congress  it was never really sold  i think that was part of the reason why it was a failure   said republican representative charlie dent  as the senate fight was coming to a head  washington was suddenly mesmerized by a profanity laced rant from scaramucci  who tore into priebus and trump strategist steve bannon in an interview in the new yorker magazine  stunned aides stopped what they were doing to read the article online  the rant has so far gone unpunished  inside the white house  there was a sense of genuine concern and bewilderment about what scaramucci s future might portend  former white house press secretary ari fleischer said the tensions did not seem to trouble trump   the president s management style seems to be to encourage factionalism among people below him  he seems to place value on watching people fight   fleischer said  aside from sacking priebus  it was unclear how trump planned to proceed to regain his footing  with healthcare stalled  trump has his sights set on tax reform with no consensus on how to proceed  top aides are split on how deeply to cut taxes  it is the same moderates versus conservatives split that doomed the obamacare rollback
