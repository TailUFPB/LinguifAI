washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump could find democratic support for a corporate tax reform package if a comprehensive tax code overhaul runs aground over republican infighting  a democratic lawmaker told reuters on friday  representative john yarmuth  top democrat on the house of representatives budget committee  predicted trump s promise to deliver the biggest tax reform since ronald reagan would have to be scaled back if the republican controlled senate fails next week to adopt legislation dismantling obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  the trump administration and republican congressional leaders are trying to agree in closed door talks on a comprehensive  tax reform bill that would cut taxes for individuals and businesses and overhaul the u s  tax code  their aim is to unveil legislation in september   but a republican effort to dismantle the affordable care act  which would could ease the path to tax reform  faces difficulties in the senate  where a healthcare measure is opposed by enough lawmakers to block passage  yarmuth  a kentucky democrat  said there are also few signs that house and senate republicans can unify their fractured caucuses to pass a fiscal  budget resolution  which they must do to enact tax reform without democratic votes   tax reform is going to be really difficult   yarmuth said   if they limited it to corporate tax reform  i think there s an opportunity to get it home and get it done on a bipartisan basis   trump wants to cut business tax rates to  percent  yarmuth said  a fair amount of democrats  agree that the current  percent corporate tax rate is too high and should be more competitive with other countries  a bipartisan package could lower the corporate tax rate to  percent or  percent and include measures to help small businesses  yarmuth said     republicans have thus far balked at the idea of a narrow corporate tax deal  on thursday  house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady said republicans would reject tax legislation that left the corporate rate at around  percent    but tax rate targets have eluded republican efforts to hammer out a deal  some lawmakers say a defeat for the senate healthcare bill would make tax reform harder by leaving in place hundreds of billions of dollars in obamacare taxes meanwhile  the house budget committee hopes to send a budget proposal to the floor next week that would include a procedural path for tax reform to proceed with only republican votes  panel members said  they warned that any republican deal within the committee did not ensure speedy passage in the republican led house  where conservative republicans want a budget that includes steep cuts to domestic spending  which more moderate republicans oppose  yarmuth said republicans  at one point  considered using language in a  budget proposal   known as reconciliation instructions   for both tax reform and healthcare  a move that could keep hopes for dismantling obamacare alive if the senate fails to pass a bill
