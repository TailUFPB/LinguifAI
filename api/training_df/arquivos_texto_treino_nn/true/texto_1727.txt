washington  reuters    republican efforts to unite the white house  senate and house of representatives behind a single tax reform plan appeared to be unraveling on thursday  when one of the  big six  negotiators said the group would not dictate tax policy in the senate     at the outset of a congressional hearing on tax reform  senator orrin hatch said the senate finance committee he chairs would not be a rubber stamp for the other congressional republican leaders and senior aides to president donald trump who make up the select group that has been working on a tax reform framework for months  the big six is preparing to release its framework on sept    a release that will sound the starting gun for hatch s panel and the house ways and means committee to produce tax reform legislation that is now expected in october  overhauling the u s  tax code is a top priority of trump and congressional republicans  who campaigned on it last year  they have made little progress since taking power in washington in january via a closed door process that has excluded democrats   the group   some have deemed us the big six   will not dictate the direction we take in this committee   hatch said   the finance committee will not be bound by any previous tax reform proposal or framework when we start putting our bill together   some analysts viewed the utah republican s comments as the beginning of what could be a widening rift among republicans in the senate  house and white house that could jeopardize hopes of completing the first overhaul of the tax code in  years before january   disagreements over both substance and process are driving a wedge between senior house republicans involved in the tax writing process and their senate counterparts   henrietta treyz of investment advisory firm veda partners said in a report   but house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady  hatch s congressional counterpart  described potential divergence as a natural and even healthy development that would be kept in check by common ground on major tax issues   we ll work this out by the end of the year   brady told reporters   at the end of the day  we just have to sit down and find common ground   hatch and brady are among the big six  which also includes treasury secretary steven mnuchin  house speaker paul ryan  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and white house economic adviser gary cohn  there have already been two statements of general tax principles from republicans  a one page document from the trump administration in april and a joint statement from the big six negotiators in july  democrats have criticized republican plans as too favorable to the wealthiest americans and corporations  with the latest blueprint due in less than two weeks  brady and mnuchin appeared to differ on thursday over how much detail the document would contain  brady told a policy forum that he did not expect the document to offer specifics on tax rates  while mnuchin said the plan would contain extensive details including a specific corporate rate  brady later told reporters that talks continued over what the document would contain       it is still clearly possible that tax reform could be enacted over the next near  however  the signs are not particularly positive at the moment   analyst jan hatzius of investment bank goldman sachs said in a research note on thursday  after months of talks  basic questions on the republican tax plan remain unanswered  such as whether or not the tax cuts they want will expand the u s  budget deficit  trump told reporters aboard air force one on thursday that the tax reform plan would be revenue neutral  if economic growth spurred by the legislation is taken into account  revenue neutrality is fast emerging as a divisive issue in congress  where deficit hawks have expressed misgivings about adding to the deficit   in white house meetings with top democrats in recent days  trump has shown a new willingness to deal with the opposition   senate democratic leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi talked about tax reform with trump after their wednesday discussion on immigration  according to representative richard neal  the top ways and means democrat  neal said the white house appeared to be  in synch  with democrats for now on tax relief for the middle class   i think that there could be some room there for conversation   he told the same policy forum where brady spoke
