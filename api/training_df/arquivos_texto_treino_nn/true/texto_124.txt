washington  reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions  who oversees the federal bureau of investigation  on friday offered a tepid endorsement of the nation s leading law enforcement agency  which has been under attack by president donald trump and other republicans  trump said earlier this month that the fbi s reputation was in  tatters  after news came to light that an fbi agent on a team investigating links between russia and trump s election campaign had exchanged anti trump text messages with an fbi lawyer      sessions on friday defended the bureau  which is part of the department of justice that he leads  but it was not an enthusiastic endorsement   i don t share the view that the fbi is not functioning at a high level all over the country   he told a news conference  sessions  comments came at a time when former fbi director robert mueller is leading an investigation into russian interference in the  presidential election  a sampling of texts between agent peter strzok and fbi lawyer lisa page was released to congress and the media earlier this week  the two referred to trump as an  idiot   but also took aim at other politicians  including democrat hillary clinton  who lost to trump in the  election  and independent bernie sanders  who had sought the democratic nomination for president  strzok was transferred off mueller s team  but the texts provided fresh fodder for some republicans who have fiercely criticized mueller in a move that democrats say is an effort to discredit his russia investigation  russia has denied meddling in the  election  and trump has repeatedly said his campaign did not collude with russia          sessions is the latest senior official to defend the fbi  his comments were much milder than those of fbi director christopher wray and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in recent testimony to congress  sessions said trump does support the fbi and noted that trump spoke earlier on friday to a class of domestic and international law enforcement managers graduating from an fbi training program in quantico  virginia  however  the audience did not consist of fbi agents  and trump s speech was to local and state police officers  sessions also ducked a question about whether he will appoint a second special counsel to investigate some of the bias allegations against mueller s team  as some republicans have demanded
