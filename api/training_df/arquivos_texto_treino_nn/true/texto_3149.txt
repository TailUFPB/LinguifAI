washington  reuters    the trump administration on friday sided with employers in a supreme court case over the rights of workers to bring class action lawsuits against companies  court documents showed   reversing a position staked out earlier by the obama administration  which backed employees  the administration said in a court filing it would no longer defend the position of the national labor relations board  nlrb  that employment agreements requiring workers to waive their rights to bring class action claims are invalid  the waivers compel workers to individually arbitrate disputes with their employers rather than bring collective lawsuits with their co workers   the nlrb  an independent agency in the federal government  said in letter to the court on thursday that its own lawyer would represent the board in the employees  class action rights case  it is unusual for the government to change positions in a case already pending at the supreme court  and marks a sharp break from the administration of former president barack obama  a democrat  which had originally pursued the case on behalf of the nlrb  the nlrb currently has a democratic majority  isolating it politically from the republican trump administration   in january the supreme court agreed to review three lower court rulings  including one involving global professional services firm ernst   young  over the legality of the waivers  employers have increasingly required workers to sign them as part of their arbitration agreements to guard against the rising tide of worker lawsuits seeking unpaid wages  in friday s court filing  acting u s  solicitor general jeffrey wall said the supreme court should find that class action waivers are legal and enforceable under federal law  workers that waive the right to collective litigation cannot  escape the consequences of that choice   he said   companies say the waivers allow for speedier and more cost effective resolution of workplace disputes  class action litigation  on the other hand  is harder to fight and can lead to large damages awards   workers argue that pursuing their cases individually is prohibitively expensive and  without the prospect of large damages awards that class action litigation can lead to  lawyers will be deterred from taking their cases  the nine supreme court justices are expected to issue a ruling on the issue in the court s next term  which starts in october and ends in june
