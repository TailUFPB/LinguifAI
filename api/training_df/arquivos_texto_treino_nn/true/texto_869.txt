washington  reuters    u s  religious entities would be allowed to engage in political activity without the risk of losing their tax exempt status under a republican proposal to overhaul the tax code unveiled on thursday  a move that could give influential community leaders more latitude to try to influence voters  the plan would eliminate a provision in the tax code known as the  johnson amendment   which prohibits churches from using church resources to encourage voting for or against a candidate   a religious leader can currently endorse a candidate in their personal capacity  but they cannot do so within the confines of their church  mosque or synagogue or use their staff to help a candidate       supporters say it will increase religious liberty  opponents say it will allow political leaders to pressure churches and allow some churches to be turned into political operations  the change would apply to all religious groups that register as non profits  including places of worship for christians  muslims and jews   but it is evangelical christians   who have become increasingly more engaged in the political process in the past  years   who have clamored the most loudly for the change   president donald trump  who is popular with evangelical voters  vowed on the campaign trail to scrap the johnson amendment  arguing that it kept evangelical churches from helping his campaign   critics of the johnson amendment have long argued that it violates the first amendment s separation of church and state because it imposes restrictions on what religious leaders can say  but supporters of the johnson amendment say it does just the opposite and instead protects the separation of church and state  arguing that it will allow political leaders to pressure churches to give them endorsements  the announced change was part of a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent is the centerpiece of the tax proposal unveiled by house of representatives republicans  the plan would also reduce tax rates on some individuals and families   many analysts have raised doubts about the likelihood that congress will be able to pass a comprehensive tax package  including whether they will have enough support for several provisions including the change in religious rules  allowing churches to engage in political activity might provide some tactical help for republicans in the  u s  congressional elections  republicans have long argued that the johnson amendment places them at a disadvantage because churches are a central organizing mechanism for their voters while labor unions  which favor democrats  are allowed to engage in political activity and operate as tax exempt   this version of the story corrects the third paragraph to say supporters  not supports
