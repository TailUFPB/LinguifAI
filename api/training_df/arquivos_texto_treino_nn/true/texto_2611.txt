brussels  reuters    the european union sounded an alarm on saturday about moves in the u s  congress to step up u s  sanctions on russia  urging washington to keep coordinating with its  partners and warning of unintended consequences   in a statement by a spokeswoman after republicans and democrats in the u s  congress reached a deal that could see new legislation pass  the european commission warned of possibly  wide and indiscriminate   unintended consequences   notably on the eu s efforts to diversify energy sources away from russia  germany has already warned of possible retaliation if the united states moves to sanction german firms involved with building a new baltic pipeline for russian gas   eu diplomats are concerned that a german u s  row over the nord stream  pipeline being built by russia s state owned gazprom could complicate efforts in brussels to forge an eu consensus on negotiating with russia over the project   we highly value the unity that is prevailing among international partners in our approach towards russia s action in ukraine and the subsequent sanctions  this unity is the guarantee of the efficiency and credibility of our measures   the commission said in its statement   we understand that the russia iran sanctions bill is driven primarily by domestic considerations   it went on  referring to a bill passed in the u s  senate last month and to which lawmakers said on saturday they had unblocked further obstacles   as we have said repeatedly  it is important that any possible new measures are coordinated between international partners to maintain unity among partners on the sanctions that has been underpinning the efforts for full implementation of the minsk agreements   the commission said  referring to an accord struck with moscow to try to end the conflicts in ukraine   we are concerned the measures discussed in the u s  congress could have unintended consequences  not only when it comes to transatlantic  unity  but also on eu economic and energy security interests  this impact could be potentially wide and indiscriminate  including when it comes to energy sources diversification efforts   sanctions are at their most effective when they are coordinated  currently our sanctions regimes are coordinated  as a result their impact on the ground is increased and through coordination we are able to avoid surprises  manage potential impact on our own economic operators and address collectively efforts to circumvent such measures  unilateral measures would undermine this   the commission said    we therefore call on the u s  congress authorities to engage with the partners  including the eu  to ensure coordination and to avoid any unintended consequences of the measures discussed
