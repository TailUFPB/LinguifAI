richmond  va   reuters    federal appeals court judges on monday peppered a u s  justice department lawyer with tough questions about president donald trump s temporary ban on travelers from six muslim majority nations  with several voicing skepticism that protecting national security was the aim of the policy  not religious bias  six democratic appointees on a court dominated by judges named by democratic presidents showed concerns about reviving the republican president s march executive order that prohibited new visas to enter the united states for citizens of iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for three months  but three republican appointees on the richmond  virginia based  u s  circuit court of appeals seemed to lean toward the administration  asking whether the president should be second guessed when it comes to protecting the country s borders and whether the plaintiffs bringing the suit had been sufficiently harmed by the order during arguments before  judges   based on the judges  questions  a ruling could hinge on whether the appeals court agrees with a lower court judge that past statements by trump about the need to prevent muslims from entering the united states should be taken into account  that would be bad news for a young administration seeking victory on one of its first policy changes   this is not a muslim ban   acting solicitor general jeffrey wall  arguing for the government  told the judges during the hearing that lasted two hours  twice as long as scheduled  judge robert king  named by democratic former president bill clinton  told wall that trump has never retracted previous comments about wanting to impose a ban on muslims    he s never repudiated what he said about the muslim ban   king said  referring to trump s campaign promise for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states     wall told the judges past legal precedent holds that the court should not look behind the text of the trump s executive order  which does not mention any specific religion  to get at its motivations  he warned that despite the  heated and passionate political debate  about the ban  there was a need to be careful not to set legal precedent that would open the door to broader questioning of presidential decision making on security matters  judge paul niemeyer  appointed by republican former president george h w  bush  told omar jadwat  the american civil liberties union lawyer representing the plaintiffs who challenged the order  that they were asking the court to rule on a president s national security judgments     you have the judiciary supervising and assessing how the executive is carrying out his office   niemeyer said  pressing jadwat  who seemed to stumble at times after pointed questioning by the judges   i just don t know where this stops   the revised travel ban was challenged in maryland by refugee organizations and individuals who said they were being discriminated against because they were muslim and because they had family members adversely affected by the ban  they argue the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the u s  constitution s first amendment barring the government from favoring or disfavoring a particular religion  the administration appealed a march  ruling by maryland based federal judge theodore chuang that put the ban on hold just a day before it was due to go into effect  the arguments marked the latest legal test for trump s ban  which also was blocked by federal judge derrick watson in hawaii in a separate legal challenge  an earlier version of the ban was also blocked by the courts  chuang  in maryland  blocked the part of trump s order relating to travel by people from the six countries  watson  in hawaii  also blocked another part of the order that suspended the entry of refugees into the united states for four months  to a packed audience in the ornate pre civil war era courthouse  judge pamela harris said trump s action clearly had a disparate impact on muslims  asking   how is this neutral in its operation as to muslims   judge barbara keenan  who like harris was appointed by democratic former president barack obama  said the order could affect some  million people  regardless of how the  judges rule  the matter is likely to be decided ultimately by the u s  supreme court  the full  circuit took up the appeal but two republican appointed judges did not participate  that left nine judges appointed by democratic presidents  three republican appointees and one judge originally appointed by a democrat and later re appointed by a republican  it was unclear when the court would rule  trump issued the march executive order after federal courts blocked an earlier version  issued on jan   a week after he took office  that also had included iraq among the nations targeted  that order  which went into effect immediately  triggered chaos and protests at airports and in several cities before being put on hold due to legal challenges  the second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban  the administration s appeal in the hawaii case will be heard in seattle on may  by a three judge panel of the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals  the three judges assigned all are democratic appointees  wall said the temporary ban was intended to give the government time to evaluate whether people from the six countries were being subjected to adequate vetting to ensure they did not pose a security threat to the united states  but he said the administration had not been able to proceed on all the work it wanted to do because of the litigation  noting  we have put our pens down
