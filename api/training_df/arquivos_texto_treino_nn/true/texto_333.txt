washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday handed a victory to president donald trump by allowing his latest travel ban targeting people from six muslim majority countries to go into full effect even as legal challenges continue in lower courts  the nine member court  with two liberal justices dissenting  granted his administration s request to lift two injunctions imposed by lower courts that had partially blocked the ban  which is the third version of a contentious policy that trump first sought to implement a week after taking office in january   the high court s action means that the ban will now go fully into effect for people from chad  iran  libya  somalia  syria and yemen seeking to enter the united states  the republican president has said the travel ban is needed to protect the united states from terrorism by islamic militants   in a statement  attorney general jeff sessions called the supreme court s action  a substantial victory for the safety and security of the american people   sessions said the trump administration was heartened that a clear majority of the justices  allowed the president s lawful proclamation protecting our country s national security to go into full effect   the ban was challenged in separate lawsuits by the state of hawaii and the american civil liberties union  both sets of challengers said the latest ban  like the earlier ones  discriminates against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution and is not permissible under immigration laws   trump had promised as a candidate to impose  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   last week he shared on twitter anti muslim videos posted by a far right british party leader   president trump s anti muslim prejudice is no secret   he has repeatedly confirmed it  including just last week on twitter   aclu lawyer omar jadwat said   it s unfortunate that the full ban can move forward for now  but this order does not address the merits of our claims  we continue to stand for freedom  equality and for those who are unfairly being separated from their loved ones   jadwat added  lower courts had previously limited the scope of the ban to people without either certain family connections to the united states or formal relationships with u s  based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies  trump s ban also covers people from north korea and certain government officials from venezuela  but the lower courts had  already allowed those provisions to go into effect  the high court said in two similar one page orders that lower court rulings that partly blocked the latest ban should be put on hold while federal appeals courts in san francisco and richmond  virginia weigh the cases  both courts are due to hear arguments in those cases this week  the supreme court said the ban will remain in effect regardless of what the appeals courts rule  at least until the justices ultimately decide whether to take up the issue on the merits  which they are highly likely to do  the court s order said the appeals courts should decide the cases  with appropriate dispatch    we agree a speedy resolution is needed for the sake of our universities  our businesses and most of all  for people marginalized by this unlawful order   hawaii attorney general douglas chin said  justices ruth bader ginsburg and sonia sotomayor said they would have denied the administration s request  monday s action sent a strong signal that the court is likely to uphold the ban on the merits when the case likely returns to the justices in the coming months  there are some exceptions to the ban  certain people from each targeted country can still apply for a visa for tourism  business or education purposes  and any applicant can ask for an individual waiver  the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals will hear arguments on the merits of hawaii s challenge on wednesday in seattle  the  u s  circuit court of appeals will arguments on the merits of case spearheaded by the aclu on friday in richmond   trump issued his first travel ban targeting several muslim majority countries in january  then issued a revised one in march after the first was blocked by federal courts  the second one expired in september after a long court fight and was replaced with the present version  the trump administration said the president put the latest restrictions in place after a worldwide review of the ability of each country in the world to issue reliable passports and share data with the united states  the administration argues that a president has broad authority to decide who can come into the united states  but detractors say the expanded ban violates a law forbidding the government from discriminating based on nationality when issuing immigrant visas  the administration has said the ban is not discriminatory and pointed out that many muslim majority countries are unaffected by it
