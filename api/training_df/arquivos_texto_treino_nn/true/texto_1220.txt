washington  reuters    the trump administration on monday will order federal agencies to adopt common email security standards in an effort to better protect against hackers  a senior department of homeland security official said  dhs assistant secretary for cybersecurity jeanette manfra  speaking at an event in new york  said the agency would issue a binding directive to require implementation of two cyber security measures  known as dmarc and starttls  intended to guard against email spoofing and phishing attacks  the new requirements are  discrete steps that have scalable  broad impact  that will improve federal government cyber security  manfra said  dmarc  or domain based message authentication  reporting and conformance  is a decade old popular technical standard that helps detect and block email impersonation  such as when a hacker might try to pose as a government official or agency  starttls is a form of encryption technology that protects email traveling between servers  making it more difficult for a third party to intercept  civilian agencies will have  days to implement the new security measures  manfra said  many agencies already use dmarc and starttls but recent reviews have found the protocols are not used universally across government  foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other sensitive data from the u s  government in recent years  the trump administration has made upgrading government agencies  much maligned network security a top cyber priority  democratic senator ron wyden  who earlier this year pushed federal agencies to adopt the security standards more widely  said in a statement the moves were  two cheap  effective ways to secure email from being intercepted or impersonated by bad guys   he said he hoped the decision would compel private sector companies to upgrade their own email security quickly  an august report from the global cyber alliance  an international non profit  found that federal government adoption of dmarc had been rising in recent months but that less than  percent of domains had the protocol fully implemented  usage of dmarc is much higher on the consumer level with  percent of inboxes  including those hosted by alphabet s google  googl o  or microsoft  msft o   supporting the standard  according to the global cyber alliance
