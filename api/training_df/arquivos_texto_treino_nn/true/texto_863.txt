 reuters    some wealthy owners of u s  major league sports teams may have to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction under a tax bill proposed by u s  house of representatives republicans  but the overall impact could be slight  sports economists said  the legislation unveiled on thursday could mean just a modest scaling back of grand plans for new stadiums  with one expert suggesting team owners could help offset any lost federal subsidies  for example  by pouring concrete flooring instead of terrazzo   outside some of the biggest cities  team owners may have enough leverage to compel local governments hungry for the prestige and perceived economic benefits of new stadiums to come up with alternative funding streams  various sports owners in the past have relocated teams to other cities because of stadium funding issues or used the threat of a move to extract concessions from local governments   i m sure the teams will be in a lather but  based on experience  if the cities counties states want to subsidize the stadium they ll figure out some way   rick eckstein  a sociology professor at pennsylvania s villanova university  wrote in an email    andrew zimbalist  an economics professor at massachusetts s smith college  said it may make future plans for billion dollar stadiums  less elaborate   but added it was nothing that team owners and local governments could not take in their stride  under the republican plan  local governments could no longer fund the building or renovating of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax exempt public purpose bonds  the sort of bonds typically used to fund things like schools  libraries and public transit    u s  president donald trump has called for an end to the subsidy  at least for the national football league after some of its players angered the republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system  his democratic predecessor  barack obama  also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in   a report last year by the brookings institution  the washington based social sciences research group  found that of the  major league stadiums built or overhauled since    were at least partly funded by tax exempt municipal bonds   the total tax exempt bond principal issued to fund those stadiums was about   billion and led to a federal tax revenue loss of about    billion  the study found  republicans say they would expect to see only an additional   million in tax revenue over the ensuing decade if the plan becomes law  ted gayer  one of the authors of the brookings study  welcomed the proposal to end what he called an  egregious but small misuse of federal tax dollars     will it substantially affect the lucrative business of professional sports teams  no   he said   will it substantially impact the ability of sports teams to get subsidies  no  maybe at the margins  but probably not
