washington  reuters    democratic senator ron wyden thinks republican leadership is moving away from trying to implement full scale tax reform this year and instead are turning their attention to simply cutting rates    if you look at the language of mitch mcconnell in the last couple of days  he s talking about tax cuts  he s been saying   well  i don t know about tax reform  let s have a tax cut    wyden  the top democrat on the senate finance committee  said in an interview with reuters on friday    to me that would really be  again  contrary to what the president campaigned on   he said  mcconnell is the senate majority leader   sweeping tax reform had been high on the republican legislative agenda  but so far  house of representatives and the senate  both controlled by republicans  have been unable to find consensus on a tax package that could pass both chambers and be signed into law by president donald trump   wyden argued there is robust bipartisan agreement that a tax overhaul is needed    there are plenty of republicans in congress   because they talk to me   who would really like to do major tax reform   he said       last month  the white house weighed in on the tax discussion  offering only a one page plan that included deep cuts in rates  many for businesses  but stopped well short of legislative language or providing detail on specific changes   the tax reform proposal is shorter than drug store receipts i have   wyden remarked   several lawmakers have warned that if tax reform is not completed by the end of   it will become more difficult to pass in   when congressional midterm elections will be held  the house has begun holding hearings and has developed a  blue print    including a controversial border adjustment tax proposal that would tax imports while providing credit for exports   wyden  in an echo of other senators  including republicans  said that a border adjustment tax would be unlikely to fare well in the senate   going so far to call it a  grocery tax  that would unfairly hit consumers in the middle class
