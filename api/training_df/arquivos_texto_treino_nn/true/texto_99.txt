washington  reuters    the u s  senate will not consider an immigration bill as part of year end legislation but will turn to a measure protecting immigrant youths known as  dreamers  in january  no   senate republican john cornyn said on monday  cornyn also said that if congress cannot meet an early march deadline for passing legislation providing the protections against deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought illegally into the united states as children  president donald trump could consider extending the deadline  in interviews over the past several days  both republican and democratic lawmakers and aides said that talks on deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  have been quietly making progress   the president has given us enough time to deal with this before march and so i think that s plenty of time and i expect us to meet it   cornyn told reporters   if we can t  then the president could extend the deadline if he chose to do so  but this is something we re going to turn to  i m sure  in january   tensions between republicans and democrats over the issue of legislative protections for dreamers increased this fall after trump took a hard line on the conditions for a deal  an intense lobbying campaign has been underway to urge lawmakers to find a permanent legislative fix after the republican president ended the daca program in september  he gave congress until early march to come up with a legislative replacement  on capitol hill  advocates have handed out buttons to lawmakers and aides with the number     referring to the estimated number of dreamers each day who already are losing the temporary legal status they had under daca  immigration advocates have erected a huge monitor on the national mall  situated at the base of the u s  capitol for lawmakers and tourists alike to see  it broadcasts videos of dreamers pleading for help  meanwhile  seven daca beneficiaries from mexico  argentina and colombia were in the fourth day of a hunger strike to draw attention to the issue  republican representative john carter  a veteran of past immigration debates  said he worried democrats want to go way beyond the scope of daca and the approximately   dreamers who at one time or another were covered by democratic former president barack obama s executive order   they re talking dream act   carter said referring to the legislation offered by democratic senator dick durbin and republican senator lindsey graham   and that number is about  million people  that s too much   past legislative attempts to allow dreamers to get work permits and drivers licenses  open bank accounts and  come out of the shadows  have stalled as conservative republicans and lobbying groups objected to giving  amnesty  to anyone who entered the united states illegally   even those who had no choice in the matter and have grown up here  democratic representative michelle lujan grisham  who chairs the congressional hispanic caucus  said republican demands for additional resources for immigration enforcement throughout the united states and not just at the border are a major problem  her concern is that the trump administration might use the money to hire more federal agents to nab undocumented relatives of dreamers   if you re going to come in and go to hospitals and go to courtrooms and go to schools  in search of family members   i m not going to do that   she said in an interview
