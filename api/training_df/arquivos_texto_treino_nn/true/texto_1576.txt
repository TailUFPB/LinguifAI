new york  reuters    the supreme court signaled on monday it may dismiss a challenge to president donald trump s controversial travel ban after the white house announced tailored restrictions on eight countries that legal experts said stand a better chance at holding up in court   the high court canceled oral arguments scheduled for oct   to decide whether or not a march  executive order that temporarily blocked travel from six muslim majority countries was discriminatory  that ban expired on sunday  the president replaced it with a proclamation that indefinitely restricts travel from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  certain government officials from venezuela will also be barred  the new ban  trump s third  could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors   trump has been trying for most of the year to create a ban that passes court muster  the sunday proclamation  which he said is needed to screen out terrorist or public safety threats  could be less vulnerable to legal attack  scholars and other experts said  because it is the result of a months long analysis of foreign vetting procedures by u s  officials   it also might be less easily tied to trump s campaign trail statements some courts viewed as biased against muslims    the greater the sense that the policy reflects a considered  expert judgment  the less the temptation  by courts  to second guess the executive   said saikrishna prakash  a professor at the university of virginia school of law  in an email   it looks less like a matter of prejudice or a desire to fulfill a campaign promise   in its brief order  the high court asked the trump administration and the ban s challengers  including states and refugee advocacy organizations  to file briefs on whether the case should be dismissed  trump s march  ban sparked international outrage and was quickly blocked by federal courts as unconstitutional discrimination or a violation of immigration law   in june  the supreme court allowed a limited version of the ban to go ahead while the justices prepared to hear arguments over its legality on oct    a date they have now scrubbed  in   more than   nonimmigrant and immigrant visas were issued to the countries covered by the new ban  excluding venezuela  with nearly half of those going to iran  only nine north koreans immigrated to the united states in  and  were granted nonimmigrant visas  the new ban is set to go into effect on oct    but it already applies to five of the six countries covered by the march  ban  according to a u s  state department cable issued on sunday and obtained by reuters   to read the full cable click here  here   sudan was dropped from the list of banned countries after the sudanese government provided information required under the new criteria set out by the trump administration earlier this year  a white house official said on monday  the government has said the president has broad authority in immigration and national security matters  but challengers to the march ban had argued that it ran afoul of the u s  constitution s bar on favoring one religion over another   they cited statements trump made during his  campaign for president  including his call for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   within hours of sunday s proclamation  representatives for the hawaii  new york and california attorneys general said their offices were reviewing the new restrictions  advocacy organizations denounced it as more of the same  if the court does dismiss the case  there remains the separate issue of whether the justices will throw out the sweeping lower court rulings that invalidated the ban  the government would want to erase precedents that constrain its authority while the challengers would want to keep them in place for the same reasons    this is still a muslim ban  they simply added three additional countries   said becca heller  director of the international refugee assistance project  which previously sued to block trump s travel ban executive orders    of those countries  chad is majority muslim  travel from north korea is already basically frozen and the restrictions on venezuela only affect government officials on certain visas   heller said   sudan  which was in the march order  is no longer included   the worldwide review examined each country s ability to issue reliable electronic passports and share security risk data with the united states  overall   countries had problems  and  made improvements  including  that agreed to share information on known or suspected terrorists  trump s proclamation said   the review  at least arguably attenuates the link between the president s alleged bias and the policy   said margo schlanger  a university of michigan law school professor  however  challengers potentially could argue that the expanded ban violates the federal immigration and nationality act  which forbids the government from discriminating based on an individual s nationality when issuing immigrant visas   congress decided that it didn t want an immigration system that played favorites among countries   schlanger said
