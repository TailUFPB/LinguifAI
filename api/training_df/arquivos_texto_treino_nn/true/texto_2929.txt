washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump called for a determined response to north korea after talks with south korea s president moon jae in on friday where he stressed the importance of their alliance but took aim at seoul over trade and sharing the cost of defense  trump said the united states was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with south korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor  barack obama  and reiterated that an era of  strategic patience  over north korea s nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended   together we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in north korea   trump said as he stood alongside moon in the white house rose garden   the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response   despite the tough rhetoric  it remains unclear how trump will find a way forward on north korea  which is working to develop a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the united states  u s  defense secretary jim mattis has warned the consequences of any military solution would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale   trump had pinned his hopes on persuading china  north korea s neighbor and main trading partner  to do more to rein in pyongyang  although he has lately grown frustrated that beijing has not taken stronger action   trump called on regional powers to implement sanctions and demand north korea  choose a better path and do it quickly   moon  who warned of a  stern response  to any provocations  urged pyongyang to return promptly to talks   our two leaders will employ both sanctions and dialogue in a phased and comprehensive approach   moon said of south korea and the united states  trump and moon have said they are open to renewed dialogue with north korea but only under circumstances that would lead to pyongyang giving up its weapons programs  moon told an event at the center for strategic and international studies think tank that moves by north korea that could create conditions for dialogue could include a freeze on its nuclear and missile tests  or the release of three americans it is holding in the country  to be successful  talks would have to involve north korean leader kim jong un and have as their ultimate aim the complete dismantling of north korea s nuclear program  he added     trump sought to woo china since a summit with chinese president xi jinping in april but the honeymoon period appears to be over  on thursday  the united states targeted a chinese bank and sanctioned chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with north korea and approved a    billion arms deal with taiwan   decisions that angered beijing  south korea is a long standing american ally but trump has spoken harshly about u s  trade imbalances and threatened to tear up the bilateral trade pact   we will do more to remove barriers to reciprocal trade and market access   trump said  adding that the two leaders had talked about the thorny trade areas of steel and autos  trump said he was encouraged by moon s assurances that he would seek a level playing field for american workers and businesses  particularly automakers  a joint statement said the two sides had agreed to work together to reduce over supply of basic materials such as steel and non tariff barriers  it also said trump had accepted an invitation from moon to visit south korea this year   bonnie glaser  senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies think tank  said it was unwise for trump to air the trade issue so publicly   public complaints by trump about unfair trade and inadequate defense spending provide opportunities for china and north korea to drive a wedge between the allies   she said  trump also emphasized the need to ensure equitable sharing of costs for defense  returning to a theme he raised during his campaign and brought up with other allies  including nato countries and japan  a senior u s  official said in a briefing before the president s meeting with moon that south korea was in many respects a  model ally   given its spending of   percent of gdp on defense and moon s plan to grow capabilities   we shouldn t view south korea as somehow laggard on that front   the official said on condition of anonymity  the u s  goods trade deficit with south korea has more than doubled since the u s  korea free trade pact known as korus took effect in   the agreement was forecast to boost u s  exports by   billion a year  but in  they were   billion lower than in   at the start of friday s talks  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said the largest component of the deficit was automotive trade and many non tariff barriers to u s  auto exports to south korea remained   i think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad imports side   he said  ross said later on friday that some progress had been made in the talks  the current pact was agreed to despite protests by supporters of moon  who was then in opposition  but analysts have suggested that given the need to preserve a unified front in the face of a hostile north korea  there could be compromise on both sides to resolve issues
