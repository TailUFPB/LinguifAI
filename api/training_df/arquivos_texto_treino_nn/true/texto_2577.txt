kabul  reuters     this version of the july  story corrects reference to a  super tucano in para   the aircraft are built in the united states under an agreement between their brazilian manufacturer  embraer and sierra nevada corp   as the u s  administration prepares its new strategy for afghanistan  the kabul government and its western allies are working hard to develop an air force that gives government forces the advantage in their war against taliban militants  the level of equipment  training and assets falls far short of matching the air assets the americans still maintain in afghanistan  but billions of dollars are earmarked for the force which is being built up almost from scratch   that is what will provide the asymmetric advantage to break the stalemate on the ground   brigadier general phillip stewart  commander of taac air  the resolute support mission advising the air force  told reuters  a four year    billion expansion plan is aimed at training more flight and maintenance crews and increasing the number of aircraft in the afghan air force  aaf    in   remember  we  nato and the u s  military in afghanistan  had the best air force in the world and the coalition pulled out and we realized we hadn t grown the afghan air force   stewart said  u s  officers say the aim is to build a counter insurgency force able to support troops fighting in remote and forbidding terrain with air strikes  supplies and intelligence  the air force is already conducting some air strikes using brazilian designed a  super tucano light attack aircraft and specially adapted md  scout helicopters and it is building capacity in other areas  last month  an afghan air crew parachuted around  kg of supplies to an isolated border police outpost  the first time the aaf had conducted an aerial supply drop   we can do casualty evacuations  we can take cargo  we can take ammunition  we can transport vehicles to different places where they can t go by road   said major khail shinwari  an afghan c  hercules pilot  the aaf has about  aircraft in service  ranging from small propeller cessna  to old soviet era helicopters  as well as the a   md  and its four veteran c  hercules transporters  in coming years  the old russian mi  helicopters  which are increasingly difficult to maintain  will be replaced by american uh  black hawks  the aaf says it is flying up to  sorties a day  carrying supplies and providing close air support to troops fighting the afghan taliban and islamic state  but whether it can be built up quickly enough to turn the tide against the stubborn taliban insurgency is unclear  all the air power of the nato led coalition was not enough to defeat the militants and the aaf is nowhere near being able operate alone  u s  drones  f  and apache attack helicopters are still heavily engaged in areas like helmand  where u s  aircraft conducted at least  air strikes in the space of five days last week in support of afghan forces  for the moment  the afghan a  are still using unguided bombs rather than the guided weapons used by the americans  and the md  helicopters  which came into service in   fire machine guns and rockets attached to their landing gear   it s close air support but not as anyone who grew up in the u s  air force would understand it   stewart said   it s not precision  it s   cal ibre machine guns  and rockets but they get close to their work and they re very good   u s  trainers say afghan pilots and crews are being trained to a standard comparable with their american counterparts  but the length of time it takes to train crews   up to four years for pilots and as much as seven years for specialized mechanics   means it will be years before the air force can operate fully independently  for the moment  the emphasis is on building a force suitable for afghanistan  which means using less complicated equipment such as the c  or md  helicopters  at the expense of maybe getting some bigger  sexier platform   stewart said  the aim is to increase the effectiveness of the security forces  which advisers hope to get to a point where the taliban are forced to negotiate a political settlement  as the aaf has grown  however  it has faced increasing pressure from army units to step up operations  advisers say one of the main risks it faces is overstretch   they just don t have the airplanes and sometimes the ground forces will become frustrated because they want more   stewart said
