washington  reuters    fresh off striking a budget deal with democrats  donald trump is toning down his rhetoric and looking to cut deals on such american hot button issues as immigration and tax reform in search of a much needed legislative victory  eight months in office  the republican president is openly courting and pressuring democrats for support on taxes and  for now at least  steering away from hardline positions on immigration that might antagonize them  the approach is still in its early stages  in the past trump has briefly taken a more moderate direction only to quickly return to his conservative base  but white house aides say the driving force behind the change of tactics is a desire to secure some wins in congress after months of failure  internal squabbling among republicans  who control both chambers of congress  killed their efforts to overhaul healthcare  the divisions threaten to undermine the push for a tax overhaul  especially in the senate  where republicans hold a narrow   majority   we learned this summer that keeping  or  republicans  in the senate  is not something that s reliable   marc short  trump s liaison to congress  told reporters this week  frustrated with republican leaders  trump is moving away from a strategy that relies on passing legislation on strict party lines  he hosted seven senators at the white house on tuesday  including three democrats  and had dinner plans on wednesday with house democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer  hours before the dinner  trump told reporters his tax plan might include a tax increase on the wealthy  a welcome gesture for democrats  who oppose cutting taxes on the rich  trump s bipartisan moves followed a series of staff changes  he replaced chief of staff reince priebus  a longtime republican operative  with john kelly  a former marine general with strong relationships on capitol hill  and ousted more polarizing aides  including steve bannon and sebastian gorka  last week trump went so far as to take democratic senator heidi heitkamp along with him to her home state of north dakota for a tax reform rally  her state leans strongly republican  and heitkamp is seen as vulnerable in next year s midterm elections  hurricanes that struck texas and florida have forced trump to focus on governing  he has petitioned congress for financial aid backed by both parties  but not everyone has been pleased with trump s outreach to democrats  immigration hardliners  including some in his party  were furious when the white house said it would not insist on funding for a proposed mexican border wall as a condition of legislation that would help young undocumented immigrants known as  dreamers  who were brought to the united states as children  conservatives said this forfeited some leverage  mark krikorian  executive director of the center for immigration studies  which seeks to limit legal and illegal immigration  said he worried that democrats would take advantage of trump s eagerness to strike a deal on dreamers   trump is the kind of guy who goes on foot to the car dealership and can t get a ride home without buying a car   krikorian said  some republican lawmakers said trump s courtship of democrats on tax reform made them nervous  especially since details of the plan had yet to be worked out   now trump is talking about doing bipartisan stuff with chuck and nancy on taxes   republican representative dave brat said   i don t want to open the door to that until we see what does this tax plan look like   but some conservatives said a bipartisan legislative strategy made sense   people inside the republican party need to understand that the president has to search wherever the votes are   said matt schlapp  chairman of the american conservative union
