boston  reuters    president donald trump s executive order on thursday making it easier for churches to dabble in politics kept faith with his promise to evangelical christians who helped him win the white house  but could end up benefiting his opponents as well  leaders of the u s  religious left  a rising force of opposition to trump s hard line stance on immigration and healthcare  said they were poised to benefit from the move  which lifts the risk of religious groups losing their tax exempt status if they advocate for particular candidates   this is going to backfire on trump   said the rev  jennifer butler  chief executive of progressive policy group faith in public life   we are morally outraged at what is going on and we are appalled at the weaponization of religion   the group plans to mobilize voters who view some of trump s policies as immoral  while the group does not endorse candidates  those voters in the  midterm elections would back candidates who oppose those policies  trump s order gives religious groups more liberty to do so without jeopardizing tax exempt status   we re going to be mobilizing millions of voters to turn out at the polls and vote their values   butler said   sojourners  a washington based progressive christian network that advocates for immigrants and the poor  also believes more of its members will now feel free to speak out against trump s policies   i wouldn t tell people who to vote for but i would tell them what to vote against and this might encourage more churches to speak out against him   said jim wallis  the group s founder   donald trump s use of racism and racial bigotry is unchristian  his attack on refugees is anti christian   trump has repeatedly and angrily denied allegations that his policies are racist  calling immigration limits essential for national security  before signing the order  the republican president cited historically black churches and slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr  as drivers of u s  social progress  evangelical and roman catholic leaders as well as a prominent u s  rabbi joined trump when he signed the order instructing the internal revenue service to  alleviate the burden of the johnson amendment   the  law prohibiting organizations with tax free status  including churches  from participating in political campaigns or supporting particular candidates  the move by trump  who appealed to religious conservatives in his  presidential run  was widely praised by religious organizations that felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it   we will not allow people of faith to be targeted  bullied or silenced any more   trump  who criticized the johnson amendment during his campaign  said at the ceremony  rescinding the law would require an act of congress  ralph reed  a longtime leader of the religious right and chairman of the faith   freedom coalition  praised trump s executive order in a statement  saying it removed a  sword of damocles that has hung over the faith community for decades   several prominent leaders of the religious left noted that neither republican nor democratic policy stances lined up neatly with any major religion s teaching and said the move could fracture congregations by encouraging leaders to take sides   once faith leaders become partisan  it hijacks their moral authority and their impartiality in this hyper partisan environment   said rabbi jonah pesner  director of the religious action center of reform judaism  the american civil liberties union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order  but later backed off  saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it fell far short of meeting trump s pledge to  totally destroy  the johnson amendment  several leaders interviewed said they worried that trump s move could be unevenly enforced  allowing conservative christian churches to promote political candidates without extending the same exemptions to other views or other denominations   the biggest religious liberty issue now for me is how christians are going to protect the liberty of muslims   said wallis  of sojourners   that s the top issue  more than whether they have to hire gay people   ibrahim hooper  spokesman for the council on american islamic relations  said his group would keep urging u s  imams to speak out on moral issues with political consequences  but would urge them to remain nonpartisan  he wondered if all religious leaders would follow that guidance   these kind of moves  particularly by this administration  have a vast ocean of unintended consequences   he said
