washington  reuters    president donald trump s supreme court appointee neil gorsuch gave a speech to a conservative group on thursday at a hotel in which trump has a financial interest  drawing criticism from protesters outside the building and the top senate democrat  about  demonstrators appeared outside the trump international hotel located just blocks from the white house  saying gorsuch s speech called into question his impartiality as the high court potentially weighs cases involving the republican president  including some involving the hotel itself   there s a reason we questioned his independence during his confirmation hearings   senator chuck schumer said in a statement  gorsuch was confirmed by the republican led u s  senate to his lifetime position as a justice in april despite unified opposition from democrats who said some of his past rulings favored corporations over ordinary americans and doubted his independence from trump  protester josh orton  a consultant for abortion rights group naral  said if gorsuch continues to make appearances that raise ethics questions  the supreme court will be in danger of losing its sacred reputation as a neutral arbiter of justice   gorsuch did not address the controversy during his  minute speech  instead focusing on the work of the event s organizer  the fund for american studies  which runs student academic programs and fellowships promoting limited government and free market economics   he spoke of his job as a justice  saying   the people and the place are a joy   he lauded american values such as free speech and civil rights  justices often address a variety of groups across the political spectrum in their spare time  but gorsuch s speech comes just days before the opening of the u s  supreme court term in which trump s administration has a stake in several major cases   the hotel is a focus of lawsuits accusing trump of violating the u s  constitution by letting his properties and restaurants accept payments from foreign governments    justice gorsuch told the senate during his confirmation that he was committed to the independence and integrity of the judiciary   said elizabeth wydra  president of the constitutional accountability center  which represents more than  members of congress in one of those lawsuits   his decision to speak at an event that profits the president  however  sadly falls far short of that standard   whether or not speaking at trump s hotel breaks any explicit ethics rules   supreme court spokeswoman kathy arberg said gorsuch declined to comment on the ethics issue
