new york  reuters    investors looking for the u s  republican tax bill to prompt multinational companies to convert foreign profits into dollars and end the worst slide in the greenback in a decade may have to temper their hopes for a prolonged rebound  the plan  designed in part to give u s  multinationals a reason to repatriate the roughly    trillion in profits held by their foreign subsidiaries  would slash tax rates on such previously accumulated earnings  companies have been slow to recognize those profits on their balance sheets so they can avoid paying u s  corporate taxes  which stand at a rate of  percent    graphic  overseas cash stash   reut rs   the dollar is down roughly   percent so far this year against a basket of currencies  the greenback has suffered as the federal reserve has raised interest rates more slowly than expected and president donald trump has not been able to sign any major legislation into law   graphic  dollar rise during  tax holiday   reut rs   yet analysts say that even if the tax bill becomes law  the dollar may not benefit in the long term because the legislation gives companies little incentive to convert their foreign profits right away  at the same time  many large companies already have those profits in dollar denominated securities   the republicans  proposals differ from the last tax break on foreign profits  which global financial services company unicredit said brought roughly   billion to the united states  the bill president george w  bush signed in october  drastically reduced tax rates to   percent over a  month window and  along with aggressive tightening by the federal reserve  helped send the dollar nearly  percent higher the following year   this time  however  the republican bills before a conference committee would permanently change how u s  companies  foreign profits are taxed   the united states would no longer collect taxes on most future earnings a company makes beyond its borders  as a result  companies would have fewer incentives to bring previously accumulated foreign profits home quickly because rates are not scheduled to revert higher   up to   billion in foreign earnings could be repatriated over an indefinite period  according to td securities  while that could provide some boost to the dollar  repatriation will probably not be a significant ongoing factor in the    trillion global currency market  analysts said   it was a one off repatriation and mandatory in  so companies took advantage of it  and the dollar benefited from it   said mark mccormick  north american head of fx strategy at td securities in toronto   but this tax bill doesn t have that same urgency     so far  there is no final version of the tax bill  legislation passed by the house of representatives would allow companies to bring back foreign profits at a  percent repatriation tax rate  as opposed to the current  percent  over eight years  the senate bill  approved over the weekend  puts the rate at   percent   neither bill requires companies to convert foreign profits into dollars   prospects of a tax break on companies  foreign earnings and expectations of wider u s  budget deficits helped boost the dollar to its highest levels since  soon after trump s presidential victory in november    now that the tax bills have passed both houses of congress   dollar bulls have started banging their drums  again  analysts at unicredit said  however  they said this attitude is misguided because the vast majority of the earnings that companies will repatriate are probably already in dollar denominated securities in the united states    even a significant wave of repatriation might not lift the dollar directly  as some of the largest u s  corporations already hold a lot of cash in dollar denominated assets   said shaun osborne  chief fx strategist at scotiabank in toronto   in many cases  foreign profits are based in dollars held in accounts at u s  banks  yet are treated as overseas assets on a company s balance sheet  as a result  they are not recognized as u s  income and are therefore not subject to u s  taxes   the brookings institution  a non profit public policy organization based in washington  estimates that at the  u s  companies with the largest cash balances abroad   percent of foreign profits are held in u s  dollar denominated cash or equivalents  for example  microsoft corp noted in its annual report that as of june   roughly  percent of the cash and short term investments held by its foreign units was already invested in u s  dollar assets  despite some skepticism about u s  repatriation flows  some analysts say the dollar could get a short term boost   immediately after tax reform is passed  you re going to hear this giant sucking sound as money is heading home very quickly   said david woo  head of global rates and currencies research at bank of america merrill lynch  yet he does not expect a dollar rally to continue beyond the second quarter of   partly due to concerns about the tax plan s impact on the u s  fiscal deficit   over the long term  the dollar will probably continue to slide  said brian jacobsen  multi asset strategist at wells fargo asset management  the effects of the tax bill are already largely priced into the currency market  leaving little unexpected demand over the following  months  he said    we are positioning client portfolios for a little more dollar weakness   he said   not strength
