san francisco washington  reuters    president donald trump suffered another legal setback on monday as a second federal appeals court refused to revive his travel ban on people entering the united states from six muslim majority nations in a dispute headed to the u s  supreme court  the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals  used narrow grounds to reject the trump administration s bid to undo a hawaii federal judge s decision blocking the temporary ban  it said the republican president s march  order violated existing immigration law  but the three judge panel   all democratic appointees   did not address whether it was unconstitutional discrimination against muslims  a second court  the richmond  virginia based  u s  circuit court of appeals  on may  upheld a maryland judge s ruling that also blocked trump s  day ban on travelers from libya  iran  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen   the  circuit had ruled that the ban  which replaced an earlier jan   one also blocked by the courts   drips with religious intolerance  animus and discrimination  aimed at muslims  the  circuit largely left in place a nationwide injunction by judge derrick watson that stopped parts of the order  which trump said was urgently needed to prevent terrorism in the united states  that ruling came in a lawsuit challenging the order brought by the state of hawaii  which stated the ban would harm its universities and tourism industry  even before monday s ruling  the case was on the fast track to the supreme court  where the administration on june  filed an emergency request seeking to reinstate the order and hear its appeal of the  circuit ruling  the supreme court could act on the administration s request as soon as this week  trump has been on the losing side in all four court rulings on the march order  white house spokesman sean spicer said the administration is reviewing monday s decision and expressed continued confidence that the order is fully lawful and ultimately will be upheld by the supreme court   i think we can all attest that these are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the united states and committing acts of bloodshed and violence   spicer told a briefing  the  circuit upheld the block on trump s three month travel ban for the six countries and four month suspension of all refugee admissions  but the court pared back part of watson s injunction in order to allow the government to conduct internal reviews on vetting procedures for these travelers  the administration said the travel ban was needed to allow time to implement stronger vetting measures  although it has already rolled out some new requirements not blocked by courts  including additional questions for visa applicants  rather than focusing on trump campaign statements as the virginia based court did  the  circuit said the language in the executive order itself did not make a rational case for why a travel ban was needed   the order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than  million people on the basis of nationality   the court wrote  referring the combined populations of the six countries   under immigration law  the administration was required to make findings that entry of the people in question would be detrimental to the united states but failed to do so  the court said  stephen vladeck  a professor at university of texas school of law  said the  circuit provided an easier path for the supreme court to keep the travel ban on hold  because it avoided entirely the controversy over trump s campaign statements    it provides a very attractive way to leave the injunction in place without setting broader doctrinal rules about which they may have pause   vladeck said  trump during the  presidential campaign called for a  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   monday was the deadline for the ban s challengers to respond to the administration s request that the order be allowed to go into effect  the american civil liberties union  which represents people challenging the ban in the separate maryland suit handled by the  circuit  filed court papers urging the court not to take up the case  saying the order will become moot on wednesday   days from when trump issued it  lawyers for hawaii called the order a  thinly veiled muslim ban   trump s earlier jan   order also included iraq among the countries targeted and a total ban on refugees from syria  the march order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban  but was blocked before it could go into effect on march   the suits by hawaii and the maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the constitution s first amendment that prohibits the government from favoring or disfavoring any particular religion  hawaii s court papers mentioned a series of trump twitter posts on june   trump described the order as a  watered down  politically correct  version of his original one
