washington  reuters    when donald trump started thinking during his campaign for the presidency last year about filling a supreme court vacancy  he turned to a group of washington insiders at the controls of a well oiled machine that puts conservative judges on the bench  that disciplined network of operatives  shepherded by judicial activist leonard leo  on friday delivered for trump his first major accomplishment as u s  president  the confirmation of conservative neil gorsuch as a supreme court justice   unlike the chaotic rollouts of other trump policy initiatives  the gorsuch nomination went relatively smoothly  democrats put up a fight in the senate  but they lacked the votes to block the republican majority and they lost  other key players included experienced washington hands such as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  former senator kelly ayotte and white house counsel don mcgahn    it worked because it was all planned out before the nomination  we know what works  what doesn t work  what resources we need  we know the other side s arguments and how to answer them  it s like war   leo told reuters on friday  the only surprise stumble in the effort came when trump attacked judges who blocked his order banning u s  entry by people from certain muslim majority countries  gorsuch distanced himself from the president s twitter messages  other than that  discipline was maintained from the first of five meetings that leo  a veteran of bush era judicial confirmation battles  attended with trump  the two met twice before the election   leo helped compile a list of potential nominees for trump  that helped win over conservative activists unsure of trump s ideological compass at a time when he was still fighting for the republican presidential nomination  a second  longer list came in september  it included gorsuch  a federal judge  the campaign for gorsuch s confirmation would not have happened without mcconnell  who stopped former president barack obama  a democrat  from filling the high court vacancy created when conservative icon antonin scalia died in february   after trump won the election  he named mcgahn  a washington based campaign finance lawyer at jones day  as white house counsel  known by his colleagues as  the quiet man   mcgahn managed the nomination from inside the administration  leo  who reported to mcgahn  pushed back against democrats  claims that trump basically out sourced the nomination process to outside groups  leo said mcgahn carefully scrutinized the lists of nominees and was not simply a rubber stamp  the gorsuch campaign got heavy marketing and promotion backing from the judicial crisis network  jcn   a coordinating body for conservative and grassroots groups  it launched   million in pro gorsuch advertising  targeting in particular senate democrats facing re election contests in    the jcn was born during the administration of former president george w  bush  when republicans realized a strong outside campaign was critical to getting conservatives on the court   carrie severino  the group s chief counsel  said the fact trump agreed to stick to the nominees list made her job easier   we were prepared for several possibilities  and we had ads  websites  research packets  and much more ready to launch the moment a name was confirmed   she said  leo said conservatives have borrowed techniques from the liberal coalitions that worked to defeat the nomination of robert bork by republican then president ronald reagan in   the jcn also tapped social media and communications professionals  washington public relations heavyweight ron bonjean played a role  reporting to white house press secretary sean spicer   at the white house  mcgahn and a team in his office held  murder boards  where gorsuch was bombarded with questions senators might ask  legislative affairs director marc short and his team organized visits with senators and worked with ayotte  asked to accompany gorsuch around capitol hill  ayotte accepted  she said in an interview  ayotte had lost her re election bid in november and had criticized trump  but she helped arrange meetings for gorsuch with almost  senators  in the end  said sources close to the gorsuch effort  it worked because it was highly regimented  leo said the machine that got gorsuch on the bench is here to stay although he will return to his job as executive vice president of the federalist society  a conservative lawyers  group  leo hopes trump will tap that machine for a possible second nomination during his presidency   supreme court confirmations have become full blown political campaigns   he said
