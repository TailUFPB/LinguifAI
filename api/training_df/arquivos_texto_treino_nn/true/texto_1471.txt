washington  reuters    u s  health and human services secretary tom price resigned under pressure from president donald trump on friday in an uproar over price s use of costly private charter planes for government business  his abrupt departure was announced an hour after trump told reporters he was disappointed in price s use of private aircraft and did not like the way it reflected on his administration   secretary of health and human services thomas price offered his resignation earlier today and the president accepted   the white house said in a statement  trump named don wright to serve as acting secretary  wright is currently the deputy assistant secretary for health and director of the office of disease prevention and health promotion   i m not happy  ok  i m not happy   trump told reporters on the white house south lawn  candidates to succeed price included seema verma  who is administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and who is close to vice president mike pence  and scott gottlieb  a physician who serves as commissioner of the food and drug administration  according to industry analysts  several sources saw gottlieb as a clear front runner  they said he got along well with the white house and is viewed favorably there  price s resignation leaves trump with a second cabinet position to fill  he has yet to pick a secretary for homeland security after hiring former secretary john kelly as his white house chief of staff      it was the latest blow to the trump white house  which has struggled to get major legislative achievements passed by congress and has been embroiled in one controversy after another since trump took office in january  price  a former congressman  was instrumental in the trump administration s policies aimed at undercutting obamacare  as well as working with governors across the country to slowly begin unraveling parts of the law  in a resignation letter  price offered little in the way of contrition  he said he had been working to reform the u s  healthcare system and reduce regulatory burdens  among other goals   i have spent forty years both as a doctor and public servant putting people first  i regret that the recent events have created a distraction from these important objectives   he said  trump  currently trying to sell his tax cut plan and oversee the federal response to devastation wreaked by three hurricanes  saw the price drama as an unnecessary distraction and behind the scenes was telling aides  what was he thinking    a source close to the president said  price promised on thursday to repay the nearly    cost of his seats on private charter flights   the taxpayers won t pay a dime for my seat on those planes   price said  but that was not enough to satisfy trump  trump told reporters that the  optics  of price s travel were not good  since  as president he was trying to renegotiate u s  contracts to get a better deal for taxpayers   look  i think he s a very fine person  i certainly don t like the optics   trump said  price had also been seen in the white house as having been ineffective in getting congress to pass healthcare reform legislation  an effort that has fizzled on capitol hill  price was one of a handful of senior officials in trump s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft  sometimes for personal travel  when they could have flown commercial for less money  the white house issued an order late on friday saying use of private planes required approval from white house chief of staff john kelly and that the commercial air system was appropriate even for very senior officials with few exceptions  the washington post on friday reported that veterans affairs secretary david shulkin attended a wimbledon tennis match  toured westminster abbey and took a cruise on the thames this summer during a  day trip to discuss veterans  health issues in britain and denmark  shulkin  who traveled on a commercial airline  was accompanied on the trip by his wife  whose airfare was paid for by the government and who received a per diem for meals  the post said  noting that the department of veterans affairs said she was traveling on  approved invitational orders   his six person traveling party included an acting undersecretary of health and her husband as well as two aides  they were accompanied by a security detail of as many as six people  the post said   washington news media outlet politico has reported that price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since may at a cost to u s  taxpayers of more than     politico also reported he took approved military flights to africa and europe costing     senior u s  government officials travel frequently  but are generally expected to keep costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible  environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt and treasury secretary steve mnuchin have also been in the spotlight for their travel habits
