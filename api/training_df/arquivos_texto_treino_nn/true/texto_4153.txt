washington  reuters    an environmental group sued president donald trump s administration on thursday over the repeal of a u s  rule intended to protect wildlife  in the first court challenge to a law being used by republicans to ease federal regulation  in february  the republican controlled congress used the congressional review act  or cra  to dismantle a rule that the administration of former democratic president barack obama finalized in august to limit hunting on federal lands in alaska  the rule had exempted wolves and bears from alaska s plans to control predators  which included killing wolves and their pups in their dens and shooting bears from planes   the cra only requires simple majorities in the house of representatives and senate and the president s signature to wipe newly minted regulations off the books    in the federal court lawsuit  which likely has little chance of success  the center for biological diversity said the cra violated the u s  constitution because it barred regulators in the future from enacting  substantially similar  rules to the ones repealed     the congressional review act throws the balance of power out of whack and opens the door for politicians in congress to meddle in decisions that ought to be made by experts at federal agencies   said collette adkins  a biologist and attorney at the center   by law the fish and wildlife service must protect biological diversity on alaskan wildlife refuges  but the act makes it more difficult for agency officials to carry out their legal duty   she said in a statement  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the cra  drafted in   has a structure and language that abide by what the u s  supreme court said in the case ins v  chadha  likely making it constitutional  said karl manheim  professor of law at loyola law school in los angeles  since feb    trump has signed  congressional resolutions repealing rules on the environment  education  gun control  corruption and family planning  most advocacy groups that had tried to block the resolutions said this week they were not intending to file similar suits    unfortunately i don t think there s an avenue for courts to overturn a cra resolution   said alison zieve who works in litigation for the liberal public citizen group
