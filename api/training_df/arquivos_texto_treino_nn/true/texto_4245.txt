washington  reuters    the trump administration on thursday issued a final rule that will shorten the obamacare enrollment period and give insurers more of what they say they need in the individual insurance market  likely making it harder for some consumers to purchase insurance  healthcare experts said   it could also raise out of pocket medical expenses  the experts said  because it gives insurers more flexibility in determining the value of their coverage  the rule  which takes effect later this year  comes as president donald trump and republicans in congress have renewed efforts to repeal and replace the affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  after an effort to pass a bill in the u s  house of representatives failed last month   issued by a division of the u s  department of health and human services and first proposed in february  the rule aims to aid insurers  who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in the individual insurance markets set up by obamacare  several major insurers  including humana inc and aetna inc  have announced plans to exit some state exchanges in    insurers welcomed the rule but said there is still too much uncertainty in the market  on wednesday  trump told the wall street journal that he may withhold obamacare payments to insurers that amount to about   billion a year to force democrats back to the negotiating table   marilyn tavenner  president and chief executive of america s health insurance plans  said in a statement that funding for the payments must continue uninterrupted  otherwise  she said premiums will rise  percent across the market and more insurers would drop out of the exchanges    the changes under thursday s final rule include a shortened open enrollment period for obamacare plans  they also make it harder for people to enroll outside that period  which is allowed under certain circumstances such as a pregnancy or a move   the rule could also allow insurers to collect unpaid premium payments and make it tougher for people to move in and out of insurance plans  according to healthcare industry experts   insurers say  gaming the system  has created an unprofitable mix of healthy and sick customers  the rule also gives states broader authority by removing the federal government s role in overseeing doctor and hospital networks included in insurance plans  republicans have said any healthcare reform or overhaul must give states more flexibility  the affordable care act enabled  million americans to gain insurance  mostly through the individual insurance markets set up by the law or through an expansion of medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled
