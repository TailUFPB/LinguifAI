washington  reuters    pennsylvania s attorney general is leading the charge among his democratic peers preparing to shore up protections for borrowers and savers while president donald trump follows through on a pledge to defang a powerful consumer finance watchdog  since he was sworn in january  democrat josh shapiro has built up his own consumer finance unit in preparation for when republican trump s officials take over the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   the unit is staffed with more than a dozen people and led by a former senior cfpb attorney  shapiro and this team have already filed cases against navient  navi o   a student loan servicer  which is accused of deceiving borrowers in order to drive up profits  and are leading a  state investigation into hacking at equifax  efx n   a consumer credit bureau   we re demonstrating a capacity to handle these big  complex consumer financial protection cases   shapiro told reuters  adding that attorneys general from both parties have asked about how they can  mimic our efforts   navient has said it operates within federal laws and rules on student loans  and has contested similar charges brought by the cfpb in court  an equifax spokesperson said the company cannot comment on pending litigation   but we remain focused on helping our customers  as well as their employees and consumers  to navigate this situation   shapiro expects his case load will grow  particularly now that trump has installed his budget director and fierce cfpb critic  mick mulvaney  as temporary chief of the agency  the press office at the office of management and budget  which is currently handling public relations for cfpb  said it was too early to comment on democratic attorneys  plans   however  of course we will carry out what we are statutorily obliged to enforce   spokesman john czwartacki said  created in the wake of the   financial crisis to crack down on predatory financial practices  the cfbp has long been criticized by republicans  including trump  who say it is far too powerful and burdens lenders with red tape   shapiro is part of a group of democratic attorneys general from powerful and large states such as california and new york who disagree with trump s call for financial deregulation     since trump s inauguration in january  those top law enforcement officials have sued the administration at least  times over its crackdown on immigration and dismantling of regulations across a range of areas from energy to education   when it comes to financial consumer protection state attorneys general wield an additional potentially powerful weapon  a little known provision of the  dodd frank law  which created the cfpb  gives them the authority to enforce the agency s rules and its broad ban on  unfair  deceptive and abusive  practices beyond state lines  states have rarely used those provisions while richard cordray  appointed by president barack obama and known for aggressively pursuing financial firms  was in charge of the watchdog  but with his departure last week  mulvaney freezing new rulemakings and hiring and a permanent successor expected to loosen the watchdog s regulation and enforcement  top attorneys in states such as pennsylvania and california say they are preparing to get more active   if we have to do this with just states that makes it more difficult but that doesn t make it impossible   said california attorney general xavier becerra  a democrat  one difficulty for states wanting to pursue federal enforcement cases and go after financial firms across state lines  is that  by law  they must notify the cfpb  said ori lev  consumer financial services partner at law firm mayer brown   if they proceed without the cfpb  blessing or if the agency changes its mind about a case  then the agency could challenge them in federal court  and they would most likely have to defer to the cfpb  said c  boyden gray  a founding partner of boyden gray   associates  who works with the conservative federalist society on tracking regulation  still  attorneys general have jurisdiction to sue institutions operating in their states under state consumer protection laws and they could join forces to pursue cases nationally  attorneys general contacted by reuters and the democratic attorneys general association  representing  officials  or nearly half the top state attorneys in the country  said they were prepared to take on more cases  washington attorney general bob ferguson said his office s consumer finance division now had  attorneys  compared with  four years ago    consequently  we are well positioned to use all the tools available to us to protect washingtonians if a new leader of the cfpb does not share director cordray s vigor for protecting consumers   the democrat said   before the consumer watchdog was created  states often took the lead in cases involving consumer lenders  as ohio s attorney general  cordray  for example  led the investigation of financial firms which precipitated the financial crisis  winning more than   billion in settlements for the state and its pension funds  consumer advocacy groups have generally applauded the work of both the cfpb and the states on consumer protections  but some republican attorneys general have sided with trump on the need to rein in the federal watchdog   in a nov   letter to trump  republican attorneys from west virginia  texas  alabama  arkansas and oklahoma said mulvaney would help curb  the cfpb s practice of overreaching regulation that harms the interests of consumers and small financial institutions   anticipating more state activity  maria earley  partner at the law firm reed smith  has been advising clients facing cfpb charges against stalling in hopes the watchdog will become more lenient under trump   you may want to litigate to run out the clock  but you re going to have six  seven  eight states who will start looking into you   earley said  adding she has settled three cfpb cases for clients since trump took office  reuters could not independently verify this number  michelle rogers  a partner with buckley sandler  said wall street may end up with increased regulatory complexity rather than relief as the state attorneys step in   they are more nimble than a big federal agency  they have their own staff  and their own agenda  and they can send out a subpoena on a whim on a broader set of issues   she said   this story corrects  paragraph to attribute idea to c  boyden gray  instead of ori lev
