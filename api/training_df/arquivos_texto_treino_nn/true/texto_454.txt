washington london  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday shared anti muslim videos posted on twitter by a far right british party leader  drawing condemnation from britain  u s  muslim groups and some members of congress  the white house defended the retweets by the republican president  who during the  u s  election campaign called for  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   saying that he was raising security issues  as president  trump has issued executive orders banning entry to some citizens of several muslim majority countries  although courts have partially blocked the measures from taking effect   look  i m not talking about the nature of the video   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters   the threat is real and that s what the president is talking about is the need for national security  the need for military spending  and those are very real things  there s nothing fake about that   jayda fransen  deputy leader of anti immigration britain first  posted the videos which she said showed a group of people who were muslims beating a teenage boy to death  battering a boy on crutches and destroying a christian statue  fransen was convicted earlier this month of abusing a muslim woman and was ordered to pay a fine and legal costs  some british lawmakers demanded an apology from trump for sharing the videos with his nearly  million twitter followers and u s  muslim groups said he had been incendiary and reckless   it is wrong for the president to have done this   the spokesman for british prime minister theresa may said   britain first seeks to divide communities through their use of hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions  they cause anxiety to law abiding people   the spokesman said  trump fired back at may over her criticism   theresa  theresamay  don t focus on me  focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom  we are doing just fine   trump tweeted  using an incorrect twitter handle for may  he later issued a tweet with her correct handle    theresamay       reuters was unable to immediately verify the videos and fransen herself said they had come from various online sources which had been posted on her social media pages   i m delighted   fransen  who has   twitter followers  told reuters  she said trump s retweets showed the president shared her aim of raising awareness of  issues such as islam   the white house repeatedly refused to be drawn into the content of the videos or whether trump was aware of the source of the tweets   it s about ensuring that individuals who come into the united states don t pose a public safety or terrorism threat   white house spokesman raj shah told reporters aboard air force one  fransen thanked trump and said   the important message here is donald trump has been made aware of the persecution and prosecution of a political leader in britain for giving what has been said by police to be an anti islamic speech   anti immigration one of the videos that trump retweeted first circulated on social and egyptian state media in   showing what appeared to be supporters of now ousted islamist president mohammed mursi throwing two youths from a concrete tower onto a roof  in reference to another video that was titled  muslim migrant beats up dutch boy on crutches    the netherlands embassy in the united states tweeted back at trump saying    realdonaldtrump facts do matter  the perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the netherlands  he received and completed his sentence under dutch law   trump s promotion of the videos contrasts with the way he often criticizes mainstream u s  media  lambasting some outlets for  fake news  when they air segments he regards as being against him   what we saw today is one of many videos that is circulating on anti muslim hate websites   said ilhan cagri with the u s  based muslim public affairs council   it is years old and simply aims to breed fear for muslims and islam and breed violence  it  has nothing to do with the practice of islam itself   cagri said  the anti defamation league said the retweets would only encourage  extremists and anti muslim bigots in the united states and abroad who exploit the propaganda value    such content is the engine that fuels extremist movements and will embolden bigots in the u s  who already believe the president is a fellow traveler   the adl said in a statement  democrats in congress and at least one republican lawmaker were also critical of trump    the violence depicted in these videos is horrific  but it is abhorrent that president trump would choose to deliberately fan the flames of hatred and religious bigotry   democratic u s  senator jack reed said in a statement  republican senator john mccain  a frequent critic of trump  said he was  surprised  that trump had chosen to retweet those videos   what do i think about it  obviously  surprised  surprised   he told reuters as he left a meeting with jordanian king abdullah at the u s  senate  britain first is a peripheral political party which wants to end all immigration and bring in a comprehensive ban on islam  with anyone found to be promoting the religion s ideology to be deported or imprisoned  the group  which rarely garners any media attention but attracts a few hundred protesters to its regular street demonstrations  states on its website it is a  loyalist movement   critics say it is simply racist  last week  fransen was charged by the police in northern ireland with using threatening  abusive or insulting words in a speech at a rally in belfast in august  along with the group s leader  she was also charged in september with causing religiously aggravated harassment over the distribution of leaflets and posting online videos during a court trial involving a number of muslim men accused and later convicted of rape  politicians in britain condemned trump  with jeremy corbyn  leader of the opposition labour party  describing his tweets as  abhorrent  dangerous and a threat to our society   in contrast  david duke  a former ku klux klan leader who has run for political office in louisiana  praised trump   he s condemned for showing us what the fake news media won t   duke wrote on twitter   thank god for trump  that s why we love him
