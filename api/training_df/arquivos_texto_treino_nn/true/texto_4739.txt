washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump and house of representatives leaders pushed on wednesday for votes for their plan to overhaul obamacare and said they were making progress in their efforts to win over conservative republicans who have demanded changes to the legislation  with a vote on the bill possible as soon as thursday  members of the house freedom caucus  a conservative republican faction  said they had been negotiating alterations to the plan with the white house   much of the discussion hinged on conservatives  desire to scrap what are labeled  essential health benefits    services that insurance plans are required to cover under the affordable care act  commonly called obamacare  such as mental health help   i can tell you that we re making great progress   mark meadows  chairman of the hardline conservative house freedom caucus  told reporters   we re not there yet  but we re hopeful    trump was to meet at the white house with members of the freedom caucus on thursday at   a m  the white house said  but while the president courted conservatives  the bill appeared to be losing traction among republican moderates  some of whom attended a meeting late wednesday in house speaker paul ryan s office  representative charlie dent  a leader of the  tuesday group  of house republican moderates  issued a statement saying he could not back the bill   i believe this bill  in its current form  will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many americans  particularly for low  to moderate income and older individuals   dent said in the statement  the chairman of the house rules committee  which met all day wednesday to set the rules for the bill s consideration on the house floor  said late on wednesday that the panel would resume its meeting on thursday  having made no definite decision on the timing of the floor vote  repealing and replacing democratic former president barack obama s  affordable care act is a first major test of trump s legislative ability and whether he can keep his big promises to business  plans aired by trump during his election campaign and his first two months in office lifted u s  stock markets to new highs  but stocks fell back sharply on tuesday as investors worried that a rough ride for the healthcare legislation could affect his ability to deliver on other big pieces of his agenda  from cutting taxes and regulation to boosting infrastructure  major stock indexes wobbled on wednesday  with the dow jones industrial average ending slightly down and the s p  slightly higher  investors are eagerly awaiting thursday s healthcare vote  which could be pivotal for trump s broader plans  the freedom caucus has objected to the bill because its members believe it is still too close to obamacare  representative steve king  a conservative who was among lawmakers who met trump on wednesday morning at the white house   said he would now vote for the bill because he got a commitment from trump to publicly advocate a change to the legislation when it reaches the senate  eliminating the essential benefits  which also include emergency room visits and maternity and newborn care   i have a full and firm commitment with many witnesses from president trump   king said in a video statement on youtube  meadows said the members of the freedom caucus had also discussed the essential benefits with the administration  conservatives say reducing or scrapping the mandates would bring down insurance premiums  on the other side  patient advocates say that not requiring the coverage would hurt both individuals and healthcare providers   it could leave countless people with too little coverage to meet their health care needs and drive higher rates of uncompensated care at hospitals already struggling to cover their costs   bruce siegel  president of america s essential hospitals  said in a statement  earlier on wednesday  a freedom caucus aide said more than  of its members were opposed  enough to stop the bill from passing  republicans cannot afford to lose more than  votes from their own party  since democrats are united in opposition  democrats  meanwhile  said amending the bill in the senate would affect procedure  and increase the amount of votes republicans would need in that chamber  currently  republicans intend to pass the plan through budget reconciliation  a process with little room for changes that only requires a simple majority to pass  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders also gave signs negotiations were making headway late on wednesday   we are continuing to move forward and adding new supporters constantly   she said   as we have indicated previously we are open to changes to the bill that make it better and grow its support   the primary aim of obama s signature legislation  passed in   was reducing the numbers of americans with no health coverage  twenty million people gained insurance under the law  the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated  million people would lose coverage under the republican plan by next year  it also said  million fewer people would be insured by       the republican plan would also rescind taxes created by obamacare  repeal penalties for not buying coverage  slash funding for the medicaid program for the poor  and modify subsidies that help individuals buy plans  in the two weeks since it was unveiled  shares of some hospital operators and health insurers have fallen more than  percent  if the healthcare bill passes the house  the senate could take it up next week  republican leaders hope that if the senate acts quickly  the bill could go back to the house for a final vote by mid april  possibly allowing trump to sign it into law by easter  april     opponents of the overhaul have been fiercely vocal  and on wednesday protesters  many in wheelchairs or with serious medical conditions  blocked the capitol rotunda for about an hour   rather go to jail than die without medicaid   they chanted  capitol police said they made  arrests and later released the protesters  aca vs  ahca  tmsnrt rs  where senators stand on the ahca  tmsnrt
