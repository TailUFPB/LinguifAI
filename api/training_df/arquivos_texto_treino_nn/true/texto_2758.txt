washington  reuters    the u s  state department will require all nations to provide extensive data to help it vet visa applicants and determine whether a traveler poses a terrorist threat  according to a cable obtained by reuters   countries that fail to comply with the new protocols or take steps to do so within  days could face travel sanctions   the cable  sent to all u s  diplomatic posts on wednesday   is a summary of a worldwide review of vetting procedures that was required under u s  president donald trump s revised march  executive order that temporarily banned u s  travel by most citizens from six predominantly muslim countries  the memo lays out a series of standards the united states will require of other countries  including that they issue  or have active plans to issue  electronic passports and regularly report lost and stolen passports to interpol   it also directs nations to provide  any other identity information  requested by washington for u s  visa applicants  including biometric or biographic details  the cable sets out requirements for countries to provide data on individuals it knows or has grounds to believe are terrorists as well as criminal record information   further  countries are asked not to block the transfer of information about u s  bound travelers to the u s  government and not to designate people for travel watchlists based solely on their political or religious beliefs   this is the first time that the u s  government is setting standards for the information that is required from all countries specifically in support of immigration and traveler vetting   the cable said   the cable can be read here   reut rs    the new requirements are the latest in a series of steps the trump administration says it is taking to better protect the united states from terrorist attack      however  former officials said much of the information sought is routinely shared between countries  including examples of passports and additional details about particular travelers that may present security concerns   some u s  allies may worry about privacy protections if washington is seen as seeking information beyond what is already shared  said john sandweg  a former senior homeland security department official now with the firm frontier solutions   i don t think you can ignore the political aspects of the unpopularity of the current administration  that puts political pressure to stand up to the administration   he said  the cable lays out risk factors the u s  government will consider when evaluating a country  some of these are controversial and could be difficult for countries to prove to u s  satisfaction  including ensuring  that they are not and do not have the potential to become a terrorist safe haven   countries are also expected to agree to take back citizens ordered removed from the united states  if they do not provide the information requested  or come up with an adequate plan to  countries could end up on a list to be submitted to trump for possible sanction  including barring  categories  of their citizens from entering the united states  the real worries for countries may not come until the results of this review are known  said leon rodriguez  the former director of u s  citizenship and immigration services   once they start making decisions i think that is where there is going to be a lot of anxiety   he said  saying delays in visa processing for nations that do not pose much of a threat could start to hurt  ordinary business and personal travel   the most controversial of trump s immigration related moves are two executive orders  challenged in federal court  which impose a temporary ban on travel to the united states for most citizens from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria  and yemen   while the orders were initially blocked from being enforced  the supreme court on june  allowed the ban to go into effect for people from the six nations with no strong ties to the united states   the cable requires countries to act quickly  but stressed that the united states would work with foreign nations to assess if they meet the standards and  if not  to come up with a plan to help them do so  the cable asks that u s  diplomats  underscore that while it is not our goal to impose a ban on immigration benefits  including visas  for citizens of any country  these standards are designed to mitigate risk  and failure to make progress could lead to security measures by the usg  including a presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain categories of foreign nationals of non compliant countries   the cable says the u s  government has made a preliminary determination that some countries do not meet the new standards and that others are  at risk  of not meeting them  it does not name these  listing them in a separate  classified cable  the state department declined comment on the cable  saying it would not discuss internal communications   the u s  government s national security screening and vetting procedures for visitors are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the united states   said a u s  state department official on condition of anonymity
