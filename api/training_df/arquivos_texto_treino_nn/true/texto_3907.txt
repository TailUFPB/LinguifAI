 reuters    u s  president donald trump signed an executive order on thursday that allows tax exempt churches to more actively participate in politics and could free religious organizations to deny employees insurance coverage for birth control pills  the order partially fulfills an oft repeated campaign promise by trump  who appealed to religious conservatives in his  run for the white house  although he would need an act of congress to rescind the underlying law that he has opposed  known as the johnson amendment  the order was widely praised by religious organizations that either felt hemmed in by the law or openly violated it  but others denounced it as putting women s health in jeopardy or weakening the u s  tradition of separating church and state   we will not allow people of faith to be targeted  bullied or silenced any more   trump said at a signing ceremony at the white house where religious leaders had gathered in support   no one should be censoring sermons or targeting pastors   he said  trump s order directs the internal revenue service to  alleviate the burden of the johnson amendment   the white house said in reference to a  law sponsored by lyndon johnson  then a texas senator who later became president  under that amendment  the tax code prohibits organizations that enjoy tax free status from participating in a political campaign or supporting any one candidate for elective office  the order also asks the government to issue rules that would allow religious groups such as the little sister of the poor to deny their employees insurance coverage for services that they oppose on religious grounds  such as birth control pills  those employees would be forced to go outside their employer provided insurance plan for subsidized contraceptives  said lori windham  a lawyer who represents the group   today s announcement is a great day for the little sisters   windham said  the american civil liberties union had threatened a lawsuit to stop the order but later backed off  saying the most onerous provisions had yet to be enacted and that it falls way short of meeting trump s pledge to  totally destroy  the johnson amendment  at least one expert said trump s order appears legally sound  rolling back the johnson amendment does not favor any particular religious views over others  and the president has broad authority to decide not to enforce certain laws  said robin fretwell wilson  a professor at the university of illinois college of law
