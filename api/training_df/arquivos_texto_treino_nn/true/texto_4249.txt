washington  reuters    at first glance  u s  president donald trump and federal reserve chair janet yellen may have little in common   yellen is an academic economist and veteran of democratic administrations who is committed to an open global economy  while trump is a real estate mogul with an electoral base suspicious of the economic order yellen helped to create  yet the two may have interests in common now that trump is president and both want to get as many americans working as possible   since her appointment as fed chair in february   yellen has kept interest rates low and she currently pledges to raise them only slowly even though unemployment  at   percent  is at its lowest in nearly ten years   meanwhile  trump s election campaign promises to cut taxes  spend money on infrastructure and deregulate banking  have  helped propel a surge in the u s  conference board s consumer confidence index to its highest level since the internet stocks crash  years ago  former fed staff and colleagues who know yellen said trump s surprising remarks this week in a wall street journal interview  in which he did not rule out yellen s reappointment to a new four year term next year  are not as outlandish as they may appear now that the president has a vested interest in keeping markets and the economy on an even keel   and the same staff and colleagues say yellen may well accept reappointment  despite trump s criticism of her during last year s election campaign   many in trump s republican party have called for tighter monetary policy and a less activist fed  but  the president would not really find that useful   said former fed vice chair donald kohn   if trump fills three existing federal reserve board vacancies with people yellen thinks she could work with   it would be really difficult to turn down  a reappointment when her term as chair expires in february    if she continues to do well  he d be nuts to ditch her for an unknown quantity   said university of california  berkeley  economics professor andrew rose  a long time colleague and co author with yellen of an oft cited study of labor markets  yellen took over from ben bernanke as fed chair in february  with the u s  economic recovery from the  financial crisis still on shaky ground  and she has made no secret she puts a priority on growth in jobs and wages and a broad recovery in u s  household wealth   in a slow return to more normal monetary policy  yellen has stopped the purchase of additional financial securities by the fed and in december  began raising short term interest rates for the first time in  years  so far those policy shifts have been engineered with little apparent impact on job growth  and so mesh with trump s core election campaign promises to restore employment and earnings  the slow rise in interest rates in the past year has also happened while u s  stock prices have risen to record highs  though trump has claimed the credit for himself    there is precedent for trump to stick with a former president s fed chair appointment  paul volcker  alan greenspan and ben bernanke  the three previous fed chairs  served at least two four year terms and were nominated by both democratic and republican presidents   however it may be a more difficult step for trump    during last year s election campaign  trump accused yellen of accepting orders from then president obama to keep interest rates low for political reasons  and he said he would replace her as fed chair because she is not a republican party member   in a particularly biting moment last year  in a campaign video advertisement  he labeled her as among the  global special interests  who had ruined life for middle america   the fed on thursday said it had no response to trump s comments published on wednesday on yellen and or on whether yellen would consider a second term   some of trump s advisers and some republican lawmakers want a more conservative fed in which the chair has less power and would see a yellen reappointment as yet another step away from his promise to  drain the swamp  of the washington establishment  there are also three current vacancies on the fed s seven member board of governors  and unorthodox new members could make it difficult for yellen to manage policy or accept another four year term  but if the choice is her consensus style or someone unproven in their ability to manage public and market expectations   he d be wise to reappoint her   said joseph gagnon  a former fed staffer and berkeley colleague of yellen s currently at the peterson institute for international economics   i don t see what is in his interests to appoint someone who is going to jack up interest rates
