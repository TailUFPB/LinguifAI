san francisco  reuters    facebook inc  fb o  on thursday launched an overhaul of how it handles paid political advertisements  giving a concession to u s  lawmakers who have threatened to regulate the world s largest social network over secretive ads that run during election campaigns  the company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators the   political ads that it says were likely purchased by russian entities during and after the  u s  presidential election   chief executive mark zuckerberg said the company  for the first time  would now make it possible for anyone to see any political ads that run on facebook  no matter whom they target   facebook will also demand that political advertisers disclose who is paying for the advertisements  a requirement that under u s  law applies to political ads on television but not on social media    we will work with others to create a new standard for transparency in online political ads   zuckerberg said   zuckerberg  broadcasting live on facebook from company headquarters in menlo park  california  said the changes would help address concerns that governments including russia are using facebook ads to meddle in other countries  elections  earlier this month  facebook said an internal review had shown that an operation likely based in russia spent    on   facebook ads promoting divisive messages in the months before and after last year s u s  presidential election  the company initially declined to turn over details on the ads to congress  u s  congressional investigators and special counsel robert mueller are examining alleged russian election interference  which moscow has denied  investigators are interested in other companies as well  representatives for twitter inc  twtr n  are set to meet next week with staff from the senate intelligence committee in relation to inquiries into the  election   representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  said on thursday that he wants to hear from facebook  alphabet inc s  googl o  google  twitter and others in public hearings    it will be important for the committee to scrutinize how rigorous facebook s internal investigation has been  to test its conclusions and to understand why it took as long as it did   schiff said in a statement  the political advertising changes represent a retreat for facebook  which for years has resisted calls from transparency advocates and academics for the regulation of political ads  the company has instead treated them like all commercial ads  in the days after the november  u s  election  zuckerberg said it was a  crazy idea  to think that misinformation on facebook swayed the vote toward president donald trump   senator mark warner  the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee  this month compared political ads on social media to the  wild  wild west  and said legislation might be needed to address them   the u s  federal election commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes to digital ads and considered whether to call facebook and other tech firms before the commission for a public hearing   facebook has grown to be the leading online platform for political ads because of its low costs and tools for targeting messages to narrow audiences   u s  political campaigns likely spent   million on facebook ads during the  election cycle  according to nomura analysts  though the exact amount is unknown   it remained unclear whether facebook s voluntary changes would satisfy demands for government action   warner and another senator  democrat amy klobuchar  on thursday sent a letter to colleagues inviting them to be co sponsors of legislation they are writing that would formalize and expand the commitments zuckerberg made   the legislation  they wrote  would require digital platforms with  million or more users to maintain a publicly available file of all election related ads bought by people who spend more than     according to a copy of the letter seen by reuters   trevor potter  president of the pro transparency campaign legal center  said in a statement that his group would  carefully monitor facebook s implementation of this new policy   he said facebook  helped create the secrecy that gave rise to foreign interference in the  elections   in the past  facebook has argued that ad details had to remain confidential unless released by the advertisers  zuckerberg  who returned to work on thursday after a month of paternity leave  laid out other steps the company would take to prevent governments from using facebook to manipulate each other s elections   he said facebook would hire  additional people  expand partnerships with election commissions around the world  and adapt systems to help deter political bullying   facebook has not found an attempt at election meddling in germany  zuckerberg said  but he added that the company would continue to examine fake accounts that it has removed in advance of sunday s german national election    i don t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy  that s not what we stand for   zuckerberg said   facebook general counsel colin stretch said in a blog post on thursday that it was unusual for facebook to voluntarily turn over information to government authorities  as it was doing by giving u s  lawmakers copies of ads  the company has long had a rigid policy of refusing to turn over any user information without a court order or other legal process    but ultimately  stretch wrote   we believe the public deserves a full accounting of what happened in the  election
