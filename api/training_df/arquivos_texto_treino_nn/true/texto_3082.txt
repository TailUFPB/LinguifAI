washington  reuters    two studies that president donald trump hopes will buttress his case to cut the number of refugees are at the heart of a fight between senior white house adviser stephen miller and career u s  government officials over immigration policy  four current and former officials said      trump in march ordered the u s  state department and other agencies to tally only the costs of resettling refugees but not the benefits that policy experts said refugees can also bring  including tax revenues  professional skills and job creation  a current official said miller had convened meetings with state department staffers to discuss the refugee cost reports  when department specialists proposed including refugees  economic contributions in the studies to produce a more balanced assessment  miller rebuffed the idea  one current and one former u s  official said  the white house said miller did not hold meetings on the specific subject of the cost reports and that trump s overall fiscal year  budget proposal sought to  make transparent the net budgetary effects of immigration programs and policy   the current and former officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said they believe  however  that the administration wants to help make a case to restrict refugee flows by creating a skewed analysis   it s a policy outcome in search of a rationale   said a former u s  official familiar with the debate  the white house disputed the notion that miller was seeking to tailor the outcome of the reports  which are to be compiled mainly by the state department s bureau of population  refugees and migration  prm     the idea that we are ordering biased reports is false   said michael short  a white house spokesman  the tensions over the reports  due in september  have not been previously reported  miller has a history of backing curbs on immigration  he  was the architect of trump s order in january suspending the refugee program for  days and refugees from syria indefinitely  that order  which also temporarily barred travelers from seven muslim majority countries  was largely blocked by the courts  as was a second executive order  miller was not available for an interview  r c  hammond  a senior adviser to secretary of state rex tillerson  said a department staffer who attended budget meetings recalled miller  suggesting the state department review the methodology and findings of existing studies  on refugees   essentially  suggesting we learn how others have examined the issue and see if there is anything we can learn   hammond said in an email   my colleague did not take away the sense that any instructions were given to include or not include certain information   hammond he did not identify the state department staffer  tensions in the government over trump s immigration policies began with trump s executive order  which prompted about  state department employees to sign an internal memo dissenting against it in january  weeks later  the right wing breitbart website  which has close ties to the white house  published a story calling for the firing   among others   of the two top officials in the department of health and human services  office of refugee resettlement and three senior officials at the prm bureau  breitbart listed the officials by name  but it did not mention the reports on refugee costs  career officials cannot be fired  but can be reassigned  there is no evidence the five have been reassigned  trump promised a hardline immigration policy during his  presidential campaign  he called at one point for a complete ban on muslims entering the united states  citing security reasons amid a series of attacks worldwide by islamist militants  for the first report  trump ordered a tally of  the estimated long term costs of the united states refugee admissions program at the federal  state  and local levels  along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs   trump directed that the second report estimate  how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum  near their home countries  for the same long term cost as supporting refugees in the united states  taking into account the full lifetime cost of federal  state  and local benefits  and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere   refugee policy experts said that while more refugees can be supported in third country camps for a given sum than settled in the united states  that support does not provide a permanent solution as resettlement can  most studies show that refugees entering the united states require more government services than immigrants as a whole  but scholars differ over the long term economic impact of accepting refugees  which can depress low skilled workers  wages and require all workers to help pay for social services that refugees receive  during their first eight years in the united states  refugees receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes  a study published this month by the nonprofit national bureau for economic research said   after the eighth year  taxes paid tend to be greater than the benefits received   by an average of    over a  year period  the study found  jessica vaughan of the center for immigration studies  which favors limiting immigration  agreed that accountings such as those trump ordered should not be limited to costs    it s only fair to consider any fiscal benefits   she said  the four current and former u s  officials said the high level white house focus on the reports has sent a clear signal about the outcome trump wants   when the white house calls and expresses interest   in a report of this nature  given all the things that the national security council and people around the president have to worry about  that sends an enormously profound signal to the bureaucracy   one of the former officials said
