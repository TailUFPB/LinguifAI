washington  reuters    president donald trump is considering nominating federal reserve governor jerome powell and stanford university economist john taylor for the central bank s top two jobs  in an apparent bid to reassure markets and appease conservatives hungry for change   under that scenario  either powell or taylor would take the reins from fed chair janet yellen when her term expires in early february  and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when stanley fischer retired this month      that is something that is under consideration  but he hasn t ruled out a number of options  he ll have an announcement on that soon  in the coming days   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters on friday  making powell  a soft spoken centrist who has supported yellen s gradual approach to raising interest rates  the next fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investors crave  the addition of taylor  who has backed an overhaul of the fed and embraced a more rigid rule oriented monetary policy  would be a feather in the cap of conservative republicans who feel that monetary policy has been too loose under yellen  who was named as fed chair by democratic president barack obama and has led the central bank since february    i think powell might be the safer pick insofar as we know what we re getting   said michael feroli  chief u s  economist at j p  morgan chase   he s a guy who obviously knows the fed culture  how the  policy setting  committee operates  so for some of those soft skills we know he would be effective    powell has embraced the yellen fed s monetary policy  keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wages higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation   taylor has spent the last two decades refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lays out where interest rates ought to be  given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy  his rule implies that rates should be higher than they are now  yellen  speaking at an economic conference in washington on friday evening  mounted a strong defense of the tools the fed has used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there was a risk of another crisis in which those  unconventional policies  may be needed again  yellen  who trump has indicated could still be named to another term as fed chair  was not asked about the fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process  although taylor is highly regarded within the fed  his rule based rate setting position has spurred criticism that he would handcuff u s  monetary policy  taylor pushed back at a meeting at the boston fed on saturday  saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rules and did not want to tie the fed s hands or suggest that he was motivated by a distrust of policymakers    i think that s completely incorrect   he said   i trust policymakers   rules  are an effort to make policy better   some analysts suggest that fears that taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the fed  as some republicans in congress hope  are likely exaggerated   there is some scope for disappointment if people think putting taylor in will just lead to mechanical based policy   feroli said  cleveland fed president loretta mester  speaking with reporters on friday  seemed to agree   even if you pick a rule  the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy   she said   but i do think being systematic  looking at the kinds of information we look at systematically over time  articulating our strategy for policy and being less discretionary is a good idea    at the same time  there are concerns that the combination of powell and taylor atop the world s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to markets   it is unclear whether trump  who has criticized yellen s stewardship but also said on several occasions that he preferred rates to stay low  wants to dramatically alter the fed s direction  although he appears to be tilting to powell and taylor  in addition to yellen the republican president has interviewed his top economic adviser gary cohn and former fed governor kevin warsh for the fed chief position
