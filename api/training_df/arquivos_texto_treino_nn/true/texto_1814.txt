washington  reuters    president donald trump signed a bill on friday extending the government debt limit for three months and providing about   billion in hurricane related aid  bringing his surprising deal with democratic congressional leaders this week to completion  the bill  approved in a   vote by the u s  house of representatives  had drawn criticism from some  conservative members of congress  but the senate passed it on thursday and the republican president signed it soon after arriving at camp david  maryland  for the weekend  despite controversy  lawmakers had rushed to approve the legislation  which provides    billion for emergency disaster aid  before government aid ran out at week s end as americans deal with two deadly hurricanes including irma  a potentially catastrophic storm poised to strike florida on sunday  hurricane harvey  which came ashore on aug   as the most powerful hurricane to hit texas in more than  years  killed about  people  displaced more than  million  and the state governor has said it caused up to   billion in damage  the bill raised questions about the relationship between trump  a political outsider who took office in january  and republican party regulars  he has frequently criticized senate leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan  and his deal on wednesday with democratic congressional leaders senator chuck schumer and representative nancy pelosi was an especially troublesome shock for conservative members  conservatives  souring relations with the administration are likely to remain a factor as congress and the white house now face a dec   deadline on the debt limit and government spending  asked about trump working so closely with democrats on the legislation  white house press secretary sarah sanders said       i think that the president s focus was doing what was best for the american people  i think the last thing we want to do is play partisan politics when we have people in places like texas and louisiana that need financial support through the federal government   a white house statement issued after trump signed the bill said   the president appreciates congress putting aside partisan politics and acting quickly to ensure that first responders  local officials  and federal emergency management personnel have the resources they need    before the vote  u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin and white house budget director mick mulvaney had pleaded the white house s case to republican lawmakers at a friday morning meeting  it was not well received by some   there s a lot of disappointment in the decision the president made and the way our leadership was treated   said house republican representative hal rogers  describing a sense of  animosity  at the meeting   that s a sore spot  it s not a happy camp    there was some hissing and i don t know if there was some booing  but there were some groans   republican representative mark walker said  mulvaney told the representatives now was not the time to discuss washington fiscal problems because of the hurricanes  conservatives reminded him that during his days as one of the most conservative members of congress  he had been a strong advocate for threatening government shutdowns in order to win concessions on spending   it got a little warm for him a few times   walker said  more moderate republicans welcomed the bipartisan approach   if we can reach across the aisle  we can get things done and not be held hostage by  or  people   said representative peter king   you can t just have one party govern       the bill s    billion in emergency funding includes    billion for the disaster relief fund at the federal emergency management agency    million for the small business administration s disaster loan program and    billion for the community development block grant program at the department of housing and urban development  some conservative groups had objected to coupling a debt limit increase with the emergency funds  but mcconnell moved ahead at trump s urging  walker said mnuchin gave conservatives little hope that the trump administration would fight to include the spending restrictions they want to see in the next debt ceiling increase in december  in wednesday s meeting with congressional leaders  trump had sought to work out a deal to attach to the disaster funding two short term  three month measures to fund the federal government at current levels and extended its borrowing limit  known as the debt ceiling   current government funding was set to expire at the end of the month  with a possible government shutdown looming  and the u s  treasury had asked congress to raise the debt limit immediately  some house republicans balked at attaching the two crucial fiscal measures to the bill and called it a win for democrats  republicans had wanted to raise the debt ceiling for a longer period that would have extended past the  midterm elections  republican senator ben sasse said on thursday the deal makes schumer  the most powerful man in america for the month of december   the three month term of the debt limit and spending deal could give democrats a better chance of winning higher government spending levels in december  republicans fear that having to deal with spending and debt again so soon will distract them from other issues  such as tax reform
