washington  reuters    a bipartisan deal from two senators to stabilize obamacare by restoring subsidies to health insurers suffered major setbacks on wednesday with the white house saying president donald trump now opposes it and senior republicans speaking out against it  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch  senate republican leadership member john thune and others expressed hostility to the deal announced on tuesday by republican lamar alexander and democrat patty murray  it was uncertain if it would ever come to a vote in a congress controlled by trump s fellow republicans  the agreement would shore up obamacare by reviving billions of dollars of federal subsidies to insurers for two years to help lower income americans obtain medical coverage  alexander said on wednesday that trump had  completely engineered  the bipartisan proposal  but the president backed away from support he had expressed a day earlier  on tuesday  trump said the white house was involved in the negotiations and that the agreement was  a very good solution  for a short term approach  but said on wednesday he could  never support bailing out  insurance companies  trump has cut off subsidies to the companies  saying congress has not provided money for them and that they enrich insurers  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump did not support the deal in its current form  although she called it  a good step in the right direction    look  we ve said all along that we want something that doesn t just bail out the insurance companies but actually provides relief for all americans   she said at a briefing   and this bill doesn t address that fact   the confusion among lawmakers in both parties over trump s position on the healthcare deal and the lack of trust some of them have in the president come as congress is entering a crucial period when important bills on federal spending  the u s  debt limit and tax cuts are due for consideration  thune said the agreement might have  stalled out  and that its future was an  open question   republicans have a   senate majority  but other than alexander only a few have publicly embraced the plan  including senators john mccain  susan collins  lisa murkowski  mike rounds and bob corker   no way to pay for it   hatch said   oh my gosh  give me a break  i appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right  but it doesn t help   trump  who campaigned on a promise to get rid of obamacare but has been frustrated by the failure of republicans in congress to pass legislation to do so  also made clear he wanted broader legislation to repeal and replace the law   lamar alexander s working on it very hard from our side  and if something can happen  that s fine   trump told reporters at the white house   but i won t do anything to enrich the insurance companies      they ve been enriched by obamacare like nothing anybody s ever seen before   insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies under the affordable care act  former democratic president barack obama s signature legislative achievement dubbed obamacare  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people  ending the subsidies  which are called cost sharing reduction payments  could create chaos in the  health insurance markets set up under obamacare  some leading insurers  including unitedhealth group  aetna inc and humana inc  have largely exited those markets  citing financial losses  others including anthem inc have significantly reduced their presence in the state based markets  ryan gave no indication of willingness to consider the alexander murray agreement   the speaker does not see anything that changes his view that the senate should keep its focus on repeal and replace of obamacare   ryan spokesman doug andres said  the proposal drew broad democratic support  top senate democrat chuck schumer ripped trump for his shifting stances on the alexander murray deal   this president cannot govern if  whenever the hard right frightens him and says   jump   he says   how high    schumer told reporters   the president is pointing fingers   schumer said   he blames  senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell for obstruction  he blames the democrats for obstruction  he s the obstructionist in chief because he cannot stick to a position   the proposal would meet some democratic objectives  such as reviving subsidies for obamacare and restoring   million in funding for a federal program that helps people enroll in insurance plans  in exchange  republicans would get more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  democratic attorneys general from  states and the district of columbia who have filed a legal challenge to the subsidy cutoff asked a judge in california to direct the administration by thursday to continue the payments  at a hearing on wednesday  u s  district judge vince chhabria in san francisco said he would likely rule on the states  request next week  murray  speaking to reuters on wednesday  said her agreement with alexander was still very much alive   absolutely   murray said   lamar and i are working to have a good set of co sponsors   and hope to formally introduce it as a senate bill on thursday
