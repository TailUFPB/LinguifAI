washington  reuters    the head of the u s  environmental protection agency  scott pruitt  said on friday he believes human activity plays a role in global warming  but measuring that contribution with precision is difficult  speaking to reporters at the white house a day after president donald trump said he would withdraw the united states  from the paris climate accord  pruitt declined to directly answer questions about whether the president still believed global warming was a hoax  as he had said during the  presidential campaign pruitt said he had indicated that global warming is occurring  and that  human activity contributes to it in some manner  measuring with precision  from my perspective  the degree of human contribution is very challenging
