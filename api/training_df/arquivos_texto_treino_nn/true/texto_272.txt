new york  lpc ifr    u s  regulators said they are open to revising restrictions on leveraged lending  offering an olive branch to a gop controlled congress keen to roll back banking regulations  the three main u s  bank regulatory agencies  in recent letters seen by reuters  said they could revisit the guidelines they put in place in   critics say those guidelines have hampered business  and members of congress started pressing for a rollback shortly after donald trump s inauguration as president  in theory  the guidelines prevent banks from loaning money when doing so would put the borrower s leverage at six times or higher  or for companies that could not quickly pay down debt   they were broadly intended to prevent the kind of egregious and wanton lending widely seen as contributing to the last global financial crisis   us senator pat toomey asked the government accountability office   the investigative arm of congress   if the guidelines rose to the level of formal rules  the gao decided in october that they do  meaning congress has the right to amend or eliminate the guidelines   which many bankers feel have hampered growth   altogether  but to forestall that development  the federal reserve  office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation said they could seek further feedback on the guidelines  the three agencies sent their letters to representative blaine luetkemeyer  head of the house financial services subcommittee  who asked them to stop enforcing the guidelines   this is positive   said richard farley  head of the leveraged finance group at law firm kramer levin   it seems both congress and regulators are looking towards a revised guidance from the agencies to avoid the  guidance being revoked and leaving the market in limbo   several specialists with knowledge of the situation said the response from regulators indicated a desire to avoid a protracted battle with a congress inclined against regulation  under the  congressional review act  congress is entitled to review   and vote to eliminate   formal regulations issued by government agencies  senator toomey asked the gao to decide whether the leveraged lending guidelines  created after the financial crisis  rose to the level of regulations that fall under the act  experts say the three agencies have decided to revisit the guidelines  rather than risk a fight on capitol hill that could limit the ability to issue similar guidance in future  two people closely following the matter said the regulators had given congress the opportunity to declare victory  while preserving their prerogatives  both described the decision as a purely political one that had little to do with the actual leveraged lending restrictions   if congress votes them down  then the agencies are basically barred from coming back   said jacques schillaci  a banking regulation specialist at law firm linklaters   if the agencies now come out with something that addresses the concerns and gives banks a bit more leeway  it gives toomey the ability to say  we got what we wanted    the three agencies declined to comment  requests for comment went unanswered by the offices of luetkemeyer and toomey  bankers have frequently complained that the guidelines do not prevent highly leveraged lending from occurring  but only keep their own regulated institutions from getting the business  instead  they say  lenders not subject to the guidelines  such as non bank investment firms  get to pick up the business that they cannot touch   and the numbers suggest they are right  according to data from lpc  two thirds of leveraged buyouts through the first three quarters of  had leverage above six times   and more than   topped seven times  the last time the percentage of lbos with seven times leverage was this high was in   just before the financial crisis kicked in   and not all of that is from institutions exempt from the guidelines  mainstream banks are still able to arrange deals well in excess of the six times leverage threshold  this can be done by inflating a company s ebitda through adjustments   which makes the leverage seem smaller   or by showing the company can generate enough cash to bring leverage down quickly thereafter  recent financings for tekni plex and avantor  for example  were all marketed with leverage of around or above seven times   whatever the methodology  the fact that the guidelines have not entirely prevented leverage topping six times suggests to some in the market that the fuss about them is overblown   the leveraged lending guidelines are a non issue   said jay ptashek  a leveraged finance partner at law firm kirkland   ellis   people understand the guard rails and are complying  whatever that means  leverage is generally being maxed out within those guidelines
