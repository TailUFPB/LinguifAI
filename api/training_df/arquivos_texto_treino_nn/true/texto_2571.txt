washington  reuters    president donald trump exhorted every republican to vote yes on a healthcare overhaul when it comes before the senate this week  but one of his party s most vocal opponents of the bill  senator susan collins  said he had made no effort to reach her   the democrats aren t giving us one vote  so we need virtually every single vote from the republicans  not easy to do   trump declared monday in the white house  appearing with families he said had been harmed by obamacare  hours later on capitol hill  collins  one of a handful of republican holdouts and the party s most reliable moderate in the senate  said she had not heard from trump   i ve had conversations with vice president  mike  pence  and seema verma  and reince priebus has called me a few times  to discuss the bill  but the president understandably i think is focusing on others   collins said in an interview on monday evening with reuters  verma is the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services and priebus is white house chief of staff   asked if trump had given up on her  collins said   i don t know but it sounded that way from one of his press statements that i saw  he said something like    susan collins  she s from maine   as if that explained it   after a mostly hands off approach to the senate debate on healthcare over the past few weeks  trump urged fellow republicans on monday to deliver on their promise of the past seven years to repeal and replace the  affordable care act  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law  popularly known as obamacare  a defeat in the senate would be a major setback for trump and congressional republicans  who view obamacare as government intrusion in the healthcare market  critics warn the republican bill will deprive millions of health insurance  collins  who voted two years ago against a repeal of obamacare  repeated on monday she would vote  no  on a motion to proceed to any of the known versions of the legislation now being circulated to repeal or overhaul the healthcare law   the  year old maine lawmaker refused to try to predict what the outcome would be when the senate votes on tuesday on whether to open debate on a republican healthcare bill  once that episode is over  she said she hoped lawmakers would start work on a bipartisan bill on healthcare   my hope is that we ll end up going back to committee and doing what we should have in the first place  which is having hearings  perhaps coming up with several smaller bills to address the very real problems created by the affordable care act   she said  representatives of the trump administration  asked whether the president intended to contact recalcitrant senators such as collins  said others in the administration had done so    we ve talked to virtually every single republican senator   health and human services secretary tom price told reporters  noting that collins had been at the white house on a number of occasions   collins said lawmakers would first need to address the collapse of insurance markets in many counties across the country  she said congress should fund cost sharing subsidies that help keep down consumers  out of pocket costs  collins  who said she had held individual discussions with at least eight senate democrats about some kind of bipartisan healthcare effort  said she believed trump would sign a bipartisan healthcare bill   at times he called for a bipartisan bill  and so i think he d be fine with a bipartisan bill   she was forthright about her problems with the senate republican approach  including its sweeping cuts to medicaid  the government healthcare program for the poor  and the expected increase in costs for older americans who buy private health insurance  maine s population is older  mostly rural  and one fifth of the population is on medicaid  the median age is   the oldest in the country    in northern maine  where the  insurance  rates are highest  and the population is older  the information from what i ve seen  it  the cost of insurance  would be like a third of their income in some cases  so i m very concerned about that   collins said
