washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump struck a blow against the  iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers  choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it  trump announced the major shift in u s  policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for extremist groups in the middle east  he accused iran of  not living up to the spirit  of the nuclear agreement and said his goal is to ensure tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon  in effect throwing the fate of the deal to congress   he singled out iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps for sanctions and delivered a blistering critique of tehran  which he accused of destabilizing actions in syria  yemen and iraq   we will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence  more terror and the very real threat of iran s nuclear breakout   trump said  trump s hardline remarks drew praise from israel  iran s arch foe  but was criticized by european allies  the move by trump was part of his  america first  approach to international agreements which has led him to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord and the trans pacific partnership trade talks and renegotiate the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico  his iran strategy angered tehran and put washington at odds with other signatories of the accord   britain  france  germany  russia  china and the european union   some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with iran  responding to trump  iranian president hassan rouhani said on friday on television that tehran was committed to the deal and accused trump of making baseless accusations   the iranian nation has not and will never bow to any foreign pressure   he said   iran and the deal are stronger than ever   european allies have warned of a split with the united states over the nuclear agreement and say that putting it in limbo as trump has done undermines u s  credibility abroad  especially as international inspectors say iran is in compliance with the accord                  the chief of the u n  atomic watchdog reiterated that iran was under the world s  most robust nuclear verification regime    the nuclear related commitments undertaken by iran under the jcpoa are being implemented   yukiya amano  director general of the international atomic energy agency said  referring to the deal by its formal name  u s  democrats expressed skepticism at trump s decision  senator ben cardin said   at a moment when the united states and its allies face a nuclear crisis with north korea  the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners   while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement  he gave the u s  congress  days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact  if congress reimposes the sanctions  the united states would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart  if lawmakers do nothing  the deal remains in place  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker was working on amending the iran nuclear agreement review act law to include  trigger points  that if crossed by iran would automatically reimpose u s  sanctions  the trigger points would address strengthening nuclear inspections  iran s ballistic missile program and eliminate the deal s  sunset clauses  under which some of the restrictions on iran s nuclear program expire over time   trump directed u s  intelligence agencies to probe whether iran might be working with north korea on its weapons programs  the president  who took office in january  had reluctantly certified the agreement twice before but has repeatedly blasted it as  the worst deal ever   it was negotiated under his predecessor  former president barack obama  trump warned that if  we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies  then the agreement will be terminated    we ll see what happens over the next short period of time and i can do that instantaneously   he told reporters when asked why he did not choose to scrap the deal now  the trump administration designated the entire islamic revolutionary guard corps under an executive order targeting terrorists  the administration stopped short of labeling the group a foreign terrorist organization  a list maintained by the state department  the revolutionary guard is the single most dominant player in iran s security  political  and economic systems and wields enormous influence in iran s domestic and foreign policies  it had already previously been sanctioned by the united states under other authorities  and the immediate impact of friday s measure is likely to be symbolic  the u s  military said on friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on iran in support of trump s new strategy and was reviewing the positioning of u s  forces  but u s  defense secretary jim mattis said no changes in force posture had been made yet  and iran had not responded to trump s announcement with any provocative acts so far
