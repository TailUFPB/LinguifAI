washington  reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions  taking up an issue that has infuriated republican president donald trump  went on the attack against leaks on friday  warning of a possible crackdown both on reporters and their sources inside the federal government  in a move derided by critics as an attack on the free press  sessions said the administration was reviewing policies on forcing journalists to reveal their sources   it is  however  difficult to prosecute members of the news media in the united states for publishing leaked information  sessions also told the employees of government agencies to stop leaking and called the issue a matter of national security      trump has repeatedly voiced anger over a steady stream of leaks to the media about him and his administration since he took office in january   some have been related to probes into russian meddling in the  u s  presidential election  others have concerned infighting in the white house       one of the things we are doing is reviewing policies affecting media subpoenas   sessions told reporters as he announced administration efforts to battle what he called a  staggering number of leaks undermining the ability of our government to protect this country    we respect the important role that the press plays and will give them respect  but it is not unlimited   the nation s top law official said   his boss  trump  has repeatedly criticized news outlets and their work as  fake news   and administration officials have criticized the use of anonymous sources  a standard journalistic practice  a media subpoena is a writ compelling a journalist to testify or produce evidence  with a penalty for failure to do so   the fact that the administration is reviewing its policy leaves open the possibility of sentencing journalists for not disclosing their sources       every american should be concerned about the trump administration s threat to step up its efforts against whistleblowers and journalists   said ben wizner of the american civil liberties union   a crackdown on leaks is a crackdown on the free press and on democracy as a whole   deputy attorney general rod rosenstein told reporters the department was just starting to review the policy on media subpoenas and could not say yet how it might be changed  but he did not rule out the possibility of threatening journalists with jail time      historically  government employees or contractors who give sensitive information to the media are much more likely to be prosecuted than the reporters who receive it  u s  regulations give journalists special protections  barring them from law enforcement that might  reasonably impair newsgathering activities   federal prosecutors must get special permission from the u s  attorney general before issuing a subpoena to try to force a member of the news media to divulge information to authorities  new york times reporter judith miller was jailed in  for refusing to reveal a source about stories on iraq  but she cut a deal with prosecutors before she was formally charged    in addressing the wider issue of leaks  sessions said the justice department has tripled the number of investigations into unauthorized leaks of classified information and that four people have already been charged   we are taking a stand   said sessions  who in recent weeks has been publicly criticized by trump for his performance in the job  including for what trump called his weakness on the issue of going after leakers   this culture of leaking must stop   sessions said  it is not illegal to leak information  as such  but divulging classified information is against the law  some of the more high profile leaks in the trump administration have revealed white house infighting in articles that would appear not to involve divulging classified information          sessions did not immediately give the identities of the four people charged  but said they had been accused of unlawfully disclosing classified information or concealing contacts with foreign intelligence officers  rosenstein did not give the exact number of leak investigations the justice department is currently handling  only that this number has tripled under the trump administration   in the latest major leak to the media  the washington post published transcripts on thursday of contentious phone calls that trump had in the early days of his administration with mexican president enrique pena nieto and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull   no government can be effective when its leaders cannot discuss sensitive matters in confidence or to talk freely in confidence with foreign leaders   sessions said of that case      one tool sessions has for prosecuting leakers is the espionage act  a world war one era law that was designed to stop leaks to america s enemies  federal prosecutors have used it  times to charge individuals for disclosing information to the media  eight of them under democratic former president barack obama    the most recent case  and the first under trump  was the justice department s indictment in june of reality leigh winner    a u s  intelligence contractor accused of leaking a classified national security agency report about russia s alleged interference in the  election
