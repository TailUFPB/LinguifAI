washington  reuters    senate republicans scrambled on tuesday to ensure support for a budget resolution vital to president donald trump s drive to overhaul the u s  tax code  as one republican fiscal hawk announced he might vote against the measure   as the senate opened debate on a fiscal year  budget  senator rand paul objected to spending levels that he said would exceed agreed caps by   billion  and called for spending reforms for so called entitlement programs such as the medicare and medicaid health insurance programs   i will not vote for the budget unless it keeps within the spending caps   the republican senator told reporters  in a conversation with trump earlier on tuesday  paul said he told the republican president   i m all in  i want to be supportive  i m a  yes  vote  but we have to obey our own rules   senate republican aides denied that the budget resolution exceeds federal spending caps set by the budget control act of   paul said the excess spending was for overseas military operations  which aides said are not subject to caps     the budget resolution already had a narrow path to passage in the senate  where democrats oppose the measures and republicans have only a   majority  a  no  vote from paul appeared to put the budget a single vote from failure  threatening to upend trump s drive for tax reform   another fiscal hawk  senator ted cruz  has refused to disclose whether he would support the measure    however  the republican odds of passing a budget resolution improved unexpectedly when senator thad cochran returned to the senate despite an illness and said in a statement that he looked forward to  taking part in the debate on the budget and tax cuts   a day earlier  cochran s office had said he would not be available this week  with cochran in the senate  republicans can pass the measure even if they lose two votes   the budget resolution is essential to trump s tax reform strategy because it would unlock a legislative tool known as reconciliation  which would allow senate republicans to pass a tax bill with a simple majority  without it  a partisan tax bill would need  votes in the  member senate and would almost certainly fail  the republican effort had gained momentum on monday when two other potential senate republican  no  votes   susan collins and lisa murkowski   indicated they were leaning toward  yes   senator john mccain also said he would support the budget resolution   after failing to overturn obamacare earlier this year  republicans fear they will face a backlash from constituents in next year s congressional midterm elections if they are unable to pass legislation to cut taxes for businesses and individuals  trump and top republicans have proposed a plan to deliver up to   trillion in tax cuts over the next  years as part of a reform package that they say will boost economic growth and provide more jobs and higher wages   democrats  who criticize the republican plan as a giveaway to the wealthy  will likely propose numerous amendments to the budget plan to prevent tax cuts for the rich and require legislation that would not expand the federal deficit     we re talking about a major political party now working night and day on behalf of the top   percent   senator bernie sanders  an independent who caucuses with democrats  told reuters on tuesday  both the senate and the house of representatives must agree on a budget resolution  the house has already approved a different version  so house and senate republicans would need to hammer out a unified version and pass it before reconciliation could take effect
