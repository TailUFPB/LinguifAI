washington  reuters    president donald trump on tuesday signed an order to undo obama era climate change regulations  keeping a campaign promise to support the coal industry and calling into question u s  support for an international deal to fight global warming  flanked by coal miners and coal company executives  trump proclaimed his  energy independence  executive order at the headquarters of the environmental protection agency   the move drew swift backlash from a coalition of  states and local governments  as well as environmental groups  which called the decree a threat to public health and vowed to fight it in court  the order s main target is former president barack obama s clean power plan  which required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants   a key factor in the united states  ability to meet its commitments under a climate change accord reached by nearly  countries in paris in    trump s decree also reverses a ban on coal leasing on federal lands  undoes rules to curb methane emissions from oil and gas production and reduces the weight of climate change and carbon emissions in policy and infrastructure permitting decisions  carbon dioxide and methane are two of the main greenhouse gases blamed by scientists for heating the earth   i am taking historic steps to lift restrictions on american energy  to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job killing regulations   trump said at the epa   the room was filled with miners  coal company executives and staff from industry groups  who applauded loudly as trump spoke  shares in u s  coal companies edged higher in response    the wide ranging order is the boldest yet in trump s broader push to cut environmental regulation to revive the drilling and mining industries  a promise he made repeatedly during the  presidential campaign   energy analysts and executives have questioned whether the moves will have a big effect on their industries  and environmentalists have called them reckless   i cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create  but i can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration s commitment to the coal industry   kentucky coal association president tyler white told reuters  environmental groups heaped scorn on trump s order  arguing it was dangerous and went against the broader global trend toward cleaner energy technologies  a coalition of mostly democrat led states and local governments issued a statement saying they would oppose the order in court   we won t hesitate to protect those we serve   including by aggressively opposing in court president trump s actions that ignore both the law and the critical importance of confronting the very real threat of climate change   the coalition  led by new york attorney general eric schneiderman  said in a statement   the coalition includes states such as california  massachusetts and virginia  as well as cities including chicago  philadelphia and boulder  colorado  u s  presidents have aimed to reduce u s  dependence on foreign oil since the arab oil embargo of the   which triggered soaring prices  but the united states still imports about   million barrels of crude oil a day  almost enough to meet total oil demand in japan and india combined  an overwhelming majority of scientists believe that human use of oil and coal for energy is a main driver of climate change  causing a damaging rise in sea levels  droughts and more frequent violent storms   but trump and several members of his administration have doubts about climate change  and trump promised during his campaign to pull the united states out of the paris climate accord  arguing it would hurt u s  business   since being elected  trump has been mum on the paris deal and the executive order does not address it  christiana figueres  former executive secretary of the united nations framework convention on climate change who helped broker the paris accord  lamented trump s order   trying to make fossil fuels remain competitive in the face of a booming clean renewable power sector  with the clean air and plentiful jobs it continues to generate  is going against the flow of economics   she said  the order directs the epa to start a formal process to undo the clean power plan  which was introduced by obama in  but was never implemented in part because of legal challenges brought by republican controlled states   the clean power plan required states to collectively cut carbon emissions from power plants by  percent below  levels by   some  percent of u s  states are on track to meet the targets despite the fact the rule has not been implemented  according to bill becker  director of the national association of clean air agencies  a group of state and local air pollution control agencies  trump s order also lifts the interior department s bureau of land management temporary ban on coal leasing on federal property put in place by obama in  as part of a review to study the program s impact on climate change and ensure royalty revenues were fair to taxpayers  it also asks federal agencies to discount the cost of carbon in policy decisions and the weight of climate change considerations in infrastructure permitting  and it reverses rules limiting methane leakage from oil and gas facilities
