new york  reuters    a u s  appeals court on thursday rejected the trump administration s effort to temporarily bar most refugees from entering the country  ruling that those who have relationships with a resettlement agency should be exempt from an executive order banning refugees   a three judge  u s  circuit court of appeals panel also  ruled that grandparents  aunts  uncles and cousins of legal u s  residents should be exempted from president donald trump s order  which banned travelers from six muslim majority countries  the ruling is the latest legal blow to the president s sweeping executive order barring travelers from iran  syria  libya  somalia  sudan and yemen for  days  which the republican president said was necessary for national security  the justices said that the government did not persuasively explain why the travel ban should be enforced against close relatives of people from the six countries or refugees with guarantees from resettlement agencies  the   ruling takes effect in five days  the u s  supreme court ruled in june that trump s ban could be implemented on a limited basis  but should not be applied to people with  bona fide  relationships to people or entities in the united states   the government took a narrow view of that interpretation  which the state of hawaii challenged in court  a lower court judge sided with hawaii  and the  circuit judges upheld that view    it is hard to see how a grandparent  grandchild  aunt  uncle  niece  nephew  sibling in law  or cousin can be considered to have no bona fide relationship with their relative in the united states   the court said   the court also rejected the administration s argument that the written assurances provided by resettlement agencies obligating them to provide services for specific refugees is not a bona fide relationship   the agencies  advance preparation and expenditure of resources for each refugee  supports the district court s determination that a bona fide relationship with the refugee exists   the decision said  trump s first version of the executive order  signed in january  sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world before it was blocked by courts  the administration replaced that version of the ban with a new order in march in response to the legal challenges  a department of justice spokeswoman said   the supreme court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before  and we will now return to the supreme court to vindicate the executive branch s duty to protect the nation   hawaii s attorney general douglas chin said the ruling  keeps families together  it gives vetted refugees a second chance  the trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis  we will keep fighting back   refugee organizations cheered thursday s decision  saying it will give relief to people fleeing violence who were caught in limbo after the ban  the broader question of whether the revised travel ban discriminates against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution will be considered by the u s  supreme court in october
