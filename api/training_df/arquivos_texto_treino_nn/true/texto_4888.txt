honolulu new york  reuters    a defiant president donald trump has pledged to appeal to the u s  supreme court if necessary to fight for his revised travel ban  parts of which were halted by two different federal judges in recent days   the legal path forward will be challenging  though  as lawsuits work their way through federal courts on opposite sides of the country  in hawaii and maryland  on thursday  a federal judge in washington state said he was also weighing a temporary restraining order  the justice department s first step would likely be filing an appeal in either or both of the cases it lost this week  an action likely to come within days  justice department spokeswoman sarah isgur flores declined to comment on the administration s intentions  in granting a temporary restraining order against the ban challenged in a lawsuit brought by the state of hawaii  u s  district judge derrick watson found on wednesday that  a reasonable  objective observer     would conclude that the executive order was issued with a purpose to disfavor a particular religion   trump s executive order would temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly muslim countries  the president has said the ban is needed for national security   early on thursday  u s  district judge theodore chuang issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in a case in maryland brought by refugee resettlement agencies represented by the american civil liberties union and the national immigration law center  chuang ruled that the groups were likely to succeed in showing that the travel ban portion of the executive order was intended to be a ban on muslims  and as a result  violates the u s  constitution s religious freedom guarantee  he did not enjoin the refugee portion of the ban    to avoid sowing seeds of division in our nation  upholding this fundamental constitutional principle at the core of our nation s identity plainly serves a significant public interest   chuang wrote in his ruling  the court orders  while victories for the plaintiffs  are only an early step in litigation and the government could ultimately win its underlying case  watson and chuang were appointed to the bench by former democratic president barack obama   trump  speaking after the hawaii ruling at a rally in nashville on wednesday  called his revised executive order a  watered down version  of his first  the president said he would take the case  as far as it needs to go   including to the supreme court  in order to get a ruling that the ban is legal  the trump administration won a small legal victory later on thursday  u s  district judge james robart in seattle  who last month blocked trump s first travel ban  ruled that the second travel ban was different enough from the first that he would not simply apply a preliminary injunction he issued against the first ban to the second one  he said he was weighing a request for a temporary restraining order on the new travel ban  the likely next stops if the administration decides to contest the two rulings that it lost this week would be the  and  u s  circuit courts of appeal  both may be frosty venues for trump s arguments  with majorities of the judges in each appointed by democratic presidents   three judges on the  circuit upheld robart s order last month on the first travel ban  rather than appeal further  the administration withdrew the ban  promising to retool it in ways that would address the legal issues  the supreme court is currently split between four conservative and four liberal justices  with no ninth justice since the death of antonin scalia more than a year ago  trump s nominee to fill the vacant supreme court seat  neil gorsuch  a  year old conservative  is likely to be asked about the travel ban next week when he goes before the senate judiciary committee for a confirmation hearing   republicans are hoping that the senate votes to confirm gorsuch for the court by mid april  which would likely be too late for him to weigh in on an emergency appeal about the travel ban  trump signed the new ban on march  in a bid to overcome legal problems with his january executive order  which caused chaos at airports and sparked mass protests before robart stopped its enforcement in february  watson s order is only temporary until the broader arguments in the case can be heard  he set an expedited hearing schedule to determine if his ruling should be extended
