washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump asked then fbi director james comey to end the agency s investigation into ties between former white house national security adviser michael flynn and russia  according to a source who has seen a memo written by comey  the explosive new development on tuesday followed a week of tumult at the white house after trump fired comey and then discussed sensitive national security information about islamic state with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov  the comey memo  first reported by the new york times  caused alarm on capitol hill and raised questions about whether trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation  the white house quickly denied the report  saying in a statement it was  not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and mr  comey   comey wrote the memo after he met in the oval office with trump  the day after the republican president fired flynn on feb   for misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations last year with russia s ambassador  sergei kislyak   i hope you can let this go   trump told comey  according to a source familiar with the contents of the memo   the new york times said that during the oval office meeting  trump condemned a series of government leaks to the news media and said the fbi director should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information  coming the day after charges that trump disclosed sensitive information to the russians last week  the new disclosure further rattled members of congress   the memo is powerful evidence of obstruction of justice and certainly merits immediate and prompt investigation by an independent special prosecutor   said democratic u s  senator richard blumenthal  republican and democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the memo  republican u s  representative jason chaffetz  chairman of a house of representatives oversight committee  said his committee  is going to get the comey memo  if it exists  i need to see it sooner rather than later  i have my subpoena pen ready   in a letter to acting fbi director andrew mccabe  chaffetz set a deadline of may  for the fbi to produce  all memoranda  notes  summaries  and recordings referring or relating to any communications between comey and the president   republican speaker of the house paul ryan backed chaffetz   we need to have all the facts  and it is appropriate for the house oversight committee to request this memo   said ryan spokeswoman ashlee strong  legal experts took a dim view of trump s comments  as quoted in the memo   for the president to tell the fbi to end a potential criminal investigation  that s obstruction of justice   said erwin chereminsky  a constitutional law professor and dean of university of california  irvine school of law   this is what caused president nixon to resign from office   but the experts said intent was a critical element of an obstruction of justice charge  and the president s words could be subject to interpretation and possibly put into the context of other actions  like comey s termination  the fact that the president apparently said he  hoped  comey would end the flynn investigation rather than more directly ordering it  makes for a weaker but still viable case   said christopher slobogin  a criminal law professor at vanderbilt university law school  flynn s resignation came hours after it was reported that the justice department had warned the white house weeks earlier that flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with kislyak before trump took office on jan    kislyak was with lavrov at the white house when trump disclosed the sensitive information  a spokeswoman for the fbi declined to comment on the details of the memo  an emailed fundraising appeal by trump s political organization and the republican national committee sent out after reports of the comey memo said trump was being victimized by an  unelected bureaucracy    you already knew the media was out to get us   it said   but sadly it s not just the fake news  there are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage president trump and our entire  america first  movement   the new development came as republican and democratic lawmakers pressured trump to give a fuller explanation for why he revealed sensitive intelligence information to lavrov  the information had been supplied by a u s  ally in the fight against the islamic state militant group  the officials said
