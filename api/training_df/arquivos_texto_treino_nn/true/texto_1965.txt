washington  reuters    defense secretary jim mattis openly differed with his commander in chief over north korea on wednesday  the latest example of a once rare public display of disagreement by top u s  aides that has become more frequent under president donald trump   we are never out of diplomatic solutions   mattis told reporters  just hours after trump said in a tweet that  talking is not the answer  to the standoff over north korea s nuclear weapons and missile programs  his public contradiction of trump s position came a day after the pentagon chief  a retired four star marine general    appeared to delay implementation of trump s decision to ban transgender people from enlisting in the military  mattis was also among the senior aides  including secretary of state rex tillerson and white house economic adviser gary cohn  who implicitly criticized the republican president s response to violence at a rally organized by white nationalists in charlottesville  virginia  earlier this month   presidents often disagree with senior advisers over policies or other matters but the differences are usually confined to internal deliberations and become public only through leaks or much later in memoirs  historians and former government officials said   i haven t seen a modern president with a pattern of this many high officials saying things like that   said michael beschloss  a presidential historian  asked in a television interview on sunday whether trump s initial comments blaming  many sides  for the violence in charlottesville instead of focusing on neo nazis and white nationalists raised questions about his values  tillerson said simply   the president speaks for himself     white house spokeswoman sarah sanders sought to play down the significance of tillerson s comments   i don t think anyone has tried to distance themselves  i think that at moments maybe you have people that disagree  i think that s a healthy thing for you to be able to have productive conversation   sanders told reporters on air force one on tuesday  but beschloss said the differences being aired publicly were notable   these are people protecting their reputations in real time  and that is something you usually do not see in high level officials around a president   he said  mattis has repeatedly made clear that diplomacy   backed by a credible military option   is the only way to prevent the north korea crisis from escalating into a potentially devastating conflict  when asked about mattis  comments on wednesday  chief pentagon spokesperson dana white said   secretary mattis provides the president with his best advice  it is the president who makes the ultimate decisions   leon panetta  who served as defense secretary and cia director under former democratic president barack obama  said the airing of differences inside the trump administration had its roots in the president s habit of sharing his opinions in twitter posts   i think the problem is that they  advisers  are now dealing with a president who tweets his thoughts to the country   said panetta  who has said he had his own policy differences with obama    he s not the kind of individual who sits down with his national security team and tries to work these issues out in a policy process that is confined to the white house   earlier this month  a video posted on social media showed mattis telling u s  troops that the united states has problems that its military does not have   you just hold the line until our country gets back to understanding and respecting each other and showing it   he said   the impromptu speech  believed to have been made during an aug   visit to jordan  came after the violence in charlottesville in which a woman was killed and many people were injured  cohn clearly distanced himself from trump s comments on the violence  and officials said he considered resigning   citizens standing up for equality and freedom can never be equated with white supremacists  neo nazis  and the kkk  ku klux klan    he said in an interview with the financial times on aug    jennifer lawless  a professor of government at american university  said it was significant that several of trump s advisers distanced themselves from trump s comments on charlottesville   that makes it very difficult for him  to retaliate against individual advisers  she said   you can t go after every single member of your cabinet  that makes it look like maybe you ve made wrong choices
