chicago  reuters    illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a legislative fix favored by chicago mayor rahm emanuel for two of the city s struggling pension funds and castigated it as a  kick the can approach   the financial footing and credit ratings for the nation s third largest city have slipped precipitously as its unfunded pension liabilities grew to    billion for chicago s four retirement systems in the most recent accounting  the plan that passed the illinois senate unanimously in january and cleared the house overwhelmingly last december would have granted the state s blessing to alter the city s pension repayment schedule for its municipal and laborers  retirement systems  the systems are projected to run out of money in the coming decade and were depending on legislative sign off of the city s enactment of a water and sewer usage tax and telephone surcharge designed to help get them  percent funded in  years  city officials have acknowledged that more money will be needed starting in  when payments will reach actuarially required levels  but rauner rejected the package  saying it created a payment schedule that eventually would necessitate a tax increase for chicago  he said it needed to be part of a broader  statewide pension funding strategy to address illinois     billion unfunded pension liability   this is another kick the can approach to pension funding that landed chicago in fiscal crisis in the first place   rauner said in a prepared statement   this bill will create an unsustainable funding schedule that will lead to tax increases without solving the real problem   a spokesman for the democratic mayor slammed the republican governor s action as an  irresponsible and irrational decision    instead of helping secure the future of our taxpayers and middle class retirees  the governor chose to hold them hostage   just as he has done to social service providers  schoolchildren and universities across the state   emanuel spokesman adam collins said in a statement  referring to rauner s inability to broker a state budget deal for  months  rauner s action left democrats with no ability to block his veto because the pension bailout passed in the previous session of the state general assembly  which ended in mid january  and the governor s only options were to approve or reject the measure  but the city is pinning its hopes on an identical piece of legislation that passed the newly seated state senate in late january and is awaiting action in the house  collins said
