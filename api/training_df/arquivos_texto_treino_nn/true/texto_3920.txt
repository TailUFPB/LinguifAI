washington  reuters    a house banking panel on thursday passed a controversial bill that would drastically change how the u s  government regulates the financial sector  with support only from the panel s republicans  the bill approved by the house financial services committee would eliminate significant parts of the dodd frank financial reform law and place new restrictions on regulators monitoring wall street  the odds of the bill offered by representative jeb hensarling becoming law are long  given staunch opposition by  democrats to many of its central proposals  the bill marks the new congress  first attempt to significantly roll back existing financial rules after republicans made gains in the  election  president donald trump has identified easing rules on banks as a key component of his economic agenda and effort to spur lending and grow the economy  critics of the bill argue that it undoes many of the critical protections enacted following the financial crisis and puts the nation at greater risk of another meltdown  if made law  the bill would repeal regulators  ability to step in and wind down failing financial institutions  it also would hamstring their ability to identify and more closely regulate firms they believe are critical to the health of the financial system  under the bill  banks that agree to adopt a  percent capital ratio would be allowed to receive an exemption from many of dodd frank s existing rules  it will also require regulators to get congressional approval on any major new rulemaking project  and overhaul the consumer financial protection bureau  the powers of that agency  created by dodd frank  would be curtailed  limiting the steps it can take to punish wrongdoing by banks and subjecting it to a number of outside checks on its authority and funding  in addition  the bill significantly changes how the federal reserve operates  subjecting its monetary policy decision making to a stricter rules based process  while separating its economic policymaking from its financial regulatory work  hensarling has said he expects the bill will be considered soon by the full house  where it likely would be passed by the republican majority   however  the senate banking committee will be considering its own proposals to rework financial rules  more modest legislation coming from that committee is more likely to become law  given it will likely be designed to attract necessary support from democrats
