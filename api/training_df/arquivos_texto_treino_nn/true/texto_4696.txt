washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson will meet with senior turkish officials in ankara next week  in talks that could be vital to an advancing u s  backed campaign to retake the syrian city of raqqa from islamic state  u s  officials said on friday  turkey has been pressing the united states to drop its military alliance with the syrian kurdish ypg militia  which it considers part of the kurdistan workers  party that has been fighting an insurgency for three decades in turkey   but u s  officials have long viewed kurdish fighters as key to an approaching assault on raqqa  islamic state s de facto capital  it would work alongside arab fighters in the u s  backed syrian democratic forces  sdf   instead  turkey wants the united states to draw from syrian arab rebel groups backed by ankara for the final assault on raqqa  a predominantly arab city  proposals that so far have failed to convince u s  officials who are not certain that the turkish backed arab force is large and well trained enough   we first need to work out details with turkey   one senior official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  the decision sets president donald trump s wish for quick battlefield victories against the need to maintain the united states  longstanding strategic alliance with turkey  a nato ally which provides the united states access to a base critical for the air war in syria  the raqqa campaign appears to be gathering steam as an overlapping u s  backed effort in iraq is drawing closer to driving islamic state from the city of mosul  french defense minister jean yves le drian said on friday that the battle for raqqa would likely start  in the coming days   the head of the syrian kurdish ypg militia told reuters last week that the assault would begin at the start of april  and that the ypg would be taking part  some u s  officials think that timeline is too optimistic  noting that a major battle underway for tabqa dam  about  miles   km  west of raqqa  could take weeks to complete  the pentagon also has said the united states has not decided on the composition of an american backed assault force in raqqa  the united states has about   troops in syria at the moment  and the raqqa campaign could involve hundreds more  senator john mccain  the senate armed services committee s chairman  suggested to reporters earlier this week that it would be hard to convince turkish president tayyip erdogan of the merits of backing kurdish fighters  even if they are the most effective weapon against islamic state   the conundrum is that if you don t use the kurds  it will take a lot longer while  islamic state is  sending streams of terrorists out of raqqa   mccain said   but if you do  you have an enormous challenge as far as relations with turkey is concerned   he added   mccain said the relationship with erdogan was particularly important and cited an april  referendum on constitutional changes to extend his powers  tillerson s meeting in ankara also closely follows a meeting of  coalition partners this week in washington  where they agreed to intensify the fight against islamic state  including in syria  at wednesday s meeting  tillerson said the united states would create  interim zones of stability  through ceasefires to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against islamic state and al qaeda in syria and iraq  he did not elaborate  although one u s  official said there was not yet agreement among all american agencies on where and how such zones would be set up  the u s  military has long been skeptical of creating safe zones inside syria or iraq  partly because any safe zone guaranteed by the united states almost certainly would require some american military protection  securing the ground alone would require thousands of troops  former u s  officials and experts say  the top u s  commander on the ground  lieutenant general stephen townsend  said earlier in march that   we are building safe zones right now for all iraqis and all syrians to be safe from  islamic state     increased u s  or allied air power would be required if trump chooses to enforce  no fly  restrictions and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas  the state department did not provide more details of tillerson s trip to turkey  but said he will visit brussels on march  to participate in a rescheduled meeting of nato foreign ministers  the nato meeting had been set for april    but it was rescheduled after tillerson decided instead to attend a summit with china  that caused unease among european allies already worried about trump s commitment to the western military alliance
