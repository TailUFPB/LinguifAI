washington  reuters    while u s  president donald trump s budget proposal for national defense increases spending  it falls short of campaign promises to rebuild the navy and a  historic  increase in military spending  the budget proposes a modest increase in military spending  trump is seeking a   billion hike for the pentagon as part of an overall defense spending increase of   billion  that is almost  percent higher than current budget caps  but only  percent more than what former president barack obama had sought in his long term budget plan  the   billion includes funding for nuclear weapons programs at the department of energy and other national defense programs as well as the department of defense  the pentagon s specific defense request is for    billion  an increase of   percent compared with the budget for fiscal year    looking at defense specifically  this is not a historic budget   much less a buildup   said mackenzie eaglen  an analyst at the american enterprise institute  a think tank based in washington   this budget seeks to repair the cracked military foundation by plugging gaps and filling holes   she said   at the direction of defense secretary james mattis  the pentagon is carrying out a broad budget and strategy review  and experts said this budget is more of a placeholder until that is complete    it feels to me like the trump administration just doesn t really have it all together at this point   said laicie heeley  a fellow at the stimson center  another washington based think tank  the budget request must be passed by congress but faces skeptical lawmakers  u s  officials said the focus of the budget proposal was to improve readiness   u s  senator john mccain  one of the leading military and foreign policy voices in congress  said on tuesday that the white house s budget proposal was  inadequate  and  dead on arrival  in congress   mccain has been a proponent of increasing base defense spending to above   billion in order to renew the military and invest in modern capabilities   obviously it is going to take a lot in congress  in both the house and senate  to try to get it done and we are here to help in any way we can   acting comptroller john roth told reporters  the proposal includes an additional   billion in overseas contingency operations  oco  money  which is intended to fund ongoing wars and does not count against the budget caps  the fiscal  budget proposal s oco funding includes   billion for operations in afghanistan  but is based on current u s  troops levels at about    the trump administration is weighing sending between   and   additional u s  and coalition troops to the war torn country to stem gains made by taliban militants  the oco fund also includes   billion for the fight against islamic state militants in iraq and syria and    billion for the european reassurance initiative  which is an increase of about    billion from the  request  the budget proposes    billion for the army  which is looking to keep active duty troop levels at    the obama administration had planned for the number of army active duty troops to go down to   by the end of fiscal      the white house s proposal also earmarks a total of    billion for the navy  as a presidential candidate  trump made repeated calls to expand the current  ship fleet to   however  that will have to wait because the budget proposal did not accelerate the navy s schedule for purchasing additional ships  but instead increased funding for ship maintenance as the duration of overseas deployments increases   the navy added a boeing co p  submarine hunting aircraft  but delayed the purchase of two f  variant jets made by lockheed martin co
