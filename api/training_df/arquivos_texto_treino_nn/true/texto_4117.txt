washington  reuters    senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on sunday he believes lawmakers could reach a short term u s  budget deal by friday if president donald trump did not meddle in their talks with  poison pill  demands like funding for a border wall   i am hopeful that we can get a budget done   schumer said at a news conference   the only fly in the ointment is that the president is being a little heavy handed  and mixing in and asking for things such as the  border  wall    so we d ask him to let us do our work  not throw in some last minute poison pills that could undo it and we could get this done
