houston  reuters    u s  president donald trump took up the mantle of  comforter in chief  in a visit to storm wracked houston as he played with children and served up food to evacuees from hurricane harvey  the first major natural disaster of his eight months in office  in a widely watched test of his presidential mien  trump comforted victims and thanked volunteers and first responders after being criticized earlier in the week for not showing sufficient empathy to texas residents during catastrophic flooding  trump    was joined by his wife  melania  as he passed out food and hugged  kissed and played with children at the  kid zone  in houston s nrg center  a   square foot    square meter  facility that was turned in to the city s largest emergency shelter  the day was a rare glimpse into trump s interactions with everyday americans outside his campaign style rallies  the former real estate magnate appeared relaxed as he posed for photographs with volunteers and chatted with evacuees alongside texas governor greg abbott   it has been a wonderful thing   trump said of his meetings with the children as he served food to evacuees amid shouts of  thank you  sir   trump  who declared sunday a national day of prayer  also went to a church in nearby pearland  where he and his wife helped load half a dozen cars with boxes of supplies for victims  he said the volunteer work was  good exercise   trump also visited a neighborhood that had sustained flooding but had dried out to greet residents and praise them for doing  a fantastic job holding it together   the visit came after a week of historic flooding in the area killed at least  people  displaced more than  million and dumped as much as  inches   cm  of rain  trump asked congress late on friday for an initial    billion for hurricane recovery efforts  the request comes as washington faces tough budget negotiations  the trip may have political implications for trump  according to the reuters ipsos tracking poll  almost  percent of the public disapproves of trump s performance as president  andrew smith  a political science professor at the university of new hampshire  said trump had done well overall in coordinating federal assistance and showing concern on saturday for those affected by harvey  but he would likely see little change in his poll numbers due to scrutiny of his administration s other policies   you can be as empathetic as you want but if your administration isn t seen as competent in dealing with the problem  it s not going to help you   smith said  his initial trip to texas on tuesday was contrasted unfavorably with the efforts of former president barack obama  who became known as  comforter in chief  after mass shootings and the sandy superstorm that hit new jersey in    with floodwaters still present  trump had stayed clear of the houston area on that trip  saying he did not want to hamper rescue efforts  instead  he met with cabinet members  state and local leaders and first responders in the state capital austin and corpus christi  where harvey first hit  focusing on the logistics of the government response  trump tweeted that he had seen  first hand the horror   devastation  from harvey but reporters traveling with him said they saw no damage   that was reasonable criticism   said matt mackowiak  chairman of the republican party in travis county  texas  who has praised the trump administration s handling of the disaster   on saturday  some area residents  even one on the opposite side of the political spectrum  said trump s visit was a positive   it raises the morale   kevin jason hipolito  who identified himself as a democrat  told reporters at the convention center   when he went to corpus i was like   man he just forgot about us   this shows a lot of support  it perks up morale   but it remains a difficult task for trump  a republican businessman new to politics  to match expectations set by his predecessors of both parties who were widely considered politically deft at displaying solidarity and commitment to those suffering from disasters both natural and man made   is he going to help  can he help   devon harris    a construction worker  said at the convention center   i lost my home  my job is gone  my tools are gone  my car is gone  my life is gone  what is trump going to do   trump was cheered at both the convention center and a church he visited and appeared to crack a joke  perhaps at his own expense  while donning gloves to serve food to victims of the disaster in a cafeteria  he commented  my hands are too big   referencing a meme from the presidential campaign in which the size of the candidate s hands were linked to his supposed virility by his opponents  including republican marco rubio
