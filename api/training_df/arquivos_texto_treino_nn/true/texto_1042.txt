washington  reuters    republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize obamacare insurance markets or try again to repeal and replace the law this year  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on wednesday  signaling his party was shelving the matter until the  u s  congressional election year  president donald trump promised as a candidate last year to dismantle obamacare  while the house passed such a bill last may  the senate tried but failed to do so in july and september thanks to deep intra party divisions and fears that millions of americans would lose their healthcare coverage   i think that is something we should do next year   ryan said in an interview with reuters when asked about prospects of the house passing a bipartisan bill that would reinstate federal subsidies to private insurers to help lower income people buy medical coverage through the affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  asked whether the seven year republican effort to repeal and replace obamacare was now dead  ryan responded   no   but he added   i can t imagine we can do that this year   congress has a packed calendar between now and the end of   it includes a major tax cut package that president donald trump wants lawmakers to pass by the end of the year as well as legislation to avert a potential government shutdown looming in december   trump has been frustrated by the inability of a congress led by his own party to pass the bill  and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law  trump this month cut off billions of dollars in obamacare subsidies to insurers  known as cost sharing reduction payments  saying they are unlawful and enrich insurance companies  republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray last week unveiled a bipartisan bill to maintain those subsidies for two years and give states some added flexibility for administering health insurance while also maintaining many of obamacare s patient protections  the plan drew bipartisan support in the senate  but trump came out against it after initially backing it  the subsidies are a critical element of obamacare  insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people  ryan said he favored a more conservative short term obamacare fix offered by leading republicans in the house and senate  it includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to obtain health coverage under obamacare  democrats are likely to balk over concerns that the measure could undermine the viability of obamacare s subsidized insurance market for individuals  republicans call obamacare a government intrusion in the u s  healthcare system while democrats note that the  law brought insurance to  million americans  congressional elections are set for november   with party primaries earlier in the year
