washington  reuters    a senior white house aide said on thursday that u s  president donald trump would demand steps toward repealing obamacare in any healthcare legislation  comments that cast doubt on the prospects for a short term bill to shore up insurance markets   marc short  the white house s top liaison to congress  said on cnn that obamacare s mandates and taxes would have to be rolled back and consumers be allowed to more heavily invest in health savings accounts for trump to sign off on any congressional deal    we re willing to work on this but we need to make sure that we re getting something that will actually reduce healthcare costs   short said   republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray unveiled legislation to shore up the insurance markets created under the  healthcare law by reviving the subsidies  which trump has discontinued  for two years to help lower income americans obtain medical coverage  the bill appeared to be gaining some momentum on thursday after several republican senators said they would support the measure  but short s comments may put a damper on hopes for any sort of bipartisan agreement  democrats have consistently opposed efforts to dismantle any and all parts of obamacare   short said the administration was sending a list of the principles it would like to see in any legislation to the bill s co authors and would likely make them public   the gist is we believe that the individual mandate should  be  repealed  employer mandate repealed and allow americans to contribute to health savings accounts   he said   earlier on thursday  alexander and murray said the deal they struck now has the support of  of the  republicans in the  seat senate  as well as  democrats   while alexander predicted in remarks on the senate floor that the plan  will become law in some fashion before the end of the year   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has not committed to bringing it to a vote  and house of representatives speaker paul ryan is against it  lobbyists and congressional aides closely following the matter said the legislation could make it onto the senate floor tucked inside a bigger  must pass  bill that congress needs to act on in december  such as a broad spending measure to prevent a federal government shutdown  trump campaigned for the presidency last year promising to get rid of obamacare  the signature legislative achievement of his democratic predecessor barack obama  but his fellow republicans who control congress have failed to repeal and replace the law thanks to deep intra party divisions   obamacare  formally called the affordable care act  extended health insurance to  million people but republicans call it  government interference in americans  healthcare      the law s individual mandate requires all americans to purchase health insurance  while its employer mandate requires businesses of a certain size to offer affordable coverage   trump initially indicated support for the alexander murray agreement but reversed himself  saying on wednesday  i can never support bailing out  insurers  senator mike rounds  one of the bill s republican co sponsors  said that if trump decides he does not support it   then it will not go forward   when a reporter noted that trump does oppose it  rounds replied   that was yesterday   gabelli funds portfolio manager jeff jonas  who focuses on healthcare  said there was too much political uncertainty for investors to latch onto any one thing  with trump  flip flopping every day  and ryan not supportive of the bill  among hospital stocks  community health systems  cyh n  closed up   percent  tenet healthcare corp  thc n  rose   percent and hca healthcare inc  hca n  gained  percent  most insurers rose more modestly  without the subsidies  insurance premiums for some of the   million americans who get coverage through obamacare markets will surge  noting that some conservative republicans object to the subsidies  alexander asked   what s conservative about creating chaos so millions can t buy insurance  or at least failing to deal with the chaos that has been created   the bill has broad support among democrats  but had just seven republicans on record supporting it only a day earlier  republican senators bill cassidy and lindsey graham  who co authored a bill in september to repeal and replace obamacare that failed to muster enough support  endorsed the bipartisan effort   we believe we need a package which stabilizes the market in the short term and lays the groundwork for a long term solution  that would overhaul obamacare  they said in a joint statement  if passed in december  as opposed to before the nov   beginning of enrollment for  obamacare insurance policies  it would be unlikely to affect premiums for next year  meaning its benefits might not be felt until   insurers have already decided whether to participate in the obamacare markets and set higher rates to build in the possibility that the subsidies would vanish  insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies  but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles  co payments and other out of pocket medical expenses for low income people  the bill would also give more flexibility for states to offer a wider variety of health insurance plans while maintaining the requirement that sick and healthy people be charged the same rates for coverage  many senate republicans are nervous about the prospect of voting on any healthcare measure   no matter what legislation it may be attached to   that buttresses obamacare  part of the fear  one senior senate republican aide said  is that trump s former chief white house strategist steve bannon is recruiting hard line conservative primary challengers to run against incumbent republican senators next year  the aide said incumbents do not want to be forced to cast a controversial vote to stabilize obamacare  a law reviled by many conservatives  if all  senate democrats and two independents back the alexander murray bill as expected  the support of the  republicans means the bill has the  votes needed to reach the super majority required to pass most legislation in the senate  trump on thursday underscored his concerns about the bill  he urged alexander and murray to be  careful with respect to the insurance companies   which he said are  extremely talented at making money   alexander and murray said their legislation does not bail out insurers  alexander said house republicans passed an obamacare repeal and replace bill in may that also would continue subsidy payments for two years  alexander said trump has called him four times in recent days on this subject  including a saturday night call when he was at a restaurant and  my dinner got cold   he urged the president to support the initiative
