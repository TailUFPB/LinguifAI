washington  reuters    the director of the federal bureau of investigation defended his  employees on thursday against a growing chorus of accusations by republicans  including president donald trump  that its agents were allowing political bias to seep into their investigations  in testimony before the house of representatives judiciary committee  christopher wray said he believed the reputation of the fbi was not  as trump recently wrote on twitter   in tatters    the agents  analysts and staff of the fbi are big boys and girls  we understand we will take criticism from all corners   wray said    my experience has been that our reputation is quite good   republicans had in recent weeks stepped up criticism of the fbi and special counsel robert mueller  who is investigating whether trump campaign aides had colluded with russia to influence the  u s  presidential election  the move is widely seen as a tactic to undermine mueller s investigation  which has so far led to criminal charges against four people from trump s inner circle  it comes as republicans prepare to head into a potentially challenging midterm  congressional election cycle  republicans have sought to re litigate questions relating to the fbi s handling of an investigation into hillary clinton s use of a private email server  and questioned whether justice department officials gave her preferential treatment in their decision not to charge her with a crime  they have criticized former fbi director james comey for publicly announcing a decision not to refer clinton for prosecution and asked whether the decision making was politically tainted   wray took over the helm of the fbi after trump abruptly fired comey earlier this year      most recently  republicans got fresh ammunition against mueller and the fbi  after media reports said fbi agent peter strzok was removed from the russia probe because he had exchanged private text messages that disparaged trump and supported clinton  strzok was involved in both the clinton email and russia investigations   wray acknowledged thursday that strzok was removed from mueller s investigation  but said he was reassigned  not disciplined   we cannot afford for the fbi   which has traditionally been dubbed the premier law enforcement agency in the world   to become tainted by politicization or the perception of a lack of even handedness   committee chairman bob goodlatte said   wray repeatedly refused to weigh in on how his predecessor handled the clinton matter  and deferred to justice department inspector general michael horowitz  who is conducting a wide ranging review into the topic  horowitz recently told lawmakers he expects his review to be complete by late winter or early spring   when those findings come to me  i will take appropriate action if necessary   wray said  democrats  meanwhile  urged wray to stand up against bullying by the president   your job requires you to have the courage to stand up to the president  mr  director   said the committee s ranking democrat jerrold nadler   there are real consequences for allowing the president to continue unchecked in this manner
