sandy springs  ga   reuters    georgia republican karen handel won the most expensive congressional race in history on tuesday  avoiding a democratic upset in a race that was widely seen as a referendum on president donald trump  by a margin of  percent to  percent  the former georgia secretary of state defeated democrat jon ossoff  a political newcomer who sought to wrest control of a suburban atlanta district that has elected republicans to congress since the         the election will not significantly change the balance of power in washington  where republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress  but it could give republicans a boost in confidence as they struggle to advance health and tax legislation that has been bogged down by infighting and investigations into whether trump s campaign colluded with russia in last year s presidential election  handel said at her victory rally that she knew it was going to  require all hands on deck  for republicans to hold on to the district   tonight i stand before you  extraordinarily humbled and honored at the tremendous privilege and high responsibility that you     have given me   handel told a boisterous crowd that chanted trump s name  ossoff and handel both tried to focus on local issues and avoided mentioning trump  whose approval rating sits at  percent  according to reuters ipsos polling   but that did not stop trump from weighing in on twitter  urging voters to support handel before the election and celebrating her victory afterward   fantastic job  we are all very proud of you   he posted tuesday night  spending on the race reached at least   million  nearly twice the previous record  according to the center for responsive politics  a watchdog group  the special election was held to fill the seat vacated by tom price after trump appointed him as secretary of the u s  department of health and human services  democrats celebrated the fact that they had turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district   we showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible we could fight  that  we could fight   ossoff told supporters  but the defeat was sure to prompt soul searching in a party that is shut out of power in washington and has steadily lost influence at the state level in recent years  despite spending more than   million  ossoff lost the district by a wider margin than democrat hillary clinton in the  presidential election  democrats also lost a special election in neighboring south carolina on tuesday  where republican ralph norman easily prevailed over democrat archie parnell in a seat formerly held by republican mick mulvaney  who is now serving as trump s budget director  democrats are  for  in congressional elections this year  having earlier lost races to fill vacant seats in kansas and montana   all the fake news  all the money spent      trump wrote on twitter  republicans  meanwhile  can now breathe a sigh of relief with the knowledge that they can still win in the kind of affluent  educated districts that often favor democrats   even with a president who has divided voters in their own party    do i agree  percent with what he does  god  no  but i believe he has the country s best interests at heart   said jessica podalsky  who voted for handel on tuesday morning
