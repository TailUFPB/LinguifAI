on board a u s  military aircraft  reuters    the u s  air force may intensify its strikes in afghanistan and expand training of the afghan air force following president donald trump s decision to forge ahead with the  year old war  its top general told reuters on tuesday  air force chief of staff general david goldfein said  however  he was still examining the matter  as the u s  military s top brass had only begun the process of translating trump s war strategy into action  asked whether the air force would dedicate more assets to afghanistan  where the united states has been engaged in its longest military conflict  goldfein said only   possibly     it s actually too early to tell what this will mean in terms of plus ups and reductions   he said in a joint interview with air force secretary heather wilson  still  he acknowledged that the air force was  absolutely  examining the possibility of increasing air power  including to support u s  ground forces  following trump s promise of a stepped up campaign against taliban insurgents  who have gained ground against u s  backed afghan government forces   goldfein said the same about providing training to afghan pilots  wilson  who assumed the air force s top civilian job three months ago  noted the afghan military had made strides thanks to u s  training and equipment  but added   i think there is a long way to go there  very honestly    in a speech on monday night  trump appeared to answer a call from the top u s  commander on the ground for thousands of more troops to break a stalemate with taliban insurgents  on top of the roughly   now deployed in afghanistan  trump said the united states would not disclose troop numbers  but one u s  official told reuters they could start moving quickly  u s  defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday he would set troop levels following the review by military chiefs  during the administration of trump s predecessor  barack obama  u s  military officials privately expressed frustration about their inability to strike at many taliban targets   including training camps    unless they could show a direct threat to u s  forces or major impact on the afghan state  wilson said trump appeared to be giving greater flexibility to strike insurgents      obviously the joint chiefs will work through their plans and make proposals  but i think the guidance was pretty clear from the president last night  and we re going to go on the offensive and destroy these terrorist networks   wilson said   goldfein said   i thought that came out very loud and clear in the speech that that s his priority   wilson and goldfein spoke to reuters while flying back to the united states after a nine day trip that included a visit to afghanistan  where the u s  military has ramped up its firepower against islamic state in recent months even as it helps afghan forces battle the taliban    particularly for the u s  air force  the size of the american commitment to afghanistan far outweighs the number of airmen deployed there  a network of u s  installations throughout the middle east supports the afghan campaign  including in qatar and the united arab emirates   still  any substantial increase in u s  targeting of the taliban and islamic state militants would likely require dedicating more u s  military assets to build intelligence  strike insurgent targets and provide support to u s  forces in the field  although the u s  military is stretched  a string of u s  coalition backed victories by iraqi forces against islamic state might free up some firepower and intelligence assets for afghanistan  experts say  air force spokesman brigadier general edward thomas declined to speculate on operational planning  but he noted that u s  air power from the region could be deployed  if needed  including fighter aircraft  bombers and spy planes      with the detailed planning that will follow the president s announcement  the air force will be ready to swing any additional airmen and aircraft to the fight as required    thomas said   trump ran for the presidency calling for a swift u s  withdrawal from afghanistan  which the united states invaded in october   and he acknowledged on monday that he was going against his instincts in approving the new campaign plan sought by his military advisers  wilson said trump s remarks represented a  strategic correction  in the war effort along with a significant shift in policy on pakistan  in his speech  trump delivered a sharp rebuke to islamabad for allowing taliban insurgents a safe haven from which launch attacks in afghanistan  and said it had  much to lose  unless it changed course  pakistan denies that it harbors militants fighting u s  and afghan government forces in afghanistan  reuters has reported that the united states has been considering a range of actions  including withholding aid to pakistan and  perhaps  ramping up drone strikes  successive u s  administrations have struggled with how to deal with nuclear armed pakistan  and the u s  military has been dependent in the past on overflight or land routes through pakistan to resupply its forces in landlocked afghanistan    wilson did not rule out a future u s  military role against militants in pakistan should islamabad fail to act  but she said trump s focus appeared to be on diplomatic efforts for now    my assumption is that there will be some intense diplomatic pressure   she said  goldfein said he was not aware of any changes to u s  pakistani military ties  but acknowledged the military would take its cues from the state department   i can tell you that i have a fairly robust dialogue with the pakistani air chief  i ve hosted him  he s hosted me   goldfein said   but that dialogue is always supportive of the diplomatic dialogue
