washington  reuters    former fbi director and prosecutor robert mueller  known for his independence in high profile government investigations  is taking on a new challenge in the midst of a crisis that threatens the presidency of the united states  mueller    was named on wednesday by the justice department to probe alleged russian efforts to sway november s presidential election in favor of donald trump and to investigate whether there was any collusion between trump s campaign team and moscow  president trump said in a statement there was no collusion between his campaign and  any foreign entity    mueller is known by some as  bobby three sticks  because of his full name   robert mueller iii   a moniker that belies the formal bearing and no nonsense style of the former marine corps officer who was decorated during the vietnam war  democrats and republicans alike praised his appointment and hailed his integrity and reputation  mueller was named to the post by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  his investigation will run in parallel to those being carried out by the fbi and the u s  congress  it would be difficult to fire mueller  and past special counsel appointments have shown that the job comes with independence and autonomy  chicago federal prosecutor patrick fitzgerald was appointed during the george w  bush administration in  to a similar role to investigate the leak of the identity of valerie plame  an undercover cia officer whose husband had criticized bush administration policies  fitzgerald indicted i  lewis  scooter  libby  a top aide to vice president dick cheney  bush granted libby clemency from a prison sentence before he left office  robert luskin  a washington lawyer who defended bush political adviser karl rove during fitzgerald s investigation  praised the choice of mueller   i think it s good across the board   luskin told reuters  he described mueller as  credible  and  independent  and said his appointment would be  good for the department of justice   mueller  known for avoiding political controversy  took a stand in  when he and then deputy attorney general james comey threatened to resign when the bush white house sought to reauthorize a domestic wiretapping program that the justice department had deemed unconstitutional  in his new role as special counsel  mueller will have wide latitude to take the investigation wherever he thinks it should go and can use the full range of justice department investigative tools  said jack sharman  an attorney who served as special counsel during a probe into the whitewater real estate investments of president bill clinton in   mueller was appointed director of the federal bureau of investigation by george w  bush a week before the sept      attacks on new york and washington  d c   he was credited with transforming the fbi after congress and an independent government commission established that the agency and the cia had failed to share information before the attacks that could have helped thwart them  at the fbi  mueller put more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other federal agencies  mueller was chief of the justice department s criminal division before becoming fbi director  among his most famous cases was the fraud and racketeering indictment of individuals associated with a politically connected luxembourg bank run out of london and led by bankers from pakistan and abu dhabi  he also oversaw the investigation into the pan am airline bombing over scotland and the drug case against former panamanian dictator manuel noriega  mueller served  years as fbi chief under bush and his  democratic successor barack obama  who then signed legislation to extend mueller s fbi term for another two years  he was succeeded as fbi director by comey  who was fired by trump last week   in the wake of his firing  there have been media reports that trump had asked comey in february to end an fbi investigation into the president s former national security adviser  michael flynn  the reports cited a memo said to have been written by comey documenting trump s request   there have been calls for months for a special counsel to oversee the investigation into any ties between trump s campaign team and moscow  most recently  mueller had worked at a major washington law firm  wilmer hale  which presents a possible wrinkle for his new assignment  the firm represents trump s daughter ivanka and son in law jared kushner  who have taken on white house jobs  it also represents paul manafort  a former campaign chairman who had ties to russia  mueller left wilmer hale this week but faces a justice department ethics requirement that could bar him for a year from investigating anyone represented by his former firm  mueller may be able to obtain a waiver from the justice department s ethics officers or recuse himself from investigating certain individuals  leaving those inquiries to a deputy  richard painter  an ethics lawyer in the george w  bush administration who has been a vocal critic of trump  said mueller has good grounds to receive such a waiver
