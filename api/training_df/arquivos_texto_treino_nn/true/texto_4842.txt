baden baden  germany  reuters    wary of their first official encounter with u s  president donald trump s blustery trade agenda  the world s top finance officials were relieved to find new treasury secretary steven mnuchin polite and business like over the weekend  but they yielded ground to the newcomer s push for the group of  major economies to abandon a decade old pledge to resist protectionism and to delete communique language on financing the fight against climate change  according to  officials who interacted with mnuchin at the meeting in the spa and casino town of baden baden  germany  many opted not to challenge mnuchin on protectionism language  instead they chose to give some space to him and trump s new administration to refine their trade views in the hopes for moderation by the time germany hosts a  leader s summit in july  five weeks into his new job  the former goldman sachs and commercial banker is currently the only senate confirmed trump appointee working at treasury  and the trump administration has not yet decided on the specific policies it will use to make good on campaign pledges to shrink u s  trade deficits and grow american manufacturing jobs  options under consideration range from more aggressive anti dumping enforcement efforts to renegotiating trade deals and enacting a proposed border tax levied on imports  during his campaign  trump threatened unilateral tariffs on mexican and chinese goods and said he would quit the north american free trade agreement unless it is renegotiated to his liking       we have a new administration in washington which still has to define precisely its narrative  especially in the context of what was said in the campaign   said pierre moscovici  european commission economic affairs minister    i think mnuchin is an articulate  constructive and pragmatic man   moscovici said   more work needs to be done to find common ground  it was not ready here  it is not a total surprise   japanese finance minister taro aso  who tangled with mnuchin s predecessor  jack lew  last year over dollar yen exchange rate volatility  said he was impressed with mnuchin s understanding of economics and financial markets   that s why i think we can do good business together   aso told reporters   in the  plenary sessions  mnuchin took to the floor only once  reading from a prepared statement  according to a  official  while counterparts from china and france argued forcefully in favor of keeping the anti protectionism pledge    while mnuchin concentrated on making good first impressions with his  counterparts  u s  negotiators behind the scenes insisted that they could no longer accept previous language vowing  to resist all forms of protectionism   this was replaced with a watered down pledge to  strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies    language viewed by some participants as preserving u s  flexibility on trade policy  german finance minster wolfgang schaeuble  who met with mnuchin in berlin before the baden baden meeting  said consensus could not be reached on the meaning of protectionism   he suggested at a news conference that mnuchin may not have had a clear mandate to negotiate on trade issues  asked about this  mnuchin said he knows trump s desires on trade and negotiated them from baden baden  adding   the new language makes sense   the deletion of a  ritualistic phrase  in the  s core language could over time diminish u s  influence  said eswar prasad  a former international monetary fund official and  trade policy professor at cornell university   the u s  may have won this battle by forcefully imposing its will on the rest of the   but the outcome represents a step backward in u s  global leadership on issues such as the promotion of free trade and tackling climate change   said prasad   but the baden baden meeting established mnuchin as a pragmatic operator in the trump administration s drive for a more level playing field on trade  said domenico lombardi  another former imf official now with the centre for international governance innovation  a canadian think tank     it d be in the interest of germany and europe to establish a strong  bilateral relationship with the new treasury secretary rather than questioning his authority   lombardi said   the alternative for them would be to negotiate directly with trump and that would be worse
