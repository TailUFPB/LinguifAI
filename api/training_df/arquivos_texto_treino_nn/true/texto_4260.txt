moscow washington  reuters    the presidents of the united states and russia on wednesday both presented souring views of the relationship between their two countries  exchanging sharp words as moscow extended an icy welcome to the united states  top diplomat in a face off over syria   in washington  president donald trump said the united states  relationship with moscow  may be at an all time low    trump s comments came after he made his biggest foreign policy decision of his new presidency last week  firing missiles at syria to punish moscow s ally for its suspected use of poison gas  russia condemned the u s  action   for graphic on battle for control in syria click here  tmsnrt rs   hours earlier on wednesday  russian president vladimir putin was equally pessimistic  saying in an interview broadcast on russian television   the level of trust on a working level  especially on the military level  has not improved but has rather deteriorated    the rhetorical salvos came as u s  secretary of state rex tillerson received an unusually hostile reception in moscow  where any hope that the trump administration would herald less confrontational relations was dashed in the week after the u s  missile strike on syria  tillerson met putin in the kremlin after talking to his russian counterpart  sergei lavrov  for about three hours  the kremlin had previously declined to confirm putin would meet tillerson  reflecting the renewed tensions  trump had frequently called during the  u s  presidential election campaign for warmer ties with putin  despite criticism from lawmakers in his own republican party  but the civil war in syria has driven a wedge between moscow and washington  upending what many in russia hoped would be a transformation in relations  which reached a post cold war low under trump s predecessor  barack obama      as tillerson sat down for talks with lavrov on wednesday  a volley of statements  including from a senior russian official  appeared timed to maximize the awkwardness during the first visit to moscow by a member of trump s cabinet  lavrov doubled down on russia s support for syrian president bashar al assad  repeating denials that assad s government was to blame for the gas attack last week and adding a new theory that the attack may have been faked by assad s enemies  tillerson reiterated the u s  position that assad must eventually relinquish power in syria   we discussed our view that russia as their closest ally in the conflict perhaps has the best means of helping assad recognize this reality   he said   asked whether assad could be subject to war crimes charges  tillerson said people were working to make such a case  though he cautioned doing so would require clearing a high legal hurdle  lavrov greeted tillerson with unusually icy remarks  denouncing the missile strike on syria as illegal and accusing washington of behaving unpredictably  one of lavrov s deputies was even more undiplomatic   in general  primitiveness and loutishness are very characteristic of the current rhetoric coming out of washington   deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told russia s state owned ria news agency  but lavrov said some progress had been made on syria at the meeting and that a working group would be set up to examine the poor state of u s  russia ties  he also said putin had agreed to reactivate a u s  russian air safety agreement over syria that moscow suspended after the u s  missile strikes          tillerson noted the low level of trust between the two countries   the world s two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this kind of relationship   he said  moscow s hostility to trump administration figures is a sharp change from last year  when putin hailed trump as a strong figure and russian state television was often full of effusive praise for him  in another possible setback to a thaw with moscow  trump said on wednesday that nato is not obsolete  as he had declared during the election campaign last year  but he told a news conference at the white house with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg that alliance members still need to pay their fair share for the european security umbrella      trump said u s  relations with russia were not going well   right now  we re not getting along with russia at all  we may be at an all time low in terms of a relationship with russia  this has built for a long period of time  but we re going to see what happens   trump told the news conference  in an interview with the wall street journal  trump said his administration s policy was not to demand assad step down as part of a  peaceful resolution to the conflict   in some contrast to tillerson s remarks in moscow   are we insisting on it  no  but i do think it s going to happen at a certain point   trump said  the wall street journal cited trump as saying that assad s use of chemical weapons again would elicit another military response  but he also said he would not intervene in depth in the conflict  the white house has accused moscow of trying to cover up assad s use of chemical weapons after the attack on a rebel held syrian town last week killed  people  trump responded to the gas attack by firing  cruise missiles at a syrian air base on friday  washington warned moscow  and russian troops at the base were not hit  moscow has stood by assad  saying the poison gas belonged to rebels  an explanation washington dismisses as beyond credible   russia blocked a western effort at the u n  security council on wednesday to condemn the gas attack and push assad to cooperate with international inquiries into the incident  trump came to the presidency promising greater cooperation with russia in fighting against the two countries  common enemy in syria  the islamic state militant group  tillerson is a former oil executive who was awarded russia s order of friendship by putin  trump s relations with russia are also a domestic issue  as u s  intelligence agencies have accused moscow of using computer hacking to intervene in the u s  presidential election to help trump win  the federal bureau of investigation is investigating whether any trump campaign figures colluded with moscow  which the white house denies
