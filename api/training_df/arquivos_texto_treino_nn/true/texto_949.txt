manafort    a longtime republican operative  and gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in washington   both men pleaded not guilty to the charges in a  count indictment  ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of ukraine s former pro russian government  the judge ordered house arrest for both men  and set a   million    million pounds  unsecured bond for manafort and a   million unsecured bond for gates  with unsecured bonds  they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court  there will be another hearing on thursday  the developments in the mueller probe weighed on the u s  dollar  which slipped   percent against a basket of currencies  mueller s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over trump s first nine months in office  u s  intelligence agencies say russia interfered in the election by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  russia denies the allegations and trump denies any collusion  neither trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against manafort and gates  the charges  some going back more than a decade  centre on manafort s work for ukraine  the indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the united states  failure to report foreign bank accounts to the u s  government and conspiracy to launder money  a count that carries a  year maximum prison sentence      a white house spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and russia    we ve been saying from day one there s no evidence of trump russia collusion  and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all   spokeswoman sarah sanders told a news briefing  manafort s attorney  kevin downing said in a statement that there was no evidence the trump campaign colluded with the russian government  downing said manafort s work for the ukrainians ended in   two years before he joined the trump campaign  downing accused mueller of using a  novel  legal theory to prosecute manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the department of justice when they are doing work for a foreign government  in a development directly related to trump s  election campaign  it emerged on monday that papadopoulos  a former campaign adviser  pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to federal bureau of investigation agents          mueller s office said papadopoulos lied to fbi agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in london who claimed to have information that would hurt clinton      papadopoulos  a little known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign  made a plea bargain that stated he had since  met with the government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions   according to a court document  sanders  the white house spokeswoman  said papadopoulos  role in the campaign was  extremely limited  and that he was a volunteer   he asked to do things  and  he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way   she said  in a may  email quoted in the papadopoulos indictment  a trump campaign employee forwarded a message from papadopoulos proposing a meeting between trump and the russian government to another campaign official  the employee included a note  according to the indictment  that read   let s discuss  we need someone to communicate that dt is not doing these trips  it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal   a source in washington  who did not want to be identified and who has seen the email  said the sender was manafort and the recipient was gates  manafort ran the trump campaign from june to august of  before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro russian political party in ukraine      trump reiterated his frustration on monday with the mueller probe  which he has called  a witch hunt    sorry  but this is years ago  before paul manafort was part of the trump campaign  but why aren t crooked hillary   the dems the focus        trump wrote on twitter  referring to clinton  mueller has been investigating manafort s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group  the party of regions  which backed former pro kremlin ukrainian president viktor yanukovich  both manafort and gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from ukraine work and laundered money through scores of u s  and foreign entities to hide payments from american authorities  the indictment said   they concealed from the united states their work and revenue as agents of ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a  lavish lifestyle  without paying taxes on the income  it said  the indictment said manafort owned properties in manhattan   brooklyn  the hamptons  arlington  virginia  and elsewhere  prosecutors said manafort spent almost   million on eight rugs in two years and more than    million on clothes from shops in beverly hills  california  and new york city  they also said he had been making payments on
