washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson on wednesday outlined for his staff how an  america first  agenda translates into foreign policy  but did not address the trump administration s proposed budget cuts  which worry many diplomats  it was the first time tillerson had addressed all employees since his first day on the job on feb    when he spoke to hundreds of state department officials in the building s lobby  and the most thorough explanation yet of the trump administration s approach to foreign policy  some allies and even some u s  officials have interpreted republican president donald trump s  america first  agenda  which puts americans  interests at home ahead of those of its partners overseas  as a threat to retreat from the world  tillerson said u s  foreign policy priorities had gotten  a little bit out of balance  in the previous decades  with the united states too focused on promoting economic activity and trade with emerging economies   these are really important relationships to us  and they re really important alliances  but we ve got to bring them back into balance   he said  speaking without notes and walking around the stage in a packed state department auditorium  he also signaled that the united states would de emphasize human rights concerns in some of its interactions with other countries  saying that while u s  values remain constant  its policies can adapt   if we condition too heavily that others must adopt this value that we ve come to over a long history of our own  it really creates obstacles to our ability to advance our national security interests  our economic interests   tillerson said  tillerson gave a tour of u s  priorities around the world  including in east asia  russia  africa  and the western hemisphere  omitting europe  with regard to north korea s nuclear program  tillerson said the administration is willing to use so called secondary sanctions to target foreign companies that continue to do business with pyongyang in contravention of united nations sanctions  the pressure campaign on north korea is  at about dial setting  or  right now   tillerson said  on china  tillerson said the united states has a  tremendous opportunity  to define its relationship with the superpower for the next several decades  and that he sensed great interest by the chinese leadership to do that as well  he and defense secretary jim mattis will chair a dialogue with their chinese counterparts in june  in addition to a dialogue focused on economics and trade and led by treasury secretary steven mnuchin and commerce secretary wilbur ross  tillerson said he had told russian president vladimir putin during his visit to moscow last month that u s  russia relations were at their lowest point since the cold war    he did not disagree   tillerson said   he shrugged his shoulders and nodded in agreement   but in remarks lasting nearly  minutes  tillerson did not address the administration s proposed  percent budget cut for u s  diplomacy and foreign aid  which would reduce funding for the united nations  climate change and cultural exchange programs  that proposal has made many american diplomats and aid workers anxious   the trump administration also has not named candidates for the vast majority of state department positions requiring senate confirmation  and many are being filled by career diplomats in  acting  positions  tillerson began his remarks by thanking those officials  to applause from the crowd  one veteran official who watched the speech criticized tillerson s use of the  america first  slogan  the phrase was used in the  by isolationists who sought to keep the united states out of world war two   the fact that they still use  america first  shows they know nothing about history  and what s worse is they don t care   it s offensive   said the official  who requested anonymity  tillerson s remarks followed an invitation to state department and u s  agency for international development employees this week to participate in an online survey to help identify  efficiency improvements   in line with a march directive from trump to  reorganize governmental functions and eliminate unnecessary agencies   in his speech  the secretary urged employees to fill out the survey and give input on how to reform the agency  tillerson said the state department  like many institutions  was built for the cold war era  he said he recognized that deep change to the state department  is really stressful for a lot of people  and said the administration has  no preconceived notions on the outcome  of a review  one state department official faulted tillerson for not talking in detail about the budget cuts  as well as for not taking questions from employees  previous secretaries of state  including colin powell  condoleezza rice and hillary clinton  held question and answer sessions with state department employees within weeks of taking office   they wanted to make this look like he was talking to us  but it was more about the appearance than any substance   said the official  speaking on the condition of anonymity  two other state department officials  however  spoke highly of tillerson s remarks  saying it was early to expect him to take questions from the rank and file and saying he provided guidance both on foreign policy and on the challenge of reorganizing the department   i can understand folks wanting more details  i just don t think we are in a place where he can provide more details   said one of these officials about the expected state department budget cuts   my big takeaway was put on your big girl britches  and when you look back you will feel like you were part of making this reform happen
