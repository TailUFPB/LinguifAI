washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump attacked the news media and dismissed leaks from the white house as  fake news  on sunday  following reports his son in law tried to set up a secret channel of communications with moscow before trump took office  shortly after trump s remarks on twitter  homeland security secretary john kelly made the rounds of sunday television news shows to praise any so called back channel communications  especially with russia  as  a good thing   the republican president returned to the white house after a nine day trip to the middle east and europe that ended on saturday to face more questions about alleged communications between jared kushner and russia s ambassador to washington   it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the  fakenews media   trump wrote in a series of twitter posts on sunday  in a statement later on sunday night  carried by the new york times  trump praised kushner and the work he has done in the white house   jared is doing a great job for the country   he said   i have total confidence in him  he is respected by virtually everyone and is working on programs that will save our country billions of dollars  in addition to that  and perhaps more importantly  he is a very good person   the white house faces mounting questions about potential ties between russia and trump s presidential campaign  which are also the subject of criminal and congressional investigations  trump officials were preparing to establish a  war room  to address an issue that has begun to dominate his young presidency  aides said trump was expected to meet with lawyers as early as sunday  the new york times reported  two republican u s  senators played down the kushner reports on sunday  while the former director of national intelligence  james clapper  took a darker view of such contacts with representatives of russian president vladimir putin   my dashboard warning light was clearly on and i think that was the case with all of us in the intelligence community   very concerned about the nature of these approaches to the russians   clapper told nbc s  meet the press   kushner  who is married to trump s daughter ivanka  had contacts with moscow in december about opening a secret back channel of communications  according to news reports published while trump was away on his trip  the  year old kushner  a real estate developer with no previous government experience  had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the russian ambassador to the united states during and after the  presidential campaign  seven current and former u s  officials told reuters   whenever you see the words  sources say  in the fake news media  and they don t mention names   trump wrote   it is very possible that those sources don t exist but are made up by fake news writers   fakenews is the enemy   contacts between trump associates and russian officials during the campaign coincided with what u s  intelligence agencies concluded was a kremlin effort through computer hacking  fake news and propaganda to boost trump s chances of winning the white house  white house officials defended the concept of secret communications channels without commenting specifically on the kushner case  national security adviser h r  mcmaster told reporters on saturday that so called back channeling was not unusual  kelly  the homeland security secretary  carried the same message on sunday   it s both normal  in my opinion  and acceptable   he said on abc s  this week  program   any way that you can communicate with people  particularly organizations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us  is a good thing    kelly told  fox news sunday  there was nothing wrong with the trump transition team trying to build relationships with the russians as they prepared to take over the white house  u s  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  said such secret channels may be used in situations including peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan or for the release of american hostages   but for people associated with the campaign after that campaign has ended and where the russians during that campaign were helping you  to try to establish a back channel and hide it from your own government  that s a serious allegation   he said  schiff was particularly concerned about a washington post  report that the back channel would have been conducted at a russian diplomatic facility to avoid monitoring in u s  communications systems   you have to ask  well  who are they hiding the conversation from   he said on abc  schiff said he expected kushner  who serves as an unpaid adviser to trump  to appear before his committee and suggested his security clearance be reviewed  kushner initially had come to the attention of fbi investigators last year as they began scrutinizing former national security adviser michael flynn s connections with russian officials  the two sources told reuters    republican u s  senator lindsey graham told cnn he doubted the kushner reports were accurate  senator bob corker  chairman of the foreign relations committee  noted that kushner has been willing to answer questions   they reached out to us yesterday to make sure that we knew that was the case and i m sure he s willing to do so   corker said on nbc s  meet the press    though he had not seen evidence of collusion when he stepped down on jan    clapper said all the signs made an fbi investigation not only appropriate but necessary   russia  at least for my money  is our primary adversary   he told nbc   they are not our friends  they are in to do us in
