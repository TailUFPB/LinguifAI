washington  reuters    republican senators john mccain and mike lee introduced a bill on thursday to permanently waive shipping restrictions on puerto rico  saying a temporary waiver from the trump administration is  insufficient  to help the island rebuild from hurricane maria  president donald trump s administration earlier on thursday waived the restriction known as the merchant marine act of   or the jones act  for puerto rico for  days  after a request by puerto rico s governor  ricardo rossello  opponents of the jones act  which bars foreign vessels from shipping goods between u s  coasts  say it hurts consumers on u s  islands  including puerto rico and hawaii  by adding shipping costs to imports of basic goods like food and fuel   mccain called the jones act an  antiquated  protectionist law that has driven up costs and crippled puerto rico s economy    in   a federal reserve bank of new york report said the jones act hurts puerto rico s economy  it estimated that shipping costs from the u s  east coast to puerto rico are double what they are to the nearby dominican republic  thanks mainly to the jones act    in addition  the u s  virgin islands have been exempt from the jones act for decades  which opponents of the law say is unfair to puerto rico   it was unclear whether mccain could gain widespread support for the bill that would waive the law  which is supported by shipping and security interests    not only do u s  ship builders support the jones act  but also a wide array of industries that build parts that go into ships  businesses that are spread throughout the country   president donald trump  before his administration waived the law temporarily  pointed out that  a lot of shippers and     a lot of people that work in the shipping industry  did not want the restrictions waived for puerto rico  in   mccain sponsored legislation to allow waivers of the law  a measure that created exemptions that are in place today  in    and this past july he introduced legislation to fully repeal the restrictions
