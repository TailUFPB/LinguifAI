 reuters    president donald trump s administration called two lawmakers from the u s  corn belt to convince them to join talks about potential changes to biofuels policy to ease the burden on oil refineries  according to a spokesman for one of the lawmakers and a source briefed on the matter  the effort is the clearest sign yet trump is seeking to mediate the long running dispute between the u s  oil industry and corn growers over the renewable fuel standard  rfs   a law requiring refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like corn based ethanol every year into the nation s fuels  refiners say the law is putting them out of business  but ethanol interests have vehemently opposed any changes   white house chief of staff general john kelly on thursday called republican senator chuck grassley of corn growing state iowa   a leading supporter of the biofuels industry   to discuss the possibility of a meeting  grassley s office told reuters on friday   and agriculture secretary sonny perdue called republican senator joni ernst  also of iowa  on the issue  a source briefed on the matter told reuters  asking not to be named  trump and senior cabinet officials met with nine republican senators from states with oil refineries on thursday  including ted cruz of texas  some of the senators said after the meeting that trump was interested in having all sides on the issue work together toward a solution  a spokesman for grassley s office said that grassley  would of course meet with any senator who requests a meeting   the spokesman  michael zona  added that kelly  in his call to grassley   reiterated the president s unwavering commitment to ethanol  the rfs and midwestern farmers    officials in ernst s office and at the white house did not respond to a request for comment  a new meeting could be scheduled as early as next week  according to the source briefed on the matter  the talks could lay the groundwork for potential future legislation to overhaul the rfs program  but would require co operation from representatives of the corn industry to pass congress       the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w  bush as a way to boost u s  agriculture  slash energy imports and cut emissions  and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to  billion gallons a year  refiners oppose the rfs because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses  while propping up demand for rival fuels   the industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels  allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets  or shift the blending burden to supply terminals from refiners       but the trump administration has ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year   last month  the environmental protection agency  the regulator which administers the rfs  slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for   senators on both sides of the debate have used parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals  for example  cruz has said he would block iowa agriculture secretary bill northey s nomination to a key post at the u s  department of agriculture until he gets a meeting about a biofuels compromise that includes all sides
