washington  reuters    republican efforts to overhaul or repeal obamacare collapsed in the u s  senate on tuesday  dealing a sharp setback to president donald trump and the republican party s seven year quest to kill former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  the disarray in the republican controlled senate rattled financial markets as it cast doubt on the chances of getting trump s other domestic policy priorities  such as tax reform  through a divided congress  trump said he was disappointed by the failure and suggested he might let the insurance markets created under obamacare go under and then  potentially  work with democrats on a rescue   we re probably in that position where we ll just let obamacare fail   trump told reporters at the white house   we will let obamacare fail  and then the democrats are going to come to us   u s  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell announced a vote on a straight repeal of obamacare  which would take effect in two years  after it became clear on monday night that he did not have enough support to pass an overhaul of the healthcare law  he said on tuesday that the vote would take place  early next week   but prospects for the repeal vote appeared doomed with at least three republican senators voicing opposition  moderate republican senators shelley moore capito of west virginia  susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska quickly announced they would not back repeal  with democrats united in opposition  republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the measure in the senate  where they have a slim   majority   i do not think that it s going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our healthcare system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement   collins told reporters  the failed effort to replace obamacare raised new concerns for u s  health insurers over whether the government would continue to fund billions of dollars in medical benefit subsidies  obamacare has boosted the number of americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers  and income based subsidies  about  million americans gained insurance coverage through the law   this has been a very  very challenging experience for all of us   mcconnell said  adding that the chamber needed to move on to issues like tax reform and a spending package to bolster the country s infrastructure  as the healthcare bill collapsed in the senate  leaders in the republican controlled house of representatives unveiled a budget plan putting a proposed tax code overhaul on the same partisan procedural path that led to the anti obamacare initiative s chaotic downfall  republicans had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming august recess so they could tackle a wide ranging rewrite of the u s  tax code in september  separate talks on taxes appear unlikely to reach trump s pledge to reduce the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent      but their failure exposed the sharp divide within republicans  own ranks  with moderates concerned the healthcare bill s medicaid cuts would take insurance away from millions of low income americans while conservatives backed the cuts and wanted even more dramatic changes to obamacare  the u s  dollar stumbled to a  month low against a basket of currencies and u s  treasury yields fell after the fresh setback to the healthcare bill raised investors  doubts about trump s ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending  reaction in the stock market was muted  and analysts said the expectation for business friendly legislation out of washington is all but priced out of the stock market   the healthcare hurdle pushes everything in trump s agenda to    said art hogan  chief market strategist at wunderlich securities in new york   trump vowed that the healthcare effort was not dead  in an early morning twitter message  he said   we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans  most republicans were loyal  terrific   worked really hard  we will return   trump had pushed hard to get a bill to repeal and replace obamacare through the u s  house of representatives in may and celebrated the victory with lawmakers on the white house lawn  but with polls showing the republican bill was unpopular  he later called it  mean  and did little to convince republican senators to get a deal  vice president mike pence said trump supported the move to vote on a straight repeal of obamacare   inaction is not an option   pence said at the national retail federation conference in washington   congress needs to step up  congress needs to do their job  and congress needs to do their job now   in crafting a replacement  republicans ran up against obamacare s growing popularity  a washington post abc news poll published on sunday showed americans preferred it over the republican alternative by a   margin    senate democratic leader chuck schumer urged republicans to start over and work with democrats  democratic senator patty murray  the leading democrat on the senate health committee  said in an interview with reuters that a bipartisan effort could help stabilize insurance markets  she said a bipartisan effort to fund cost sharing subsidies that help cover premiums  deductibles and other medical expenses for about  million people who purchase health insurance on the individual market would  send a strong message to the market  and  create some stabilization that is much needed   within hours of the bill s failure  republican senate health committee chairman lamar alexander said he will set hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets  orrin hatch  the republican chair of the senate finance committee  said on the senate floor that the failure could mean congress will have to bail out insurance markets  probably before the end of    for hospitals  shelving the bill relieves the near term pressure of massive medicaid reform  but the long term plan for federal spending for states  medicaid expansion is now murky
