 reuters    senator john cornyn  the no   senate republican  is trying to win support from the midwest corn lobby for a broad legislative overhaul of the nation s biofuels policy  according to sources familiar with the matter  the effort comes as president donald trump s white house mediates talks between the rival oil and corn industries over the renewable fuel standard  which requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of corn based ethanol and other biofuels in the nation s fuel supply every year  oil refiners say the regulation costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year and is threatening to put a handful of the nation s refineries out of business  ethanol interests have so far refused to budge on proposals to change it  cornyn  is working hard to unify all stakeholders in a consensus effort to reform the renewable fuel standard   an aide to the senator told reuters  the aide  who asked not to be named  did not provide details  cornyn  of texas  the u s  state that is home to the most oil refineries  is part of the senate s leadership team  responsible for securing the votes needed to pass the republican party s legislative agenda  two lobbyists for the oil refining industry said cornyn was having some success cobbling together a coalition of lawmakers and stakeholders around a potential rfs reform bill that could be dropped early next year  however  similar efforts to unify these rival factions have fallen flat in the past  any such effort would need the buy in of legislative backers of the ethanol industry  like republican senators chuck grassley and joni ernst of iowa  the top producing state for corn  officials for the senators did not respond to repeated requests for comment  both grassley and ernst have previously repeatedly expressed their intention to defend the rfs in its current form  the white house has been hosting negotiations between both sides of the issue over short term remedies that can provide relief to refiners struggling with the existing regulation  the refining industry says compliance now costs it hundreds of millions of dollars a year  and threatens to put some refineries out of business  refineries that do not have adequate facilities to blend ethanol into their gasoline must purchase blending credits  called rins  from rivals that do  rin prices have risen in recent years as the amount of biofuels required under the rfs has increased  refineries that buy rins include philadelphia energy solutions and monroe energy  both of pennsylvania  and valero energy corp of texas  valero said rins cost it around   million last year  though there are competing arguments over whether refiners pass along those costs  senator ted cruz  also of texas  last week sent a proposal to the white house to cap the price of rins at  cents each  a fraction of the current price  the proposal was widely rejected by the ethanol industry  the ethanol industry has said in the past that placing caps on the credits was a non starter  and has instead argued for policies to increase volumes of ethanol in the u s gasoline supply  the industry claims this would boost supplies of the credits  lowering their prices  prices of renewable fuel credits have fallen in recent weeks on reports of the discussions in washington  the price hit  cents on wednesday  nearing a seven month low  according to traders and oil price information services  the white house has not yet commented on cruz s proposal  the rfs was introduced by former president george w  bush as a way to boost u s  agriculture  slash energy imports and cut emissions  it has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to  billion gallons a year  the refining industry has pressed the trump administration repeatedly to adopt reforms that would lower the credit costs or otherwise ease the burden on refineries  but the ethanol industry has successfully defeated those efforts so far
