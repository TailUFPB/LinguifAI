washington  reuters    president donald trump s promise to balance the federal budget in a decade rests on a sustained rise to  percent annual economic growth that he promised in his election campaign and a vague  feedback  effect that lowers the annual government deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars  the projections are a leap of faith that many economists and the federal reserve regard as unlikely in a country where the population is aging and productivity has lagged   they also hinge on continued low interest rates  low inflation and full employment   a decade free not just of major economic shocks but of the sort of mild recession considered part of a capitalist economy s normal ups and downs  according to the summary tables released by the administration on monday night  the administration is assuming economic growth reaches  percent annually by the end of trump s first term and stays there at least through    actual first quarter economic growth was a weak   percent on an annualized basis  though current fed forecasts expect about   percent growth for the year  economic growth is one reason the plan forecasts tax receipts growing by around  percent a year even as the president promises tax cuts that  will spur investment and create jobs     inflation is assumed to hit the fed s  percent goal and stay there  compared to the fed s current forecast of just below  percent for   the budget assumes the unemployment rate will rise slightly from its current   percent rate and stay at a long term average of   percent  without that jump in growth and the steady environment surrounding it  deficits would increase by as much as half a trillion dollars a year   around where they are now   according to administration estimates that include an  effect of economic feedback  that reduces the government s annual shortfall by an amount that grows to   billion by   the exact nature of the  effect of economic feedback  was not detailed in the initial documents  president barack obama s last budget assumed   percent annual growth  and even that is considered optimistic by professional economists and the federal reserve  central bankers have penciled in trend u s  growth of around   percent over the long run  some wall street analysts  giving credit to some of trump s possible tax cut ideas  forecast economic growth could hit   percent in   according to the latest quarterly poll of forecasters by the philadelphia fed    with all due respect  the full fiscal trump magic was never a realistic outlook   erik nielsen  chief economist at unicredit  wrote in a note to clients on sunday  growth since  has averaged   percent in the united states  over the course of a decade the difference between that and trump s  percent figure compounds to an additional   trillion annually that would not get spent  invested or taxed  the administration is also assuming that interest rates remain low  with a  year treasury bond rate that rises to   percent and remains there  a figure critical to projected government borrowing costs  while the  year bond has averaged near that level throughout this century and is currently well below it  periods of faster economic growth generally involve higher rates because of both the likelihood of tighter monetary policy and the likely demand for u s  securities if the economy does accelerate
