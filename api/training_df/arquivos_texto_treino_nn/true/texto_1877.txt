washington  reuters    president donald trump on tuesday scrapped an obama era program that protects from deportation immigrants brought illegally into the united states as children  delaying implementation until march and giving a gridlocked congress six months to decide the fate of almost   young people  as the so called dreamers who have benefited from the five year old program were plunged into uncertainty  business and religious leaders  mayors  governors  democratic lawmakers  unions  civil liberties advocates and former democratic president barack obama all condemned trump s move  the action was announced not by trump but by jeff sessions  his attorney general  who called the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program an unconstitutional overreach by obama  there will be an  orderly  lawful wind down   sessions said  trump later issued a written statement saying that  i do not favor punishing children  most of whom are now adults  for the actions of their parents  but we must also recognize that we are  a  nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws   he denounced obama s program as an  amnesty first approach  toward illegal immigrants and pressed his nationalist  america first  message  saying that despite concerns voiced by his critics about the fate of the dreamers   above all else  we must remember that young americans have dreams too   on tuesday evening  the republican president tweeted that lawmakers now had six months to  legalize daca  and that if they did not  he would  revisit this issue   obama issued his own statement calling trump s action a political decision  defending daca s legality and urging congress to protect dreamers   this is about young people who grew up in america   kids who study in our schools  young adults who are starting careers  patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag  these dreamers are americans in their hearts  in their minds  in every single way but one  on paper   obama said  the trump administration said nobody covered by the program  which provided work permits in addition to deportation protection and primarily benefits hispanics  would be affected before march   most people covered by daca are in their   trump shifted responsibility to a congress controlled by his fellow republicans and said it was now up to lawmakers to pass immigration legislation that could address the fate of those protected by daca who would be in danger of deportation  trump and sessions offered no details of the type of legislation they would want to see  and trump s spokeswoman offered only a broad outline   i have a love for these people  daca recipients   and hopefully now congress will be able to help them and do it properly   trump later told reporters at the white house  adding   i think it s going to work out very well    since trump took office in january  congress has been unable to pass any major legislation  most notably failing on a healthcare overhaul  and lawmakers have been bitterly divided over immigration in the past    president trump s decision to end daca is a deeply shameful act of political cowardice and a despicable assault on innocent young people in communities across america   said nancy pelosi  the top democrat in the house of representatives  the democratic attorney general of massachusetts  maura healey  said a coalition of states planned to file suit in the coming days to defend daca  and one advocacy group announced its own legal action   this is a sad day for our country   added facebook inc  fb o  founder mark zuckerberg   the decision to end daca is not just wrong  it is particularly cruel to offer young people the american dream  encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government  and then punish them for it    brad smith  president of microsoft corp  msft o   urged congress to  put the humanitarian needs of these   people on the legislative calendar  before tax cut legislation sought by trump  nearly   people stepped forward  admitted their illegal immigrant status and provided personal information to the government to apply for the daca program  they now face the prospect of being deported starting in march  dreamers are a fraction of the roughly  million illegal immigrants in the united states   the cancellation of the daca program is reprehensible   the u s  conference of catholic bishops said in a statement  but white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said   it s not cold hearted for the president to uphold the law   trump said daca recipients would not be deportation priorities unless they were criminals or gang members  ending daca was the latest action by trump sure to alienate hispanic americans  a growing segment of the u s  population and an increasingly important voting bloc  most of the immigrants protected by daca came from mexico and other latin american countries  the mexican government said it  profoundly laments  trump s decision to end daca and pledged to strengthen efforts to guarantee consular protections for affected mexican citizens  the homeland security department will provide a limited window   until oct     for some daca recipients whose work permits expire before march  to apply to renew those permits  in addition  the department will adjudicate any new daca requests  or renewal requests  accepted as of tuesday  that would mean that some beneficiaries of daca could work legally in the country through   the administration said the president s decision was prompted in part by a threat from several republican state attorneys general  led by texas  to file legal challenges in federal court if trump did not act to end daca  late on tuesday  texas state attorney general ken paxton said he withdrew the  state suit after trump s decision  house speaker paul ryan called on lawmakers to find a long term solution for the young people affected by the reversal of the program  republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said congress  will continue working on securing our border and ensuring a lawful system of immigration that works   republican senator lindsey graham said there could be a winning formula by coupling legislation to provide legal status for dreamers with additional border security measures  although he said support was lacking in congress for trump s proposed border wall  trump made a crackdown on illegal immigrants a centerpiece of his  election campaign  promising to deport every illegal immigrant  the decision to end daca is the latest action by trump to erase key parts of his democratic predecessor s legacy  that includes pulling the united states out of the paris climate accord  abandoning a  nation pacific trade deal  seeking to dismantle the obamacare healthcare law  rolling back environmental protections  reversing parts of obama s opening to cuba and removing protections for transgender people
