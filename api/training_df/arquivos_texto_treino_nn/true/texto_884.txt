 washington  reuters    when president donald trump announced on oct   he would stop subsidies to health insurers critical to the obamacare law  the response from democratic state officials was swift and predictable  a lawsuit by  state attorneys general was filed within  hours   the race to the courthouse in response to presidential actions has become a familiar pattern since trump took office in january  and early rulings in many of the lawsuits have  at least temporarily  hobbled key parts of the president s agenda   many of the republican president s most significant executive actions  in areas from immigration and transgender rights to energy and the environment  have been impeded by court rulings in cases brought by democratic state and local officials as well as liberal advocacy groups    we are more of a check on this administration than congress   democratic new york state attorney general eric schneiderman said of state attorneys general   similarly  important executive actions taken by trump s democratic predecessor barack obama were stymied by lawsuits filed by republican state attorneys general  including one eventually decided by the supreme court that was intended to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation   since trump took office  courts have at least temporarily blocked trump s plans to     ban travelers and immigrants from several muslim majority countries    withhold federal funds from so called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement    ban transgender people from serving in the military    delay implementation of a regulation issued by the obama administration limiting methane emissions    put the brakes on an interior department rule requiring energy firms to pay more mineral royalties on federal land    delay compliance with an obama era rule aimed at curbing natural gas drilling waste emissions on federal land    and impede a detained illegal immigrant teenager from obtaining an abortion      trump has claimed some court victories  too  including on oct   when a federal judge in california refused the request by the state attorneys general to force the government to keep the subsidies to insurers under obamacare  formally known as the affordable care act  in place as the litigation proceeds  that decision was more the exception than the rule    president trump remains committed to protecting our national security and to eliminating excessive regulations that  if implemented  would destroy jobs  harm consumers and provide no meaningful benefit   a white house official  speaking on condition of anonymity  said in a statement provided to reuters   the trump administration is confident in its legal positions and looks forward to arguing    and winning    before the federal judiciary   the official added   in response to legal setbacks  trump has lashed out at the judiciary in ways that even his own supreme court appointee neil gorsuch called disheartening and demoralizing  trump called u s  courts  so political   labeled various rulings and proceedings  ridiculous  and  disgraceful   and disparaged one jurist who ruled against him as a  so called judge    while presidents often face legal challenges over policy initiatives  trump s administration stands out for the number of suits it has encountered so soon after taking power    trump has faced far more litigation than obama had at this stage of his presidency  a review of legal database westlaw showed that in trump s first nine months in office  cities or states filed  lawsuits challenging major policy initiatives of the administration  the review showed no similar lawsuits during the same time period of obama s presidency   trump also faces numerous suits by advocacy groups and others challenging such actions as his termination of an obama program that protected people brought into the united states illegally as children from deportation and the authority of a presidential commission formed to investigate alleged voter fraud   trump has relied heavily on unilateral executive actions to advance his policy objectives  his fellow republicans who control congress have been unable to pass any major legislation he has sought   executive actions can be challenged in court more quickly than lengthy federal rule making procedures  said law professor jonathan adler of case western reserve university school of law   obama relied on executive actions during the later years of his presidency after being unable to win congressional approval of key initiatives  and some of those actions drew legal challenges  but early in his presidency  he relied on unilateral actions less often because his fellow democrats controlled congress and passed major legislation including the  obamacare law   some legal experts say the haste with which trump drafted some of his policy initiatives may have helped those challenging the actions because the orders were not sufficiently vetted    this administration is more willing to shoot from the hip  when compared with the obama administration  adler said   that is how san francisco city attorney dennis herrera  a democrat  saw trump s executive order on sanctuary city funding  which herrera calculated could jeopardize up to   billion in federal funds for his city   herrera said he saw trump s action as  designed to appeal to a part of the administration s political base without really having been vetted  by lawyers to ensure it was legally airtight  herrera won an initial ruling in april blocking the measure  and the case is now pending before an appeals court   trump s actions have appealed to his conservative political base  while the legal challenges have pleased his liberal critics   speaking at an event at new york university  schneiderman  new york s attorney general  called trump s first travel ban  signed in january just a week into his presidency  a  galvanizing moment  for democratic officials   while lawsuits challenging the president s actions have won some important early victories  the litigation onslaught s ultimate effect on trump s agenda is not yet clear   trump s opponents have tended to file suits in jurisdictions where they think they are likely to prevail  and where appeals will be heard in regional federal circuit courts dominated by democratic appointed judges   the final decisions on the cases could be made by the supreme court  where trump s appointment of gorsuch restored a   conservative majority   the high court is likely to  prove more receptive  to the administration s arguments on issues like immigration  said george washington university law school professor jonathan turley   last week  a federal judge in san francisco who was appointed by obama appeared skeptical in a hearing about the challenge by the  states to the affordable care act subsidies  illustrating the limits of resistance through litigation   alluding to the political aspect of the case  u s  district judge vince chhabria asked rhetorically during a hearing  why  have all these attorneys general rushed to court seeking an emergency ruling against president trump   chhabria then ruled in favor of trump   follow trump s impact on energy  environment  healthcare  immigration and the economy at the trump effect
