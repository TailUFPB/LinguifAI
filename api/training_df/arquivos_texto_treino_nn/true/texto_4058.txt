new york houston  reuters    the trump administration s proposal to slash tax rates on so called pass through businesses would deliver a windfall to investors in master limited partnerships and could offer a much needed lift to this niche segment of the energy market  the tax plan outline released on wednesday by u s  president donald trump would sharply slash business taxes and discount the rate on overseas corporate profits brought back into the united states  the proposed changes include a cut to the top tax rate on pass through businesses to  percent from the current rate of up to   percent  pass throughs get that name because taxes are not paid by the business itself but pass through to their owners  individual taxes  at that rate  the change would largely benefit owners of private businesses  but u s  stock market investors holding shares of master limited partnerships  or mlps  would receive the same treatment  mlps build the pipelines and storage tanks and are a common corporate structure in the oil and gas infrastructure sector    if the average rate  for mlp investors  is in the   reducing it to  percent would be tremendously attractive   robert willens  president of tax and accounting advisory firm robert willens llc  said on wednesday   he said if the cuts come through they would make mlps  the most attractive investment from a tax point of view   mike bresson  a tax partner with the law firm baker botts in houston said trump s proposed change would enhance an already superior tax structure enjoyed by mlps   they re talking about giving mlps the same  percent tax rate that corporations get  so that would actually expand the benefits of mlps over corporations   bresson said    the devil is in the details and we haven t seen them   mlps have broadly underperformed the wider stock market over the past several years  largely due to the weakness in oil prices  the energy sector was pummeled as crude prices tumbled from above   per barrel in mid  to below   early last year  they only recently stabilized at around   for u s  oil   there has been a gradual improvement in mlps now that energy prices have stabilized  it s still a decent place to invest even without the tax cut   said bryant evans  portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign  illinois   there should be an almost immediate bounce  in price  once the proposal is solid  it should create more demand for mlp stock in general  but beyond an immediate bounce  it all goes back to how their businesses are doing   even with their above average dividend yields  mlps have lagged the s p  s total return in the last year by around  basis points   mlp stocks   more specifically  units   are up as a group so far this year  with the alerian mlp etf up  percent  though they have fallen   percent since trump took office   even as his administration has been more friendly to sector projects like the keystone xl pipeline and the dakota access pipeline  the etf rose   percent tuesday as details of the tax proposal were reported first by the wall street journal  it was the largest gain for the fund in six weeks  among the best performers in the sector this year are shell midstream partners and tallgrass energy partners  both up by more than  percent in   while plains all american pipeline and genesis energy are down  percent and  percent year to date  respectively
