washington  reuters    the supreme court s criteria for who can be barred from entering the united states under president donald trump s travel ban may confuse the u s  officials overseas charged with implementing it and trigger a new round of lawsuits  experts said  people with a  bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the united states are spared from the temporary ban affecting people from six muslim majority countries and all refugees that the justices on monday allowed to go partially into effect   there s no precedent for something like this that i m aware of   said jeffrey gorsky  a former legal adviser to the state department s visa office  referring to the new  bona fide  standard  gorsky said the standard is likely to sow confusion among u s  consular officials who have to make visa decisions and could require another court decision to determine what constitutes a connection to the united states sufficient to allow entry  the supreme court agreed to decide the legality of trump order in its next term  which begins in october  justice clarence thomas argued that the court should have granted trump s request to implement the travel ban in full while the legal fight continues   today s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding   on peril of contempt   whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the united states have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country   thomas wrote  joined by two fellow conservative justices  in monday s ruling  the high court gave a few examples of connections that qualify  for individuals  a close family relationship is required   bona fide connections to entities  it said  must be  formal  and  documented   that would include students who have been admitted to a u s  school and workers who have accepted an offer of employment from an american company  the court said  it noted that trump s executive order already allowed for case by case waivers for people with connections to the country  on the other hand  the justices said  relationships created for the purposes of evading the travel ban will not be considered valid  for instance  an immigration agency cannot add foreigners to client lists  and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion   the march  order called for a  day ban on travelers from libya  iran  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen and a  day ban on all refugees to enable the government to implement stronger vetting procedures  trump cited national security concerns as the reason for the order  stephen legomsky  chief counsel for u s  citizenship and immigration services under former president barack obama  said lawsuits could claim that a bona fide relationship was ignored   while legomsky said he believes the vast majority of cases will be clear cut  courts will have to determine whether visiting a close friend or taking part in a wedding could also qualify   in theory  you could say if somebody is coming for tourism and has made a reservation for a hotel  there s now a u s  interest in bringing them to the united states  the hotel is a u s  entity   gorsky said   some lawyers also said the vagueness of the  bona fide  standard was license for the trump administration to interpret it broadly   it s just like a green light to the government to do what it wants to do   said kiyanoush razaghi  a maryland based immigration attorney who deals with primarily iranian clients   who is going to tell us what is the definition of  bona fide relationship     the difficult job of judging foreigners  claimed connections could land back in the lower courts in maryland and hawaii that had originally blocked trump s travel ban  said stephen vladeck  a professor university of texas school of law     we could have dozens of these cases between now and september   vladeck said  adding that the supreme court would not be likely to weigh in on them on a case by case basis  david martin  a former u s  department of homeland security official and now a professor at the university of virginia  said the ruling was  carefully tailored  and should be manageable for officials to enact  part of the reason  martin said  is the case by case waiver process that was already envisioned in the executive order   i think there will be some litigation over the extent of the reach of this bona fide relationship but i don t think it will be as burdensome as the dissenters suggest   martin said
