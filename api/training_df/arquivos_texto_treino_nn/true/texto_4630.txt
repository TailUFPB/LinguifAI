 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s administration has billed his move to re open federal lands to new coal leases as a win for miners seeking to expand production  but a review of company filings shows that coal miners with the most to gain already have enough leases in hand to last well over a decade   trump will sign a decree on tuesday to reverse former president barack obama s  ban on new federal coal leases  part of a wide ranging executive order to sweep away green regulations his administration says have hobbled the drilling and mining industries    when we evaluate energy  let s look at the social cost of not having a job   trump s interior secretary ryan zinke said in a twitter post on tuesday ahead of the executive order   but companies focused on coal deposits below federal lands  such as peabody energy  arch coal  and cloud peak  have enough coal in the ground on existing leases to last an average of more than  years at  sales levels  earnings reports show   that suggests miners could already ramp up production levels immediately if the market demanded more coal  energy experts say that is unlikely on a large scale due to stiff competition from cheap and abundant natural gas    these initiatives prevent things from getting worse for coal  but they won t help much   said charles dayton  vice president of market analytics at doyle trading consultants in colorado  which has been tracking reserve levels on public lands   shares in cloud peak were up about  percent in early trading on tuesday  ahead of the executive order  with peabody up   percent and arch down   percent   the current level of reserves appeared to be within historical norms  a decade ago  under republican president george w  bush when there were no bans on federal coal leasing  the industry had about  years worth of leases on federal lands  according to a reuters examination of securities filings   arch coal and peabody confirmed they have substantial reserves on their federal leases already  but nonetheless welcomed trump s move    peabody has a comfortable amount of reserves in the powder river basin  although we recognize the poor public policy represented by the leasing moratorium put into place by the prior administration   peabody spokesman vic svec told reuters in an email   arch coal has  sufficient permitted reserves to sustain our operations on federal lands for a number of years to come   spokeswoman logan bonacorsi said   but as with all producers we will need to add reserves over time  and the ability to obtain those reserves when needed is important    officials at peak and contura did not respond to requests for comment   trump s executive order will also seek to undo obama era rules limiting carbon emissions  one example is the clean power plan  a regulation that would have increased pressure on states to replace coal fired power stations with ones using cleaner fuels like natural gas  wind and solar   obama s administration imposed the temporary ban on new federal coal leases in january  as part of a broad environmental and economic review to ensure royalties from lease deals provide fair returns to taxpayers   it was not immediately clear whether the royalty review would continue even with the ban on leases lifted  some analysts said this scenario could trigger a near term land rush by companies fearing higher royalty rates in the future   coal accounts for about a third of u s  electricity production  down from about half a decade ago  about  percent of all u s  coal comes from federal lands  mainly in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana   luke popovich  a spokesman for the national mining association industry group  said he expected trump s executive order to have symbolic impact  at least    lifting the moratorium would strengthen the signal to markets that the federal government is not any longer standing in the way of fossil energy   he said   he added that re opening federal lands to new leases could also play into a production upswing if demand ultimately increases  the u s  energy information administration has forecast a  percent increase in western coal production to   million short tons by   driven mainly by higher natural gas prices   others were less optimistic about the u s  coal industry s outlook  saying the best trump could do is slow the sector s decline  since   coal production has plunged more than  percent to the lowest levels since  due to falling prices  the industry has been hit with massive layoffs and bankruptcies
