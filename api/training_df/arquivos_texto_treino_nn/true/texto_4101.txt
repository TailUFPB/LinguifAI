washington  reuters    expanding the u s  navy to  ships as recommended by military leaders and backed by president donald trump would cost some   billion more over the next  years than the currently planned  ship fleet  according to a study released on monday  the annual cost to build  crew and operate a  ship fleet would be about   billion  or  percent more than the   billion needed for the currently planned navy  according to the study by the nonpartisan congressional budget office  the   billion cost of the  ship fleet is  percent more than congress appropriated in  for the current  ship navy  the cbo said  to achieve the larger force  the navy would need    billion annually for ship construction  which is  percent more than the average amount that congress has appropriated for shipbuilding in the past  years  the cbo study said  the navy s  shipbuilding plan called for boosting the size of the fleet to  ships  which was expected to cost    billion per year to implement over  years  with trump pressing for an expansion of the fleet to  ships during the presidential campaign last year  the navy released a new force structure assessment in december seeking a  ship navy  taking into consideration older ships being retired  creating a  ship fleet would require the navy to buy about  new ships over  years  compared with  under its previous plan for a  ship fleet  the cbo study found  the navy would have to buy about  ships per year under the larger fleet plan  versus about eight per year under the earlier plan  the larger fleet would require more civilian and uniformed personnel and more aircraft  pushing up overall operating costs  the cbo said  the increase in shipbuilding would force all seven u s  shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in order to meet the demand for vessels  the cbo said  the greatest challenge would be building submarines to meet the force structure requirements  the report said  the study said the earliest the navy could achieve a  ship fleet would be the year   or  years from now
