washington san francisco  reuters    eighteen u s  states sued president donald trump s administration on friday to stop him from scrapping a key component of obamacare  subsidies to insurers that help millions of low income people pay medical expenses  even as trump invited democratic leaders to negotiate a deal  one day after his administration announced plans to end the payments next week  trump said he would dismantle obamacare  step by step    his latest action raised concerns about chaos in insurance markets  the subsidies cost   billion this year and were estimated at   billion for   according to congressional analysts   as far as the subsidies are concerned  i don t want to make the insurance companies rich   trump told reporters at the white house   they re making a fortune by getting that kind of money   trump s action took aim at a critical element of the  law  his democratic predecessor barack obama s signature domestic policy achievement  frustrated by the failure of his fellow republicans who control both houses of congress to repeal and replace obamacare  trump has taken several steps to chip away at it  democrats accused trump of sabotaging the law   democratic attorneys general from the  states as well as  washington  d c   filed a lawsuit in federal court in california later on friday  the states include  california  connecticut  delaware  kentucky  illinois  iowa  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  new mexico  new york  north carolina  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  vermont  virginia and washington state  the states will ask the court to force trump to make the next payment  legal experts said the states were likely to face an uphill battle in court       his effort to gut these subsidies with no warning or even a plan to contain the fallout is breathtakingly reckless   new york attorney general eric schneiderman said   this is an effort simply to blow up the system   the new lawsuit would be separate from a case pending before an appeals court in the district of columbia in which  democratic state attorneys general are defending the legality of the payments  if the subsidies vanish  low income americans who obtain insurance through obamacare online marketplaces where insurers can sell policies would face higher insurance premiums and out of pocket medical costs  it would particularly hurt lower middle class families whose incomes are still too high to qualify for certain government assistance  about  million people are enrolled in obamacare through its online marketplaces  and most receive subsidies  trump s action came just weeks before the period starting on nov   when individuals have to begin enrolling for  insurance coverage through the law s marketplaces  the administration will not make the next payment to insurers  scheduled for wednesday  u s  attorney general jeff sessions said  senate democratic leader chuck schumer expressed optimism about chances for a deal with republicans to continue the subsidy payments   we re going to have a very good opportunity to get this done in a bipartisan way  during negotiations in december on broad federal spending legislation   if we can t get it done sooner   schumer told reporters  trump offered an invitation for democratic leaders to come to the white house  while also lashing out at them   we ll negotiate some deal that s good for everybody  but they re always a bloc vote against everything  they re like obstructionists   trump told reporters  the senate failed in both july and september to pass legislation backed by trump to repeal obamacare due to opposition by a handful of republican senators  one of them  susan collins  a moderate republican from maine who had been contemplating running for governor next year  on friday said she planned to remain in the senate and would use her voice in reforming the healthcare system  hospitals  doctors  health insurers  state insurance commissioners and patient advocates decried trump s move  saying consumers will ultimately pay the price  they called on congress to appropriate the funds needed to keep up the subsidy payments  shares of u s  hospital companies and health insurers closed down on friday after the subsidies announcement  centene corp  cnc n  closed down   percent and molina healthcare  moh n  closed down   percent  among hospital shares  tenet healthcare  thc n  finished   percent lower and community health systems  cyh n  declined   percent   the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated that erasing the subsidies would increase the federal deficit by   billion over the next decade because the government still would be obligated under other parts of obamacare to help lower income people pay for insurance premiums  trump  who as a candidate last year promised to roll back the law formally called the affordable care act  received applause for his latest action during an appearance on friday before a group of conservative voters   it s step by step by step  and that was a very big step yesterday   trump said   and one by one  it s going to come down  and we re going to have great healthcare in our country   earlier on twitter he called obamacare  a broken mess  that is  imploding   and referred to the  pet insurance companies  of democrats  republicans for seven years had vowed to get rid of obamacare  but deep intra party divisions have scuttled their efforts to get legislation through the senate  where they hold a slim majority  since taking office in january  trump threatened many times to cut the subsidies  health insurers that planned to stay in the obamacare market prepared for the move in many states by submitting two sets of premium rates to regulators  with and without the subsidies  the national association of insurance commissioners said the change would drive up premium costs for consumers by at least  to  percent in  and cut more than   billion in payments to insurers for   the white house announced the cut off just hours after trump signed an order intended to allow insurers to sell lower cost  bare bones policies with limited benefits and consumer protections  republicans have called obamacare an unnecessary government intrusion into the american healthcare system  democrats have said the law needs some fixes but noted that it had brought insurance to  million people
