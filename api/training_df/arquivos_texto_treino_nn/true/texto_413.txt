washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson s expected exit from the  trump administration is one of many staff changes likely as president donald trump nears the end of his first year in office  with sources saying top economic adviser gary cohn and  son in law jared kushner could be among those who depart  cohn  whose relationship with trump became tense earlier this year  has considered leaving once the republican effort to overhaul the u s  tax system is completed in congress  according to the sources with ties to the white house who spoke on condition of anonymity  kushner  who has seen his influence in the white house shrink  may receive a  face saving  exit as he deals with legal challenges related to a special counsel s investigation of trump s  presidential campaign s potential ties to russia  one of the sources said   this is pure speculation   said white house spokesman raj shah in an emailed statement about potential staff moves  more junior level advisers could also use the completion of trump s first year and tax legislation as a pivot point to move on  leading to another period of uncertainty that has at times overshadowed trump s tenure  which began on jan    things change quickly at the trump white house  advisers and cabinet members who fall out of favor with the president can re enter his good graces  making it hard to predict staff moves  but shifts in personnel are watched around the world for indications of how trump will tackle issues ranging from north korea to regulatory policy   it may be february  it may be march  it may be april  but i think once you get to that time period  people are going to feel as though they ve kind of put their time in   said one person with close ties to the white house   you re definitely going to see some people leave after tax cuts get done   said a separate trump adviser  who requested anonymity to speak freely about the administration  trump is considering a plan to oust tillerson  whose relationship has been strained by the top u s  diplomat s softer line on north korea and other differences  senior administration officials said  a state department spokeswoman said tillerson s chief of staff had been told by the white house that the reports of tillerson being replaced were not true  cohn s future in the white house has come into question since his public criticism of trump s response to the violence at a white supremacist rally in virginia in august  their once tense relationship has since improved  however  and one source close to the white house said he could stay longer to help spearhead legislation to improve u s  infrastructure   i d go a little bit against conventional wisdom here and say he s got one more project to get under his belt before he leaves   the source said  referring to infrastructure  the white house noted cohn s interview with cnbc earlier this month in which said he did not plan to leave after tax reform was finished   it s my plan to stay and work as long as i can help the president drive his economic agenda   cohn said  two of the sources with ties to the white house said they assumed the white house chief of staff  general john kelly  wanted at least to outlast his predecessor reince priebus  six month tenure in the position  the white house spokesman s statement said discussion of changes was speculation    one of the sources said kushner  who is married to trump s daughter ivanka trump  could go if a scenario  such as giving him an outside adviser role  were found that appealed to the president   once someone comes up with a solution that sounds right  then i think he s going to latch on   the source said  kushner told the washington post this month that he and his wife  a fellow white house adviser  were  here to stay   though a lot of speculation about departures has focused on high profile names  the possibility of mid level staffers leaving could have a big impact on the rhythms of the white house   the difference in this administration is that you don t have replacements already on staff  or people clamoring to get on board  said one of the sources with ties to the white house
