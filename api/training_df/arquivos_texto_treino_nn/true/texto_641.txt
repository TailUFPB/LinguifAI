 reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions on tuesday denied that he misled legislators when he previously failed to disclose a meeting he attended with then candidate donald trump and aides where campaign connections to russia were discussed  sessions testified in congress that  following a guilty plea by trump campaign foreign policy advisor george papadopoulos  he now remembers a march  meeting at which papadopoulos was present and suggested he could arrange a meeting with russian president vladimir putin  democratic representative ted lieu  who sits on the house of representatives judiciary committee  said on twitter on tuesday he believes sessions committed perjury when he previously denied knowledge of contact between trump s campaign and russia   the following describes the crime of perjury and whether it would apply to sessions  conduct  what is perjury      a person can be convicted of perjury only if they intentionally make a false statement under oath about a fact pertinent to a relevant investigation or criminal case  under federal law the penalty for perjury is a prison sentence of up to five years or eight years in terrorism related cases   you can t x ray people s minds to see what they were thinking and what they knew  so perjury can be a difficult crime to prove   said bennett gershman  a professor of criminal law at pace law school   did sessions commit perjury      some legal experts said there is a strong argument that sessions committed perjury at an oct   oversight hearing before the senate judiciary committee  during that hearing  democratic senator al franken asked sessions whether  surrogates from the trump campaign had communications with the russians   sessions responded   i did not  and i m not aware of anyone else that did  and i don t believe it happened   gershman said that sessions  failure to disclose the papadopoulos meeting could amount to perjury  perjury prosecutions based on congressional testimony are rare  in part because lawmakers often ask circuitous questions  but in this case franken asked a straightforward question and the response sessions gave was misleading  gershman said  however  stuart green  a professor of criminal law at rutgers university school of law  said sessions would have a plausible argument that papadopoulos  communications were not the type of contacts franken was asking about since they were with russian government intermediaries rather than russian officials   there s a bit of wiggle room there   green said      what if sessions says he forgot about papadopoulos  remarks      sessions said at the hearing on tuesday that he forgot about the march  meeting because the trump campaign was  a form of chaos  from the beginning   we traveled all the time  sometimes to several places in one day  sleep was in short supply   he said  a prosecutor could use circumstantial evidence to undermine such a defense  lawyers said  gershman said sessions  statement that he did not recall papadopoulos  remarks at the meeting would raise skepticism since sessions led the meeting  trump attended it and important national security matters were discussed   it s something a person would be hard pressed to claim they don t remember   he said       who could prosecute sessions for perjury      any charges against sessions would likely be brought by special counsel robert mueller  green said that mueller s mandate clearly encompasses looking into whether sessions tried to conceal the extent of russia s influence in the election  but gershman noted that mueller may be reluctant to charge sessions with perjury because the case would not be solid   when you bring a charge against a high profile figure you don t want to lose because then it looks like a witchunt   he said
