washington  reuters    president donald trump is unlikely to pick economic adviser gary cohn as his nominee for federal reserve chairman because cohn is playing a crucial role in the white house tax reform effort  a senior administration official said on wednesday   no decision has been made and no candidate has been ruled out but gary s role is too crucial to getting tax reform done  it might be too important for him to continue to be the lead  for him to announce a change at this time   the official said  the republican president is looking to announce a fed chair nominee before leaving on a trip to asia on nov    in order to give his choice time to go through the senate confirmation process  current fed chair janet yellen s term ends in early february  but an announcement is unlikely this week  said another source familiar with the situation  trump told republican senators during a private lunch on tuesday that his focus for a new fed chair was on stanford university economist john taylor  fed governor jerome powell and yellen  a source familiar with the meeting said  when trump asked the senators for a show of hands on whether they would prefer taylor or powell  the most support went for taylor  the source said  cohn irritated trump by criticizing the president s response to violence in charlottesville  virginia  in august at a white supremacist rally  but the two men in recent weeks seemed to have ironed out their differences  with trump singling out cohn for praise for his help in the tax reform effort  trump is also considering a fifth candidate for the fed job  former federal reserve governor kevin warsh  sources have said  trump told fox business network that he admired yellen but that the decision to pick a new fed chair was something to which he would like to contribute   you like to make your own mark  which is maybe one of the things she s got a little bit against her  but i think she is terrific  we ve had a great talk and we are obviously doing great together  you look at the markets   trump told the network
