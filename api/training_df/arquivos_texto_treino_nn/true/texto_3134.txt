washington  reuters    one of president donald trump s personal lawyers said in television interviews on sunday that the president was not under investigation for obstruction of justice  but when pressed on the assertion  said he was not certain   the fact of the matter is the president has not been and is not under investigation   jay sekulow  a new member of trump s legal team  said on cbs   face the nation  in one of four interviews he gave on sunday  there have been multiple news reports and a tweet from trump himself on friday that began with   i am being investigated   challenged on  fox news sunday  about the issue  sekulow said he could not be certain trump was not under investigation but that no one had notified the legal team if that was the case   it is common for subjects of federal investigations not to know they are under scrutiny  especially in the initial phases   a source familiar with the mueller probe said on thursday that investigators would have to gather a large amount of evidence before an interview with the president would be warranted   trump  who has denied any collusion between his campaign and russia  has frequently lashed out about the allegations  which have overshadowed his administration s efforts to overhaul the healthcare system  cut taxes and boost jobs  mueller  the special counsel named by the justice department to probe the russia matter  is investigating whether anyone associated with trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with russian officials or others with ties to the kremlin  russian officials have denied meddling in the u s  election  the source familiar with the mueller probe told reuters that mueller was also examining whether trump or others tried to interfere with the investigation  sekulow said that trump  in his tweet  was reacting to a story in the washington post  which was the first to report  mueller was examining whether trump had tried to obstruct the probe by firing fbi director james comey in may  sekulow acknowledged that he could not be certain that the report was false   i cannot read the mind of the special prosecutor   he said   peter carr  a spokesman for the mueller team  declined to comment  sekulow  a conservative activist and radio talk show host  earlier this month joined trump s legal team  which is led by marc kasowitz   sekulow has publicly criticized comey  whom trump fired   in addition to being the author of several books such as  undemocratic  how unelected  unaccountable bureaucrats are stealing your liberty and freedom   sekulow is the chief counsel for the american center for law and justice  a politically conservative christian organization  barak cohen  a former justice department lawyer and now a defense attorney specializing in white collar crime and investigations  said there was no requirement that the special counsel notify trump he was under investigation  so the lack of such notice meant nothing  he said  however  that sekulow s comments could mean the white house was taking the position that no investigation exists until mueller s team officially confirms it  disregarding media reports based on anonymous sourcing  cohen said the first official communication that a target is under investigation typically comes when prosecutors begin requesting documents and other evidence  at that time  defense lawyers often will ask about their clients  status  prosecutors will often answer then to avoid misleading the target  they may not answer if they are trying to build a case and develop further evidence   no answer is probably the most troubling answer in criminal defense   cohen said
