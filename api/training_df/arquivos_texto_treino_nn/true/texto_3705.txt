washington  reuters    a bipartisan bill introduced on thursday would prohibit members of the u s  congress from ever working as lobbyists after they leave the senate or house of representatives  republican senator cory gardner with democratic senators michael bennet and al franken in introducing the senate legislation to stop the lucrative  revolving door  practice that has drawn the ire of watchdog groups for decades   by banning members of congress from lobbying when they leave capitol hill  we can begin to restore confidence in our national politics   gardner said in a statement  similar legislation has failed in the past  currently  there are only temporary restrictions on former members of congress becoming lobbyists  the center for responsive politics has noted that former members often score large salaried lobbying jobs  sometimes of   million or more  the non partisan group found that just over  percent of former members of the  congress     became lobbyists  besides a lifetime ban on lobbying for current members of congress  the legislation would require former congressional aides to wait six years instead of one year before engaging in lobbying and require better reporting of lobbying activities
