manila  reuters    across asia  more and more countries are being pulled into beijing s orbit  with the timid stance adopted by southeast asian nations on the south china sea at a weekend summit a clear sign this fundamental geostrategic shift is gathering momentum  u s  president donald trump s flurry of calls at the weekend to the leaders of the philippines  thailand and singapore might cheer those who fear his predecessor barack obama s  pivot  to asia has been abandoned in favor of an  america first  agenda  but white house chief of staff reince priebus said the conversations were aimed at lining up asian partners in case tensions over north korea lead to  nuclear and massive destruction in asia   and mentioned no broader strategic goal  southeast asian nations will need more than that to convince them the united states still has their backs  in the meantime  some are leaning closer to china  soft pedalling quarrels over the disputed south china sea and angling for a slice of beijing s  one belt  one road  infrastructure investment program to compensate for the u s  abandonment of the trans pacific partnership trade pact  the unexpected bonhomie that has emerged between trump and chinese president xi jinping could give asian countries further confidence to continue their swing toward beijing   before  most southeast asian states wanted to benefit from chinese regional economic initiatives and from american pushback against china   said malcolm cook  a senior fellow at the institute of southeast asian studies in singapore   the second part of this balance is now in question  hence  the pressure to acquiesce to china diplomatically and on security issues is stronger   philippines president rodrigo duterte  piqued by the obama administration s criticism of his human rights record  last year announced his  separation  from longtime ally the united states while on a visit to beijing  the white house described trump s conversation with the firebrand philippines leader as  very friendly  and   prompting criticism from human rights watch for  effectively endorsing duterte s murderous war on drugs    invited him to washington  but  underlining his new found friendship with beijing  duterte on monday inspected a chinese naval ships docked at his hometown  the first visit of its kind to the philippines in years  duterte  who last year put aside a legal challenge to beijing s sweeping territorial claims in the south china sea to start negotiating billions of dollars worth of loans and infrastructure investments  chaired the latest summit of the  nation association of southeast asian nations  asean  in manila  several asean diplomats said china sent officials to lobby the philippines ahead of the summit  and before the leaders had even gathered duterte said it was pointless pressuring beijing over its maritime activities  an early draft of the summit statement seen by reuters made references to land reclamation and militarization in the disputed waterway  but they were subsequently dropped  as were references to  tensions  and  escalation of activities    cook said it was clear that  with the philippines steering the summit to this conclusion   it is no longer just cambodia that is acting as an agent of chinese influence in asean over the south china sea dispute   thailand and malaysia have also moved closer to china  thailand s relations with washington came under strain during the obama administration because of concerns about freedoms under its military dominated government  trump invited prime minister prayuth chan ocha to visit washington during their call on sunday  but the former general s government has its eyes elsewhere  last week it approved the first of three submarine purchases from china worth more than   billion  singapore prime minister lee hsien loong says washington s new posture has shifted asia s political and economic balance  lee  whose country  like vietnam  has shown no signs of moving closer to beijing  stressed to his asean counterparts on saturday that  despite trump s  radically different approach   they should balance their ties between the united states and china  trump has said he will attend two summits in the region in november  but southeast asian nations are trying to gauge how far they can still rely on washington as a shield against chinese assertiveness  asean foreign ministers will be seeking answers at a meeting with secretary of state rex tillerson in washington this thursday  uncertainty over washington s commitment  analysts say  will only draw asean countries further toward china  which can lure them with cheap loans  infrastructure investments and tariff cuts  but with a risk of diminished bargaining power  thitinan pongsudhirak  director of the institute of security and international studies at bangkok s chulalongkorn university  said it was imperative for asean to regain leverage by bringing washington back into the equation and expanding the influence of japan   asean is in a precarious position now with the concessions  accommodation and even appeasement with china   thitinan said      if china continues to be shrewd and takes asean on another ride  then asean will be much worse off
