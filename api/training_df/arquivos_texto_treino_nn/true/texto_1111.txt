washington  reuters    president donald trump s disavowal this week of a bipartisan agreement to stabilize obamacare has further eroded the already minimal trust congressional democrats had in him  complicating prospects for gaining their cooperation on a range of issues  trump s fellow republicans who control congress will need at least some democratic support to pass critical legislation in the coming months to avert a government shutdown and prevent an unprecedented u s  debt default   i ve been here with every president since jerry ford   said democratic senator patrick leahy  who was first elected to the u s  senate in  and is its longest serving member   i ve always been willing to negotiate with anybody because they always keep their word  if you have a president who doesn t keep his word  it makes it more difficult   leahy said when asked about trump s interactions with congress  trump initially backed the bipartisan deal announced on tuesday by democratic senator patty murray and republican senator lamar alexander for shoring up insurance marketplaces established under obamacare for two years by reviving federal subsidies to private insurers that trump has scrapped  a day later  trump disowned it  going forward  democratic senator jeanne shaheen said that while more collaboration with trump is possible   i think we have to know that we can t count on him   trump enraged republicans in september with his collaboration with top senate democrat chuck schumer and top house of representatives democrat nancy pelosi  trump cut a short term spending deal with them  blindsiding republican leaders  and then discussed with them the outlines of a plan to revive protections for young adult immigrants dubbed  dreamers  brought into the united states illegally as children  on both healthcare and dreamers  trump has shown that while he relishes deal making  he is quick to row back in the face of a conservative backlash  the president also has sent signals over the past few weeks that he is wavering on working with democrats to help the dreamers  making demands that could be a deal breaker  republicans have worked seven years to get rid of obamacare  democratic former president barack obama s signature legislative achievement  and many of them vehemently opposed the alexander murray deal  it remains unclear whether it will ever come to a vote in the senate or house  because spending legislation requires a super majority of  votes in the  seat senate and there are  republican senators  it cannot pass without at least eight democrats backing it  because hard line house conservatives often oppose spending bills  democratic support is expected to be needed there as well   a dec   deadline is looming for passing the spending measure needed to prevent a shutdown  democrats could demand a steep price for their support  potentially an obamacare fix and action to help the dreamers  under a budget resolution passed by the senate on thursday night  republicans need only a simple majority to pass trump s proposed major tax cuts  though he has urged democrats to support the overhaul  schumer  who trump earlier in the year called the democrats   head clown  before their thaw last month  this week vented his frustration about the president  saying he  keeps zigging and zagging so it s impossible to govern    this president cannot govern if  whenever the hard right frightens him and says  jump   he says  how high    schumer told reporters on wednesday  schumer and pelosi dined at the white house with trump last month  and left feeling as if they had a deal on a proposal to help continue protections for the dreamers that the president has moved to end effective in march  within a day  trump began distancing himself from that deal  with the white house later floating a series of hard line immigration  principles   including money for a wall along the u s  mexico border fiercely opposed by democrats  that have thrown the entire effort into doubt  pelosi and schumer argue their deal with trump is still salvageable  as the president himself has not called it off  pelosi spokesman drew hammill acknowledged that the principles  don t help  the effort  but hammill said that would not stop pelosi  a former house speaker first elected to the chamber in   from engaging trump in the future   it was always a case by case thing  it was never  the switch was on   full time  hammill said  there will be plenty of cases to come in the weeks ahead  giving trump an opportunity to improve his relations with democrats if that is what he wants  hammill said  as congress and the white house approach the december deadline for settling fiscal affairs  hammill said trump can use that opportunity to stabilize obamacare and shield dreamers from deportation   if he s unable to do that  we re unable to work with him on his priorities   including taxes  hammill said
