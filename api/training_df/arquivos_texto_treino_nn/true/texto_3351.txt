washington  reuters    u s  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch said on wednesday it is not yet clear how big a tax cut congress can deliver through tax reform  despite calls by president donald trump and other republicans for steep reductions in business tax rates  hatch  whose panel oversees tax policy in the senate  told a washington tax policy forum he could also accept a tax reform plan that expands the federal deficit  despite opposition from deficit hawks  trump and other republicans have promised the biggest overhaul of the u s  tax system since the reagan era  but the white house says a detailed proposal is not expected until september  allowing little time in  for congress to act on such a major piece of legislation  the white house wants to cut the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  while republicans in the house of representatives have proposed  percent  but hatch said he is not committed to any rate targets  because discussions have yet to focus on specific policy changes  including the elimination of tax breaks  needed to help pay for rate reductions   until we perform the surgery and start eliminating preferences and credits in order to bring down rates     we cannot speak definitively on the rate targets   the utah republican said   all of that is going to take some time   he added  a day after joining treasury secretary steven mnuchin  white house economic adviser gary cohn and republican congressional leaders for a weekly tax reform meeting on capitol hill   the trump administration and congressional republicans are trying to forge agreement on a tax reform package that can clear the house and senate this year  the main challenge is the  member senate  where republicans cannot afford to lose more than two votes from their  seat majority  a top issue for debate is whether tax reform should avoid expanding the deficit by including policy changes that pay for tax cuts   i don t see a problem with a tax reform proposal that loses revenue in the short term  if we can show that it will help put our economy on a better growth path   hatch said      however  we do have some budget hawks in our conference who will have a difficult time supporting a package that adds to the deficit  and we ll have to take that into account  because once again we can t afford to lose too many votes
