dubai  reuters    u s  president donald trump  departing from his predecessor s practice  is expected to sidestep human rights questions when he meets gulf arab leaders at the weekend and focus  to the dismay of  beleaguered government critics  on business and security  civil liberties monitors point to freedom of expression as a right increasingly constrained in gulf arab states including summit host saudi arabia  which is planning to buy tens of billions of dollars  worth of u s  arms   gulf arab states began stepping up the muffling of political discussion in the dying months of former president barack obama s term and have continued this under trump  they say   given trump s tenuous relationship with freedom of the press and free expression in general  we have no expectation that trump would raise these issues during his visit   said adam coogle  middle east researcher at human rights watch  in washington  a senior trump administration official said human rights would not take center stage in riyadh  where arab leaders are expected to discuss combating islamist militancy and what they see as the growing influence of adversary iran  the official said trump preferred to keep such conversations private  much as he did with egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi recently when he obtained the release of an egyptian american humanitarian worker  trump s visit is likely to contrast with one obama paid to egypt in  when he made an appeal to the muslim world promoting self determination  democracy and individual rights   the saudis  don t want any more talk about human rights  democracy  political reform or gender equality  they had enough of that from barack obama and hillary clinton   said bruce riedel of the brookings institution think tank in washington    they re pretty confident they re not going to hear it from donald trump   while experts are not surprised  since the gulf states  monarchies abhor discord and dislike free wheeling political debate as practised in the west  they are nevertheless dismayed  the output of several columnists  economists and clerics in regional powerhouse saudi arabia and some of its smaller neighbors has either dried up or grown circumspect since the second half of  in what critics see as an unacknowledged state drive to stifle public criticism  rights monitors say  among those who have fallen silent are critics  both liberal  and conservative  of the kingdom s ambitious plan to diversify the economy and open up the country culturally under a plan known as vision   until late last year saudi writer jamal khashoggi commented about issues including trump s rise to power on social media and a column in the pan arab al hayat daily  he also spoke in public appearances at think tanks  in december  news circulated on social media that kashoggi  former editor of the arabic language al watan daily  one of the kingdom s top newspapers  had been ordered to stop writing or tweeting  his account has been silent since november last year  khashoggi declined to comment on the reported ban  since the  arab spring  gulf states have stepped up efforts to curb dissent with tough new cyber crime laws  sentencing offenders to prison terms for web posts deemed insulting to rulers or threatening to public order  but in the past two years  unnerved by low oil prices and the slow progress of a war in yemen targeting the influence of arch foe iran  gulf authorities became even less patient with dissenting voices in the media  analysts and rights groups say  madawi al rasheed  visiting professor at the middle east centre  london school of economics  said riyadh was engaged in an effort to muzzle intellectuals with  dissenting voices    there are so many of them  both men and women  who have left the kingdom   she said  activists say muzzled writers include economists  academics  columnists and muslim clerics  there are no precise figures on how many have been affected  but estimates by activists put the number at more than  from saudi arabia alone  while some were merely advised not to air their views on social media  more vocal critics have found themselves behind bars  facing possible indictments on charges such as disobeying the ruler or incitement against the state  rights activists say   the pursuit by security is increasing rapidly and     it is killing the voice of moderation   said walid sulais  a saudi rights activist who fled abroad in late  after authorities summoned him for questioning over his rights work  gulf arab officials did not respond to requests for comment on the issue of free expression  but asked about the expected absence of human rights from trump s agenda  saudi foreign minister adel al jubeir said the issue was one of definition   we look at human rights as the right to safety  the right to a decent life  the right to a job  the right to food  we see it as the right to live your life without people imposing on you   he told a news conference on thursday   every saudi has the right to petition his monarch or the governors  the doors of our leaders are open  we have built institutions  we have a thriving press corps  we have a consultative council that started with  members  today it has  members  and  of them are ladies  distinguished ladies    gulf states have increasingly chafed at what they see as a campaign of vilification by western media and rights groups  they insist they respect rights which do not violate islamic sharia laws and their societies  conservative traditions  political parties are banned in saudi arabia as are protests  unions are illegal  the press is controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison  riyadh says it does not have political prisoners  while top officials have said monitoring activists is needed to keep social stability   in a statement on jan    bahrain s information minister scolded gulf media  warning outlets to  shoulder their responsibilities  and counter foreign attempts to  spread sedition  in gulf states   an apparent reference to iran which bahrain accuses of fomenting unrest among bahraini shi ites  iran denies interfering in the affairs of gulf states      other gulf countries  including the united arab emirates  qatar and oman  have also been accused by rights groups of curbing free expression  in qatar  activists noted that faisal al marzoqi  a prominent commentator with more than   twitter followers  had not tweeted since november   the uae said on march  it had arrested political activist ahmed mansoor  an electrical engineer and poet  on charges of spreading sectarianism and hatred on social media  a move criticized by amnesty international  defending the move  mohammed al hammadi  editor of the pro government al ittihad newspaper  wrote that mansoor  either will be convicted or will be cleared through the rule of law and the justice of the judiciary  so what is the problem with this   in february saudi social media reported the arrest of prominent clerics sheikh essam al owayed and saad al breik  in a twitter post on feb    owayed wrote in apparent reference to liberalizing reforms   any decision maker who thinks he can change the faith and identity of this country by opening the doors to decadence would be calling for a war in which he would be the main loser  no matter who he is   owayed s twitter account has had no new postings since then  while the last twitter message on breik s account dates to march   neither owayed nor breik could be reached for a comment  on may  on a visit to saudi arabia  un special rapporteur on human rights and counter terrorism ben emmerson urged riyadh to stop using a  counter terrorism law and security prohibitions against human rights defenders and writers    when he is meeting with his counterparts from saudi arabia and other gulf countries there  he should be equally as clear that any counter terrorism efforts must include safeguards to protect the rights of individuals to express their opinions and assemble peacefully   philip luther  amnesty international s director for the middle east and north africa  told reuters
