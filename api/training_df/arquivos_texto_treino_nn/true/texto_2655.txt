washington  reuters    the united states and china failed on wednesday to agree on major new steps to reduce the u s  trade deficit with china  casting doubt over president donald trump s economic and security relations with beijing   the annual economic dialogue session in washington ended with canceled news conferences  no joint statement and no new announcements on u s  market access to china  the two sides had a  frank exchange  but failed to agree on most major bilateral trade and economic issues that were important to the united states  a senior u s  official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly  these included u s  demands for access to china s financial services markets  reducing excess chinese steel capacity  reductions in auto tariffs  cutting subsidies for state owned enterprises  ending chinese requirements for data localization and lifting ownership caps for foreign firms in china  the official said   china acknowledged our shared objective to reduce the trade deficit which both sides will work cooperatively to achieve       u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin and u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said in a brief statement  highlighting a rare point of consensus  the chinese embassy in washington cast the talks in a positive light  saying in a statement that both sides had acknowledged  significant progress  on the  day talks and would to work together to reduce the trade deficit   the two sides will expand areas of cooperation in services and increase trade in services  expand mutual investment  and create a more open  equitable  transparent and convenient investment environment   the embassy said  both sides agreed that one of the solutions to address the trade imbalance is for the united states to expand exports to china  instead of reducing imports from china  said chinese vice finance minister zhu guangyao after the conclusion of the talks  to address the imbalance  china has been urging the united states to remove regulations on export control and increase the exports of high tech products to china  the official xinhua news agency cited zhu as saying   china will push for this in a one year action plan for economic cooperation which both sides discussed  zhu said   far from mar a lago the session had been billed as a follow up to trump s first meeting with chinese president xi jinping at his mar a lago  florida  estate in april when trump hailed xi s cooperation in curbing the threat from north korea  trump said that this would lead to better trade terms for china  the two leaders launched a  day economic plan that has produced some industry specific announcements  including the resumption of american beef sales in china and pledged to grant limited u s  access to some financial services sectors  but there have been no new initiatives since  and trump has grown increasingly frustrated with china s lack of pressure on north korea  his administration has threatened new sanctions on small chinese banks and other firms doing business with pyongyang   ross and mnuchin said the u s  position on the china trade relationship would be guided by  the principles of balance  fairness  and reciprocity on matters of trade will continue to guide the american position so we can give american workers and businesses an opportunity to compete on a level playing field   china s delegation leader  vice premier wang yang  left the treasury building without speaking to reporters  earlier  he had warned that confrontation between the two countries would be damaging  investors interpreted the negative signals from the talks and lack of new trade announcements as making it more likely that trump would forge ahead with broad steel tariffs or quotas based on a national security review  sending steelmakers  shares soaring  shares of united states steel corp closed up   percent  while ak steel rose   percent and nucor rose   percent  trump  asked by a reporter at the white house after the stock market closed whether he would impose steel tariffs  said   could happen   potential steel tariffs  which could be announced in the coming weeks  were expected to be a difficult topic in the u s  china talks  ross has blamed massive chinese excess capacity for a global steel glut that is hurting u s  producers  wednesday s deadlock was unsettling for u s  business groups that had hoped to put more cracks in beijing s market access barriers and obviate more aggressive measures from the white house that could destabilize trade ties   we are disappointed the comprehensive economic dialogue ended at an apparent impasse  it is important for governments to take tangible steps to address long standing issues and ensure the commercial relationship remains a source of stability in the overall relationship   said jacob parker  vice president of china operations at the u s  china business council   even if the u s  and chinese governments fail to agree on more substantive trade terms  corporate chief executive officers from the two countries pledged to deepen their cooperation and joint investment efforts  led by blackstone group ceo stephen schwarzman and alibaba group ceo jack ma  a group of  executives said they were committing to increase bilateral trade  including the export of u s  agricultural goods  liquefied natural gas and consumer products to china   a stable  growing economic relationship between the united states and china is mutually beneficial to the people of our two countries and for the world   ma and schwarzman said in a statement
