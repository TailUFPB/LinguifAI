san francisco  reuters    facebook inc said on wednesday it had found that an operation likely based in russia spent    on thousands of u s  ads promoting divisive social and political messages in a two year period through may  facebook  the dominant social media network  said   ads and   inauthentic  accounts and pages spread polarizing views on topics including immigration  race and gay rights  another    was spent on    potentially politically related  ads  likely by russians  facebook said   u s  election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate  non u s  citizens may generally advertise on issues  other ads  such as those that mention a candidate but do not call for the candidate s election or defeat  fall into what lawyers have called a legal gray area   facebook announced the findings in a blog post by its chief security officer  alex stamos  and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the  u s  presidential election   facebook briefed members of both the senate and house of representatives intelligence committees on wednesday about the suspected russia advertising  according to a congressional source familiar with the matter  both committees are conducting probes into alleged russian interference in the  u s  election  including potential collusion between the campaign of president donald trump and moscow  facebook also gave its findings to robert mueller  the special counsel in charge of investigating alleged russian interference in last year s presidential election  a source familiar with the matter said  the company produced copies of advertisements as well as data about the buyers  the source said  mueller s office declined to comment  facebook said it found no link between the russian purchased advertising and any specific presidential campaign  the ads were mostly national in their focus and did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing states  the company said  even if no laws were violated  facebook said the  accounts and pages associated with the ads ran afoul of the social network s requirements for authenticity and have since been suspended   facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages  but some of them included such words as  refugee  and  patriot    more than   billion was spent on political ads during the  presidential campaign  thousands of times more than the presumed russian spending identified by facebook s security team  but the findings buttress u s  intelligence agency conclusions that russia was actively involved in shaping the election  facebook previously published a white paper on influence operations  including what it said were fake  amplifier  accounts for propaganda  and said it was cracking down  as recently as june  facebook told journalists that it had not found any evidence of russian operatives buying election related ads on its platform  representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  called the facebook report  deeply disturbing and yet fully consistent with the unclassified assessment of the intelligence community    we are keenly interested in russia s use of social media platforms  both the use of bots and trolls to spread disinformation and propaganda  including through the use of paid online advertising   he said in a statement  a facebook employee said wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive issue ads and a well known russian  troll factory  in st  petersburg that publishes comments on social media  ellen weintraub  a member of the u s  federal election commission  said u s  voters deserve to know where the ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal   it is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal  state or local election  directly or indirectly   weintraub said in a phone interview   she declined to comment on the facebook ads  saying she could not discuss subjects that could come before the agency  facebook declined to release the ads themselves  prompting a sharp rebuke on twitter from pierre omidyar  the billionaire founder of first look media  a producer of feature and documentary films  television and podcasts   facebook keeps the targeted political ads it publishes secret  emboldening criminals   wrote omidyar  the ebay founder who also provided funding to launch media organization the intercept   i don t see how that can possibly be legal   facebook s disclosure may be the first time a private entity has pointed to receiving russian money related to u s  elections  said brendan fischer  a program director at the campaign legal center  a washington nonprofit that advocates for more transparency    whoever may have provided assistance to russia in buying these facebook ads is very likely in violation of the law   he said  adding that facebook has a legal duty to act if it is aware of similar activity in the future
