washington  reuters    the head of the u s  federal communications commission unveiled plans on tuesday to repeal landmark  rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape  fcc chief ajit pai  a republican appointed by president donald trump in january  said the commission will vote at a dec   meeting on his plan to rescind the so called net neutrality rules championed by democratic former president barack obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities  the rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content  they were intended to ensure a free and open internet  give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content  the action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as at t inc  comcast corp and verizon communications inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price  it represents a setback for google parent alphabet inc and facebook inc  which had urged pai not to rescind the rules  netflix said tuesday it opposed the measure to  roll back these core protections   with three republican and two democratic commissioners  the move is all but certain to be approved  trump  a republican  expressed his opposition to net neutrality in  before the regulations were even implemented  calling it a  power grab  by obama  the white house did not immediately comment tuesday  pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is  inherently an interstate service   the preemption is most likely to handcuff democratic governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers  equal access to internet content   the fcc will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro competitive   pai said in an interview  adding that the obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised  heavy handed  regulation of the internet   we should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses   pai added  tom wheeler  who headed the fcc under obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules  called the planned repeal  a shameful sham and sellout  even for this fcc and its leadership  this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights   at t  comcast and verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing  comcast said no matter what the fcc decided it would  not block  throttle  or discriminate against lawful content    verizon said it believed the fcc  will reinstate a framework that protects consumers  access to the open internet  without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation   the internet association  representing major technology firms including alphabet and facebook  said pai s proposal  represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of americans    this proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect americans  ability to access the entire internet   it said  pai s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content  such disclosure will make it easier for another agency  the federal trade commission  to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers  pai said  the ftc could seek to bar practices that it deemed  anticompetitive  or violated antitrust rules  the fcc received more than  million comments  new york attorney general eric schneiderman disclosed tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments  a u s  appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations  which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association us telecom  the group praised pai s decision to remove  antiquated  restrictive regulations  to  pave the way for broadband network investment  expansion and upgrades   the fcc s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality  nancy pelosi  the top u s  house of representatives democrat  said the fcc move would hurt consumers and chill competition  saying the agency  has launched an all out assault on the entrepreneurship  innovation and competition at the heart of the internet   the planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of obama being erased since trump took office in january  trump has abandoned international trade deals  the landmark paris climate accord and environmental protections  taken aim at the iran nuclear accord and closer relations with cuba  and sought repeal obama s signature healthcare law  pai  who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming fcc chairman  is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda  pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the white house in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by white house officials  the fcc under obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies  language in the new proposal would give the fcc significantly less authority to oversee the web  the fcc granted initial approval to pai s plan in may  but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct  his plan would eliminate the  internet conduct standard   which gave the fcc far reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices
