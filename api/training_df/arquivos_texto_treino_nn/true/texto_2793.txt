san francisco  reuters    a u s  judge on wednesday said he was  very much inclined  to maintain a court order that blocks president donald trump s administration from carrying out a policy designed to threaten federal funds to so called sanctuary cities  at a hearing in san francisco federal court  u s  district judge william orrick iii said a recent memo from the justice department that appeared to narrow the scope of trump s executive order on sanctuary cities did not remove the need for an injunction  trump issued the order in january directing that funding be slashed to all jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with immigration authorities  sanctuary cities generally offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce of federal immigration laws  dozens of local governments and cities  including new york  los angeles and chicago  have joined the growing  sanctuary  movement  the trump administration contends that local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes  the republican president s moves to crack down on immigration have galvanized legal advocacy groups  along with democratic city and state governments  to oppose them in court   after trump issued the sanctuary cities executive order earlier this year  santa clara county   which includes the city of san jose and several smaller silicon valley communities   sued  saying it was unconstitutional  san francisco filed a similar lawsuit  in a ruling in april  orrick said trump s order targeted broad categories of federal funding for sanctuary governments and that plaintiffs challenging the order were likely to succeed in proving it unconstitutional  attorney general jeff sessions then issued a memo which formally endorsed a narrower interpretation of trump s order  saying that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs  in court on wednesday  deputy assistant attorney general brett shumate said the sessions memo meant less than a million dollars were now at risk for santa clara county and san francisco  so the injunction was no longer needed  but orrick said an injunction was still necessary because trump could always order sessions to issue new  broader guidance   the attorney general still has the ability to change that memo   orrick said  the judge said he would also likely reject a justice department request to dismiss other claims by santa clara and san francisco
