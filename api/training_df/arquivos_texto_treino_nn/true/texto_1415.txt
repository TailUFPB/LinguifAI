washington  reuters    president donald trump s tax plan would let u s  companies take bigger  faster deductions on capital investments  a step some experts said would deplete washington s policy arsenal by using up a tax break normally reserved for fighting recessions  by putting a five year  immediate expensing  provision in his plan  trump handed a win to some businesses  especially capital intensive ones such as oil drillers  that could gain from it through savings on new plant and equipment purchases   these changes are something i would  percent support     it would be a huge positive   said paul mosvold  president of privately held scandrill inc  which drills oil wells for anadarko petroleum corp and others  while some industrial sectors might get a short term boost from the tax break  critics said its wider business impact was unclear  as was whether it is needed with the economy slowly but steadily growing and investment capital abundant  moreover  some said  a five year immediate expensing policy could set up a capital investment hangover in late  or  by shifting private sector plant and equipment purchases into the five years covered and out of later years  one outcome would be sure  they said  putting immediate expensing in place for the next five years would make it unavailable until  to combat a possible future recession   it s hard to see how moving to full expensing  except at the margin  would produce the growth that they re looking for from this provision   said corporate tax analyst robert willens  formerly an executive at kpmg and lehman brothers   it s also true that  once you go to full expensing  there s nothing more you can do  particularly during a later downturn when you might really need to provide a jolt to the economy   immediate expensing lets companies take a tax deduction for the full value of new plant and equipment upon purchase  rather than stringing out deductions over several years under accelerated or normal depreciation schedules  immediate expensing has been tried before  but not for as long and at the maximum level proposed by trump  his advisers and congressional republicans  their plan faces months of debate in congress before it could become law  it calls for immediate expensing  for at least five years  at  an unprecedented level  and urges congress to work out the details  with a focus on helping small businesses   that will be something that people have never seen before and it will be truly great   trump said on friday at a national association of manufacturers event where his remarks were applauded by a roomful of business executives  federal tax revenues would be slashed under trump s plan  an estimate of immediate expensing s revenue impact earlier this year was for a loss of    trillion over a  year window  according to the tax foundation  a business focused group that supports making immediate expensing permanent  not temporary  scott hodge  president of the foundation  said permanent expensing is needed if trump wants to meaningfully boost economic growth   the only way to get there is by having permanent immediate expensing for all capital investments  not a short term policy that robs investment from the future   only then do you get the long term increase in investments that boost productivity  wages and gdp   hodge said  louisiana republican senator bill cassidy told reporters on capitol hill on tuesday that  full expensing could be quite effective for economic growth  i m favorably disposed  but i d like to see it in the context of everything else   some tax experts questioned the need for expensing at all      while u s  economic growth has been sluggish  there is little evidence that businesses are short on investment capital   there s no sign that there s a shortage of capital available to business today     so is immediate expensing really necessary   asked ed kleinbard  a law professor at the university of southern california and former chief of staff of the u s  congress s joint committee on taxation  the tax code has not been overhauled since  under former president ronald reagan  trump s plan is largely a set of tax cuts that is less ambitious than reagan s sweeping package  but the plan is politically important to the republicans  after more than eight months in office  trump has no major domestic policy achievement  much is riding on the tax plan  which the business community has eagerly awaited  immediate expensing was put in place under former democratic president barack obama for qualified investments between september  and january   part of his recovery program after the deepest u s  recession in decades  after   immediate expensing was cut to  percent of new investment through   it has been slated to decline in phases to  percent in  and  percent in   trump s plan would bring it back up to  percent through late   investment firm morgan stanley questioned the impact of the immediate expensing proposal in a recent research note    we are not sure that this policy can drive incremental stimulus because the tax code has contained similar incentives since   evidence shows that only  percent of companies elect to use bonus depreciation   the firm said  adding that the likeliest beneficiaries would be in the utilities  telecoms  materials and industrials sectors
