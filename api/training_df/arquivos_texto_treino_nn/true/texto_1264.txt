washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump will strike a blow against the  iran nuclear agreement on friday in defiance of other world powers  choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal in a major reversal of u s  policy  trump s decision will not withdraw the united states from the agreement  which was negotiated by washington and other world powers during the administration of former president barack obama  the move likely gives u s  lawmakers  days to decide whether to bring back sanctions on iran that were lifted under the deal    if congress reimposes the sanctions  the united states would in effect be in violation of the terms of the nuclear deal and it would likely fall apart  if lawmakers do nothing  the deal remains in place  here is a look at where key u s  lawmakers stand on the deal   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  like every republican in congress  mcconnell voted against the iran nuclear agreement  he has not expressed a position on how he will respond to trump s decertification  but has not yet broken from trump on policy matters  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  has not said where he stands   i don t want to get ahead of the president   he said last week  house majority leader kevin mccarthy  has not said what he would do  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  repeatedly spoke out against the agreement and wrote legislation that gave congress some say over it  while he has questioned trump recently on some foreign policy issues   helping spark a twitter feud   corker has followed the administration line on most policy matters  corker said on friday he expected to introduce legislation to  address flaws  in the pact without violating it   house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce  royce says  as flawed as the deal is  i believe we must now enforce the hell out of it   it was not clear how he would respond to the legislation   senate minority leader chuck schumer  opposed the deal two years ago but more recently says it should be left in place but strongly enforced with efforts to clamp down on other activities like iran s ballistic missile program  house minority leader nancy pelosi  supported the original deal  still supports it  senate foreign relations committee top democrat ben cardin  opposed the deal two years ago  but says u s  should honor it now  while strictly enforcing it and clamping down on other iranian activities detrimental to the interests of the united states and its allies  house foreign affairs top democrat elliot engel  opposed the deal two years ago but said killing it now would be a  grave mistake   still an iran hawk on issues such as tehran s ballistic missile program  human rights violations and its support for what washington sees as terrorism
