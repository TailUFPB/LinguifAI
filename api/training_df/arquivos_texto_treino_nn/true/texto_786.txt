 reuters    the national football league said on tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by u s  house of representatives republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction  under the legislation unveiled last week  local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax exempt  public purpose bonds  the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools  libraries and public transit  according to the nfl  building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available   you can look around the country and see the economic development that s generated from some of these stadiums   nfl spokesman joe lockhart told a conference call   these sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country  so we will continue to make our opposition known on that   president donald trump has called for an end to the subsidy  at least for the nfl  after some of its players angered the republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system  his democratic predecessor  barack obama  also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in   a report last year by the brookings institution  the washington based social sciences research group  found that of the  major league stadiums built or overhauled since    were at least partly funded by tax exempt municipal bonds  the nfl s oakland raiders are expected to begin playing in las vegas in  and construction on a new stadium is already underway  lockhart refused to what  if any  impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium   that is a hypothetical at this point and we d have to see how the final bill comes out   he said   what gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law  so we ll have to see where that goes
