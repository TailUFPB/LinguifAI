washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump s son in law and close adviser  jared kushner  had at least three previously undisclosed contacts with the russian ambassador to the united states during and after the  presidential campaign  seven current and former u s  officials told reuters  those contacts included two phone calls between april and november last year  two of the sources said  by early this year  kushner had become a focus of the fbi investigation into whether there was any collusion between the trump campaign and the kremlin  said two other sources   one current and one former law enforcement official   kushner initially had come to the attention of fbi investigators last year as they began scrutinizing former national security adviser michael flynn s connections with russian officials  the two sources said  while the fbi is investigating kushner s contacts with russia  he is not currently a target of that investigation  the current law enforcement official said  the new information about the two calls as well as other details uncovered by reuters shed light on when and why kushner first attracted fbi attention and show that his contacts with russian envoy sergei kislyak were more extensive than the white house has acknowledged   nbc news reported on thursday that kushner was under scrutiny by the fbi  in the first sign that the investigation  which began last july  has reached the president s inner circle    the fbi declined to comment  while the russian embassy said it was policy not to comment on individual diplomatic contacts  the white house did not respond to a request for comment   kushner s attorney  jamie gorelick  said kushner did not remember any calls with kislyak between april and november    mr kushner participated in thousands of calls in this time period  he has no recollection of the calls as described  we have asked  reuters  for the dates of such alleged calls so we may look into it and respond  but we have not received such information   she said  in march  the white house said that kushner and flynn had met kislyak at trump tower in december to establish  a line of communication   kislyak also attended a trump campaign speech in washington in april  that kushner attended  the white house did not acknowledge any other contacts between kushner and russian officials  before the election  kislyak s undisclosed discussions with kushner and flynn focused on fighting terrorism and improving u s  russian economic relations  six of the sources said  former president barack obama imposed sanctions on russia after it seized crimea and started supporting separatists in eastern ukraine in   after the nov   election  kushner and flynn also discussed with kislyak the idea of creating a back channel between trump and russian president vladimir putin that could have bypassed diplomats and intelligence agencies  two of the sources said  reuters was unable to determine how those discussions were conducted or exactly when they took place  reuters was first to report last week that a proposal for a back channel was discussed between flynn and kislyak as trump prepared to take office  the washington post was first to report on friday that kushner participated in that conversation  separately  there were at least  undisclosed calls and emails between trump associates and kremlin linked people in the seven months before the nov   presidential election  including six calls with kislyak  sources told reuters earlier this month    two people familiar with those  contacts said flynn and kushner were among the trump associates who spoke to the ambassador by telephone  reuters previously reported only flynn s involvement in those discussions  six of the sources said there were multiple contacts between kushner and kislyak but declined to give details beyond the two phone calls between april and november and the post election conversation about setting up a back channel  it is also not clear whether kushner engaged with kislyak on his own or with other trump aides   fbi scrutiny of kushner began when intelligence reports of flynn s contacts with russians included mentions of u s  citizens  whose names were redacted because of u s  privacy laws  this prompted investigators to ask u s  intelligence agencies to reveal the names of the americans  the current u s  law enforcement official said  kushner s was one of the names that was revealed  the official said  prompting a closer look at the president s son in law s dealings with kislyak and other russians  fbi investigators are examining whether russians suggested to kushner or other trump aides that relaxing economic sanctions would allow russian banks to offer financing to people with ties to trump  said the current u s  law enforcement official   the head of russian state owned vnesheconombank  sergei nikolaevich gorkov  a trained intelligence officer whom putin appointed  met kushner at trump tower in december  the bank is under u s  sanctions and was implicated in a  espionage case in which one of its new york executives pleaded guilty to spying and was jailed   the bank said in a statement in march that it had met with kushner along with other representatives of u s  banks and business as part of preparing a new corporate strategy  officials familiar with intelligence on contacts between the russians and trump advisers said that so far they have not seen evidence of any wrongdoing or collusion between the trump camp and the kremlin   moreover  they said  nothing found so far indicates that trump authorized  or was even aware of  the contacts  there may not have been anything improper about the contacts  the current law enforcement official stressed  kushner offered in march to be interviewed by the senate intelligence committee  which is also investigating russia s attempts to interfere in last year s election  the contacts between trump campaign associates and russian officials during the presidential campaign coincided with what u s  intelligence agencies concluded was a kremlin effort through computer hacking  fake news and propaganda to boost trump s chances of winning the white house and damage his democratic opponent  hillary clinton
