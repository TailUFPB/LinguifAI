chicago  reuters    target corp  tgt n   wal mart stores inc  wmt n  and other retailers are shelving considerations to move supply bases closer to the united states in the face of a possible border tax  banking instead on killing support for the tax idea in congress  president donald trump s push to impose a tax on imports  such as the  percent levy initiated by house republicans  could raise u s  consumer prices by as much as  percent  industry officials said  last week  the president said he favored an  import tax  that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origin s tax rate for u s  products   the decision by retailers to forestall supply chain investment in countries such as bolivia and romania to focus on lobbying congress shows how trump s ambitious agenda has instilled a new level of risk operating outside u s  borders  but the vagueness around the tax proposals and whether they may ever be implemented means retail industry executives are still not willing to change their operating infrastructure  the retail industry leaders association  which is leading the industry lobbying effort  has conducted  meetings with lawmakers since december  focusing on the costs of a new tax and encouraging lawmakers who oppose the tax  prospects for a quick passage of a tax bill took a hit last month when the republican attempt to overhaul the national healthcare law failed to get a vote in the u s  house of representatives  trump and republican leaders have said they still intend to pass a healthcare reform law first  casting further doubt on when congress may consider tax reform  the border tax proposal likely will be  as messy as the healthcare bill   according to brian dodge  senior executive vice president of public affairs for the retail lobby group  target  for one  thinks the industry s lobbying efforts are succeeding    we are working on educating lawmakers and president trump hasn t embraced it yet  so we definitely think we are making progress   a senior company official at target said on condition of anonymity   there is good reason for retailers to fight the tax idea  rbc capital markets forecast such a levy could reduce profits of six large u s  retailers by as much as   billion in its first year  with wal mart alone seeing its federal tax bill jump to    billion from    billion  for a graphic please click tmsnrt rs  best buy co inc  bby n   which relies heavily on electronics imports  could see its earnings completely wiped out  rbc warned  best buy declined to comment  firms with less exposure to overseas suppliers   ranging from off price chains like tjx cos  tjx n  and ross stores  rost o  to cosmetics seller ulta beauty  ulta o    would feel less impact than heavy importers like wal mart  target and costco wholesale corp  cost o   analysts and consultants said  tjx companies and ulta beauty declined comment  ross stores and costco did not respond to requests seeking comment      steve osburn  director of supply chain for retail consultancy kurt salmon  said it is more cost effective to spend on lobbying than on supply chain relocation at this point  retailers also have other investment needs  especially around winning consumers who want to shop from home   they are putting a lot of money in e commerce initiatives to compete online so there are not a lot of funds to spare   he said  one outlier is luxury handbag maker rebecca minkoff  which sells its own products and supplies other retailers  like nordstrom inc  jwn n  and amazon com inc  amzn o    the prospect of a u s  border tax factored into its recent decision to supply u s  customers from europe as it mitigates logistics costs to supply to the united states  according to uri minkoff  the firm s founder and ceo      the process has intensified in the past six months   said minkoff   the decision to bank more on the lobby effort to kill support for the tax idea comes after retailers spent the last few months considering whether to move some of their production to supply bases like bolivia  brazil and other south american countries with low wage rates  as well as european countries like hungary  bulgaria and the czech republic  industry sources told reuters   a return to the united states was also a consideration  the sources said   shifting production from existing supply bases like china is costly  may involve intellectual property issues and disrupts long term supply contracts  making it hard to plan and execute such moves  two industry sources said  consultants have told retailers they could mitigate shipping costs enough to offset any border tax  while avoiding the cost of moving production into the u s  the sources said   but so far they are not proceeding with major supply chain changes  according to retailers and industry consultants   wal mart is not ready to spend money to deal with this   said a supply chain consultant who works with the retailer but requested anonymity for fear of disrupting the firm s relationship with wal mart      wal mart has reviewed its options with supply chain consultants  but has not yet commissioned a concrete contingency plan  sources with direct knowledge of the matter said         wal mart declined comment  executives at smaller retailers and brands like samsonite  crate and barrel and steve madden said there is little competitive impetus for action because they believe a border tax would hurt them and competitors equally  samsonite was studying reviving its u s  manufacturing base  but is not close to taking action   setting plans  based  on policy proposals that are yet to be implemented is not right   samsonite chief executive officer ramesh tainwala told reuters           minneapolis based target is limiting itself to conducting feasibility studies   we just don t want to get ahead of ourselves and invest capital   the target official said     target declined comment
