washington  reuters    besieged by controversy at home  u s  president donald trump is under pressure to stick to the script and avoid fresh flare ups when he embarks this week on his first foreign trip  a nine day trek to the middle east and europe  white house officials and republicans close to the administration say trump  who campaigned on an  america first  slogan  wants to demonstrate leadership abroad on his visit with arab leaders in saudi arabia  israeli and palestinian leaders in israel and the west bank  the pope at the vatican  nato leaders in brussels and  counterparts in sicily  trump faces fierce criticism over his sharing of sensitive national security information with russian officials and his firing last week of fbi director james comey  allegations that he previously asked comey to end an investigation into his former national security adviser drew a new round of attacks on tuesday  a republican strategist close to the white house said trump needed a strong trip to help put the past tumultuous  days behind him   if the white house is looking for this international trip to turn the page  then it really needs to come off well without any balls dropped or serious mistakes   said the strategist  who requested anonymity   this is their time to shine  to show americans and the world that the white house isn t becoming a circus of errors   airing his frustrations on twitter  trump has lashed out at leaks to the news media from officials inside his administration  confidants say a staff shake up is possible  although major changes are unlikely before trump s foreign trip  his political woes will add to trump s challenges as he tries to bolster ties abroad   this trip combines so many different things and actors that the question is going to be what s the message that he wants to communicate when he s out there   said lanhee chen  who advised republican mitt romney s presidential campaign in  and marco rubio s in   some doubt whether trump  a businessman turned politician who never held elective office before becoming president in january  is ready for a smooth presidential debut abroad  one republican official  who requested anonymity in order to speak freely  said after meeting trump recently he did not think  the president had a firm enough grasp on the nuances of the long running israeli palestinian conflict   i don t think he understands it   said the official  adding that trump needed more detailed briefings before leaving on friday   i think it s a very difficult challenge and i hope he s going to talk to a lot of smart people   white house advisers insisted trump was up to speed on the middle east  having already hosted arab  israeli and palestinian leaders at the white house   his way of doing diplomacy  which really contrasts with president obama s approach  is to     prioritize the personal relationship   said michael singh  a foreign policy adviser to former republican president george w  bush  to prepare for his trip  trump has been meeting with briefers including secretary of state rex tillerson  secretary of defense jim mattis  white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster  deputy national security adviser dina powell and senior adviser and son in law jared kushner  conversations with some officials who have briefed trump and others who are aware of how he absorbs information portray a president with a short attention span  he likes single page memos and visual aids like maps  charts  graphs and photos  national security council officials have strategically included trump s name in  as many paragraphs as we can because he keeps reading if he s mentioned   according to one source  who relayed conversations he had with nsc officials  trump likes to look at a map of the country involved when he learns about a topic   he likes to visualize things   said a senior administration official   the guy s a builder  he has spent his whole life looking at architectural renderings and floor plans   although trump has a string of golf resorts around the world that he has visited  the trip could take him out of his comfort zone  he generally prefers his own bed to hotel rooms  during the  presidential campaign  he often flew home after a day of campaigning rather than staying in hotels overnight  presidential rhetoric and gaffes abroad have caused  problems for some of trump s predecessors  bush drew fire after his first meeting with russian president vladimir putin  in slovenia in june   when he said he had looked the former kgb chief in the eye and  i was able to get a sense of his soul   the comment was seen as naive  even body language is watched carefully  democratic president barack obama was criticized for bowing to japanese emperor akihito in a visit to japan in november   one gulf arab official said trump s decision to make saudi arabia  the birthplace of islam  the first stop on his trip would send a message that america did not see islam as an enemy      the trip could be a chance for the president to counter critics who accuse him of being anti muslim because of the order he issued  now blocked by u s  courts  temporarily banning entry into the united states by citizens of several muslim majority countries      but the official  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said that if trump  who is prone to speaking off the cuff  ended up undercutting his own message  it could be damaging   it can backfire  i mean it can seriously backfire   the official said  ari fleischer  former press secretary to bush  said that since the trip would be trump s first overseas  the stakes were higher   the meaning and importance of his first trip abroad will be exaggerated  but it gives him a chance to get bipartisan accolades  or a chance to fail badly and have the failure exaggerated   fleischer said
