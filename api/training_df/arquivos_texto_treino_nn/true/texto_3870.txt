washington  reuters    eight democratic senators asked u s  regulators on tuesday to launch an investigation into billionaire carl icahn s activities in the u s  biofuels blending credit market  saying the activist investor may have violated trading laws since becoming an adviser to president donald trump   we are writing to request that your agencies investigate whether carl icahn violated insider trading laws  anti market manipulation laws  or any other relevant laws based on his recent actions in the market for renewable fuel credits   the senators said in a letter to the heads of the securities and exchange commission  the commodity futures trading commission and the environmental protection agency  the letter  a copy of which was seen by reuters  was signed by elizabeth warren of massachusetts  sheldon whitehouse of rhode island  sherrod brown of ohio and five others  the agencies are not required to act on it   efforts to reach icahn for comment were not immediately successful  there have been months of public outcry from democratic lawmakers and liberal watchdog groups concerned that icahn s dual role as a high powered investor and presidential adviser could lead to conflicts of interest  trump  a republican  named icahn as an unpaid adviser on regulation shortly after november s election  saying the choice could help him slash red tape and bolster economic growth   in february  icahn submitted a proposal to the white house to change the u s  biofuels program in a way that would ease its regulatory burden on oil refining companies  already struggling with low profit margins  icahn owns a majority stake in refining company cvr energy inc  cvi n   the white house is considering the proposal  an administration official did not immediately respond to a request for comment on tuesday  a reuters review of securities filings last month showed that cvr had accumulated a large short position in biofuels blending credits  called renewable identification numbers  or rins  which many refiners are required to purchase under the biofuels law  that meant the company would have been in a strong position to profit if rin prices fell  in their letter  the senators pointed out that rin prices dropped sharply in late february after icahn s proposal on the biofuels regulation was reported   we have no way of knowing at this time whether mr  icahn made any of his renewable fuel credit trades or decisions about trades based on material  non public information or otherwise manipulated the market   the senators wrote    but the publicly available evidence is troubling  and based on this evidence  we ask that your agencies investigate whether mr  icahn s conduct violated any laws under your jurisdiction   they said  icahn previously dismissed accusations that his proposal to the white house to change the biofuels program was self serving  saying the overhaul would help other refining companies too  including his competitors   cvr energy shares fell   percent to    on tuesday  a cvr spokesman declined to comment  shares in icahn s investment firm  icahn enterprises  iep o   fell   percent to     icahn    has spent decades doing battle with major companies as an activist investor  and has amassed a fortune that forbes magazine pegs above   billion  in recent years  he built up an  percent stake in cvr  making him a player in the niche biofuels market   carl icahn is not shy  and he knows his voice and his actions as special adviser can influence the rin markets   said tyson slocum of public citizen  a liberal watchdog group that has already asked congress to investigate whether icahn had violated any lobbying disclosure laws   the real issue is did carl icahn use his position as special adviser to unduly impact the rin market and then make corresponding bets on those moves   slocum said   cvr energy s refining unit  cvrr n  posted a net gain of    million associated with the biofuel credits market in the first quarter of   a   million turnaround from the year ago period when cvr shelled out    million  the company said in a filing  the u s  renewable fuel standard  overseen by the u s  environmental protection agency  requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be blended into the nation s gasoline and diesel every year  it places that responsibility mainly on refiners  who are required to blend the fuel themselves or purchase credits from others that do it for them  icahn s proposal had called for regulators to shift the responsibility for blending from refiners  many of which lack sufficient blending capacity  to terminal operators   a number of biofuels groups oppose the proposed change  saying it could undermine the renewable fuel standard by making it more complicated  since there are many times more terminal operators than refining companies    moving the point of obligation would require a dramatic increase in the staff required to track this at epa  all while delivering poorer supervision  increasing the complexity of the program  and ultimately higher costs for american drivers   said growth energy chief executive emily skor
