jerusalem  reuters    israeli leaders welcomed the u s  airstrikes in syria  saying they sent a strong message that the trump administration would not accept the use of chemical weapons and was a warning to other hostile states  including iran and north korea  prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel stood fully behind the decision to fire more than  cruise missiles at the airfield from where washington said president bashar al assad s forces launched a deadly chemical attack this week   in both word and action  president trump sent a strong and clear message today that the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated   netanyahu said in a statement    israel     hopes that this message of resolve in the face of the assad regime s horrific actions will resonate not only in damascus  but in tehran  pyongyang and elsewhere   during the six year conflict in syria  israel has largely stayed on the sidelines  carrying out only occasional airstrikes when it feels threatened  including by the movement of weapons to lebanese hezbollah militants on its frontier with syria  israeli officials said the united states had informed them about the airstrikes ahead of time  but it was not clear whether israel provided intelligence or any other form of input to the white house to support carrying out the attack  israeli defence minister avigdor lieberman called the u s  move an  important  necessary and moral message    the american notification to the israeli military and defence establishment before the strike is additional proof of the strength of the deep ties   he said   yaakov amidror  israel s former national security adviser  said the calibrated response by the united states had sent a message that washington was reengaged in the region and that russia did not have free rein in syria    the americans are telling the russians   you are not alone any more  not in syria not in the middle east  and we are ready to take all the steps to be involved  and if you neutralise the u n  security council  we will know how to act without its permission    he said on a conference call with reporters    yet again  military action is an option that will be used when the americans decide that it should be used and  tell hostile states    watch your behaviour and your attitude towards american interests    asked about the risk of retaliation  he said   the chances for an attack initiated by either syria or hezbollah is even less today than before because now it is understood that if they violate the interests of the united states of america     this administration is ready to take action   as for israel stepping up its actions in syria  amidror said it would only engage if either of its two red lines are crossed  if strategic weapons are passed to hezbollah units or if launch sites for attacks are set up in the golan heights  where israeli occupied territory borders syria   we will stay on the sidelines because our strategic decision was not to take part in this war  if there is something specific that we can do militarily or from an intelligence point of view and so on  i m sure that israel would be more than happy to contribute to such efforts
