washington  reuters    dining on rib eye steak and peach cobbler with a group of senators  president donald trump was cautiously optimistic that republican efforts to overhaul obamacare were in good shape   then came word that two republican senators not at the dinner   mike lee of utah and jerry moran of kansas   had announced their opposition to the healthcare proposals put forward by party leaders in the senate  the setback on monday night triggered a last gasp effort by the president and top aides to keep the legislation from dying  he called  republican senators over to the white house for lunch and a scolding on wednesday  telling them they needed to settle their differences and that they should postpone their summer recess until a deal was done   for seven years you promised the american people you would repeal obamacare  people are hurting and frankly inaction is not an option   said trump  who desperately wants a legislative victory to make good on his campaign promises to repeal and replace the affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  it is by no means clear if trump s pressure can help republicans overcome sharp differences between moderates who want to preserve health insurance for their constituents and conservatives insisting on lower costs  but after doing little over the past few weeks to win senators  support for the controversial legislation  trump is now staking his reputation on getting them to cut a deal  senior white house aides said on wednesday the president sensed the healthcare effort could be salvaged despite the grim outlook  after a series of conversations with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell as well as lee  senator john cornyn of texas and others  white house chief of staff reince priebus told trump he felt it was possible to keep the effort alive  trump agreed  based on his own talks with senators  and told aides he was hearing that  a lot of people don t want this to be over   an aide said   senator ted cruz  who has led conservative criticisms of the proposals  was also sounding more positive  so trump dispatched vice president mike pence and priebus to capitol hill on tuesday to see if there was room to maneuver  the aides said  pence and priebus worked the room  talking to nearly every  senator present and urging them not to concede defeat  the two men reported back to trump and he decided to invite the republican senators for lunch  the aides said   at that lunch  beneath the portrait of abraham lincoln in the white house s state dining room  trump made clear he wanted the senators to go back to the drawing board before heading out on vacation in august   any senator who doesn t vote to open debate is really saying they re okay with obamacare   he told the room   we shouldn t leave town until this is complete  until this bill is on my desk and until we all go over to the oval office  i ll sign it and we can celebrate with the american people   some of the senators who have opposed parts of the legislative effort were strategically placed around the room  next to trump was senator dean heller of nevada and lee was next to pence  trump referred to heller with a chuckle   look  he wants to remain a senator  doesn t he    the comment drew a wry smile from heller  after nearly two hours of talks over lunch  the group agreed to meet on wednesday night to start talks on whether the hurdles could be overcome  but cruz said after the meeting that they were still divided on some issues  every democrat in the senate is opposed to the repeal of obamacare  so it can only pass if republicans are united  polls show the proposals are unpopular  so some republican lawmakers fear a backlash  white house aides said they hope an agreement can be worked out by next week
