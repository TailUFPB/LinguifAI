 reuters    president donald trump faces his biggest test as a world leader when he meets chinese president xi jinping thursday and friday for a summit that will set the tone for perhaps the most consequential of u s  foreign relationships  the two leaders are expected to struggle to find common ground on the main issues that divide them when they meet at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  the main agenda items are  north korea is perhaps trump s most pressing national security challenge  pyongyang has been working to develop nuclear tipped ballistic missiles capable of reaching the united states  trump is expected to repeat his call for china to do more to rein in its ally and neighbor and has warned that washington might deal with pyongyang s weapons programs alone if need be  china says it is doing all it can and has said it is up to the united states to de escalate with pyongyang  a white house strategy review focuses on options for pressuring pyongyang economically and militarily  among measures under consideration are  secondary sanctions  against chinese banks and firms that do the most business with pyongyang   a long standing option of pre emptive strikes remains on the table  but the review  de emphasizes direct military action   a senior u s  official said  any military action would likely provoke severe north korean retaliation and massive casualties in south korea and japan and among u s  troops stationed there  trade trade is one of the biggest hot button issues  given trump s charges in his presidential campaign that chinese trade practices were killing u s  jobs and his vow to impose  percent tariffs on chinese imports  the administration has not acted on unilateral tariffs but is targeting a reduction in china s   billion goods trade surplus through tougher enforcement of trade laws and anti dumping and anti subsidy duties      commerce secretary wilbur ross has also demanded  reciprocity  in the u s  china economic relationship  saying that u s  companies do not enjoy the same access to china s vast market as chinese firms get in the united states    china says washington should create better conditions for chinese investment in the united states if it wants to correct the imbalance  neither side wants a trade war  but it may be hard to do much more than lower the temperature in mar a lago  some analysts believe xi may bring a package of job creating chinese investments and the prospect of a more open services sector that trump could tweet as tangible achievements      relations are also clouded by china s expansive claims in the disputed south china sea  where beijing has been building artificial islands and installing military facilities on them  u s  officials see this as part of a long term chinese bid to deny u s  forces access to the strategic sea  a key global trade route  they say washington plans more robust naval operations to challenge chinese claims and assert the right to freedom of navigation  though months have passed since the last one in october under trump s predecessor barack obama  the situation in north korea has appeared to push the south china sea issue onto the back burner for now  but trump is expected to air u s  concerns  trump has repeatedly charged that china manipulates its yuan currency to keep its exports cheap  and he is likely to raise the issue with xi  but trump did not make good on his promises to formally declare china a currency manipulator on the first day of his presidency      while economists believe china pushed down the value of the yuan in the past  china s central bank for much of the past two years has been working to prop up the yuan amid capital outflow pressures  spending more than   trillion in the process      this would make it very hard to justify a manipulator designation under the u s  treasury s current foreign exchange analysis  due one week after xi s visit  the summit would not be happening if trump had not reaffirmed the  one china  policy that has underpinned bilateral relations for decades  trump infuriated beijing when  as president elect  he took a call from taiwan s president and suggested he might not abide by the policy  he backtracked in a call with xi in february  xi may now be looking to head off a big new weapons package to taiwan that u s  officials have told reuters is being crafted   for its part  taiwan will be watching anxiously for any sign that trump is using it as a bargaining chip
