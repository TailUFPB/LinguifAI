washington  reuters    president donald trump will nominate kirstjen nielsen  who as top aide to his white house chief of staff has sought to instill order in trump s team  to lead the u s  department of homeland security  the white house said in a statement on wednesday  if confirmed by the senate  nielsen would take the reins at a sprawling department with more than   employees that is responsible for u s  border and airport security  immigration policy  disaster response  refugee admissions and other matters  nielsen    is a cyber security expert with a considerable resume in homeland security that includes work at the department s transportation security administration and on former republican president george w  bush s white house homeland security council  nielsen was retired marine corps general john kelly s chief of staff when he was secretary of homeland security during the opening months of trump s presidency  kelly brought her to the white house as his deputy when trump named him chief of staff in july to replace reince priebus after only six months on the job  the nomination requires senate confirmation  nielsen s departure from the white house would mark the latest upheaval in trump s white house team  she was responsible for carrying out some of kelly s orders on who gets access to the president  as a result  she has irritated some white house officials who now have limited contact with trump  according to sources familiar with the situation  kelly has sought to bring more order to the chaotic west wing since replacing priebus  trump has welcomed the changes to some extent  although he has privately confided to friends that the limitations on access to the oval office sometimes go too far  putting nielsen into the homeland security post will allow trump and kelly to keep a close eye on the department  but getting her out of the white house could permit some of kelly s strictness to be relaxed  the department has been led by an acting secretary  elaine duke  since kelly took the white house post  cyber security is one of the primary issues under the homeland security department s portfolio  nielsen previously worked at a cyber think tank at george washington university  blocks from the white house  and is considered well versed in some of the more technical missions at the department  such as sharing cyber threat information with the private sector  the department was created after the sept      attacks on the united states exposed cracks in the country s homeland security apparatus  the appointment comes at a busy time for the department  with one of its agencies  the federal emergency management agency  overseeing disaster relief in hurricane hit puerto rico  texas and florida as well as wildfire ravaged areas of california  the department also is responsible for u s  border security  the department is a major player in implementing trump s aggressive stance toward deporting illegal immigrants  as well as vetting the lower number of refugees trump has decided to allow into the united states and devising his travel ban on six muslim majority nations  north korea and certain venezuelans   low drama pick   it seems like a low drama pick  it s a little concerning that she seems to have little background in immigration security and policy  but those individual agencies are in good hands already  and there is a strong core of career managers   said jessica vaughan  director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies  which favors more limits on immigration   nielsen is not known for hard line views on immigration like those of white house adviser stephen miller  if confirmed  nielsen would be the first homeland security secretary to have previously served as a rank and file member of the department  some previous dhs secretaries have been criticized for not possessing enough technical fluency to address cyber threats facing the nation  she also served as a corporate attorney and a congressional staff member  the white house statement said   kirstjen s a policy wonk at heart  especially when it comes to cyber   frank cilluffo  a former senior homeland security official under bush who worked with nielsen at george washington university  nielsen would immediately be given the task of helping coordinate the federal response to potential cyber attacks that target elections  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that russia meddled in the  presidential election to try to help trump win  in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to his democratic opponent  hillary clinton  and through online propaganda  russia has denied meddling in the election and trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and moscow  jeh johnson  who served as former democratic president barack obama s last homeland secretary chief  designated election systems as critical infrastructure  widening the support the department can provide to states  but the department has clashed with several state officials over how best to cooperate to defend future elections  politico first reported the appointment
