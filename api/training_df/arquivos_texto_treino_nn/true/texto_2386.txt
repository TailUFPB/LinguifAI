washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump dictated a statement  later shown to be misleading  in which his son donald trump jr  said a meeting he had with a russian lawyer in june  was not related to his father s presidential campaign  the washington post reported on monday  trump jr  released emails earlier in july that showed he eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton as part of moscow s official support for his father  the new york times was first to report the meeting  the washington post said trump advisers discussed the new disclosure and agreed that trump jr  should issue a truthful account of the episode so that it  couldn t be repudiated later if the full details emerged   the president  who was flying home from germany on july   changed the plan and  personally dictated a statement in which trump jr  said he and the russian lawyer had  primarily discussed a program about the adoption of russian children    the post said  citing unnamed people with knowledge of the deliberations  it said the statement  issued to the new york times as it prepared to publish the story  emphasized that the subject of the meeting was  not a campaign issue at the time   an attorney for trump  jay sekulow  issued a statement in response to the post report   apart from being of no consequence  the characterizations are misinformed  inaccurate  and not pertinent    the white house did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment on the post story  nor did trump jr  s attorney  alan futerfas  u s  investigators are probing whether there was collusion between the kremlin and trump s republican presidential campaign  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that moscow sought to hurt clinton and help trump in the  election  russia denies any interference  and trump has denied collusion with russia the president applauded his son s  transparency  after he released the email exchanges on july    it remains unclear exactly how much the president knew at the time of the flight about trump jr  s meeting   the washington post said  david sklansky  a professor of criminal law at stanford law school  said that if trump  as reported by the post  helped craft a misleading public statement about the meeting  he may have bolstered a potential obstruction of justice case against himself   to build a criminal obstruction of justice case  federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with  corrupt  intent  a misleading public statement could be used as evidence of corrupt intent  sklansky said   lying usually isn t a crime   he said  but  it could be relevant in determining whether something else the president did  like firing  former fbi director james  comey  was done corruptly
