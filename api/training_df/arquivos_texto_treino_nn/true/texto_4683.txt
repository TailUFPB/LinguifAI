new york washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on friday that obamacare was  exploding  after republican lawmakers shelved legislation that would have dismantled the healthcare law   that s not going to happen this month  probably not even this year  the more than  million people who bought  health insurance plans on healthcare gov and other websites the law created are not in danger of losing their healthcare or having their premiums go up right now  experts say  but  is another story  republicans could choose to pass a budget that defunds obamacare s cost sharing subsidies  which help low income people cover out of pocket and other medical costs  but that would be highly unpopular among consumers who would likely blame the president and congress for skyrocketing healthcare costs  experts said    that is one of the ways that is available to monkey wrench the affordable care act   said morgan tilleman  an associate with the law firm foley   lardner  who represents insurers  obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature legislation created by the affordable care act of   has had a tough beginning  the mix of sick and healthy customers has been worse than expected  and premium rates on the individual insurance market went up  percent this year  other parts of the law  like the expansion of medicaid to enhance coverage for the poor  and changes to allow young people to stay on their parents  health plans  have been popular  and the defeat of the bill is a win for the hospitals that have benefited from those increased medicaid dollars  but many counties across the country have only one insurer  after humana inc  aetna inc and unitedhealth group inc pulled out after reporting hundreds of millions of dollars of losses       the insurers who are left  anthem inc and other bluecross blueshield insurers across the country  as well as smaller players like centene corp and molina healthcare inc need to decide in the next few months where to sell insurance and how much to charge   and that is where the market s slow burn takes off  with insurers leaving and premiums rising  jeff jonas  a portfolio manager at gabelli funds who focuses on health care  said that for consumers   looks uncertain  with a  death spiral  of decreasing competition and increasing premium rates ramping up   after the failed republican effort to push through the bill  insurers are looking at changes to help   america s health insurance plans spokeswoman kristine grow said  that includes the market s cost sharing subsidies as well as other government payments for sicker than usual customers and finalizing a rule the trump administration proposed that addresses issues insurers say drives up costs   the trump administration could do some of that itself if it wants to  such as using its regulatory authority to adjust the formula for how it compensates insurers for the sickest people  elizabeth carpenter at healthcare consultancy and research firm avalere health said   but it is unknown if the administration will try to work within the law s existing framework or take actions to undermine it and blame the democrats for its failure   if they fail to act and they don t act in an appropriate way  that will further destabilize the marketplace   dr  mario molina  ceo of molina healthcare  said  molina s enrollment ballooned to  million exchange enrollees this year and the company is weighing if it will submit plans for next year  the administration could also decide to not enforce the individual mandate  which requires that everyone purchase health insurance or pay a fine  it already took steps to erode that provision last month  when it backed off implementing tougher oversight that was due to go into effect for  taxes  experts said the individual mandate still cost less than purchasing insurance  but as it increases each year more young and healthy people would have incentive to join the healthcare market  helping to offset the cost of sicker patients   the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that  million more people would be uninsured under the republican bill next year  with most of the increase coming from the repeal of the penalty associated with the individual mandate  it s unclear what the republicans will do  trump said this bill had been shelved but that republicans would end up with a  great  healthcare bill in the future  but for now that they are moving onto tax reform   until they do that  they will have to work within the  affordable care act  it can also undercut the healthcare law through regulatory authority at the department of health and human services
