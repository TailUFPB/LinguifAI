washington  reuters    in less than three months  president donald trump s nominee to the u s  supreme court  justice neil gorsuch  is already staking out ground on the court s right  adding his voice to the biggest controversies including trump s travel ban targeted at six muslim majority countries  gun control  religious rights and gay rights  in a flurry of activity at the court on monday  gorsuch showed his inclination to rule from a spot occupied by fellow conservative justice clarence thomas  at a minimum  he is so far living up to trump s claim that he would be a conservative in the mold of the man he replaced  justice antonin scalia  who died last year  thomas  appointed by president george h w  bush in   is seen by legal experts as the most conservative of the nine justices and is known for his idiosyncratic views of some legal issues  the court has a   conservative majority  two of the conservative majority  anthony kennedy  and to a lesser extent chief justice john roberts  sometimes side with the liberals  liberal groups and democratic senators had vociferously opposed gorsuch s appointment  with the evidence so far suggesting their depiction of him as a dogged conservative was largely correct   justice gorsuch has shown himself to be the conservative ideologue many predicted he would be and not the moderating check on the executive branch as others suggested he would be   said michele jawando  a lawyer with the liberal center for american progress  conservatives  meanwhile  are delighted  their hope that gorsuch    would be a solid vote on the right  would appear to be well founded   gorsuch is rapidly becoming my favorite justice   said ilya shapiro  a lawyer with the libertarian cato institute  the new justice  formerly an appeals court judge in colorado  was sworn in on april  after democrats made a concerted effort to block his confirmation by the republican controlled u s  senate  gorsuch has not been shy to make his voice heard since day one on the bench when  during three one hour arguments  he sparred with attorneys no fewer than eight times   i m sorry for taking up so much time  i apologize   he said  smiling  after one such lengthy exchange  gorsuch has asserted himself on paper as well  his one opinion for the court  in a case about debt collection  was unanimous  but it s not unusual for new justices to be assigned a first opinion to write where the court is in broad agreement  in the cases where the court has been divided  he has reliably stuck with the conservative wing while showing something of an independent streak similar to thomas  gorusch nailed his colors to the mast in a series of written opinions and votes on monday  in the biggest dispute before the justices  the court handed a partial win to trump by partly reviving his travel ban that he has said is needed for security reasons but opponents criticize as discriminatory  the ban was blocked by lower courts and the high court agreed to hear oral arguments in its next term starting in october  gorsuch  with two of the court s other conservatives  said they would have voted to allow the entire ban to go into effect  when the court also declined to hear what would have been a major gun rights case on whether the constitutional right to keep firearms for self defense extends outside the home  only two of the nine justices dissented  one was thomas  the other was gorsuch  a gay rights case saw a similar pattern  with thomas  gorsuch and fellow conservative samuel alito the only dissenters as the court threw out an arkansas court ruling that allowed the state to refuse to list both same sex spouses on birth certificates  gorsuch has also showed a willingness to quibble with his colleagues on what might seem minor points  in the court s big ruling on monday in a religious rights case  the justices were split   on allowing a church to apply for state funding to re pave its school playground  gorsuch wrote a separate concurring opinion  joined by thomas  in which he explained in part why he agreed with all of the majority opinion  except for one footnote that limited it   it could be that he is more similar to thomas than scalia  if he continues this pattern it might be significant   said ilya somin  a libertarian law professor at george mason university
