shanghai beijing  reuters    chinese state media on saturday cheered the meeting between u s  president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable  the official china daily newspaper said it was encouraging to see the two day summit that ended on friday  going as well as it could  after earlier  confusing signals  from washington about how it was approaching the u s  china relationship  trump had campaigned with strident anti china rhetoric and had angered beijing before taking office by talking to the president of taiwan  the self ruled island beijing claims as its own  but the two sides avoided any diplomatic gaffes at trump s mar a lago resort in florida that would have tarnished the meeting in the eyes of the protocol conscious chinese  china daily said both parties appeared  equally enthusiastic about the constructive relationship they have promised to cultivate    this may sound surreal to those preoccupied with an  inescapable  conflict scenario between what they see as rising and incumbent powers   the newspaper wrote in an editorial    but that beijing and washington have so far managed to do well in preventing conflicts shows confrontation is not inevitable   state run chinese tabloid global times said the meeting  served as an indicator that the china u s  relationship is still very much on course since the trump administration took office in january  and it was likely the two nations would develop a more  pragmatic relationship     it seems that both countries have understood the importance of how essential a smooth transition needs to be and not just for the two countries involved here but really for the entire world over   it said  their comments were echoed by a front page commentary in the overseas edition of the ruling communist party s official people s daily  which said the meeting established the tone for the development of u s  china relations   in a tweet on saturday  trump wrote of the meeting   goodwill and friendship was formed  but only time will tell on trade   the chinese commentaries  however  made no mention of the u s  missile strike on a syrian government air base  which overshadowed the summit  wang dong  associate professor of international studies at china s elite peking university  said the move may have had the added bonus in trump s eyes of sending north korea a message over its nuclear program  but that china was unlikely to be fazed   there are great differences between the syria situation and the korean peninsula situation   wang said  noting north korea s conventional military capability to strike back at south korea in the event of u s  military action   any use of force or pre emptive strikes against north korea will carry huge ramifications  which would probably lead to a drastically different outcome compared to syria   wang said  in the talks  trump pressed xi to do more to curb north korea s nuclear program and the two agreed to a  day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting u s  exports and reducing the gaping u s  trade deficit with beijing  u s  industry had hoped trump would deliver a strong message to xi behind closed doors to end what they see as discriminatory trade policies  but not do anything rash to spark a trade war  in an outcome likely to play well in china  state news agency xinhua said u s  and chinese officials initiated new dialogue mechanisms on economic issues  as well as security and diplomatic issues  in what appeared to be a reimagining of the annual strategic and economic dialogue held under president barack obama  some within u s  industry had suggested those earlier talks yielded little substance  and urged the trump administration to scrap them until beijing displayed more initiative to address complaints about its industrial policies   we would like to see more results oriented outcomes coming out of these new dialogues and fewer laundry lists   said beijing based jacob parker  vice president of china operations at the u s  china business council  although he added that he saw the meeting as  generally positive  on commercial issues
