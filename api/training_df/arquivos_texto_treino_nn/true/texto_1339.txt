washington  reuters    a public feud between president donald trump and influential fellow republican bob corker could narrow the path for a tax overhaul in the u s  senate  where a republican go it alone effort is already showing signs of disunity   days after the republican controlled congress took important steps toward advancing tax legislation  trump s twitter attacks on senator corker over the weekend threatened to further alienate the president from other key republicans such as senator john mccain  whose  no  vote was pivotal in the party s failure to repeal obamacare in july  although a foreign policy specialist  corker is also a key player in the tax debate   he helped the senate move closer to legislation by agreeing to a budget resolution that would allow tax reforms to reduce government revenue by up to    trillion over a decade  but he wants savings elsewhere and has vowed not to vote for a tax package that adds to the federal deficit   republicans hope corker will ultimately vote for tax reform in hopes of boosting economic growth  but trump s tweets do not help  especially now that corker has decided against seeking re election next year and is free to vote whichever way he wants without having to face voters again   republicans are desperate to push through tax reform  seeing it as their last good chance to get a major legislative victory in the first year since  that the party has controlled the white house and both chambers of congress   trump and top republican lawmakers have unveiled a plan to slash taxes for businesses and individuals  the first comprehensive overhaul of the u s  tax code since   they hope to get it done by january  the tax push has been dogged by delays and distractions such as trump s criticisms of his own party s leaders  including senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and house of representatives speaker paul ryan  the latest incident erupted on sunday when trump lashed out at corker in a series of derisive tweets saying the lawmaker had  begged  him for his endorsement ahead of the midterm election next year and announced his retirement after being turned down  corker replied by describing the white house as an adult day care center  and told the new york times that trump risks setting the country on the path to  world war three   the spat complicates things for republicans as they try to move tax legislation through the senate  which they control by  a slim   margin  most democrats oppose the plan  and republicans cannot pass it if they lose support from more than two lawmakers of their own party    this is a delicate balance   said stephen moore  a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation who helped write trump s campaign tax plan   it all comes down to whether you can get  votes in the senate  right now  by my count  they re at about   a few votes short    divisions have emerged over proposals to repeal the federal inheritance tax and a popular deduction for state and local taxes  senate republican rand paul has expressed unhappiness over reports that trump s tax plan could raise taxes on some middle class americans     republicans need to keep corker on board and prevent him from becoming a maverick like mccain  known for his sharply independent streak     bob corker  at this point  is as free as john mccain is to do what he thinks is right   said william galston  who was a domestic policy adviser to former president bill clinton   ron bonjean  a republican strategist with close ties to congress and the white house  said he thinks most republican senators will get in line despite their concerns over trump s treatment of their colleagues    while it may really bother other senate republicans and it s unnerving that one of their own is being attacked  most aren t retiring and know they must still work with the white house or answer to frustrated voters   bonjean said
