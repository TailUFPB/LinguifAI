washington  reuters    u s  senators unveiled two opposing visions of a healthcare  system in the united states on wednesday   leading liberals advocating government insurance for all and several republicans proposing an eleventh hour repeal of obamacare to replace it with programs run by the states  neither plan was thought likely to succeed in a congress exhausted with fighting over the issue  raising questions over whether lawmakers would instead prop up the health benefits offered under former president barack obama s healthcare law  independent senator bernie sanders  a  democratic party presidential candidate  held a campaign style gathering at which enthusiasts applauded as he proposed extending the federal medicare health insurance program for seniors to include everyone   the american people want to know what we are going to do to fix a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us twice as much per person as any other country and yet leaves  million people uninsured  and even more underinsured   sanders declared  senator elizabeth warren  one of  democratic co sponsors for sanders  proposal  told the gathering it was time to go a step beyond obamacare  the  law officially called the affordable care act that expanded health coverage to  million americans    we will say that in this country everyone gets a basic right to healthcare   warren said  but in an office building nearby  republican senators announced they were offering a  last chance  to repeal obamacare  before a parliamentary procedure allowing them to pass it with a simple majority  instead of a three fifths majority like most senate legislation  expires at the end of september  they proposed replacing the law with a program that would give states money in the form of block grants to run their own healthcare programs  senator lindsey graham of south carolina  one of the plan s authors  said he was not ready to give up the long held republican goal of repealing obamacare despite a stunning failure to muster enough votes within the party this summer to kill the law   the idea that the republican party has done its best to repeal and replace obamacare is a joke   said graham  who was joined by fellow republican bill cassidy in the effort  a system of u s  government run healthcare for all is anathema to many republicans  who think the hybrid obamacare system in which government subsidizes private health insurance already was a step too far  republicans  last attempt in july to overturn obamacare fell one vote short in the senate in a humiliating defeat for president donald trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  in addition to the sanders and graham cassidy proposals  a bipartisan effort is under way in the senate health committee to repair obamacare without repealing it  by protecting subsidies that are paid to insurance companies to help offset discounts under the program  mcconnell this week declined to comment on either the cassidy graham bill or the bipartisan health committee effort  saying the way forward was not clear  the republican leader is not expected to bring sanders  proposal to the senate floor for a vote   trump applauded graham and cassidy  saying he hoped the senators  have found a way to address the obamacare crisis   trump has frequently complained that obamacare is in crisis  democrats dispute this but many admit there is room for improvement  a greater than expected mixture of sick and healthy customers hampered obamacare from the start  leading to large premium increases and many counties have just one insurer
