washington  reuters    president donald trump proposed on wednesday the biggest u s  tax overhaul in three decades  calling for tax cuts for most americans  but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit  the proposal drew a swift  skeptical response from senator bob corker  a leading republican  fiscal hawk   who vowed not to vote for any federal tax package financed with borrowed money   what i can tell you is that i m not about to vote for any bill that increases our deficit  period   corker  who said on tuesday he would not seek re election in   told reporters  trump said his tax plan was aimed at helping working people  creating jobs and making the tax code simpler and fairer  but it faces an uphill battle in the u s  congress with trump s own republican party divided over it and democrats hostile  the plan would lower corporate and small business income tax rates  reduce the top income tax rate for high earning american individuals and scrap some popular tax breaks  including one that benefits people in high tax states dominated by democrats  forged during months of talks among trump s aides and top congressional republicans  the plan contained few details on how to pay for the tax cuts without expanding the budget deficit and adding to the nation s   trillion national debt  the plan still must be turned into legislation  which was not expected until after congress makes progress on the fiscal  budget  perhaps in october  it must then be debated by the republican led congressional tax writing committees  analysts were skeptical that congress could approve a tax bill this year  but that is what republicans hope to achieve so they can enter next year s congressional election campaigns with at least one legislative achievement to show for   financial markets rallied on the plan s unveiling  an event long anticipated by traders betting that stocks would benefit from both faster economic growth and inflation  at an event in indianapolis  trump called the plan the largest tax cut in u s  history   we want tax reform that is pro growth  pro jobs  pro worker  pro family and  yes  tax reform that is pro american   he said  the real estate mogul turned politician  who promised big tax cuts as a candidate  told reporters he personally would not gain financially from the proposal   i think there s very little benefit for people of wealth   said trump  who unlike many of his white house predecessors  has refused to make public his own tax returns  republicans have produced no major legislative successes since trump took office in january  even though they control the white house and both chambers of congress  their top legislative priority  overhauling the u s  healthcare system  collapsed again in the senate on tuesday  a comprehensive rewrite of the u s  tax code has eluded previous presidents and congress for decades  the last one was passed in  under republican president ronald reagan  trump s plan falls short of the sweeping  bipartisan package crafted by reagan and congressional democrats  analysts said  the white house said that  under the proposal  typical middle class families would have less income subject to federal tax  trump said the first    earned by an individual and the first    by a married couple would be tax free  the plan would lower the top individual tax rate  paid by the nation s top earners  to  percent from   percent  it would lower the top corporate income tax rate to  percent from the current  percent  the existing rate is high globally  but many u s  based multinationals pay much less than the headline rate because of abundant loopholes and tax breaks  trump has appealed to democrats to back the plan  although they were not consulted in drafting it  republicans hold a thin   senate majority and may need some democratic support to win passage  but democrats said the plan would expand the federal deficit in order to deliver tax cuts to wealthy americans rather than the middle class families that trump and republicans say they are trying to help    if this framework is all about the middle class  then trump tower is middle class housing   said senator ron wyden  the top democrat on the tax law writing senate finance committee       republican kevin brady  chairman of the tax writing house of representatives ways and means committee  said he expected tax legislation to be passed by the end of this year  the committee for a responsible federal budget  a washington based policy group  estimated on wednesday the plan contained about    trillion of total tax cuts over a decade and would have a net cost of    trillion through   analysts have warned huge tax cuts would balloon the deficit if economic growth projected by republicans to offset the costs fails to materialize amid rising interest rates   pass through  rate the plan would set a new  percent tax rate for  pass through  businesses  which are usually small  private enterprises  such as partnerships and sole proprietorships  they represent about  percent of all u s  businesses  under current law  the profits of those companies  pass through  directly to their owners and are taxed as personal income  often at the top   percent individual income rate  cutting that to  percent could mean big tax savings for small business owners  but also be vulnerable to abuse by other individuals and companies  analysts said  republicans proposed eliminating some tax deductions  they did not target the popular ones for mortgage interest and charitable giving  but called for scrapping the one for state and local tax payments  that could especially hurt people in high tax states like california and new york  in a step to simplify tax returns  the plan would shrink the current seven tax brackets to three   percent   percent and  percent  that would raise the bottom tax rate on low earning americans to  percent from  percent  but analysts said other parts of the plan would still mean a net tax cut
