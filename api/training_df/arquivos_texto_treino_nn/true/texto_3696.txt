washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump  striking a defiant tone on thursday after days of political tumult  denied asking former fbi director james comey to drop a probe into his former national security adviser and decried a  witch hunt  against him   trump s terse denial followed reports by reuters and other media about a memo written by comey alleging that trump made the request to close down the investigation into michael flynn and russia in february  trump fired comey on may    no  no  next question   trump told a news conference in the white house  when asked if he  in any way  shape or form  ever urged comey to end the probe  comey s dismissal last week set off a series of jarring developments that culminated on wednesday in the justice department s appointment of a special counsel to probe possible ties between russia and trump s  presidential campaign  they included media reports that trump discussed sensitive intelligence on the islamic state militant group with russia s foreign minister      in a pair of morning twitter posts and at a later news conference  the republican president described calls by some on the left for his impeachment as  ridiculous  and said he had done nothing to warrant criminal charges   the entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign   but i can always speak for myself   and the russians  zero   he told the news conference  standing alongside colombian president juan manuel santos  in his earlier twitter posts  trump criticized the naming of former fbi director robert mueller as a special counsel by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  an official he himself appointed   with all of the illegal acts that took place in the clinton campaign   obama administration  there was never a special counsel appointed   trump wrote on thursday morning   he did not offer any evidence of such acts in his reference to former democratic president barack obama and former presidential candidate hillary clinton   this is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in american history   trump tweeted  democrats rejected trump s characterization   this is a truth hunt   said democratic senator amy klobuchar  russia has denied u s  intelligence agencies  conclusion that it interfered in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in trump s favor  trump has long bristled at the notion that russia played any role in his november election victory over clinton  trump fired flynn on feb   for misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations last year with russia s ambassador   reuters reported on thursday that flynn and other trump campaign advisers were in contact with russian officials and others with kremlin ties in at least  calls and emails during the last seven months of the presidential race  u s  stocks recovered ground on thursday as upbeat economic data emboldened investors to return to the market  a day after wall street saw the biggest selloff in eight months on worries the political turmoil could undermine trump initiatives such as tax cuts that investors see as favoring economic growth  rosenstein  the no   justice department official  named mueller amid mounting pressure in congress for an independent investigation beyond existing fbi and congressional probes into the russia issue  trump later told news anchors at the white house that mueller s appointment was a  very  very negative thing   adding   i believe it hurts our country terribly  because it shows we re a divided  mixed up  not unified country   rosenstein briefed senators on thursday but made no public comments  one of the attendees  speaking on condition of anonymity  described rosenstein as anxious and nervous and said he drank multiple glasses of water  and spilled one   afterward  republican senator lindsey graham told reporters that  everything he said was that you need to treat this investigation as if it may be a criminal investigation   a self described friend of comey s wrote in a public blog post on thursday that comey had told him that he had rebuffed a trump request for loyalty by promising only honesty   he also told me that trump was perceptibly uncomfortable with this answer   wrote benjamin wittes  a senior fellow at the brookings institution and a critic of trump    and he said that ever since  the president had been trying to be chummy in a fashion that comey felt was designed to absorb him into trump s world   to make him part of the team   democratic senator claire mccaskill said rosenstein told senators that he knew comey would be fired before he wrote his letter accusing him of missteps as fbi director  including his handling of an election year probe into clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state  the white house initially said last week that trump was prompted to fire comey after reading the rosenstein letter  trump later said he had already decided to dismiss him and was thinking of  this russia thing   the new york times reported on thursday that trump called comey weeks after he took office on jan   and asked him when federal authorities were going to say trump was not under investigation  it cited two people briefed on the call    comey told trump he should not contact him directly about fbi investigations but follow procedure and have the white house counsel ask the justice department  which oversees the fbi  the times reported  a key issue mueller may have to tackle is whether trump has committed obstruction of justice  an offense that could be used in any effort in the republican led congress to impeach him and remove him from office   asked about possible obstruction of justice  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan told reporters the special counsel would  follow the facts where ever they may lead  and that  it is premature to prejudge anything at this point
