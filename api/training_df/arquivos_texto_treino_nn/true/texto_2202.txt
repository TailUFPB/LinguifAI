 reuters    at first glance  u s  representative mo brooks seems exactly the kind of candidate president donald trump would love to see win tuesday s republican primary election for alabama s open u s  senate seat  the  year old republican is a freedom caucus member and an immigration hardliner who calls opponent luther strange  lying luther   echoing trump s penchant for bestowing insulting nicknames on his political foes  strange    is the former state attorney general who was appointed to fill the senate seat left vacant after jeff sessions became u s  attorney general   trump would like to drain the swamp  brooks would like to blow it up   said larry powell  a professor of communication at the university of alabama at birmingham   but their goals are the same   yet it was strange  not brooks  who earned a coveted prize last week in a race that could measure trump s influence in a state he carried easily in last year s election  despite recent indications that his support among republicans may be softening   trump took to twitter to offer strange his  complete and total endorsement   the tweet came as something of a surprise  known as  big luther  thanks to his  foot  inch    meter  frame  strange has a close alliance with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who is under fire from trump for failing to push his agenda through congress and refusing to eliminate a filibuster that gives democrats veto power over many key bills  strange agrees the filibuster should remain in place      in a telephone interview  brooks noted that trump followed his endorsement of strange with a barrage of twitter criticisms aimed at mcconnell  which brooks called  extraordinarily baffling    any alabama voter who wants to see president trump s legislative agenda pass the united states senate would be much better served to vote for mo brooks than luther strange   brooks said   president trump s entire legislative agenda is dead so long as the senate s  percent rule requires president trump to get the consent of democrat leader chuck schumer to pass it       both brooks and strange may be losing to the third viable candidate in the nine way race  former alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore    has led in several voter surveys  though polling in the race has been limited  the moore and strange campaigns did not respond to requests for comment  assuming no candidate reaches  percent of the vote  the top two finishers will go head to head in late september  with the winner a heavy favorite against whoever emerges from the democratic primary  for weeks  strange and brooks have lobbed attacks at one another as insufficiently committed to trump  advertisements from supporters of strange highlighted brooks  endorsement of texas senator ted cruz for president last year  as well as criticism brooks made of trump at the time  brooks  a founder of the house of representatives  far right freedom caucus who survived the shooting attack on congress members at a softball practice in june  has fired back by attacking strange for his close ties to senate leadership  strange and brooks have largely ignored moore  though strange backers have run some anti moore ads in recent days   i think both assume that moore is going to make the runoff  and whoever gets to the runoff will likely beat him   powell said      moore made his name in  by refusing a federal court order to remove a ten commandments monument from the state supreme court building and losing his position  after winning another term in   he was suspended in  and later resigned after directing state judges to defy the u s  supreme court and continue to enforce a ban on same sex marriage  the former judge is popular among religious conservatives but had trouble expanding his base in previous campaigns for governor  each contender would likely serve as a reliable republican vote in the senate  with little daylight between their policy positions   all three of these candidates are different intensities of the same flavor   said steven taylor  a political science professor at troy university in alabama
