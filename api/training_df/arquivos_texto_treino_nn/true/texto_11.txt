new york washington  reuters    the new u s  tax code targets high tax states and may be unconstitutional  new york governor andrew cuomo said on thursday  saying that the bill may violate new york residents  rights to due process and equal protection   the sweeping republican tax bill signed into law by u s  president donald trump on friday introduces a cap  of      on deductions of state and local income and property taxes  known as salt  the tax overhaul was the party s first major legislative victory since trump took office in january   the salt provision will hit many taxpayers in states with high incomes  high property values and high taxes  like new york  new jersey and california  those states are generally democratic leaning    i m not even sure what they did is legally constitutional and that s something we re looking at now   cuomo said in an interview with cnn  in an interview with cnbc  cuomo suggested why the bill may be unconstitutional    politics does not trump the law   cuomo said on cnbc   you have the constitution  you have the law  you have due process  you have equal protection  you can t use politics just because the majority controls to override the law   the fifth amendment of the constitution  better known for its protection against self incrimination  also protects individuals from seizure of life  liberty or property without due process and has been interpreted by the supreme court as guaranteeing equal protection by the law   cuomo and california governor jerry brown  both democrats  have previously said they were exploring legal challenges to salt deduction limits   law professors have said legal challenges would likely rest on arguing that the provision interferes with the protection of states  rights under the u s  constitution s  amendment  tax attorneys said cuomo s legal argument against the tax bill could be that it discriminates and places an unjust tax burden on states that heavily voted for democrats in the past   known as  blue states    the de facto effect of this legislation is to discriminate against blue states and particularly from  cuomo s  perspective the state of new york   said joseph callahan  an attorney with the law firm mackay  caswell   callahan in new york   but some tax experts noted the u s  supreme court has interpreted the  amendment to give congress broad latitude to tax as it sees fit  in a frequently cited  decision  the supreme court called tax deductions a  legislative grace  rather than a vested right   i don t understand how they think they have a valid lawsuit here   david gamage  a professor of tax law at indiana university s maurer school of law  told reuters last week  speaking generally about governors in blue states that could challenge the tax bill   cuomo also said on thursday that new york is proposing a restructuring of its tax code  he provided no details   a group of  law professors on dec   published a paper suggesting ways that high tax states could minimize the effects of the salt deduction cap   their suggestions included shifting more of the tax burden onto businesses in the form of higher employer side payroll taxes  since the federal tax bill s cap on salt deductions only applies to individuals and not businesses  states also could raise taxes on pass through entities  which the federal tax bill specifically benefits with a lower rate on a portion of their income  on friday  cuomo said he would allow state residents to make a partial or full pre payment on their property tax bill before jan    allowing taxpapyers to deduct such payments for  before the cap kicks in  prompting a wave of residents to pay early   however  the u s  internal revenue service on wednesday advised homeowners that the pre payment of  property taxes may not be deductible
