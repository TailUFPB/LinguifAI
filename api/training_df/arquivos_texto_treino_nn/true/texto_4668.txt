 reuters    since president donald trump s election  monthly lectures on social justice at the  seat gothic chapel of new york s union theological seminary have been filled to capacity with crowds three times what they usually draw   in january  the  year old upper manhattan graduate school  whose architecture evokes london s westminster abbey  turned away about   people from a lecture on mass incarceration  in the nine years that reverend serene jones has served as its president  she has never seen such crowds   more from reuters more democrats oppose trump s supreme court pick after healthcare flop  white house looks to congress for help on tax reform obamacare exploding  maybe just a slow burn  the election of trump has been a clarion call to progressives in the protestant and catholic churches in america to move out of a place of primarily professing progressive policies to really taking action   she said   although not as powerful as the religious right  which has been credited with helping elect republican presidents and boasts well known leaders such as christian broadcasting network founder pat robertson  the  religious left  is now slowly coming together as a force in u s  politics   this disparate group  traditionally seen as lacking clout  has been propelled into political activism by trump s policies on immigration  healthcare and social welfare  according to clergy members  activists and academics  a key test will be how well it will be able to translate its mobilization into votes in the  midterm congressional elections    it s one of the dirty little secrets of american politics that there has been a religious left all along and it just hasn t done a good job of organizing   said j  patrick hornbeck ii  chairman of the theology department at fordham university  a jesuit school in new york    it has taken a crisis  or perceived crisis  like trump s election to cause folks on the religious left to really own their religion in the public square   hornbeck said   religious progressive activism has been part of american history  religious leaders and their followers played key roles in campaigns to abolish slavery  promote civil rights and end the vietnam war  among others  the latest upwelling of left leaning religious activism has accompanied the dawn of the trump presidency   some in the religious left are inspired by pope francis  the roman catholic leader who has been an outspoken critic of anti immigrant policies and a champion of helping the needy   although support for the religious left is difficult to measure  leaders point to several examples  such as a surge of congregations offering to provide sanctuary to immigrants seeking asylum  churches urging republicans to reconsider repealing the obamacare health law and calls to preserve federal spending on foreign aid   the number of churches volunteering to offer sanctuary to asylum seekers doubled to  in  of the  u s  states after the election  said the elkhart  indiana based church world service  a coalition of christian denominations which helps refugees settle in the united states   and the number of new churches offering help has grown so quickly that the group has lost count    the religious community  the religious left is getting out  hitting the streets  taking action  raising their voices   said reverend noel anderson  its national grassroots coordinator   in one well publicized case  a quaker church in albuquerque  new mexico  on march  took in a honduran woman who has been living illegally in the united states for  years and feared she would be targeted for deportation   leaders of faith in public life  a progressive policy group  were astounded when  clergy members turned out at a january rally at the u s  senate attempting to block confirmation of trump s attorney general nominee  jeff sessions  because of his history of controversial statements on race    i ve never seen hundreds of clergy turning up like that to oppose a cabinet nominee   said reverend jennifer butler  the group s chief executive   the group on wednesday convened a capitol hill rally of hundreds of pastors from as far away as ohio  north carolina and texas to urge congress to ensure that no people lose their health insurance as a result of a vote to repeal obamacare   financial support is also picking up  donations to the christian activist group sojourners have picked up by  percent since trump s election  the group said   but some observers were skeptical that the religious left could equal the religious right politically any time soon    it really took decades of activism for the religious right to become the force that it is today   said peter ubertaccio  chairman of the political science department at stonehill college  a catholic school outside boston   but the power potential of the  religious left  is not negligible  the  moral mondays  movement  launched in  by the north carolina naacp s reverend william barber  is credited with contributing to last year s election defeat of republican governor pat mccrory by democrat roy cooper   the new political climate is also spurring new alliances  with churches  synagogues and mosques speaking out against the recent spike in bias incidents  including threats against mosques and jewish community centers   the sisterhood of salaam shalom  which encourages alliances between jewish and muslim women  has tripled its number of u s  chapters to nearly  since november  said founder sheryl olitzky    this is not about partisanship  but about vulnerable populations who need protection  whether it s the lgbt community  the refugee community  the undocumented community   said rabbi jonah pesner  director of the religious action center of reform judaism  using the acronym for lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender   more than   people have already signed up for the center s annual washington meeting on political activism  about three times as many as normal  pesner said   leaders of the religious right who supported trump say they see him delivering on his promises and welcomed plans to defund planned parenthood  whose healthcare services for women include abortion  through the proposed repeal of obamacare    we have not seen any policy proposals that run counter to our faith   said lance lemmonds  a spokesman for the faith   freedom coalition  a nonprofit group based in duluth  georgia
