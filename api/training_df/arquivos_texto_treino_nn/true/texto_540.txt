washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump has designated white house budget director mick mulvaney acting director of the consumer financial protection bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed  the white house said on friday  the action came hours after richard cordray submitted his formal resignation and named a deputy director as his replacement  setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the regulator s leadership   the president looks forward to seeing director mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the cfpb s dedicated staff  an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities   the white house said in its statement  democratic lawmakers are eager to preserve the regulator for as long as possible while republicans want to put in place new leadership to chart a drastically different course   the six year old bureau has policed consumer financial markets  drafting aggressive rules curbing products like payday loans  while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like wells fargo  but republicans have consistently complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from congress on its operations  and they are eager to take control  mulvaney  who has criticized the bureau in the past  said   i look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission  while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer   the succession plan has never been tested  with cordray as its first and only full time director  cordray had previously announced plans to resign by the end of november  in a statement to staff  he said that leandra english  the cfpb s chief of staff  had been named deputy director and would take over as acting director of the agency upon his exit  however  the white house had already said it planned to name its own interim leadership at the regulator  trump has pushed to ease regulations on businesses  including the financial sector  a stance seemingly at odds with cordray s more aggressive regulatory approach  earlier this month  white house deputy press secretary raj shah said that the administration  will announce an acting director and the president s choice to replace mr cordray at the appropriate time   there are competing theories in washington as to who can name cordray s replacement  democrats point to language in the dodd frank law that created the cfpb  stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves  but others say a separate law governing federal vacancies gives trump power to name someone elsewhere in the administration to that role temporarily  while the white house identifies a full time nominee who would be confirmed by the senate
