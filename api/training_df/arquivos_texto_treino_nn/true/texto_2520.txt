washington  reuters    top republican lawmakers rallied to the defense of jeff sessions on tuesday as allies of the attorney general said president donald trump appeared to be trying to pressure him to quit by repeatedly criticizing him on twitter and in interviews  trump said again he was frustrated that sessions had recused himself from the federal investigation into possible collusion between trump s  presidential campaign and russia and said he would not have appointed him had he known he would do so  he stopped short of saying whether he would fire him  two allies of sessions told reuters that trump s public attacks went beyond a president simply venting his frustration but were part of a deliberate campaign to encourage the attorney general to step down  they said trump was likely reluctant to fire sessions after his sacking of fbi director james comey backfired and led to the appointment of an independent special counsel  robert mueller  whose wide ranging probe into contacts between trump aides and russian officials has cast a deep shadow over trump s presidency    the kremlin says it did not interfere in the election  and trump has denied any collusion  asked about sessions  future  trump said at a news conference on tuesday   time will tell  time will tell   the two allies of sessions said the attorney general  who was the first republican senator to back trump s presidential campaign  has been deeply offended by the public berating from his boss  but his resolve to stay is strong  it is not clear though whether that will be possible in the long term if sessions  relationship with the president irretrievably breaks down   as trump and top white house aides stepped up their attacks on sessions on tuesday  republican lawmakers  stunned by the extraordinary scene of a president lambasting a member of his own cabinet  push backed strongly  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  the top republican in the chamber  said sessions  is doing a fine job and made the right decision to recuse himself from the russia matter   some lawmakers also expressed disquiet with trump s public humiliation of sessions  who has mostly stayed silent on his boss s criticism   mr  president  maybe just try a meeting  this is beneath the office   of any held office   from city councilman to potus   said republican representative adam kinzinger  using the presidential acronym   the top democrat in the senate  chuck schumer  accused trump of trying to  bully his own attorney general out of office   he said if trump fired sessions  democrats would fight any attempt to replace him during the august congressional recess  the split between trump and republicans in congress is the latest test of a strained relationship  lawmakers have expressed frustration that the upheaval in the white house is distracting from their legislative agenda  republicans have little to show for trump s first six months in office   we re getting nothing done   lamented senator john mccain on the senate floor on tuesday  trump said in a tweet on tuesday that sessions had  taken a very weak position  on investigating his former opponent in the  presidential election  democratic nominee hillary clinton  over her use of a private email server  on monday  trump had called his attorney general  beleaguered    sessions recused himself in march from the russia  investigation after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with russia s ambassador in washington  in publicly attacking sessions  trump has torn out yet another page from the washington rulebook   typically a president would convey his displeasure with a cabinet secretary out of the public eye   in an administration where a lot of unexpected things have happened  this may be the most unexpected  this has risen to a level that we have never seen before   said douglas heye  a former top aide to former republican house majority leader eric cantor   right wing backlash  a third sessions  ally said an article published by the right wing website breitbart on tuesday painting trump as  weak  for criticizing a man who is tough on immigration was significant  breitbart s previous chairman  steve bannon  is one of trump s closest white house advisers   that says to trump   if you do this  if you get rid of him right now  you will have to face the wrath of the far right   said the ally  sessions made a name for himself for his hardline views on immigration and criminal justice  he is aligned with groups that lobby for cutting the number of legal immigrants allowed into country each year  as well as programs to ensure that employers aren t able to hire illegal workers  as attorney general  he has vowed to crack down on the violent el salvadorian gang mara salvatrucha  known as ms   and strip justice department funding from so called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities   at a news conference last thursday  sessions said he loved his job and planned to stay in it  as long as that is appropriate   a justice department official said sessions started his day on tuesday with his usual early morning run on the treadmill in the department s gym  soon afterward  he got down to work
