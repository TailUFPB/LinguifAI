kenosha  wis   reuters    president donald trump on tuesday ordered a review of the u s  visa program for bringing high skilled foreign workers into the country  putting technology firms and the outsourcing companies that serve them on notice that possible changes may be ahead  seeking to carry out a campaign pledge to put  america first   trump signed an executive order on the h  visa program  it was vague on many fronts  and did not change existing rules  but one objective  said trump aides  is to modify or replace the current lottery for h  visas with a merit based system that would restrict the visas to highly skilled workers  indian nationals are the largest group of h  recipients annually  such a change could affect companies  such as tata consultancy services ltd  cognizant tech solutions corp and infosys ltd  that connect u s  technology companies with thousands of foreign engineers and programmers  none responded to requests for comment  trump announced the order and made remarks at a visit to the headquarters of snap on inc  a tool maker in wisconsin  in addition to addressing the visas issue  he also ordered a review of government procurement rules favoring american companies to see if they are actually benefiting  especially the u s  steel industry   with this action  we are sending a powerful signal to the world  we re going to defend our workers  protect our jobs and finally put america first   trump said  trump was a businessman before he was elected president last year  and his companies have been criticized for using visa programs to fill positions at trump properties with foreign workers  trump branded products are also made overseas   day benchmark as he nears the  day benchmark of his presidency  trump still has no major legislative achievements  with his attempts to overhaul healthcare and tax law stalled in congress  trump has leaned heavily on executive orders to change policy  it was unclear whether the latest such order would yield immediate results  the h  visas section included no definite timeline  the government procurement section did   we hope the goal of president trump s executive order on the h  program is  mend it  don t end it    said robert atkinson  president of the information technology and innovation foundation  a technology industry group  going to a more merit based h  system could attract more people with advanced science and technology skills  atkinson said in a statement  but he said some ideas could make the system ineffective  such as requiring advertisement of job openings for long periods to prove the unavailability of u s  workers  democrats said trump s order was not strong enough  and too late  after thousands of visas were awarded this month in this year s lottery   for a president who has prided himself on his swift action when it comes to immigration  an interagency review of the program is a guarded and timid approach  it s too little  too late   said u s  senator dick durbin  the no  democrat in the senate  critics of the program say most h  visas are awarded for lower paid jobs at outsourcing firms  many based in india  that takes work away from americans  lowers wages and keeps americans from being trained in tech related fields  they say     right now  widespread abuse in our immigration system is allowing american workers of all backgrounds to be replaced by workers brought in from other countries   trump said  tech companies have been bracing for trump to make changes to the h  program  the visas are intended to go to foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge  such as science  engineering or computer programming  the government uses a lottery to award   visas yearly and randomly distributes another   to graduate student workers  critics say the lottery benefits outsourcing firms that flood the system with mass applications for visas for lower paid information technology workers       right now h  visas are awarded in a totally random lottery and that s wrong  instead  they should be given to the most skilled and highest paid applicants and they should never  ever be used to replace americans   trump said  more than  percent of facebook inc s u s  employees in  used a temporary work visa  according to a reuters analysis of u s  labor department filings  facebook did not respond to requests for comment  infosys  india s no   it services firm  has said previously that it is ramping up work on on site development centers in the united states to train local talent in an effort to address the visa regulation changes under consideration  it warned last week that onerous changes to u s  visa rules could affect its earnings    nasscom  the indian it service industry s main lobbying group  said it backs efforts to root out h  abuses  but said the idea that h  visa holders are cheap labor is inaccurate  indian prime minister narendra modi urged washington in february to be open minded on admitting skilled indian workers
