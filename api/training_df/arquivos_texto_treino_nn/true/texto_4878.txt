washington  reuters    president donald trump s first budget outline  calling for a security heavy realignment of federal spending  drew resistance on thursday from his fellow republicans in the u s  congress as many balked at proposed deep cuts to diplomatic and foreign aid programs  conservatives have plenty to like in the white house plan  with its  percent increase in military spending next year and beefed up funding to help deport more illegal immigrants and build a wall on the border with mexico  it also takes steps to downsize government  a central goal of conservatives  but the gaze into trump s priorities for the next four years proved too savage for many republicans  taste  foreshadowing an intense battle between congress and the white house over spending in coming months  although republicans control both the senate and house of representatives  congress holds the federal purse strings and seldom approves presidents  budget plans  the administration asked congress for a  percent  or    billion  cut in state department funding and other international programs to help pay for a  percent    billion hike in military spending next year   these increases in defense come at the expense of national security   said republican senator lindsey graham  who has not hesitated to take on trump  republican senator marco rubio  who like graham ran unsuccessfully for president in   leveled similar sentiments  as did some prominent republicans in the house of representatives  house speaker paul ryan sidestepped reporters  questions about whether he supported state department cuts  saying the white house blueprint was just the start of the budget process  the budget also drew criticism internationally  the french ambassador to the united nations  francois delattre  warned that cutting funding of global programs could fuel instability  the white house shrugged off concerns about the impact  saying trump was making good on election promises   the president said  specifically  hundreds of times   you covered him    i m going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home  and that s exactly what we re doing with this budget   trump s budget director  mick mulvaney  told reporters  democrats  whose votes would be needed later this year to sign off on the spending bills that implement any budget blueprint given the slim republican hold on the senate  attacked the proposed reductions to the environmental protection agency and programs that benefit the poor  the white house proposal would inflict a  percent  or    billion  cut on the epa  some veteran republicans  including senator rob portman of ohio  a white house budget chief during the administration of president george w  bush  vowed to preserve the epa s great lakes restoration program that trump wants to eliminate  moderate republicans expressed unease with potential cuts to popular domestic programs  lisa murkowski  who chairs the senate energy and natural resources committee  attacked plans to cut or eliminate programs that help the poor pay heating bills  provide aid for localities to deal with wastewater and subsidize air travel in rural areas like her home state of alaska   we need to remember that these programs are not the primary drivers of our debt   murkowski said  in fact  those  discretionary  programs that must be renewed annually by congress  account for about    trillion out of a    trillion federal budget  the biggest portion of the budget   about    trillion   is for  mandatory entitlement  programs that provide social security retirement benefits and medicare and medicaid healthcare for the elderly  poor and disabled  conservatives have been clamoring for years for reforms to those programs to save money  trump vowed  however  to protect them as he campaigned for president last year  trump was silent on those programs in the plan released on thursday  but they will be included in a fuller fiscal blueprint due out in mid may that will project spending and revenues over  years  it is unclear if any reforms for those programs will be part of that budget  other discretionary cuts proposed by trump included community development grants at the housing department and more than  education department programs  funding would disappear for  independent bodies that count on federal money for public broadcasting  the arts and regional programs   throwing billions at defense while ransacking america s investments in jobs  education  clean energy and lifesaving medical research will leave our nation weakened   said house democratic leader nancy pelosi  trump also asked for   billion more for core defense department programs for the current fiscal year  as well as   billion more for combat operations  a detailed copy of that request seen by reuters showed some of the funds would be for procurement of technology such as f  fighter aircraft and drone systems  about    billion of the supplemental request was earmarked for aircraft  missiles and ships  it included thaad missiles  blackhawk helicopters and f  made by lockheed martin corp  lmt n   as well as f a  warplanes and apache helicopters manufactured by boeing co  ba n   also for this fiscal year  trump requested   billion more for the department of homeland security  with some of that money intended for planning and construction of the border wall that he made a major part of his  election campaign  congress will likely consider the supplemental request by april   when regular funding expires for most federal agencies   the budget outline also does not incorporate trump s plan for sparking   trillion in investments to build roads  bridges  airports and other infrastructure projects  the white house has said the infrastructure plan is still to come  the planned defense increases are mainly matched by cuts to other programs so as to not increase the   billion federal deficit  despite the proposed big cuts to the epa and the state department  mulvaney said their  core functions  would be preserved   reflecting trump s repeated election campaign pledge to reduce illegal immigration  the department of homeland security would get a   percent increase  with more money for extra staff needed to catch  detain and deport illegal immigrants  trump wants congress to approve    billion for the border wall in the current fiscal year   enough for pilot projects to determine the best way to build it   and a further    billion in fiscal   mulvaney said  the estimate for the total cost of the wall will be included in the upcoming full budget  trump has repeatedly said that mexico will pay for the  wall  mexico has adamantly said it will not  since trump took office in january  the white house has said funding would be kick started in the united states
