washington  reuters    the u s  house banking chairman said on thursday his attempt to eliminate limits on fees banks can charge retailers for debit card transactions may not survive as he pushes a bill to overhaul financial rules  republican representative jeb hensarling of texas said his provision to kill the fee limits is the most contentious part of his  page financial reform measure  and could eventually be stripped in the final version of his bill  any house bill that reverses the  dodd frank financial reform law will probably face rough sledding in the senate  with significant changes needed before it could become law  merchants favor the limits established in   while bankers oppose them  at stake are billions of dollars in revenue for either industry  and both sides have been waging a lobbying battle  with lawmakers feeling pressure from both sides   i know that we have members frankly on both sides of the aisle who may be a little conflicted on the issue   said hensarling   we are still listening carefully to both sides  so we ll see what happens as we progress through the process   debit card fee limits  part of the dodd frank financial reform law  are frequently referred to as the  durbin amendment   after the primary sponsor  senator dick durbin  democrat of illinois  proponents say the limits are needed checks on the banking industry  which had forced retailers to pay higher fees  but banks and other critics say the limits are improper government policy and have not lowered costs for consumers  hensarling  chairman of the house financial services committee  said he is fundamentally opposed to government price controls on private market operations  and will make the case for scrapping the fee limits  but he acknowledged that members in both parties were divided  and the provision could be stripped when his panel considers amendments to the bill  alternatively  the provision could be removed from the bill before it is voted on by the full house  the banking panel is expected to consider amendments and vote on hensarling s bill tuesday  he said he expects the bill to be considered by the full house  shortly thereafter   the house bill is not expected to become law because it will probably not garner enough support in the senate  where the votes of at least eight democrats would be needed for it to pass  the senate is considering a more modest approach to revisiting existing financial rules
