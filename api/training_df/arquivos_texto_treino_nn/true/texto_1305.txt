tokyo  reuters    japan will propose changes to its safeguard mechanism on frozen u s  beef imports that will shorten review periods and allow importers to voluntarily lower import volumes to prevent tariffs from automatically kicking in  two government sources said on thursday  the proposal will be made at the second round of the u s  japan economic dialogue in washington on oct    but it is uncertain if the u s  side will go along  said the two sources  who have direct knowledge of the matter  if successful  the proposal could help ward off trade friction with the united states  which is renegotiating free trade agreements with other countries to protect jobs and lower its trade deficit  under current measures  japan automatically imposes higher tariffs if quarterly imports of specific beef products from any country rise more than  percent from the previous year  japan hiked tariffs from aug   on imports of frozen beef  popular in beef bowl dishes  from countries including the united states to  percent from   percent  the move followed u s  president donald trump s withdraw from the long planned trans pacific partnership trade deal earlier this year  japan says the tariff hike  set to be in place until next march  is a  safeguard  mechanism to protect domestic farmers  but it has prompted some concern in washington  instead of reviewing import data on a quarterly basis  japan will propose shortening this period to every  days  the sources said  this will make it easier for companies that import beef to adjust volumes and avoid triggering tariffs  the sources said  however  the plan is far from certain to work because frozen u s  beef imports could surge next year in april after the current tariff increase expires  one source said   once the safeguard is triggered  there is a concern that it will repeatedly be triggered in the future   the source said  the first round of the u s  japan economic dialogue  which was held in tokyo in april  ended largely without incident  however  there is some concern among japanese officials that the u s  side could strongly push for trade concession during the second dialogue meeting  japan had a   billion trade surplus with the united states last year  according to the u s  treasury department  which has expressed concern over what it called the  persistence  of the imbalance  japanese officials counter that tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the u s  deficit than in the past  while china s imbalance is much bigger
