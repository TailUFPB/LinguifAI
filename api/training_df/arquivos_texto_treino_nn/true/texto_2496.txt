new york  reuters    president donald trump s announcement on wednesday on banning transgender people from serving in the u s  military unleashed a storm of legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to file suit  trump s surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing former president barack obama s policy would go into effect  nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join  but if the u s  defense department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military  the pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight   legal experts say   there s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military   said jon davidson  legal director for lgbt rights group lambda legal   they are currently serving without a problem  there hasn t been an extraordinary cost  there hasn t been disruption   experts say singling out transgender people would violate their rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the u s  constitution  joshua block at the american civil liberties union said his inbox was flooded with emails about trump s ban  including from service members   i think the most important thing for people to understand is that for the immediate future  nothing can happen to them     trump s tweet is not self executing   said block  a senior staff attorney on lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender  lgbt  issues  under obama  the defense department declared in june  that transgender people could serve openly in the armed forces  the pentagon was considering a second step of allowing openly transgender people to enlist when trump on wednesday issued three tweets saying transgender people would not be allowed to serve any capacity in the military  citing disruptions and medical costs  the pentagon referred all questions to the white house  where press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump made the decision in consultation with his national security team and that the defense department would work with the white house and take the lead on a lawful implementation   sarah warbelow  the human rights campaign s legal director  said trump s declaration amounted to  discrimination on the basis of sex and identity   and was therefore open to legal challenge   the courts do provide quite a bit of deference to the military in determining its own policies   she said   however  that doesn t mean the military is above the law   but the pentagon may have a clearer path to a ban should it merely prevent new transgender recruits from signing up  if the ban applies only to those seeking to enlist  the legal bar would be higher because the military already has wide leeway to exclude classes of people based on medical needs  block said  if trump did want to remove all existing transgender servicemembers from the ranks  it was unclear what legal mechanism he could use to forcibly discharge u s  troops  if transgender people disclosed their identity as a result of the obama policy and that policy is then changed  they would have a legal recourse should they be arbitrarily denied their jobs and benefits  davidson said  even those seeking to enlist might allege the government banned transgender individuals in an arbitrary way and without good reason  but at least one legal expert said a challenge would be difficult to mount because courts typically defer to the government on military matters  eugene fidell  who teaches military law at yale law school  said even if discharged transgender service members asked for military reviews of their cases and won  those decisions could be overturned by the secretaries of the four branches of the military  who are political appointees  it would difficult to convince federal courts to reverse the secretaries  fidell said
