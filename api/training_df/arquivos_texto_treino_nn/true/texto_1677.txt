washington  reuters    a national association of u s  venture capitalists filed suit against the trump administration on tuesday  claiming it illegally delayed a policy that would have allowed foreign entrepreneurs to stay in the united states to build their companies  the suit  filed in washington  d c  district court by the national venture capital association  argues that the trump administration did not go through proper procedures when it delayed the obama administration s  international entrepreneur  rule  which was due to go into effect in july and would have allowed some foreign start up founders to stay in the united states for up to five years in hopes of growing their businesses  instead  in july the trump administration pushed back implementing the new rule to march   and said it was  highly likely  the administration would ultimately rescind the rule  in delaying the program s start date  the department of homeland security did not engage in the standard  notice and comment  period government agencies typically go through when changing regulations  or a delayed effective date  the dhs argued in july that doing so while the agency was likely to abolish the rule would be contrary to the public interest because it would sow confusion and waste resources and mean the immigration agency would have to expend limited resources to implement the rule  the suit claims that the administration s actions violated the administrative procedure act  which requires advance notice of new rules  and asks the court to stop the government from delaying the new rule and instead require it to begin accepting applications from foreign entrepreneurs   the process followed by dhs in deciding to delay the effective date of the rule was the polar opposite of the careful  deliberative process dhs used to formulate the rule itself   the suit argued  a dhs spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the suit  the nvca was joined in the suit by several tech start ups active in the united states but founded by foreign entrepreneurs who wanted to be able to stay in the country and work with their businesses through the entrepreneur rule but are now unable to  the obama administration estimated fewer than   entrepreneurs would be eligible for the program each year  the rule would have applied to start up founders who own a large portion of their companies  to qualify  the companies have to have already received significant investment from american investors or government grants
