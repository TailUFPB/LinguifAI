washington  reuters    u s  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on tuesday said the debate over raising the country s debt ceiling could stretch into september and he sought bipartisan support for the legislation to prevent a government default   we are looking for a way forward  to pass a debt limit increase  sometime in the next month or so   mcconnell said after meeting with treasury secretary steven mnuchin and senate democratic leader chuck schumer  he also told reporters that comprehensive tax legislation will move forward in september  but that he does not expect many senate democrats to support the republican legislation  senate finance committee chairman orrin hatch  whose panel oversees government borrowing  said in a brief hallway interview that he does not expect bipartisan cooperation on the debt legislation   we re not going to get any democrat help  i ll tell you that   hatch said  the government bumped up against its statutory limit on borrowing at just under   trillion in march  since then  mnuchin has had to take  extraordinary  measures to stave off a default until congress agrees to raise the treasury s borrowing capability   to ensure that we have robust economic growth and promote fiscal discipline  the trump administration believes it s important to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible   said white house spokeswoman sarah sanders  while the trump administration had been hoping congress would pass a debt limit bill before embarking on a long summer recess  the house of representatives already has begun its break and mcconnell did not explicitly include the debt limit in a list of legislation to get done before the senate s recess begins in coming days  house conservative republicans have been pushing for a variety of add ons to a debt limit bill  such as deep spending cuts or the sale of government assets  that approach could draw opposition from democrats and some republicans as the government gets closer to a possible default   we don t know where the white house is because they have different factions saying different things   schumer told reporters when asked if the white house had articulated clear goals  conservative republicans in the past have balked at debt limit increases as a wedge for advancing deficit reduction legislation  when congress returns from its summer break in early september  it also will have to pass bills to fund day to day government activities in the fiscal year that starts on oct   and there are some fears that the debt limit could get caught up in those negotiations
