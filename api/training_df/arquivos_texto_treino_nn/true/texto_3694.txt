jerusalem  reuters    u s  presidential trips are an opportunity to project power and burnish statesmanship  but they come with diplomatic dangers and potential pitfalls  too  for donald trump  several of those await in jerusalem and bethlehem next week  a nine day tour taking in saudi arabia  israel  the palestinian territories  the vatican and nato would be a tall order for any president  but for trump  under siege at home over questions about his administration s links to russia and his firing of fbi chief james comey  it is a particularly demanding itinerary  especially for a first overseas venture  during his campaign  trump promised to be israel s  best friend  if elected  and signaled that it was okay for the israeli government to go on building settlements on occupied land since he didn t regard it as an obstacle to peace  since taking office  however  trump has shifted tack  urging prime minister benjamin netanyahu to  hold back  on settlements  and praising palestinian president mahmoud abbas at a white house meeting this month  part of an effort to bring the sides together and launch another attempt at middle east peace  it looks unlikely trump will manage to get netanyahu and abbas to shake hands during his  hour visit to the holy land  and the prospects of him setting a timetable for a resumption of peace talks also look dim  but that doesn t mean other diplomatic traps aren t lying in wait  perhaps the most sensitive is what trump ends up saying   or not saying   about a promise he made during the election campaign to move the u s  embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem  no country in the world has its embassy to israel in jerusalem since the status of the city remains disputed in the eyes of the international community  while israelis call jerusalem their  indivisible capital   palestinians want the capital of any future state in the east of the city  only once jerusalem s final status is agreed via direct negotiations between the israelis and palestinians are foreign countries likely to move their embassies to the city  in the meantime  trump has appointed as his envoy to israel david friedman  a devout jew who insists the embassy must be moved and plans to work out of jerusalem some days of the week  when friedman arrived in israel this week  his first act was to visit jerusalem s western wall  the holiest place where jews are permitted to pray  a symbolic departure from usual protocol  trump intends to visit the western wall too  something past presidents have not done because of the political sensitivities  the wall stands in the old city in the east of jerusalem  which israel captured during the  middle east war  officially  the united nations  the united states and others consider the old city and east jerusalem occupied territory and do not recognize israel s claim to sovereignty over it  as a result  the u s  state department turned down a request for netanyahu to accompany trump and his family when they visit the site on monday  instead  the president will be accompanied by the rabbi of the western wall   this is the most appropriate way to show the proper deference to such a significant holy site   a state department official said  yet in an interview with israel hayom  a pro netanyahu paper  trump said his plans  could still change  and suggested he might ask netanyahu to join him  a last minute move that would please netanyahu but anger the palestinians  on tuesday  trump is scheduled to visit abbas for an hour in bethlehem  the birthplace of jesus  which lies a few kilometers south of jerusalem in the israeli occupied west bank   to get there  the president s convoy will have to pass through israel s high security checkpoint and towering concrete barriers that cut the west bank off from jerusalem  both palestinians and israelis will be on alert to see what language trump uses when he meets abbas  while the president hasn t clearly backed a two state solution   israel and a palestinian state   he is expected to voice support for palestinian  self determination   a phrase that nods in the direction of an independent palestinian state  after negotiating that diplomatic minefield  trump is scheduled to visit yad vashem  israel s holocaust memorial  he has set aside  minutes for the visit  unlike previous presidents who spent an hour or more at the site
