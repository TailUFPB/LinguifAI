 reuters    bank lobbyists who opened the trump era with great expectations for sweeping regulatory reform are privately striking an increasingly dismal tone as hopes for a quick and thorough rewrite of dodd frank legislation dim    lobbyists say they are facing the reality that bank deregulation legislation will have to wait in line behind other bigger priorities such as healthcare reform and taxes   it s so disheartening   said one financial industry representative   i was excited for this year  and i m not anymore    even if congress does look to rewrite the  dodd frank law  it is unlikely to muster enough votes in the senate for the strong across the board overhaul industry leaders had hoped for  roughly a half dozen lobbyists told reuters in recent interviews  banks say that dodd frank  which was conceived in response to the financial crisis  hobbles their growth  among dodd frank measures that banks want to see changed are the law s ban on proprietary trading  heightened oversight for some of the nation s largest institutions  and stricter capital requirements  but they see short term hopes for less stringent oversight by agencies like the federal reserve or the securities and exchange commission stymied by the slow pace of trump appointments for those agencies  the private dejection is in contrast to the upbeat message being delivered to some   bankers gathered in washington this week for visits to congress and speeches from policymakers at an american bankers association  aba  conference  this year poses the biggest opportunity that we have seen in a long time to see some action on much needed regulatory relief   rob nichols  the aba s president and chief executive officer  said at the conference  senate banking committee chairman mike crapo  the idaho republican who will play a key role in any regulatory rewrite  has downplayed immediate expectations  he has emphasized that work in the senate is slow going  crapo announced monday he wanted public input on proposals  underlining the deliberate pace of the panel s work  and the republican chairman of the house of representative financial services committee  jeb hensarling  has yet to move on his prepared dodd frank overhaul  industry advocates say they have hoped sympathetic regulators could take major steps absent congressional action  but the trump administration has lagged in naming people for key roles  such as federal reserve s vice chair for supervision   for instance  a sympathetic federal reserve could relax the  living wills  process applied to large banks to determine how they could be dissolved if necessary  and a friendlier sec could act to roll back rules on industry opposed measures like requiring companies to disclose the pay ratio between their ceo and the average employee  to be sure  there likely will be some action this year to help banks  though it is likely to be much more limited than the trump transition team led bankers to expect when it said one day after the november election that it would  dismantle  dodd frank  there appears to be bipartisan appetite for easing capital formation rules or reducing the regulations that smaller banks and credit unions must comply with  republicans in congress could attack specific parts of dodd frank  such as gaining control over funding of the consumer financial protection bureau   which was created to help guard individuals from fraud in mortgages  student loans and other financial products   through a budget process that would eliminate the need for democratic support  bankers preparing on tuesday to head to capitol hill to make their case heard james ballentine  a lobbyist for the aba  emphasize the need to stay on message with stories about the impact of regulation on their banks  he noted they would be competing with wiretapping allegations  federal bureau of investigation probes  supreme court confirmation hearings  and a massive healthcare push all at once   none of those things should be topics of your conversation when you go to meet with your members of congress   he cautioned the conference crowd
