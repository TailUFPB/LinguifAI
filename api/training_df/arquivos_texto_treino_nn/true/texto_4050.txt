washington  reuters    the trump administration said on wednesday it aimed to push north korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure  and remained open to negotiations to bring that about  the u s  stance  which appeared to signal a willingness to exhaust non military avenues despite repeated warnings that  all options are on the table   came in a statement following an unusual white house hosted briefing for the entire u s  senate followed by a briefing to the house of representatives  graphic   carl vinson strike group  tmsnrt rs  graphic   north korea s nuclear program  tmsnrt rs  the statement from secretary of state rex tillerson  defense secretary jim mattis and director of national intelligence dan coats described north korea as  an urgent national security threat and top foreign policy priority   north korea s growing nuclear and missile threat is perhaps the most serious security challenge confronting president donald trump  who has vowed to prevent north korea from being able to hit the united states with a nuclear missile   a capability experts say pyongyang could have some time after    the president s approach aims to pressure north korea into dismantling its nuclear  ballistic missile  and proliferation programs by tightening economic sanctions and pursuing diplomatic measures with our allies and regional partners   the statement said   the united states seeks stability and the peaceful denuclearization of the korean peninsula  we remain open to negotiations towards that goal  however  we remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies   u s  lawmakers have been seeking a clear white house strategy following repeated north korean missile tests and fears it could conduct a sixth nuclear bomb test  but some lawmakers on both sides went away dissatisfied   while the administration has said military strikes remain an option  officials have stressed tougher sanctions as the key strategy given the risks of massive north korean retaliation   essentially representing a continuation of the policy of former president barack obama s administration  which failed to slow pyongyang s weapons programs  democratic senator christopher coons told reporters after the white house briefing that military options were discussed   it was a sobering briefing in which it was clear just how much thought and planning was going into preparing military options  if called for  and a diplomatic strategy that strikes me as clear eyed and well proportioned   coons said  tillerson will chair a ministerial meeting of the u n  security council on friday that is expected to discuss tougher sanctions  which u s  officials say could include an oil embargo  banning north korea s airline  intercepting cargo ships and punishing chinese and other foreign banks doing business with pyongyang  u s  state department spokesman mark toner said another means of diplomatic pressure would be for nations to close north korean missions and to ostracize north korea in international organizations  china objects to north korea s weapons development and has called for a return to international negotiations  but u s  officials have said washington sees no value in talks until pyongyang shows it is serious about denuclearization  earlier on wednesday  north korea s foreign ministry called u s  attempts to make pyongyang give up its nuclear weapons through military threats and sanctions  a wild dream  and like  sweeping the sea with a broom   the administration is hoping for greater chinese cooperation after a summit between president xi jinping and trump last month  and a senior white house official said beijing now appeared to acknowledge north korea as a threat to china too   you have seen some early indications of china doing a better job enforcing existing u n  sanctions on north korea   the official said  adding there had also been a clear effort to communicate to north korea in the chinese press  that its nuclear tests  missile tests  the existence of these programs can t be tolerated   china has been angered  however  by u s  deployment of  the terminal high altitude area defense  or thaad  missile defense system in south korea  complaining that its radar can see deep into china and undermines its security  the top u s  commander in the pacific  admiral harry harris  told congress on wednesday the system would be operational  in coming days  and suggested beijing should focus on influencing north korea rather than worrying about a purely defensive system  the front runner in south korea s may  presidential election has called for a delay in thaad deployment  saying the new seoul administration should make a decision after gathering public opinion and more talks with washington  harris said he believed pyongyang s threats needed to be taken seriously and that the united states may also need to strengthen missile defenses in hawaii  he said these were sufficient for now but could one day be overwhelmed  and suggested studying stationing new radar there as well as interceptors to knock out any incoming north korean missiles   i don t share your confidence that north korea is not going to attack either south korea  or japan  or the united states     once they have the capability   harris told one lawmaker  u s  officials have warned that a conflict with north korea could have a devastating effect on ally south korea and u s  troops based there  a point pyongyang underscored by a big live fire exercise on tuesday to mark the foundation of its military harris conceded that north korean retaliation to any u s  strikes could cause many casualties  but added that there was the risk  of a lot more koreans and japanese and americans dying if north korea achieves its nuclear aims and does what  north korean leader kim jong un  has said it s going to do   north korea has vowed to strike the united states and its asian allies at the first sign of any attack on its territory  in a show of force  the united states is sending the uss carl vinson aircraft carrier group to waters off the korean peninsula  where it will join the uss michigan  a nuclear submarine that docked in south korea on tuesday  south korea s navy has said it will hold drills with the u s  strike group  harris said the carrier was in the philippine sea  within two hours  striking distance of north korea if need be
