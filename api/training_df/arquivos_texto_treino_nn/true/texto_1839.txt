washington  reuters    treasury secretary steven mnuchin and house of representatives speaker paul ryan expressed confidence on thursday that congress will pass an overhaul of the u s  tax code by the end of this year  a major but elusive goal for president donald trump and his fellow republicans   we want america to wake up on new year s day  with a new tax system   ryan said  adding that his goal was to have a u s  corporate tax rate at or below   percent  down from the current  percent   i think it s still very viable to get it done this year   mnuchin said  calling the tax overhaul his and trump s top priority   we don t need to set a specific date  we re going to get this done as quickly as we can   mnuchin and ryan made their predictions a day after trump reached a deal with democrats to avert an unprecedented default on u s  government debt  keep the government funded at the outset of the fiscal year beginning oct   and provide aid to victims of hurricane harvey  mnuchin later met with ryan  white house economic adviser gary cohn  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell and the republican chairmen of the two congressional committees that are crafting tax legislation  the group of tax policymakers are known as the  big six    the major blueprint has been outlined  it s going to go to the committees   mnuchin told fox business ahead of the meeting   but there were no tangible signs of progress    i think you re going to see something very soon   cohn told reporters as he left the session   we had a very good meeting today  we continue to work together  we continue to work well   a key republican goal is to slash the corporate income tax rate  which trump and congressional republican leaders contend will make u s  companies more competitive  create jobs and raise wages  but the president and congress appear to be at odds over rates  and independent analysts say lawmakers may not be able to deliver a corporate rate low enough to be meaningful for companies without expanding the federal deficit  trump has said he wants to lower the u s  corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  ryan  in an interview with the new york times  indicated that a figure that low was unrealistic   the numbers are hard to make that work   ryan said   he obviously wants to push this as low as possible  i completely support doing that  but at the end of the day we ve got to make these numbers work    our goal is to be at or below the industrialized world average   and that s    percent   so our goal is to get in the mid  to low   and we think that s an achievable goal   he added  the white house hopes wednesday s deal clears the decks for congress to tackle the tax overhaul  a top trump campaign promise  even though republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress  trump has yet to win passage of any major legislation  with democrats typically united against him  his administration previously has offered rosy predictions about the timing of a tax overhaul that have not come to pass  mnuchin in february said the administration was committed to getting the tax overhaul through congress by august  mnuchin  ryan and the rest of the  big six  have been negotiating a tax plan behind closed doors for months  excluding democrats and producing only a few pages of basic principles   trump on tuesday urged congressional leaders to make a big push on taxes with cuts for individuals and companies and tax breaks for businesses to bring back profits from overseas   republicans are still divided on significant issues such as whether tax cuts should be offset with spending cuts to avoid increasing the federal budget deficit and how much to lower the corporate income tax rate  in an interview with fox business network  mnuchin said he was not worried about the plan going off track because of either democrats or conservative republicans making their own demands  many democrats have voiced opposition to a tax plan that primarily benefits the wealthiest americans and corporations  asked whether he was concerned that democrats could use the funding deal struck on wednesday to make demands such as rejecting any tax cut for the wealthy or pushing for a cut for middle income earners  mnuchin said no  he also said he expected some democrats to back the final tax plan  on wednesday  trump said he would offer more details about his tax reform plan in about two weeks
