 reuters    former fbi director james comey on thursday accused the trump administration of defaming him  but declined to offer his opinion on whether president donald trump sought to obstruct justice by asking him to drop an investigation into the former national security advisor  the hearing could have significant repercussions for trump s presidency as special counsel robert mueller and several congressional committees investigate alleged russian efforts to influence the  presidential election and whether trump s campaign colluded with this    comey said trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a great job    comey said administration chose to defame him and fbi by saying organization was in disarray  comey said  those were lies  plain and simple      comey said he has no doubt russia interfered with u s  election  comey says he is confident no votes cast in  election were altered   comey says it is not for him to say whether trump tried to obstruct justice in their conversations   comey says found conversations with trump very disturbing   comey says trump did not ask him to stop russia investigation   comey says fbi became aware of russia cyber intrusion in late summer of  scott wren  senior global equity strategist  wells fargo investment institute  st  louis  missouri   from the statement released yesterday  just from the headlines  it sounded like it was pretty benign  so the action in the market  not just so far today  but in general over the last couple of months is the market certainly doesn t think there s going to be much that comes out of this  and i think largely that s because if there was something that s going to come out  as leaky as things seem to be  we would have heard something more than what we ve been hearing so far   so i think the market thinks that s the likely outcome   john canavan  market strategist  stone   mccarthy research associates  princeton  new jersey  he didn t offer that much that was new  he confirmed all the previously reported concerns  concerns about the interactions  between comey and trump  remain  there was a very muted market response    it leaves us where we were before  it becomes that much more difficult for the trump administration to put together a fiscal stimulus package  anything they could put together with tax reform and infrastructure spending would be a lot smaller than had been expected  you are also pushing back the timing on any fiscal stimulus into   possibly in     a lot of the initial euphoria for strong fiscal stimulus has already been unwound  primarily in the bond market  even without fiscal stimulus  the economy would be able to maintain its current momentum  we are looking for steady growth next year  in our view  this would allow the fed to raise next week and likely one more time this year either in september or in december    dan scavino jr   white house director of social media  on verified twitter account  sorry dems  nothing here  no votes were altered by russians in the  election  potus or team never asked to stop election investigation   art hogan  chief market strategist at wunderlich securities in new york  to the extent it doesn t seem to be a  gottcha  moment here  the market s plodding along    unless something comes out that s outside the realm of the expected  that s what we should expect  i wouldn t say the market s taking action either way here    the market looked at this as one of three major events today  along with this you ve got the ecb and the uk election  it s a pretty catalyst filled day    it feels like comey is pretty good at staying in the middle of the fairway in his responses    if they haven t been able to tease anything out of him in the first two hours they re probably not going to get more  i think the market is looking at this as a non market moving event much like the ecb meeting was    thomas simons  money market economist  jeffries   co   new york   the testimony  doesn t appear to be super substantive  my read on the prepared remarks yesterday was that there was nothing particularly stirring there    i think the market is taking less of an alarmist review of this situation because there is no smoking gun here that there has been any illegal activity by high ranking officials  so it s not particularly impactful for thinking about the impact for trump s economic agenda to go through or anything like that    jon adams  senior investment strategist and portfolio manager at bmo global asset management in chicago   we would need to see more evidence as far as explicit direction from the president for there to be a more significant market reaction  we ve been worried about complacency in the market around political risk as investors have become immune to the daily noise out of washington  we ask  does this impact economic growth or earnings growth    and so far the answer is no to both of those questions    omer esiner  chief market analyst at commonwealth foreign exchange in washington   so far we haven t had any major surprises or any kind of bombshells released  the dollar yen ran up a little bit as the testimony got underway  suggesting a little bit of a relief on the fact that we are not likely to get a smoking gun from james comey that we did not already know   we are not likely to get any new revelation that suggests that the president s behavior was anything other than  maybe inappropriate and certainly likely fell short of the bar for obstruction of justice   outside of a little bit of a move higher in dollar yen  there s really not much that is going on     stephen massocca  senior vice president at wedbush securities in san francisco   it s the james comey show  nobody cares  none of this is going to matter  the republicans are going to say there is nothing to see here  move along  there is no  there   there  in my opinion  which is why stocks aren t reacting     at best what we have here is a president who has zero political experience probably said something he shouldn t have said  i don t see it becoming a bigger issue    i don t think this is going to move any needle in any direction  it s not significant enough that the republicans are going to bail on trump and the democrats are going to make a lot of noise about it  but at the end of the day people care about unemployment  job growth and more important issues than this  in my opinion   bucky hellwig  senior vice president at bb t wealth management in birmingham  alabama  the hearings should be mostly a non event for stocks unless there is some kind of unforeseen  smoking gun  either way   detrimental to the president or beneficial to him    because the president did not invoke executive privilege  it raises the likelihood that nothing happens during the hearings  i e   there is nothing secret or detrimental to keep out of the hearings    separately  it looks like the market is looking for excuses to go higher as it dances around all time highs   earnings are rising  rates are falling  supporting higher pes   and the technical indicators show the market in an uptrend  so if the hearings maintain the status quo  it could move money off the sidelines into stocks   tom di galoma  managing director  seaport global holdings  new york   at the end of the day  former fbi director comey hasn t really revealed anything new  in my view  so bond prices are either treading water to heading lower   donald trump jr   son of u s  president donald trump on verified twitter account  hoping and telling are two very different things  you would think that a guy like comey would know that   givemeabreak  faiza patel  co director  liberty   national security program at the brennan center for justice in new york city  comey s notes will be very useful for mueller  they are detailed  close in time notes so will carry weight  even potentially legal weight  they were made before comey was fired and so he had no grudge against trump when he wrote them   alan dershowitz  professor emeritus harvard law school  cambridge  ma   nothing i ve heard so far changes my view that the president did not obstruct justice   laura donohue  georgetown university law center  professor of law  washington d c   if the president directed comey to drop the investigation  with an improper purpose  then it is a violation of the law    tim kaine  democratic us  senator from virginia  on verified twitter account  trump and his team brought their own cloud in with them  it s not the investigation that s the cloud  it s their own actions    comeyday  terry sandven  chief equity strategist at u s  bank wealth management in minneapolis   today is about washington and the drama surrounding former fbi director james comey s testimony and the talk about the demise of president trump s presidency or growth agenda seems premature  short of a smoking gun   i think after today s testimony  focus will quickly shift back to his pro growth agenda  mainly less regulation  tax reform  healthcare reform and infrastructure spending   but clearly all eyes are on washington and i expect equities to generally trend sideways today short of any new revelations coming out of the testimony   stocks  stocks were little changed as comey s testimony kicked off  trading slightly lower to flat  then moved slightly ahead    bonds  u s  treasury prices were lower ahead of comey s testimony and pared losses as he testified   forex  the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies and then pared gains slightly as comey s testimony began
