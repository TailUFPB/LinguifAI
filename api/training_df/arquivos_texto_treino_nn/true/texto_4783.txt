washington  reuters    u s  labor secretary nominee r  alexander acosta told a senate committee on wednesday he would abide by president donald trump s directive to review a pending  fiduciary rule  for retirement investment advisers  indicating he believed it goes too far  acosta told the senate committee on health  education  labor and pensions that the fiduciary rule  slated to take effect on april  but which the department has proposed delaying  goes  far beyond  regulating the conduct of investment advisers  the trump administration directed the department last month to review whether the obama era rule  which requires brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients  interest first  was burdensome and out of step with current white house policies  acosta likewise expressed reservations about another obama administration rule issued last year that more than doubled the salary ceiling under which employees would be eligible for overtime pay  from    to    a year  acosta said he had  serious questions as to whether the secretary of labor had the power to enact this in the first place   a federal judge in november blocked the rule  which extended mandatory overtime pay to more than  million salaried workers  the trump administration must decide whether to defend the rule  and acosta s statements indicated that  if confirmed  he may decline to do so  however  acosta told senators he was sensitive to the fact that overtime rules have not been updated in more than a decade  during the three hour hearing  acosta said that while he felt both republicans and democrats had the shared goal of protecting the interests of u s  workers  they may disagree about the best courses of action  ultimately  acosta told the panel  cabinet secretaries are selected by trump and tasked with deploying his administration s vision   we work for the president  he is our boss  and so all cabinet officials     will ultimately follow his direction unless we feel that we can t and if we can t  we resign   acosta said  acosta  a former member of the national labor relations board and dean of the florida international university college of law in miami  was nominated to be labor secretary in february  one day after trump s original choice  andrew puzder  withdrew   acosta has had a decades long career in public service and has been through multiple senate vettings for previous appointments  making it is unlikely his nomination will be derailed  if he clears the panel  acosta will come up for a confirmation vote before the full senate
