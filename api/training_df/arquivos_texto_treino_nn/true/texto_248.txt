washington  reuters    u s  democratic senator al franken announced his resignation on thursday after facing a series of sexual misconduct allegations  and republican representative trent franks also said he was stepping down as he too was hit with ethics charges   franken  buffeted for weeks by sexual harassment charges and under pressure from party colleagues  said on the senate floor he would leave in a few weeks  although he denied some of the allegations against him and questioned others  the  year old former comedian from minnesota had been seen as a rising star in the democratic party   i know in my heart that nothing i ve done as a senator   nothing   has brought dishonor on this institution   he said   nevertheless  today i am announcing that in the coming weeks  i will be resigning as a member of the united states senate   hours later  franks announced his resignation after two former staff members complained about discussions he had with them about his efforts to find a surrogate mother   i deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress   said franks  who was first elected to his arizona congressional seat in  and is an outspoken opponent of abortion   franks said in a statement that he and his wife  have long struggled with infertility   the developments came with congress already held in low regard by voters  according to a reuters ipsos poll  only  percent approved of the way congress was handling its job  with  percent disapproving  in recent weeks  charges of sexual misconduct have taken down prominent people in the worlds of entertainment  media and politics  it is somewhat rare for members of the senate or house of representatives to resign from office  but veteran democratic representative john conyers also resigned earlier this week amid sexual harassment accusations that he has denied  the house ethics committee said on thursday it was investigating yet another lawmaker  blake farenthold  a republican representative from texas  faces allegations of sexual harassment  discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member  franken has the highest profile of the lawmakers hit by allegations in the past few weeks   reuters has not independently verified the accusations against franken  franks  conyers or farenthold  franken s seat will initially be filled by a democrat appointed by minnesota s democratic governor  meaning the  republicans  slim majority in the senate will not change  allegations that franken had groped and tried to kiss women without their consent began to surface three weeks ago  he initially said he was embarrassed and ashamed by his behavior but would not resign   but the majority of his democratic colleagues in the senate called on wednesday for his resignation after a new allegation  denied by franken  hit the news    some of the allegations against me are simply not true  others i remember very differently   franken said on thursday   striking a tone of defiance  he also sought to contrast himself with two prominent republicans   president donald trump and senate candidate roy moore   i  of all people  am aware that there is some irony in the fact that i am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the oval office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the senate  with the full support of his party   he said  trump was heard bragging about kissing and forcibly touching women in a  videotape that surfaced last year as he was running for the white house  he apologized for the remarks  but called them private  locker room talk  and said he had not done the things he talked about   trump also denied allegations at that time by at least  women of sexual advances and groping in the past  moore  who is running for the senate in alabama in a special election on tuesday  has been accused by several women of sexual assault or misconduct when they were teenagers and moore was in his early   moore    has denied the accusations  which reuters has not independently verified  trump has backed moore  but senate republicans have been cooler toward his candidacy  in pressing franken to step aside  democrats have tried to capture the moral high ground and draw a distinction between their party and republicans           in every workplace in america  including the u s  senate  we must confront the challenges of harassment and misconduct   said amy klobuchar  franken s fellow democratic senator from minnesota      similarly  house republican speaker paul ryan said on thursday he had told franks that he should resign  a special election will be scheduled to determine a replacement for franks  while a democrat will be appointed initially to replace franken  his departure could complicate the party s efforts to maintain or build on the  senate seats they hold  two independent senators also vote with the democrats  republicans are defending eight seats in the congressional elections in november  but democrats will be defending  if minnesota holds a special election for franken s seat  the election to fill franken s seat could be close  when he ran in   the race was decided after an extensive recount  with minnesota s supreme court weighing in   in the  presidential election  democrat hillary clinton won the state by less than  percentage points
