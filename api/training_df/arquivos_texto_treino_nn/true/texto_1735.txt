washington  reuters    u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said on thursday that the united states was seeking to add a five year sunset provision to the north american free trade agreement to provide a regular   systematic re examination  of the trade pact  ross told a forum hosted by politico that both he and u s  trade representative robert lighthizer had agreed on the need for such a sunset provision   which means nafta would automatically end after five years unless renewed   and would  put it forward  in the nafta modernization talks  but it was unclear whether canada and mexico would back it  u s   canadian and mexican negotiators are set to reconvene for a third round of talks in ottawa on sept     ross said a sunset provision was needed because forecasts for u s  export and job growth when nafta took effect in  were  wildly optimistic  and failed to live up to expectations  canadian and mexican ambassadors to washington pushed back at the idea  saying such a provision would add uncertainty to a nafta agreement and affect long term planning by businesses   i m a believer in sunset clauses when things are set up to be temporary   said canada s ambassador david macnaughton   we can have that discussion but i really do suspect that it won t be mexico and canada pushing back against the secretary  it will be a lot of americans too   mexico s ambassador to the united states gerónimo gutiérrez fernández said a provision  would have very detrimental consequences to the business sector of the united states  mexico and canada    let s look at what they are thinking about in more details but certainty is the key word here   said gutierrez  ross said the termination clause currently in nafta  that allows a country to exit after a six month notice period  has never been triggered  and  it s the kind of thing that probably wouldn t be   ross and trump have both talked about quitting nafta if it can t be renegotiated to reduce u s  trade deficits with mexico and canada   the five year thing is a real thing  would force a systematic re examination   ross said   if there were a systematic re examination after a little experience period  you d have a forum for trying to fix things that didn t work out the way you thought they would
