washington  reuters    the tax bill is president donald trump s biggest legislative victory this year  but democratic strategists are already planning how to turn it into his biggest liability  the emotional trigger they think will work on voters at next year s midterm elections  arguing the bill is profoundly unfair by giving the lion s share of benefits to corporations and the rich     be careful what you wish for   tom steyer  a democratic billionaire  said of republican leaders in an interview with reuters on wednesday   they wanted this  they should have never have wanted it  now that they ve got it  they re going to wish they didn t   steyer said he plans to use his money   through his political group nextgen america   to attack the republican tax overhaul  using social media and online advertising aimed at young voters  a strategy that recently helped elect democratic candidate doug jones in a senate race in alabama and ralph northam as governor of virginia  in november   elections will be held for all  seats in the u s  house of representatives and for  seats in the  member senate   pollsters believe the midterms could be a rare  wave election   when one party seizes back control of congress  it happened for republicans in  and    if democrats are able to pick up two more senate seats  they will take control of the chamber  and after the wins in alabama and virginia  they are even hopeful they could tap into anger over tax cuts for the rich to win control of the house  only about  percent of voters approve of the tax bill  according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted in mid december  slightly more than  percent oppose it  in no region of the country did even half of the people polled say they support it   the democratic senate campaign committee is already running anti tax plan ads in several key states including nevada  arizona  indiana  ohio  pennsylvania and wisconsin   the ads are only five second spots running before youtube videos  the viewer  unable to skip over the ads  will hear   the republican tax scheme gives huge breaks to corporations but raises taxes on middle class families   the tax bill cuts the corporate tax rate to  percent and raises the threshold at which an inheritance is taxed  it also cuts the tax rate for top earners   while it also cuts the tax rate for most other income groups and doubles the size of the standard deduction  the elimination of other popular deductions could result in some taxpayers seeing a tax increase instead of a cut  it has been popular with the republican base  trump voters and the party s donors  the stock market has surged in anticipation of the cuts      democrats plan to focus on provisions like benefits to commercial real estate owners  arguing that the tax bill could produce millions of dollars of more cash for trump and his family members  the white house asserts trump will not personally benefit   but it admits that his business might    the super pac american bridge  which supports democratic candidates  is running digital ads in states with senate races targeting women  swing voters and republicans in suburban areas  said joshua karp  the group s communication director for senate races     i think there is a couple of things that get almost all americans riled up about this bill  it is fundamentally unfair and breaking the promise the republicans made to the american people   karp said   republicans say democrats are indulging in wishful thinking  polls say  percent of voters think their taxes will go up  but tax analysts say that  percent will pay less tax   republicans are counting on voters  when they see more money in their paychecks  to dismiss democratic rhetoric  and perhaps even throw their support behind trump   and if there are any unpleasant surprises in store for taxpayers  they will not be filing their first tax returns under the new law until early   months after the midterm elections   republican strategist alex conant  a veteran of congressional and presidential campaigns  said the unpopularity of the tax cuts in opinion polls can be directly attributed to trump s low approval levels    we re losing elections because donald trump is incredibly unpopular and makes a lot of independents and soft republicans uncomfortable     trump s numbers are dragging down tax reform s numbers   conant said  although he also played down the electoral risks of the tax overhaul   i would be very surprised if people are marching in the streets months from now because we cut their taxes    republicans have some other advantages  like the growing economy  that means an attack on the tax overhaul could backfire    democrats will have a very hard time taking this road if the economy is still going gang busters  months from now   republican strategist joe bretell said  but he acknowledges that the democrats are on the right track    the emotional trigger point is in fairness   he said   the party that can best explain or brand this bill and explain why it s fair or unfair to their base or the other side  wins
