washington  reuters    i am voluntarily providing this statement  submitting documents  and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the trump for president campaign and during the transition period  i am not a person who has sought the spotlight  first in my business and now in public service  i have worked on achieving goals  and have left it to others to work on media and public perception  because there has been a great deal of conjecture  speculation  and inaccurate information about me  i am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight  my role in the trump for president campaign before joining the administration  i worked in the private sector  building and managing companies  my experience was in business  not politics  and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father in law s campaign when he decided to run for president  however  as the campaign progressed  i was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign  and took on more and more responsibility   over the course of the primaries and general election campaign  my role continued to evolve  i ultimately worked with the finance  scheduling  communications  speechwriting  polling  data and digital teams  as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials  all of these were tasks that i had never performed on a campaign previously  when i was faced with a new challenge  i would reach out to contacts  ask advice  find the right person to manage the specific challenge  and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action  i was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way  all of whom made significant contributions toward the campaign s ultimate success  our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the situation warranted  i share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions  some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not  it is also important to note that a campaign s success starts with its message and its messenger  donald trump had the right vision for america and delivered his message perfectly  the results speak for themselves  not only did president trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency  he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election  he outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the american people  campaign contacts with foreign persons  when it became apparent that my father in law was going to be the republican nominee for president  as normally happens  a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign  my father in law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries  these were not contacts that i initiated  but  over the course of the campaign  i had incoming contacts with people from approximately  countries  to put these requests in context  i must have received thousands of calls  letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics  including hundreds from outside the united states  while i could not be responsive to everyone  i tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing  productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail  to that end  i called on a variety of people with deep experience  such as dr  henry kissinger  for advice on policy for the candidate  which countries representatives with which the campaign should engage  and what messaging would resonate  in addition  it was typical for me to receive  or more emails a day during the campaign  i did not have the time to read every one  especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which i was added at some later point in the exchange  with respect to my contacts with russia or russian representatives during the campaign  there were hardly any  the first that i can recall was at the mayflower hotel in  washington  d c  in april   this was when then candidate trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech  doing the event and speech had been my idea  and i oversaw its execution  i arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order  after that  i stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event  dimitri simes  the publisher of the bi monthly foreign policy magazine  the national interest  who had done a great job putting everything together  mr  simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event  he introduced me to several guests  among them four ambassadors  including russian ambassador sergey kislyak  with all the ambassadors  including mr  kislyak  we shook hands  exchanged brief pleasantries and i thanked them for attending the event and said i hoped they would like candidate trump s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to america s foreign policy  the ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election  each exchange lasted less than a minute  some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies  i never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions  reuters news service has reported that i had two calls with ambassador kislyak at some time between april and november of   while i participated in thousands of calls during this period  i do not recall any such calls with the russian ambassador  we have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with ambassador kislyak and i am highly skeptical these calls took place  a comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls  i had no ongoing relationship with the ambassador before the election  and had limited knowledge about him then  in fact  on november   the day after the election  i could not even remember the name of the russian ambassador  when the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from president putin  i was asked how we could verify it was real  to do so i thought the best way would be to ask the only contact i recalled meeting from the russian government  which was the ambassador i had met months earlier  so i sent an email asking mr  simes   what is the name of the russian ambassador   through my lawyer  i have asked reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which i supposedly reached  or was reached by  ambassador kislyak  the journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred  the only other russian contact during the campaign is one i did not recall at all until i was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information  in june   my brother in law  donald trump jr  asked if i was free to stop by a meeting on june  at   p m  the campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in trump tower  and it was common for each of us to swing by the other s meetings when requested  he eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to   p m  that email was on top of a long back and forth that i did not read at the time  as i did with most emails when i was working remotely  i quickly reviewed on my iphone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at   pm at his office  documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as  meeting  don jr   jared kushner   no one else was mentioned  i arrived at the meeting a little late  when i got there  the person who has since been identified as a russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on u s  adoptions of russian children  i had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well spent at this meeting  reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that  in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work  i actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after i had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote  can u pls call me on my cell  need excuse to get out of meeting   i had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since  i thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently  i did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees  no part of the meeting i attended included anything about the campaign  there was no follow up to the meeting that i am aware of  i do not recall how many people were there  or their names   and i have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted  finally  after seeing the email  i disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form  even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form  there was one more possible contact that i will note  on october     i received a random email from the screenname     this email  which i interpreted as a hoax  was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate trump s tax returns and demanded that we send him  bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information  i brought the email to the attention of a u s  secret service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought  he advised me to ignore it and not to reply   which is what i did  the sender never contacted me again  to the best of my recollection  these were the full extent of contacts i had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the russian government   transition contacts with foreign persons the transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign  starting on election night  we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well wishers in the united states and abroad  dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration  during this period  i recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries  two of those meetings were with russians  neither of which i solicited  on november     my assistant received a request for a meeting from the russian ambassador  as i mentioned before  previous to receiving this request  i could not even recall the russian ambassador s name  and had to ask for the name of the individual i had seen at the mayflower hotel almost seven months earlier  in addition  far from being urgent  that meeting was not set up for two weeks   on december   the meeting occurred in trump tower  where we had our transition office  and lasted twenty  thirty minutes  lt  general michael flynn  ret    who became the president s national security advisor  also attended  during the meeting  after pleasantries were exchanged  as i had done in many of the meetings i had and would have with foreign officials  i stated our desire for a fresh start in relations  also  as i had done in other meetings with foreign officials  i asked ambassador kislyak if he would identify the best person  whether the ambassador or someone else  with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his president  the fact that i was asking about ways to start a dialogue after election day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that i was not aware of one that existed before election day  the ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations  and then said he especially wanted to address u s  policy in syria  and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his  generals   he said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration  he said the generals could not easily come to the u s  to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation  general flynn or i explained that there were no such lines  i believed developing a thoughtful approach on syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis  and i asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to general flynn  the ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the inauguration  nothing else occurred  i did not suggest a  secret back channel   i did not suggest an on going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office  i did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period  we did not discuss sanctions  approximately a week later  on december   the embassy asked if i could meet with the ambassador on december   i declined  they then asked if i could meet on december   i declined again  they then asked when the earliest was that i could meet  i declined these requests because i was working on many other responsibilities for the transition  he asked if he could meet my assistant instead and  to avoid offending the ambassador  i agreed  he did so on december   my assistant reported that the ambassador had requested that i meet with a person named sergey gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the russian president who could give insight into how putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together  i agreed to meet mr  gorkov because the ambassador has been so insistent  said he had a direct relationship with the president  and because mr  gorkov was only in new york for a couple days  i made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day  on december   the meeting with mr  gorkov lasted twenty to twenty five minutes  he introduced himself and gave me two gifts   one was a piece of art from nvgorod  the village where my grandparents were from in belarus  and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village   any notion that i tried to conceal this meeting or that i took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false  in fact  i gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office   after that  he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the russian economy  he said that he was friendly with president putin  expressed disappointment with u s  russia relations under president obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future  as i did at the meeting with ambassador kislyak  i expressed the same sentiments i had with other foreign officials i met  there were no specific policies discussed  we had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the obama administration  at no time was there any discussion about my companies  business transactions  real estate projects  loans  banking arrangements or any private business of any kind  at the end of the short meeting  we thanked each other and i went on to other meetings  i did not know or have any contact with mr  gorkov before that meeting  and i have had no reason to connect with him since   to the best of my recollection  these were the only two contacts i had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the russian government  disclosure of contacts on my security clearance form there has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my sf  form  as my attorneys and i have previously explained  my sf  application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts  not just with russians  with foreign government officials  here are some facts about that form and the efforts i have made to supplement it  in the week before the inauguration  amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company  moving my family to washington  completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms  people at my new york office were helping me find the information  organize it  review it and put it into the electronic form  they sent an email to my assistant in washington  communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete  my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed  at that point  the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father in law  which was obviously well known   because of this miscommunication  my assistant submitted the draft on january     that evening  when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely  we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form  the very next day  january     we submitted supplemental information to the transition  which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the fbi  the supplement disclosed that i had  numerous contacts with foreign officials  and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list  i provided a list of those contacts in the normal course  before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form  it has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with russians  that is not the case  in the accidental early submission of the form  all foreign contacts were omitted  the supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form  these included meetings with individuals such as jordan s king abdullah ii  israel s prime minister bibi netanyahu  mexico s secretary of foreign affairs  luis videgaray caso and many more  all of these had been left off before  over the last six months  i have made every effort to provide the fbi with whatever information is needed to investigate my background  in addition  my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited  the form itself instructs that  during the interview  the information in the document can be  update d   clarif ied   and explain ed   as part of the security clearance process  a good example is the june  meeting  for reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting i have provided  i did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an sf   when documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred  and because of the language in the email chain that i then read for the first time  i included that meeting on a supplement  i did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form  this supplemental information was also provided voluntarily  well prior to any media inquiries  reporting or request for this information  and it was done soon after i was reminded of the meeting  as i have said from the very first media inquiry  i am happy to share information with the investigating bodies  i have shown today that i am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate as i have nothing to hide  as i indicated  i know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from russia  i have disclosed these contacts and described them as fully as i can recall  the record and documents i am providing will show that i had perhaps four contacts with russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition  none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable  i am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight  i also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign  and i am proud of the candidate that we supported  of the campaign that we ran  and the victory that we achieved  it has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense  i have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this president and this country to the best of my abilities  i hope that through my answers to questions  written statements and documents i have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with russian representatives during the campaign and transition  i did not collude  nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded  with any foreign government  i had no improper contacts  i have not relied on russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector  i have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my sf  form  above and beyond what is required  hopefully  this puts these matters to rest
