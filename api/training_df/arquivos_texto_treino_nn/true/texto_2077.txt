washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump came around to the decision to allow for more troops to be sent to afghanistan only after a prolonged internal debate in which he frequently tangled with his top national security advisers  trump had repeatedly argued on the campaign trail last year that the long running wars in afghanistan and iraq were a waste of lives and billions of dollars that could be better spent at home  an emotional visit in april to walter reed hospital  where many grievously wounded soldiers are taken for treatment  only served to harden the president s reluctance to send more troops   trump said he did not want to send more young americans to battle only to see them lose limbs   what are we doing there   he asked his national security aides  according to a senior administration official  in a series of interviews  senior administration officials said trump was hard to persuade but finally   and begrudgingly   agreed to allow for a modest increase in troop numbers  from the current   to more than    he first had to be convinced that the approach he was approving was markedly different from the strategies employed by his two immediate predecessors  george w  bush and barack obama  since he considered them to have failed  the officials said  in his prime time speech to the nation on afghanistan policy on monday night  trump conceded that his original instinct on taking office had been to pull out but he was then persuaded of the dangers of a hasty withdrawal  putting new emphasis on anti terrorism goals  he said u s  troops were needed to prevent the taliban from taking over afghanistan and again making it a breeding ground for islamic militants   this is not about nation building again  we are killing terrorists   he said      in the white house discussions  some of trump s advisers appealed to his pride in his negotiating skills by saying he could succeed with the taliban where obama had failed  in part because obama made the mistake of announcing that a surge of additional troops to afghanistan he approved in late  was temporary       the president knows that in order to get the taliban to the table  he knows that he first has to prove that he s willing to keep pressure on them for as long as it takes  which obama failed to do   said one of the officials   that doesn t mean he expects to sit down with them in qatar tomorrow   trump challenged his advisers to provide clear measurements of how progress can be gauged  with the goal of turning the tide in a battle in which the taliban appears to have gained the upper hand in recent months   he wants to be shown that we re winning   said one official   they had to develop the metrics for that in advance before he would agree to it  he doesn t want to be told in two years that it s just as bad as it was   but not worse  if that happens then we re really talking about a withdrawal  he made that clear   while trump was joined in his skepticism by his chief strategist steve bannon  who was fired on friday after months of power struggles inside the white house  multiple officials said the debate was less about bannon and more about trump himself  the argument that white house chief of staff john kelly  defense secretary jim mattis and white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster made was that previous efforts faltered because the afghan and pakistani governments did not step up and do what is required of them to help defeat the taliban and deny terrorists a haven in afghanistan      the three   who have all had distinguished military careers   also raised the specter of iran s involvement in afghanistan  an argument that helped given trump s desire to block tehran s expansionism in the middle east  officials said   it was hard to put together for him all the pieces of a complicated puzzle that includes not just the three major regional players  but also india  china  russia  and iran   said one official   but the idea that he could succeed where his predecessors had failed had a certain appeal  so did the idea of emphasizing this is part of the war against islamic terrorism  not an effort to rebuild afghanistan  something he had consistently opposed   the official added  the new trump strategy puts greater emphasis on the responsibilities of the pakistani and afghan governments  another important factor  the officials said  was convincing trump that the withdrawal he had advocated for years would force him to shoulder some of the blame for the taliban victory that surely would follow
