washington  reuters    the u s  senate moved on tuesday toward ramming through approval of president donald trump s supreme court nominee this week  as its top republican said he had the votes to wipe away democratic roadblocks but vowed to preserve the minority party s ability to hold up legislation  majority leader mitch mcconnell plans to change the senate s long standing rules in order to eliminate the ability to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster against supreme court nominees like trump s pick  neil gorsuch  if a democratic filibuster succeeds as expected in blocking a confirmation vote  senate confirmation of gorsuch    to the lifetime post would restore the court s conservative majority and enable trump to leave a lasting imprint on america s highest judicial body even as he regularly criticizes the federal judiciary  mcconnell said he had the necessary votes to approve the rule change with a simple majority vote  expected on thursday  republicans control the senate    the rule change has been dubbed the  nuclear option   and trump has encouraged mcconnell to  go nuclear   such a step would threaten to further erode trust between the parties in congress   there s a reason they call it the nuclear option  and that is because there s fallout  and this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the senate for years to come   democratic senator richard blumenthal told reporters  republicans were so confident they could use their muscle to pass the rule change that senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley said flatly that gorsuch  will be on the supreme court friday night   amid a fierce debate over both gorsuch and the senate s rules  mcconnell tried to tamp down any speculation that republicans would stage a monumental power grab by ending the filibuster for legislation  mcconnell said that as long as he was the senate s majority leader  he would never remove the ability to mount a filibuster against legislation  as opposed to presidential appointments  mcconnell fought against many of former democratic president barack obama s legislative initiatives when republicans were the minority party in the senate   there s not a single senator in the  republican  majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster  not one   mcconnell told reporters  the move to change venerable senate rules reflects an intensifying of the already toxic partisanship in washington since trump took office in january  mcconnell s promise to keep the ability to filibuster legislation could make it more difficult for republicans to get key parts of trump s legislative agenda through the senate  considering the expected strong democratic opposition  a filibuster requires a super majority of  votes in the  seat senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a supreme court nominee or legislation  the  vote super majority threshold that gives the minority party power to hold up the majority party has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship in legislation and presidential appointments  the senate on tuesday kicked off its formal debate on confirming gorsuch  a colorado based appeals court judge  and mcconnell said he would get the clock ticking toward a vote expected on thursday to stop the democrats  filibuster  democrats on monday amassed the votes needed to sustain the filibuster  prompting republicans to move toward changing the rules  democratic senator jeff merkley took to the senate floor on tuesday evening to rally support for the gorsuch filibuster  his office said in a statement that he  plans to hold the floor and refuse to yield for as long as he is able to continue speaking   merkley s  talking filibuster  is not expected to affect the republican timetable for gorsuch s confirmation   the filibuster in one form or another dates back to the  century but assumed its current form in the   the democrats were the first to use the  nuclear option   in   when they controlled the senate  they changed it to bar filibusters for executive branch nominees and federal judges aside from supreme court justices  they did so after republicans filibustered obama s appeals court nominees   democrats are now being pushed by far left interest groups into doing something truly detrimental to this body and to our country   mcconnell said on the senate floor   they seem to be hurtling toward the abyss this time  and trying to take the senate with them   top senate democrat chuck schumer  leading the filibuster effort  said it was the republicans who bore responsibility for the crisis and for deciding  as he said  to  break the rules   he noted that the senate  under mcconnell s guidance  refused last year to consider obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the same high court vacancy that trump elected gorsuch to fill   what the majority leader did to merrick garland by denying him even a hearing and a vote is even worse than a filibuster   schumer said on the senate floor  restoring the nine seat high court s conservative majority would fulfill one of trump s top promises during the  presidential campaign  republicans say gorsuch is well qualified for the job and that there is no principled reason to oppose him  democrats say he is so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream  has favored corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions  and has shown insufficient independence from trump
