moscow  reuters    the u s  house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to impose new sanctions on moscow  triggering an angry reaction from russian officials  but analysts are playing down the impact  the sanctions  which have yet to be approved by the u s  senate and president donald trump  expand and tweak a list of existing sanctions  but cannot be viewed as a game changer  analysts said  russian president vladimir putin will decide if and how moscow will retaliate once the fresh sanctions become law  below are highlights from the bill and analysts  reactions    the united states  should continue to uphold and seek unity with european and other key partners on sanctions implemented against the russian federation  which have been effective and instrumental in countering russian aggression in ukraine    the secretary of the treasury shall submit     a report describing in detail the potential effects of expanding sanctions     to include sovereign debt and the full range of derivative products   the secretary of the treasury shall review sanctions from   to ensure that the directive prohibits the conduct by united states persons or persons within the united states of all transactions in  provision of financing for  and other dealings in new debt of longer than  days maturity or new equity of persons determined to be subject to the directive  their property  or their interests in property    the secretary of the treasury may determine that a person meets one or more of the criteria     if that person is a state owned entity operating in the railway  or metals and mining sector of the economy of the russian federation   the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state  shall submit a detailed report on russia s senior foreign political figures and oligarchs  the bill is designed  to continue to oppose the nordstream  pipeline given its detrimental impacts on the european union s energy security  gas market development in central and eastern europe  and energy reforms in ukraine   trump  in coordination with allies of the united states  may impose sanctions on an entity that makes an investment described in the act or  sells  leases  or provides to the russian federation  for the construction of russian energy export pipelines  goods  services  technology  information  or support     any of which has a fair market value of     or more  or that  during a  month period  have an aggregate fair market value of     or more    with the senate voting   and the house    it is highly unlikely that president trump would veto the bill   said charles robertson  global chief economist at renaissance capital in london   long term this is really bad news  we know from jackson vaneck that these kind of sanctions are hard to remove once in place  this will further stall foreign investment into russia  negatively impacting growth and development  furthering long term capital flight and brain drain  it will further the isolation from the west  and stagnation of the russian economy   said tim ash  a senior strategist at bluebay asset management in london   most importantly for russia  the original senate bill with regard to nord stream  was watered down as it now requires coordination with  allies  when imposing such sanctions  moreover  the bill only gives the option for the president to introduce such sanctions  but does not require that he does so  so  overall  i expect marginal negative effect   ivan tchakarov  senior economist at citi in moscow   in general we think that the impact on the russian economy should be relatively limited  compared to  when the first set of sanctions was introduced the russian economy is in much better state to weather the measures   said liza ermolenko  emerging european economist at barclays in london   in the u s  sanctions bill we have not seen any direct negative implications for the rouble so far  some tightening of the trade financing terms would not have a material negative impact on the rouble  although it may lead to a shortage of the dollar liquidity in the market and it s not clear how well companies and banks were prepared to this   said alexey pogorelov  chief economist at credit suisse in london
