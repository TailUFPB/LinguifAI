washington  reuters    lobbyists and republican lawmakers are gearing up for battle over a new u s  regulation that is likely to dent profits in the   billion short term  high interest  payday  loan industry   the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb  is expected in coming days to release a long anticipated rule curbing payday lending  now that a final review by other regulatory agencies has concluded  three people familiar with the matter said  the rule pits the country s consumer financial watchdog against payday lenders who say the new regulation will wipe out much of their established industry  currently overseen by the states  and push poor and rural customers to use illegal loan sharks    we are likely  on our part  to take the appropriate actions that we can to see this rule never becomes effective  and that includes a possible lawsuit   said dennis shaul  chief executive of the community financial services association of america  cfsa   a payday lending trade group  the group says the rule drafting process was flawed because the agency did not listen to borrowers or properly process comment letters   an argument that could form the basis of potential litigation  the cfpb has declined to comment on its procedure or on the final rule  but public records show it closely followed the law throughout the rulemaking process  meanwhile  president donald trump s republican party  which says the cfpb goes too far in its regulations  wants to undo the rule through legislation  recently  republicans in the house of representatives added a  rider   or amendment  to a spending bill banning the cfpb from regulating the payday loan industry  they are also poised to repeal the rule under the congressional review act and bar the cfpb from ever drafting a similar regulation  according to aides and lobbyists  borrowers take out the small  short term loans to cover emergencies and traditionally repay them with their next paychecks  because the loans can carry interest rates as high as  percent  borrowers can become trapped in devastating cycles of taking out new loans to pay outstanding ones  the cfpb said   the agency began drafting the rule last summer to end this  debt trap   by requiring lenders to conduct background checks showing borrowers can afford the loans and to limit the number of loans made to a single borrower    the rule that we re expecting will do a lot to combat the debt cycle   said karl frisch  head of allied progress  a consumer advocacy group
