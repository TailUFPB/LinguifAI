new york washington  reuters    president donald trump s turnabout on the violence in charlottesville  virginia has rocked his administration  leading to rising speculation that some top officials may be looking for a way out   a parade of business executives broke ties with trump on wednesday  a day after he blamed white nationalists and counter protesters in equal measure for the weekend clashes that left one woman dead   now  frustrated aides could be next  trump s remarks have left some wondering if sticking by the president comes at too high a cost to their reputations    a lot of us joined this administration thinking we could bring to it the experience and expertise that the president didn t have an opportunity to gain in his business career  and to encourage some restraint in what he says publicly and to our allies   said one senior official who is contemplating whether to resign    after yesterday  it s clear that there is no way for anyone  even a marine general  to restrain his  trump s  impulses or counter what he sees on tv and reads on the web   it was hoped that retired general john kelly  trump s new chief of staff  could impose some form of discipline on trump that his predecessor  reince priebus  could not   but kelly stood with his eyes fixed on the floor when trump veered off script at his manhattan office tower on tuesday  the president accused the protesters  who rallied against neo nazi and white supremacist groups in charlottesville  of being  very  very violent    in the uproar that followed  chief executives at companies such as merck   co inc   under armour inc   intel corp   campbell soup co  and  co  quit advisory councils to the white house  trump then dissolved the councils   the exodus of executives sparked talk that gary cohn  trump s top white house economic adviser and a key liaison to the u s  business community  might resign in protest as well   cohn  who is jewish  was upset by trump s remarks  though he is remaining with the administration for now  sources said  cohn  along with treasury secretary steven mnuchin and transportation secretary elaine chao  stood by trump during his remarks at trump tower on tuesday  cohn in particular looked self conscious and uncomfortable   he just did not want to be in that position     and he was not good at hiding his body language for that   said a former administration official who knows cohn   cohn did not comment on the president s language   david shulkin  u s  secretary of veterans affairs  told reporters on wednesday that as a jewish american  he was  outraged  by neo nazis and other white supremacist groups and felt obligated to speak out against them    i am not going to condone in any way the behavior of nazis  i believe this clearly cannot be tolerated   shulkin said when asked about whether it was appropriate to compare the actions of the white nationalists to the protesters opposing them  shulkin  however  defended trump s approach   i think he s been clear that this is totally unacceptable   shulkin said   cohn  who came to the white house from a successful career  at goldman sachs group inc  is mindful the effect his trump tenure could have on his professional reputation   he s worried about his reputation being trashed  which is much more valuable to him than anything else   the former administration official said  cohn has served as a point man on top white house priorities such as tax reform and rebuilding the nation s infrastructure  but both of those efforts have been muddled by trump s increasingly combative relationship with congress  one that was strained even further by his comments on charlottesville  cohn s departure would further set back those efforts and perhaps give the upper hand in the white house to a group of advisers seeking to scale back foreign trade  said a wall street executive who asked not to be named    gary knows he s a moderating influence   the executive said   it may give you short term satisfaction to see gary go  but it may be bad for the country in the long term  the calculation is  what do you think is best for the country versus what s best for gary   steve bannon  a white house senior adviser with close ties to far right groups  told the american prospect in an interview published wednesday that he constantly butts heads with cohn over issues such as trade with china   that s a fight i fight every day here   bannon said   cowan and company  a financial services firm  said on wednesday that the departure of the pragmatic and business friendly cohn could adversely affect markets    for us  the biggest question is what is the tipping point that would cause national economic council director gary cohn to quit   the firm wrote   trump thinks highly of cohn and has spoken often of the financial sacrifices he made to leave goldman to join the administration  he is widely considered to be a leading candidate to chair the u s  federal reserve should trump choose not to retain janet yellen  that decision would insulate cohn from the day to day drama of the trump white house  but likely is months away   in the meantime  cohn has to decide whether he can stick it out  another wall street executive told reuters that trump s remarks may prove to be too much for him    until yesterday  cohn did a great job insulating himself from trump and staying in the economic lane  but all of a sudden he was standing behind him when he goes off on a rampage and the true price of working for him comes home   the executive said   what can you do
