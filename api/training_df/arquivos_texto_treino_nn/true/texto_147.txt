new york  reuters    the surprise victory by democrats in tuesday s alabama election for a u s  senator is prompting fund managers to prepare for more losses by the republican party in the  mid term congressional elections   fund managers from federated investors  wells fargo  james funds and lpl financial are among those that are moving into the shares of retailers  banks  industrials and technology firms that may benefit from strong global economic growth abroad and tax cuts for high income wage earners at home  even if the democratic party makes gains in next year s elections   with a strong economy  continuing deregulation by the administration of president trump  and the benefits of corporate tax cuts expected to be passed by the republican led congress in coming days  cyclical companies ranging from amazon com inc  amzn o  to allstate corp  all n  will outperform as long as washington stays out of the way  according to fund managers    tax reform was the big thing from an economic perspective  and if i ve got it then i ve got it  if this  next year s election  makes it harder for republicans to pass an immigration bill or trade restrictions then that s even better  because it reduces threats to global economic growth  said steven chiavarone  a portfolio manager at federated investors in new york  which has   billion in assets under management   as a result  chiavarone is holding on to large capitalization technology stocks like apple inc  aapl o  and amazon  despite each company s stock gaining more than  percent for the year to date  because he expects them to be the largest beneficiaries of the global economic expansion    you are going to have more money in the pockets of both consumers and of corporations  and these companies are most exposed to where that money will be spent   he said  historically  the u s  stock market has done well during periods when opposing political parties have control of the presidency and at least one house of congress  this time  however  the more influential factor looks to be the strength of the global economy   in the u s  the economy grew at its fastest pace in three years during the third quarter this year  while the economy of the eurozone is on pace for its largest expansion in a decade  in october  the international monetary fund raised its outlook for global economic growth to a rate of   percent in   helping to push emerging market stocks up to six year highs    we haven t had anything like this on a global growth scale since    said ryan detrick  senior market strategist for lpl financial  which has   billion in assets under management   against that backdrop  more gridlock in washington is not a bad thing  because you won t have any extreme moves one way or another   detrick expects cyclical value stocks  especially financials and industrials  to outpace the market in the year ahead as the federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and corporations start to increase their capital expenditures   financial stocks slightly outperformed the broad market on wednesday following the victory in the alabama election by democrat doug jones  with the financial select spdr fund  xlf p   a measure of financial companies in the benchmark s p  stock index  gaining   percentage points while the index as a whole was little changed   the move to invest in stocks that might benefit from gridlock in washington d c   if the democrats regain at least one house in congress next year  is a reversal from a year ago  when fund managers piled into infrastructure  defense and small capitalization stocks in anticipation of republican legislative victories in the  elections    dubbed the  trump trade  last year  the move helped push the u s  dollar up to multi year highs and sent the broad s p  index up more than  percent between november and march this year  now  however  fund managers are looking at companies that can benefit even if republicans are not able to legislate in congress   barry james  portfolio manager of the   billion james balanced golden rainbow fund  is also moving into financial stocks such as allstate and capital one financial corp  cof n  because he expects the trump administration to continue to reduce regulations in the industry  a policy that it can continue if republicans lose one or both houses of congress   at the same time  he is increasing his position in retail companies such as best buy co inc  bby n  and target corp  tgt n  that get the majority of their revenues in the u s  and are well positioned to benefit from the republican led corporate tax cut likely to be passed soon   he expects that democrats will win at least at least one house of congress in   limiting the impact of washington on the stock market until the presidential election in     it s looking more and more like the tax plan will be the one legislative victory that republicans will have  and there won t be anything else out of washington unless it is truly bi partisan   he said
