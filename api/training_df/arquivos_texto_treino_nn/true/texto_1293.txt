washington  reuters    the u s  energy secretary defended his plan to reward nuclear plants with incentives against criticism it would manipulate markets by telling a congressional hearing on thursday that a strong domestic nuclear industry boosted national security   rick perry pushed the federal energy regulatory commission on sept   to issue a rule within  days that would reward aging nuclear and coal fired power plants that store  days of fuel on site  he has said those plants should be supported for their ability to boost the reliability of the u s  power grid   many u s  representatives at the hearing  including democrat frank pallone  said the plan favored aging industries  killed free markets and would saddle consumers with higher power bills  one lawmaker pointed to a study by icf consulting that said power bills could rise   million to    billion annually if ferc issued perry s plan    but perry said the federal government had disregarded nuclear power for decades at a risk to national security   if we lose our supply chain  if we lose our intellectual chain of supply of bright scientists because we basically pushed the nuclear industry back  then we re going to lose our role as a leader when it comes to nuclear energy in the world   perry said  that in turn could hurt the country s ability to address nuclear nonproliferation  perry said   the united states has more nuclear power reactors than any other country  but russia  china and other countries are rapidly building nuclear plants and some in the industry worry those countries could become the world s top nuclear innovators   perry s plan has divided the energy industry  with coal and nuclear interests squaring off against natural gas drillers  solar and wind power  and consumer groups  it is unclear what ferc will decide on the plan  the agency  an independent arm of the energy department  declined a request to lengthen a comment period on perry s plan    republican representative pete olson suggested that perry was more in favor of free energy markets when he was governor of texas  but perry said the notion that energy markets were free and without subsidies was a  fallacy   pallone said a study that perry had directed energy department staff to conduct concluded the grid was already reliable and that most recent grid outages were caused by problems in energy transmission  not by power plants  several coal plants were forced to shut by recent hurricanes because their mounds of coal supply were soaked by heavy rains    perry said his plan was a directive for ferc  but he added that he initiated it to start a conversation about protecting people from outages during extreme storms
