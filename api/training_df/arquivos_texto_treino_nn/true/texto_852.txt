new york  reuters    many of the immigration initiatives launched by the trump administration in recent weeks target one kind of migrant  children  the measures are aimed at expelling young people already in the united states illegally and preventing new ones from crossing into the country       some of the policy shifts have generated headlines  including trump s decision in september to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program  or daca  that measure  put in place by former president barack obama in   allowed nearly   young people brought to the united states illegally as children the ability to live  work and study in the country without fear of deportation      other proposals and actions have received far less attention  the trump administration has recently intensified scrutiny of abused and neglected foreign minors applying to stay in the united states  it is seeking to restrict who qualifies for special protections granted to children crossing the border alone  and it is stepping up prosecutions of adults who paid smugglers to bring unaccompanied kids to the united states   the white house also announced this fall it will end a program allowing central american minors to apply for u s  asylum while still living abroad  at the same time  the administration is exploring ways to scrap legal protections that limit how long and under what conditions children can be held in immigration detention centers  in response to questions about the changes in immigration policy focused on children  the white house said that relevant agencies were reviewing ways to help  law enforcement professionals to do their jobs and keep the country safe    for a graphic on trump policies targeting young immigrants  see  tmsnrt rs     trump came to office promising to crack down on immigration  that message grew stronger this week in the wake of a terrorist attack in new york by a  year old immigrant awarded a green card through a visa lottery program the president has now vowed to end  some of his messaging on child immigrants also reflects security concerns  in a speech in long island in july  trump called out  alien minors  as responsible for gang related killings in the united states    these are animals   he said of members of the notorious central american gang ms   in addition  the administration says it wants to prevent children from undertaking perilous journeys to the united states and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants   the president wants to stop the incentives for vulnerable children to come here illegally   attorney general jeff sessions said in a speech in texas in october  in another speech last month  he blamed  dirty immigration lawyers  for encouraging clients to game the process  some immigration advocates see the president s focus on young border crossers differently  children are perceived sympathetically by the public and have more legal protections than other immigrants  giving authorities less flexibility to deport them  they say  it is  in the administration s interest to paint unaccompanied children as gang bangers and not as asylum seekers fleeing violence and abuse   said american civil liberties union attorney michael tan   the administration wants the public to perceive these children as monsters and not people deserving of refuge   president trump is not the first president to try to crack down on minors crossing the border illegally  obama prioritized the removal of young immigrants after the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the u s  mexico border peaked at more than   in   most of them from violence torn central america    trump campaigned on a promise to toughen enforcement further  saying obama s policies had failed  after he took office early in   apprehensions of unaccompanied minors dropped sharply  to a low of just over  in april from more than   in january  but the number of arrests has begun rising again  with nearly   unaccompanied minors caught in august  according to government data   one target of the administration is a legal agreement dating back to  that bars the government from holding child immigrants for long periods   the so called flores settlement addressed what advocates said were harsh conditions for kids held in immigration detention facilities  to settle a class action lawsuit  the government agreed to release minors quickly to adult relatives or licensed childcare programs  or to put them in the  least restrictive  setting possible if other options were not available  faced with  surge in illegal crossings  the obama administration fought broad legal interpretations of the agreement in court to make it easier to detain families  the trump white house now wants to scrap it altogether  an internal memo dated sept   written by the department of homeland security  dhs  and reviewed by reuters called the two decade old legal agreement  unworkable   and presented four options to fight or end it  among them  dhs could ask a federal court to dissolve the flores deal  a move the memo acknowledged could prove difficult given past rulings that have bolstered the agreement  a dhs spokesperson said the agency would not comment on  internal working documents   the administration is focused not just on stopping illegal border crossings by children but also on limiting their ability to stay once they reach the united states  one of its targets is sijs  or special immigrant juvenile status  a program for foreign minors who have been abused  abandoned or neglected   to qualify  children have to prove their mistreatment in u s  family court  after which they are protected from deportation and allowed to apply for green cards  sijs applications ballooned following the  surge in unaccompanied minors  the program s numbers hit   in the  fiscal year  a more than   percent increase from   in fiscal year   the white house and immigration hard liners in congress say lawyers have taken advantage of the program by using it for kids who are not in the kind of peril the statute was intended to address  chief among their complaints is that children abandoned by one parent can apply for sijs even if another parent is providing adequate care  the administration is already taking steps to limit the program  immigration attorneys say government scrutiny of sijs petitions has increased  slowing the approval process and leaving kids in limbo  approvals from april to june totaled    down more than  percent from the previous three month period  according to data from u s  citizenship and immigration services  uscis    uscis acknowledged that it has stepped up scrutiny of petitions  to ensure that they meet criteria for approval   but the agency stressed that the majority of applications are still approved   from january through june of this year   sijs petitions were approved while  applications were denied  meanwhile pending applications are ballooning  totaling   through june  as new petitions grow   the delays are creating confusion for young immigrants such as  year old drucilla  she says her mother neglected her after bringing her to the united states illegally from jamaica when she was three years old following her father s murder  drucilla eventually moved in with an aunt in new york and applied for sijs last year in order to stay in the country  drucilla  who asked only be identified by her first name  said she is nervous about the outcome of her case after u s  officials recently requested additional documents to substantiate her claims   growing up  nothing was ever in my control   she said   i have a lot of anxiety   see how the administration s actions affect people  communities  institutions and companies at the trump effect www
