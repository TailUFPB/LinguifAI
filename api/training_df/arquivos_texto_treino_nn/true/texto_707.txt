 reuters    u s  senate republicans  version of a tax cut bill will delay corporate rate cuts by one year to take effect in   and will not include a repeal of obamacare s individual mandate  republican senate finance committee member bill cassidy said   story   gary bradshaw  portfolio manager of hodges capital management in dallas  i do think the market would like to see this tax cut and if it s delayed  certainly it is going to have a big effect on small caps  they are probably off the most    i think the market is anticipating that we get this tax cut through  that it would really drive earnings  you look at s p earnings next year projected to be about    you get a tax cut it would probably be  a little above     if we don t have that  earnings are going to be tempered some  obviously a little of the tax cut has been in the market already and if it s delayed some of that good news is coming out   michael o rourke  chief market strategist  jonestrading  greenwich  connecticut   that was the catalyst for the recent leg down   he said  referring to the headlines that the senate tax proposal will delay the corp tax rate cut to     making sure we don t drive the deficit too much higher is going to be key here  that makes sense why they would push the corporate tax cut back  but at the same time  we re not getting to the point where we have a plan that seems workable yet   the market is due for a breather  it s been a year since the election  we ve gone up  percent on hopes of what the trump agenda would bring  and while they re trying to work toward this thing  they haven t really accomplished much yet  if progress is not made  the equity market should either pause or correct until meaningful progress is made   rick meckler  president of investment firm libertyview capital management in jersey city  new jersey  investors view the corporate tax cut as central to higher near term stock prices  once you delay it  the more time that goes on the more further changes can happen  this has been a bit of an emotional roller coaster for investors   you re starting to see some divergence between house  senate and white house  all three of which are controlled by republicans  that suggests that whatever is agreed to will probably look quite a bit different if its signed into law   the sell off is a quick reaction to how much uncertainty is ahead when it comes to significant corporate tax change   joe saluzzi  co manager of trading at themis trading in chatham  new jersey   nervous nellies are going to read the headlines  i have the feeling we are going to be headline driven until they finish this thing off  whenever that may be  if it is a market that has been based on tax cuts  or a good chunk of the rally has been  you would expect it to pullback if there is a potential breakup in the talks or a delay  it looks like this last leg was based on a delay of potentially a year on the senate side  so totally expected you would see that  but i would also expect it to rip right back if all of a sudden they come out and say they are making progress    other than that there is really nothing fundamentally changed  nothing new today  economic numbers   nothing was really out of line  it is certainly tax driven  if there is a decent headline that comes out by the end of the day we will rally right back  maybe people are not nervous  they shouldn t be  but i hope there is no complacency in the market  i am always worried about that  but i don t see this as a big deal yet    subadra rajappa  head of u s  strategy  sg corporate   investment banking  new york  in the bond market  we reacted initially to the selloff in europe  now we are giving some of it back because of the concerns about the implementation of the tax plan  the difference between house and senate plans have be reconciled  they have to make the math work with the agreed upon    trillion projected addition to the deficit  they feel the better start for the corporate tax cut is   we saw some pressure on the high yield spreads the past few sessions with evaluations being frothy  this combined with the tax plan have put some downward pressure on yields  the news on the tax front hasn t been very positive  the devils are always in the details  there s a bit more worry about which of the proposals will get though and how  i personally think they would have trouble to get through reconciliation in such short order   paresh upadhyaya  director of currency strategy at amundi pioneer investment management  boston  i think the markets are getting a bit jittery over details of the plan as it looks like it is going to be pushed off another year  the initial reaction is disappointment over the senate plan  of course that s not going to be the final plan  but the initial reaction is certainly negative for the dollar   the momentum of the dollar has been hit on concerns about the tax plan  that this could take longer than people had expected  that s why the dollar momentum seems to have stalled   stocks  u s  stocks extended losses in mid day trading  the dow jones industrial average  dji fell   points  or   percent  to     the s p   spx lost
