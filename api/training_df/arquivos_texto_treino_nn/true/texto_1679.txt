new york  reuters    the united states  britain and other countries opposed to syrian president bashar al assad will not support the reconstruction of the country until there is a political transition  away from assad   british foreign secretary boris johnson said on monday  the  friends of syria  group  an alliance of mainly western and gulf arab countries  met in new york on monday on the sidelines of the u n  general assembly at a time when the conflict in syria  now in its seventh year  appears to be less urgent with attention focused on the north korean nuclear threat and the fate of the iran nuclear deal   we believe that the only way forward is to get a political process going and to make it clear to the iranians  russians and assad regime that we  the like minded group  will not support the reconstruction of syria until there is such a political process and that means  as resolution  says  to a transition away from assad   johnson said  he was speaking after a meeting of about  countries that back the syrian opposition including france  saudi arabia  turkey and the united states   the u n  security council has adopted a syria transition road map through a geneva led process  russia joined the war on assad s behalf in   turning the momentum in his favor  assad also enjoys robust support from iran and lebanon s hezbollah  meanwhile  the moderate syrian opposition is moribund and the united states has largely stepped back from a leading role in syrian diplomacy  earlier this year the trump administration also halted the cia s covert program to equip and train certain rebel groups fighting assad  acting assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs  david satterfield  said all those at the meeting agreed that  there has got to be a political process if there is to be any international participation in the reconstruction of syria    the regime and the regime supporters cannot declare a victory solely based on a map and colors of positions on the ground   satterfield said   the reconstruction of syria depends very much on that credible political process  that political process is focused on geneva and the role of the united nations   the meeting on monday was in stark contrast to last year s which took place after a ceasefire deal between the united states and russia effectively collapsed when an aid convoy was bombed in aleppo  syria s largest city  aleppo is now in the hands of assad s forces and assad himself is in a much stronger position  thanks to russian and iranian support  the last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the international syria support group  issg   which included iran  was cast aside after syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of aleppo in   russia  turkey and iran have been negotiating separately for months in astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de escalation zones across the country  although those talks do not cover a long term political solution  we discussed here how to bring it back to the u n  led process and geneva   swedish foreign minister margot wallstr√∂m told reuters  asked if there was consensus on that  she said  i would say so     it s good if the astana process leads to de escalation and a reduction of the violence but it has to lead into the political process   earlier on monday  france warned that the status quo in syria risked leading to the country s permanent fragmentation and opening the door to new radical islamist groups  foreign minister jean yves le drian told reporters in new york he would hold a meeting with the four other permanent members of the security council   britain  china  russia and the united states   on thursday to persuade them to create a contact group to give new impetus to end the seven year conflict  le drian said  realism  dictated that assad could not stay in power after millions of syrians had fled the country due to the war  but that it was vital major powers worked together to help revive u n  brokered peace talks in geneva  dutch foreign minister bert koenders said the french contact group proposal was not discussed at the friends of syria meeting   but riyad hijab  a prominent syrian opposition leader  said he told french president emmanuel macron that the initiative was important in part because  of american withdrawal and russia is dominating the entire process  so mr  macron s initiative  is the right way to fix this because it s vital all five  permanent security council members  are involved in the process
