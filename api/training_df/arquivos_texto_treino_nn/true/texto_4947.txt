washington  reuters    u s  senate democrats on wednesday outlined how they will question supreme court nominee neil gorsuch at his confirmation hearing next week over what they say is a pro corporate bias in his rulings as an appeals court judge  democratic leader chuck schumer told reporters that the burden is on gorsuch  a conservative appeals court judge from colorado  to prove at the hearing starting on monday that he is an independent judge and not a pro business activist   judge gorsuch may act like a neutral  calm judge  but his record and his career clearly show he harbors a right wing  pro corporate  special interest legal agenda   schumer said   schumer appeared on capitol hill with several individual plaintiffs that gorsuch ruled against in his position as a judge on the denver based  u s  circuit court of appeals    he expresses a lot of empathy and sympathy for the less powerful   schumer said   but when it comes to time to rule  when the chips are down  far too often he sides with the powerful few over everyday americans just trying to get a fair shake    conservative legal activists who support the nomination say that democrats are cherry picking a small number of rulings that distort gorsuch s  year record as a judge  president donald trump nominated gorsuch on jan   to fill a yearlong vacancy on the nine justice supreme court  the republican controlled u s  senate has to approve the appointment for it to take effect  last year they refused to consider democratic former president barack obama s nominee to fill the vacancy caused by the february  death of conservative justice antonin scalia  trump s fellow republicans control the senate    but schumer repeated his view that gorsuch would need to win  votes  rather than a simple majority  to move toward confirmation  democrats can seek to use a procedural maneuver to block a confirmation vote if gorsuch s supporters cannot muster  votes  although republicans could change the senate rules   if a nominee can t get  votes  you don t change the rules   schumer said   you change the nominee   among the plaintiffs who spoke out was truck driver alphonse maddin  who was fired after he disobeyed a supervisor and abandoned his trailer at the side of a road after the brakes froze  gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion as a three judge panel ruled last year that maddin was wrongly terminated and had to be reinstated with back pay   this was a seven year battle   maddin said   seven different judges heard my case  one of those judges found against me  that judge was neil gorsuch
