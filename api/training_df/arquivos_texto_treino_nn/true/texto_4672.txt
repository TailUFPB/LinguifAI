washington  reuters    fresh off a defeat on u s  healthcare legislation  the white house warned rebellious conservative lawmakers that they should get behind president donald trump s agenda or he may bypass them on future legislative fights  including tax reform  the threat by white house chief of staff reince priebus to build a broad coalition on tax reform that could include moderate democrats came as the republican head of the tax writing committee in the house of representatives said he hoped to move a tax bill through his panel this spring  house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady said his committee had been working on tax reform in parallel with the failed healthcare reform push    we ve never stopped working   brady told fox news   sunday morning futures with maria bartiromo    we will continue to make improvements   brady said the committee planned to move on the bill in the spring  he said he wanted the house blueprint to be the basis for trump s tax reform plan rather than have competing versions from treasury and the white house  investors on wall street worry the healthcare bill s defeat bodes poorly for tax reform  equities have rallied since trump s election partly on expectations of tax cuts  economic growth would be more modest without fiscal stimulus and u s  equity index futures fell to a six week low on sunday  both trump and priebus have scolded hardline conservatives who rejected legislation backed by the white house to replace the  affordable care act  known as obamacare  speaking on  fox news sunday   priebus held out the possibility of working with moderate democrats as well as republicans to pass other aspects of trump s agenda  such as his proposed budget  the revamp of the tax code and a renewed effort at healthcare reform   if we can come up with a bill that accomplishes the goals of the president with republicans alone  we ll take it and we ll move forward with it   priebus said  but he added   i think it s more or less a warning shot that we re willing to talk to anyone  we always have been and i think more so now than ever   in an embarrassment for trump  who had campaigned for the white house on what he said were his skills as a dealmaker  the healthcare bill was pulled from the floor of the house of representatives on friday because it failed to draw enough support from within trump s republican party  objections from members of the conservative house freedom caucus and from moderate republicans left leaders short of the votes needed for passage  with democrats unified in opposition  trump failed to win over the freedom caucus lawmakers despite courting them intensively  outside conservative groups such as the club for growth and heritage action for america that are closely aligned with the freedom caucus had strongly opposed the republican healthcare bill and urged lawmakers to reject it  in a tweet on sunday morning  trump lashed out at both the freedom caucus and the conservative groups  saying their actions had left  democrats smiling in d c   priebus said it was a  real shame  that conservative lawmakers decided not to get behind the healthcare bill   and i think the president is disappointed in the number of people he thought were loyal to him that weren t   he said  middle class tax cut trump has put tax reform at the top of his legislative agenda now that the healthcare bill has failed  priebus said trump was not backing off his view that the tax reform bill needed a border tax  he also said that the measure would include a middle class tax cut that he said might help to attract votes from moderate democrats      in a sign that not everyone in the freedom caucus was in line with its approach and a positive signal for trump as he looked ahead to tax reform  u s  representative ted poe  a texas republican  said he had resigned from the group   in order to deliver on the conservative agenda we have promised the american people for eight years  we must come together to find solutions to move this country forward   poe said in a brief statement   saying no is easy  leading is hard   senate democratic leader chuck schumer criticized trump over his handling of the healthcare bill and said republicans would face roadblocks from conservatives on other issues   they re going to repeat the same mistake they made on trumpcare with tax reform   schumer told abc s  this week   he urged trump to go a different path  reject the freedom caucus and work with democrats    if he changes  he could have a different presidency   schumer said   he s going to have to tell them he can t work with them and we ll certainly look at his proposals  but it s going to be guided on our values   republican representative mark meadows  chairman of the freedom caucus  said on sunday he was optimistic on tax reform and that his group could support a plan that is not revenue neutral    so  tax reform and lowering taxes  you know  will create and generate more income   he said   and so we re looking at those  where the fine balance is  but does it have to be fully offset   my personal response is  no    another freedom caucus congressman  jim jordan  rejected fingerpointing over the collapse of the health bill   instead of doing the blame game  let s get to work   he said on  fox news sunday
