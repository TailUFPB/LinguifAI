new york  reuters    not even a week after the trump administration and congress rekindled optimism that they could soon make progress on a pro growth agenda including tax cuts  the unexpected firing of the head of the fbi late tuesday presented investors with a fresh reason to second guess their confidence in the  trump trade   at the least  financial market participants viewed president donald trump s abrupt dismissal of fbi director james comey as an unwelcome distraction  while some fretted it could tie washington in knots for months  potentially postponing already delayed reforms  the takeaway for the stock markets  don t bet on any quick legislation around trade  the budget  healthcare or infrastructure   there is nothing good out of this for markets   said michael purves  chief global strategist at weeden   co   it will weigh on trump s ability to cut deals with congress  it costs him negotiating leverage    jack ablin  chief investment officer at bmo private bank  said   on a medium term basis  it does undermine the administration s power to get things done    trump s election last november unleashed a powerful upswing in u s  stock markets on the premise that he would cut taxes and regulation and usher through a major infrastructure spending package  the benchmark s p   spx has gained  percent since election day  while shares of tech stocks and smaller companies have performed even better   nagging concerns about trump s ability to get things done  along with some anxiety about stretched equity valuations  have combined to cap the rally  and stocks have done little since early march  around midday wednesday  the s p was near unchanged  as were other market benchmarks  the administration recovered some credibility last week when the house of representatives voted to repeal major portions of former president barack obama s affordable care act after failing to do so a month earlier  the simple achievement of advancing the healthcare bill to the senate had been seen by investors as a signal that enacting tax cuts was doable  the big question was just how soon   this year or next    there s a tremendous amount of hope baked into the market that trump is going to be able to act  particularly on tax reform   said brad mcmillan  chief investment officer for commonwealth financial in waltham  massachusetts  edward perkin  chief equity investment officer at eaton vance  said if the date to pass tax  is pushed out it s not so much a problem  but if people question if it will ever happen  then that s a problem   the degree to which this further alienates democrats on capitol hill  especially in the senate  was another concern given how narrow support has been so far for trump s agenda  sen  dianne feinstein  a senior democratic lawmaker from california  was not optimistic that tensions between the parties would ease anytime soon   i had been hopeful that we could have a line of activity that s going to bring a very divided country together   feinstein told reuters wednesday   the problem out there is that people are so divided   should the comey episode weaken trump s bargaining ability with lawmakers  it may actually act as a catalyst for a tax bill  just one that might resemble congressional republicans  version more than trump s   an ongoing special investigation or shift in the balance of power could actually make trump more eager to sign off  on the previously existing congressional tax plan  analysts at natwest markets said  of course  some had already adopted the view that trump s promised reforms were a distant hope  at best   investors are realizing that the fiscal policy agenda is being pushed out farther on the horizon   michael arone  chief investment strategist at state street global advisors  stt n
