washington  reuters    in the end  the closer couldn t close the deal  for president donald trump  the collapse on friday of his first legislative priority  a healthcare reform bill  was an embarrassing loss of face after he and his administration insisted up until the time of the vote by the u s  house of representatives that there was enough republican support  it brings into question the neophyte president s ability to move big ticket legislation through congress  and for a celebrity businessman who brands himself a deal maker and fixer  it casts doubt over his ability to deliver on his bold  drain the swamp  promises to shake up washington  the white house wants to advance  among other things  tax reform and a massive infrastructure package this year  but now it must address whether a change of approach is needed and whether congressional allies such as house speaker paul ryan can be counted on to deliver   this is the most consequential day of trump s presidency and it s not just a failure  it s a stunning failure   charlie sykes  an influential wisconsin republican political commentator and frequent trump critic  said on twitter   trump appeared to chalk up the loss in part to his own inexperience after house leaders pulled their bill to repeal and replace obamacare following defections by both moderate and far right republican members who were unmoved by trump s ultimatum to vote for the plan or live with the current system   we learned a lot about loyalty  we learned a lot about the vote getting process   trump said after the bill was withdrawn  adding that he would move forward with other priorities  it was yet another setback for an administration barely two months in office that has already seen its national security adviser resign  had its immigration restrictions struck down in courts  and faces a barrage of questions about the trump campaign s ties to russia  trump s hallmark salesmanship seemed to abandon him this week  although he furiously courted the hard line conservatives opposed to the reform bill  they largely refused to yield  and in the process he alienated moderates who initially supported the bill  the president then switched tactics and gave up trying to bring the conservative opponents into the fold  instead delivering an ultimatum that all republicans needed to back the bill  that did not work either   trump also failed to persuade the american public that the bill was an improvement over the one it would have repealed and replaced  the affordable care act   the signature domestic achievement of former democratic president barack obama  polls showed the replacement bill to be deeply unpopular  and conservative republicans complained that their offices were being deluged by calls from constituents opposing it    this demonstrates that campaigning and legislating are two different things   said jim manley  once a top aide to former democratic senate majority leader harry reid   representative joe barton of texas blamed the failure on republicans who control the white house  senate and the house still learning how to govern after eight years of obama    sometimes you re playing fantasy football and sometimes you re in the real game   barton told reuters  representative mario diaz balart of florida called it  a big blow  for the republican agenda  trump s efforts to engage the bill s opponents at times seemed to muddy the process further  as he largely cut ryan out of negotiations   ryan didn t seem to mind  calling trump a  great closer     but even as trump offered concessions  conservatives did not budge and moderates were angered  stuart diamond  a professor who teaches negotiation at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania  said trump s strong arm tactics backfired    threats don t work in general   he said   they cause damage to relationships  they definitely don t work in a situation with a lot of different stakeholders  where the power is distributed   after the bill was revised along trump s specifications  the congressional budget office  which analyzes the financial impact of proposed legislation  determined that the bill would deprive  million americans of health insurance over the next decade and slice about   billion off the budget deficit   the cbo said the bill would not affect the number of uninsured but it would reduce the budget deficit significantly less than the original bill  troubling fiscal hawks  even as trump and the white house pushed harder  opposition to the bill among the rank and file rose  representative bill huizenga  a michigan republican who is also a small business owner  said trump was still getting used to governing   there are parallels between government and business  but they are not exactly the same   the lesson from the debacle  said john feehery  a republican strategist who was an aide to former house speaker dennis hastert  is that the white house needs to take a firmer hand in crafting legislative strategy  on healthcare  trump largely deferred to ryan s office  which drafted the bill in secret  sowing mistrust among conservatives   congress now faces arguably an even tougher legislative reform  overhauling the tax code  which has not been done since  and involves navigating a snake pit of competing special interests  like trump s healthcare proposal  it could struggle against public opinion  with democrats likely to cast it as a republican giveaway to the rich  there was also a feeling among some republicans that they had escaped a looming disaster  even if the bill had passed the house  it faced a radical overhaul in the senate  meaning both chambers would have been tied up battling over the bill for weeks  perhaps months  and if it became law and millions of voters lost health insurance  some republicans feared they could suffer at the polls   instead  those republicans have to hope voters will not punish them for failing to deliver on a promise they had been making since obamacare was passed in   and that they will  still believe this president when he says he can strike a deal   this is a promise the gop made to voters  they need to get it right   said rachel bovard  a policy analyst at the conservative heritage foundation  as she urged republicans to  start over   it is unclear when that could happen   this bill is dead   said representative greg walden of oregon  a member of the house leadership team
