washington  reuters    president donald trump s tax reform plan came under new criticism on tuesday from two towering wall street figures  including billionaire investor warren buffett  who called into question a republican drive to slash the u s  corporate rate    with the white house and top republicans in congress already on the defensive over claims the plan would not cut taxes for many middle class americans  buffett and blackrock inc  blk n  chief executive larry fink suggested in separate interviews that the corporate rate may not have to be cut as deeply as proposed   we have a lot of businesses    i don t think any of them are non competitive in the world because of the corporate tax rate   buffett  the chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway inc  brka n   told cnbc  fink said a corporate rate as high as  percent could satisfy u s  businesses  need for tax relief  while avoiding an increase in the federal deficit    what is being proposed is a pretty large expansion of our deficits   fink told bloomberg tv  the republican tax plan unveiled last month calls for slashing the corporate income tax rate to  percent from the current level of  percent  which many multinationals already avoid paying by taking advantage of abundant tax loopholes  the plan contains up to   trillion in tax cuts  according to independent analysts  which trump and top republicans say they would offset by eliminating loopholes  deductions and tax breaks and boosting annual economic growth  hungry for legislative victory after repeated failures in their push to overturn obamacare  many republicans are now willing to accept a tax plan that raises the federal deficit  a fact that bothers some deficit hawks   i feel like in some ways  since election day  we ve moved into a party atmosphere  and that concerns me   said republican senator bob corker  who has vowed not to vote for a tax bill that increases the deficit   republicans also insist that cutting the corporate tax rate to  percent will help workers by increasing jobs and raising salaries  though this claim is disputed by democrats     senator ron wyden  the top senate democrat on tax policy  accused the trump administration on tuesday of removing a research paper from the u s  treasury s website that showed workers would benefit only marginally from a corporate rate cut   apparently that mainstream economic analysis had to be purged because it basically didn t jibe with the trump team s patter   wyden said at a senate finance committee hearing  a treasury spokeswoman said the document was a dated analysis from the obama administration that  does not represent our current thinking and analysis    an analyst who testified at the senate hearing said only about  percent of the benefits of a corporate tax cut would directly help workers   buffett and fink also criticized other republican tax initiatives  buffett said a proposal to repeal the estate tax would be  a terrible mistake  that would benefit the wealthiest americans unnecessarily  fink predicted tax legislation would not pass if it includes a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments      i don t believe we re going to get tax reform if there is the elimination of deductibility of state and local taxes   he said    eliminating the state and local tax deduction would raise about one quarter of the   trillion in revenues that some republicans say they need to prevent tax cuts from creating a massive increase in the federal budget deficit  but eliminating that deduction is already opposed by republican lawmakers from high tax states such as new york and california  who say it helps their state governments pay for social programs  including public education    house of representatives ways and means committee chairman kevin brady discussed the state and local tax deduction at dinner on monday evening with about a dozen other house republicans  including some new york lawmakers  at least one came away predicting there would be a compromise   we kicked around six or eight or  different types of options   republican representative chris collins  a staunch trump ally from new york  told reporters
