washington  reuters    backers of a u s  russian plan to build nuclear reactors across the middle east bragged after the u s  election they had backing from donald trump s national security adviser michael flynn for a project that required lifting sanctions on russia  documents reviewed by reuters show  the documents  which have not previously been made public  reveal new aspects of the plan  including the proposed involvement of a russian company currently under u s  sanctions to manufacture nuclear equipment  that company  major engineering and construction firm omz oao  declined to comment  the documents do not show whether flynn  a retired army lieutenant general  took concrete steps to push the proposal with trump and his aides  but they do show that washington based nuclear power consultancy acu strategic partners believed that both flynn  who had worked as an adviser to the firm as late as mid   and trump were firmly in its corner   donald trump s election as president is a game changer because trump s highest foreign policy priority is to stabilize u s  relations with russia which are now at a historical low point   acu s managing director  alex copson  wrote in a nov     email to potential business partners  eight days after the election  white house officials did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment  acu declined comment and also declined to make copson available for an interview  previously they told a congressional committee that they had not had any dealings with flynn since may   before trump became the republican party s presidential candidate   flynn s lawyer  robert kelner  did not respond to a request for comment  flynn pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the fbi about a discussion with the former russian ambassador to washington  sergey kislyak  in late december  regarding sanctions    the documents also show that acu proposed ending ukraine s opposition to lifting sanctions on russia by giving a ukrainian company a   billion contract to provide turbine generators for reactors to be built in saudi arabia and other mideast nations      the contract to state owned turboatom  and loans to ukraine from gulf arab states  would  require ukraine to support lifting us and eu sanctions on russia   copson wrote in the nov   email  a turboatom spokeswoman said she did not have an immediate comment on the matter      the email was titled  trump putin me marshall plan concept   me stands for middle east  the title  evoking the post world war two plan to rebuild western european economies  reflected the hopes of the plan s backers that trump and russian president vladimir putin could cooperate on a project that would boost middle east economies      the email can be seen here  tmsnrt rs  the acu documents reviewed by reuters include emails  business presentations and financial estimates and date from late autumn   as part of their investigation into the trump election campaign s ties to russia  special counsel robert mueller and democrats on the house of representatives  oversight committee are probing whether flynn promoted the middle east nuclear power project as national security adviser in trump s white house  flynn resigned after just  days as national security adviser after it became known he had lied to vice president mike pence by telling him he had not discussed u s  sanctions on russia with kislyak in late december   in response to questions about the emails and documents  acu referred reuters to letters written in june and september by acu scientist thomas cochran to the house oversight committee  in those letters  cochran had laid out the project s strategy  describing a  ready to go  consortium that included  french  russian  israeli and ukrainian interests  without naming specific companies   representative elijah cummings  the committee s top democrat  said the panel s republican chairman  trey gowdy  has for months rejected democrats  requests to ask the white house for documents pertaining to the acu proposal  gowdy  has blocked all efforts to allow committee members to vote on issuing subpoenas   cummings told reuters  gowdy did not respond to requests for comment  the acu s nuclear reactor plan aimed to provide washington s middle east allies with nuclear power in a way that didn t risk nuclear weapons proliferation and also helped counter iranian influence  improve dismal u s  russian relations  and revive the moribund u s  nuclear industry  according to the documents seen by reuters      the wall street journal and the washington post reported this week that flynn pushed a version of the nuclear project within the white house by instructing his staff to rework a memo written by a former business associate into policy for trump to sign       two u s  officials familiar with the issue told reuters the policy document flynn prepared for trump s approval proposed  working with russia on a nuclear reactor project but did not specifically mention acu  the officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said they did not know if trump had read the memo or acted upon it      on nov       days after trump won the presidential election  acu s copson received an email from nuclear non proliferation expert reuben sorensen saying that he had updated flynn on the nuclear project s status  sorensen s role in the project was not clear from the emails       flynn is getting closer to  being named  national security advisor  expect an announcement soon  this is a big win for the acu project   sorensen wrote    spoke with him via backchannels earlier this week  he has always believed in the vision of the acu effort     we need to let him get settled into the new position  but update him shortly thereafter   sorensen added  the email can be seen here  tmsnrt rs  reuters could not independently confirm a briefing took place  sorensen did not reply to an email seeking comment      on nov      copson briefed u s  representative ed royce  republican chairman of the house foreign affairs committee  on the nuclear project  an email shows      copson was joined by jim hamel  a senior official from curtiss wright corp   which has a nuclear division based in royce s california district and was eager for a role in the multi billion dollar project      in a follow up email on dec   to a royce aide  hamel wrote   we hope that the chairman will follow up on alex s suggestion to reach out to general flynn  to discuss the project      royce s spokesman  cory fritz  confirmed the briefing to reuters   no action was ever taken by the chairman or the committee   he said in an email      hamel and curtiss wright declined to comment      flynn was an adviser to acu from april  to june   according to amended financial disclosure forms he filed in august  to the office of government ethics        democrats on the house oversight committee say that when flynn applied last year to renew his government security clearance  he failed to disclose a june  trip he made to egypt and israel to promote the reactor project  flynn has not commented on the trips
