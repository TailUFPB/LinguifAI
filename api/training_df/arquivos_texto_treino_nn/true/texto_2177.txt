washington  reuters    the top tax law writer in the u s  house of representatives insisted on tuesday that tax reform will happen this year  despite concerns among some experts that a tax code overhaul could drag into   or even collapse altogether  president donald trump is still seeking his first major legislative achievement and has focused on tax reform  but he has done little to advance it recently  amid constant distractions over russia  north korea and race relations  in congress  as they did for their failed push to dismantle obamacare  republicans are ramping up a nationwide publicity campaign in favor of tax law changes without first deciding on exactly what changes they want to make  house ways and means committee chairman kevin brady  a texan  is scheduled to deliver a speech on the issue on wednesday at former president ronald reagan s ranch in santa barbara  california  other committee members will also attend  ahead of his remarks  brady told cnbc on tuesday that the house  senate and white house are united around a common tax plan  with details being hammered out  no legislation has been introduced  house republican leaders had an ambitious plan earlier this year  but key pieces of it have been discarded  no replacement revenue raising provisions have been agreed upon  nevertheless  brady said   we are on track to deliver transformational  bold tax reform this year   at the same time  he acknowledged that details have yet to be finalized   we have a lot of work left to do      corporate lobbyists and independent experts said congress and the administration are far apart on critical issues such as how to slash rates without ballooning the federal deficit   the republicans all agree on lower tax rates  just not on how to pay for them   said stephen shay  a harvard law school lecturer who advised on tax policy at the u s  treasury under former democratic president barack obama  shay put the odds of tax reform occurring before the november  midterm congressional elections at     expectations for tax reform have fallen off sharply among investors on wall street  where many now believe congressional gridlock is more likely than an overhaul   economically  it  tax reform  is a no brainer  but from here to there  it s a long and winding road  and we re finding more land mines on that road pretty much every week   said brad mcmillan  chief investment officer at broker dealer commonwealth financial network   major tax reform last occurred in  as the result of a broadly bipartisan effort that took several years  under trump  tax reform is a highly partisan venture   republicans have only a few months to overcome internal divisions and other obstacles to get tax reform done by jan    the push will collide next month with efforts to prevent a government shutdown and a default on u s  debt   still  some experts said tax legislation might still fly   there s still an expectation that there will be some sort of tax bill that gets to the president s desk that he can sign before the midterm elections   said rohit kumar  a tax policy expert at accounting and consulting group pwc and a former senior senate tax aide    i think there s a lot of uncertainty about whether we can call that  tax reform  or whether that s something more like  tax relief
