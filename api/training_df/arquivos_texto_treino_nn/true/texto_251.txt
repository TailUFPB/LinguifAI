washington  reuters    millions of households would no longer benefit from federal tax deductions for charity donations  mortgage interest payments and property tax under republican tax plans being debated in the u s  congress  a think tank said on thursday  the left leaning institute on taxation and economic policy said that up to  million u s  households now writing off donations  home loan interest and state and local property tax payments would no longer be able to do so under either of the two plans  while all three deductions are maintained in some form in one or both of the rival senate and house of representatives bills  far fewer taxpayers could take advantage of them because of other proposed changes  said the washington based group   the house and senate have voted to fundamentally transform those write offs in ways that most people don t understand   said carl davis  research director of the institute  under the bills  the mortgage interest and charitable deductions would be  worthless for most people   davis said   less than one in  people is going to be able to write off their donations to their churches or local nonprofits if this legislation is signed into law   president donald trump and congressional republicans are racing to complete a sweeping tax code overhaul by the end of   if they can  it would represent their first major legislative achievement since trump took power in january  trump has promised to simplify the tax code  part of which involves ending tax breaks for special interests  that goal is encountering resistance from interests that would be hurt  the senate and the house have approved separate tax bills and are now trying to craft one unified bill to send to trump for his signature   as drafted  the two bills call for roughly doubling the  standard deduction   a key part of the tax code  to    for individuals and    for married couples filing jointly  the standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount  claimed by about two thirds of taxpayers  that reduces taxable income  instead of claiming the standard deduction  about one third of taxpayers  mostly high earning americans  itemize deductions  doing that is worthwhile  in most cases  if the total of itemized deductions exceeds the standard deduction  both the senate and house bills also curtail the deduction for state and local tax  salt  payments  with the house preserving it for state and local property taxes up to     tax experts estimate that the combination of doubling the standard deduction and curtailing the salt deduction would mean that far fewer americans would itemize  since itemizing is the only way to claim the deductions for charity  mortgage interest and state and local tax payments  claims for those deductions are also expected to plummet  especially among middle class americans  the institute estimated that the percentage of u s  households writing off charitable donations  under the republican plans  would fall to  percent from  percent  a similar decline would be seen in households claiming the mortgage interest deduction  it said   the mortgage interest deduction would be left in place for precisely the families who are least likely to need to the deduction to become homeowners  more than three fourths of middle income families claiming a mortgage interest deduction today would no longer receive that deduction   it said    there are good reasons to consider reforming itemized deductions to improve their effectiveness or fairness  but the house and senate s approach to that task leave much to be desired   the institute said   the story is refiled to correct last name in second reference to davis from david in fifth paragraph
