 reuters    a group of about a dozen republican governors is pushing for its own set of national healthcare reforms  flexing its considerable muscle in the national debate over the future of obamacare as the u s  senate begins writing its bill   led by governor john kasich of ohio  the governors are using a nine page proposal they crafted in february as the platform to shape what they think a critical portion of an obamacare replacement law should look like  according to a half dozen people who helped write the plan   among the group s recommendations for the senate include maintaining the expansion of medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled  while also limiting federal spending for certain populations  according to a copy of the proposal   members of the group  which include governors from utah  tennessee and michigan  are also now looking to form a bipartisan coalition of states to propose reforms for the individual insurance market  according to one source  that they hope the senate will also use  to see a graphic  click tmsnrt rs  they have not yet met or decided on specific reforms about the individual insurance market  but the goal is to address issues such as how to make insurance more affordable and stabilize the markets  the house of representatives narrowly passed its national healthcare bill earlier this month  called the american health care act  which would slash federal medicaid funding by more than   billion over the next decade   it has prompted fierce criticism from both republican and democratic governors   kasich recently called the bill  inadequate   and said it would leave millions of people without affordable coverage and  living in the emergency rooms again     pressure is building from their constituents   the reuters ipsos poll  which has been tracking public opinion on health care issues for the past several years  has found that republicans are more supportive than they were in  of benefits including expanded medicaid and insurance subsidies for low income families and a government requirement that small businesses provide insurance for their employees  the latest reuters ipsos poll was conducted online in english across the united states and gathered responses from   adults  including  republicans  it has a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of  percentage points for the entire group and  percentage points for republicans  the governors group is looking to the senate for massive changes as they begin writing their own bill  several groups  from insurers and hospitals to medical groups and patient advocates  are trying to influence the senate  but the governors carry extra weight because they will ultimately be responsible for implementing whatever healthcare overhaul is signed into law  and republicans in congress have repeatedly spoken about the need to have fewer federal regulations apply to medicaid and commercial insurance  under obamacare  more than  states  including about a dozen republican led states  expanded medicaid  one of the thorniest issues republicans have grappled with is treating both expansion and non expansion states equally  governors from both types of states united to craft medicaid proposals in the hope that their voice would carry added weight and provide a surer path for lawmakers   the governors are also in the same boat politically as u s  senators because both are elected statewide  rather than in smaller districts as house representatives are  so many governors and their senators have been better aligned on what healthcare reform should look like  several of the sources said  several governors and their staff said they have been in regular contact with their senators  and will be pushing for the senate to use the governors  set of reforms as a framework in writing its bill   senator rob portman of ohio wrote in an op ed monday that he and other senators tasked with writing a healthcare bill have continued to engage with governors   many of who share my concerns about medicaid but who also want more flexibility to ensure they can design health care programs that meet the individual needs of their states    he added that the senate will continue to work with governors on healthcare reform   they are definitely hearing our concerns and questions  they have been very attentive to our interests   said nathan checketts  deputy director of the utah department of health  the group of republican governors has worked to have a unified voice to reconcile needs among a diverse set of states  including arizona  illinois  wisconsin  arkansas and nevada  its leaders  which also include governor rick snyder of michigan and governor doug ducey of arizona  deliberately chose some participants from states with influential republican senators who would become key players in a federal healthcare overhaul   a  member senate panel has been tasked with writing a healthcare bill  and at least five of its senators are from states from the republican governors  group  including portman  orrin hatch of utah  mike lee of utah and lamar alexander of tennessee   other republican senators with governors in the group   including dean heller of nevada and jeff flake of arizona   are up for reelection in    as senate republicans take up the bill  one of the most complicated policy and political issues they must grapple with is medicaid reform   states that expanded medicaid  such as ohio and michigan  have said a healthcare overhaul must protect those who gained coverage under obamacare  non expansion states  meanwhile  have said they do not want to be penalized with less federal funding because they did not expand and therefore cover fewer people  the governors  proposal recommends maintaining obamacare s medicaid expansion and giving other states the opportunity to expand  but capping federal spending on certain populations through either block grants or per capita caps  it would provide states the option to phase in other groups  such as parents and children  to per capita caps or block grants  and it recommends reducing federal regulations on states and their medicaid programs
