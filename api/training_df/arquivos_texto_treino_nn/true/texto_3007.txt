colorado springs  colo   reuters    at a glitzy weekend gathering of donors to the powerful koch brothers  network  much of the talk was about the conservative political group s criticism of the healthcare bill moving through the u s  senate  that opposition suggests billionaires charles and david koch  powerful players in republican politics  remain at odds at least on some key issues with president donald trump  whose campaign last year they refused to back  but beyond healthcare  the kochs and their operatives have welcomed much of the fledgling administration s actions  including efforts to roll back federal regulations  the decision to pull out of the paris global climate accord  a veterans administration reform bill and the appointment of neil gorsuch to the supreme court  koch officials say their network has better access to the trump administration than they expected given past frictions  partly because former koch operatives have been hired in key administration jobs   overall  we ve made tremendous progress on the federal level that we haven t been able to make in the last  years   said james davis  a spokesman for freedom partners  a koch backed advocacy group  vice president mike pence has played a key role  meeting privately with charles koch on friday  as well as marc short  a former member of the koch network who is now trump s point man in congress   charles koch  addressing more than  supporters gathered at the broadmoor luxury resort in colorado for the event  touted the progress the organization is making  particularly since the  election   when i look at where we are   at the size and effectiveness of this network   i m blown away   he said   i m more optimistic now than ever   the koch brothers have been a force in american politics since the   their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on koch industries  the second largest privately held company in the united states with annual revenues of more than   billion from interests in energy  chemicals and other sectors   both trump and the koch network have incentives to build warmer ties  the kochs could end up spending hundreds of millions to preserve the republican majority in congress during next year s midterm elections  attendees to the weekend meeting had to donate at least    to be invited  koch funded groups such as freedom partners could also help build support among conservative activists for tax reform and other trump administration agenda items  during the  campaign  the kochs kept their distance from trump  charles koch spoke out against trump s proposed muslim registry  invoking a comparison to nazi germany  the network did not actively work to defeat trump during the republican primary  but when he secured the nomination  the group did not spend money backing him or criticizing democratic candidate hillary clinton  by contrast  the koch network spent more than   million in the  election to defeat president barack obama      for his part  trump lumped the kochs in with other special interest groups  boasting that he did not need their money and that they could not influence him  but the koch network began showing its clout in the spring when it worked with the white house to push the house of representatives healthcare bill in a more conservative direction      tim phillips  president of americans for prosperity  a koch advocacy group  teamed with pence and short  trump s legislative affairs director  to help get the measure through the house      pence is viewed as a trusted friend of the koch network  dating to his time as a congressman      at the meeting with charles koch on friday they discussed healthcare and tax reform  phillips and other koch aides said       short is a former pence aide and koch alumni  having run the koch political organization that became freedom partners  stephen ford  a speechwriter for pence  has worked for freedom partners      koch operatives were encouraged when the white house recently cooled to the idea of a tax on imports  the so called  border adjustment tax  advocated by house speaker paul ryan      americans for prosperity and freedom partners mounted a media and public pressure campaign against the border tax  phillips has met with treasury secretary steven mnuchin on the issue  mnuchin s chief of staff  eli miller  served as the ohio director of afp      mnuchin has since come out against the tax in meetings with members of congress  representative mark meadows of north carolina said at the donor retreat      on the veterans bill  koch group concerned veterans of america was able to work with one of their own  darin selnick  a former senior adviser to that group  is now a top aide to trump s secretary of veterans affairs david shulkin      that group is working with the white house on the more than  federal judicial vacancies trump must fill  partnering with conservative legal advocate leonard leo  who has become a trusted trump adviser on the issue      leo joined charles koch on stage at a donor event on saturday night  a koch group   concerned veterans of america  mounted a grassroots campaign to secure neil gorsuch s confirmation to the supreme court      yet some stark policy differences remain between the kochs and the trump administration      the kochs  who are proponents of criminal justice reform  are frustrated with the department of justice s effort to crack down on low level drug offenders  they also disagree with trump s hardline immigration stance      asked about the koch network s successes  a white house aide did not expressly address the network s goals  but said trump  has already made tremendous progress toward making our country prosperous and safe again       in interviews with attendees at the donor summit  opinions on trump were mixed  but even some critics found reason to praise the administration  several mentioned education secretary betsy devos  an advocate of charter schools and vouchers      other attendees were effusive in their praise of trump s actions so far       he s walks the walk   said al hartman  ceo of a property management firm in houston   he s doing exactly what everyone wants done
