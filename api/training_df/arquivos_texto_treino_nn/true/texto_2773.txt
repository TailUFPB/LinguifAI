washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump said on wednesday he did not fault his son donald trump jr  for meeting with a russian lawyer during the  presidential election campaign and that he was unaware of the meeting until a few days ago  asked if he knew that his son was meeting with lawyer natalia veselnitskaya in june last year  the president told reuters in a white house interview   no  that i didn t know until a couple of days ago when i heard about this    transcript highlights  reut rs   trump jr  eagerly agreed to meet the woman he was told was a russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about democratic rival hillary clinton as part of moscow s official support for his father s campaign  according to emails the son released on tuesday  seated at his oval office desk  trump said he did not fault his son for holding the meeting  writing it off as a decision made in the heat of an upstart  non traditional campaign   i think many people would have held that meeting   trump said    it was a  minute meeting  i guess  from what i m hearing   trump said   many people  and many political pros  said everybody would do that   the emails were the most concrete evidence that trump campaign officials might have been willing to accept russian help to win the nov   election  a subject that has cast a cloud over trump s presidency and prompted investigations by the u s  justice department and congress  donald trump jr   in an interview with fox news on tuesday  said   in retrospect  i probably would have done things a little differently   in the white house interview  the president said he directly asked russian president vladimir putin if he was involved in what u s  intelligence says was russian meddling in the presidential campaign and that putin had insisted he was not  trump said he spent the first  or  minutes of his more than two hour meeting with putin last friday in germany on the election meddling subject   i said   did you do it   and he said   no  i did not  absolutely not   i then asked him a second time in a totally different way  he said absolutely not   trump said  asked if he believed putin s denial  trump paused   look  something happened and we have to find out what it is  because we can t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process  so something happened and we have to find out what it is   he said  about putin  he added   somebody did say if he did do it  you wouldn t have found out about it  which is a very interesting point   while u s  intelligence agencies and even members of trump s cabinet have said russia meddled in the election  trump has wavered on the subject  at times suggesting that other actors might have been involved  trump equivocated on whether he felt he could trust putin  he said putin and chinese president xi jinping both look out for their countries  interests  as he looks out for u s  interests   i am not a person who goes around trusting lots of people  but he s the leader of russia  it is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth  i am the leader of the united states  i love my country  he loves his country   trump said  as in the past  trump said there was no collusion between his campaign and russia   there was zero coordination  it s the dumbest thing i ve ever heard   he said  the republican president said democrats had used the accusations to justify clinton s loss in november  saying   the white house is functioning beautifully despite the hoax made up by the democrats   although he and putin were able to forge a ceasefire agreement in part of syria  trump said their interests collided over other issues  he said his u s  military buildup and drive to increase u s  energy production were in direct conflict with putin  whose nation is dependent on energy exports  their differences made him wonder whether putin really had supported him last year  as many news reports have suggested   it s really the one question i wish i would have asked putin  were you actually supporting me
