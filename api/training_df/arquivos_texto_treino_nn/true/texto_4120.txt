new york  reuters    u s  president donald trump reassured manufacturers gathered in the white house roosevelt room on march  that a massive infrastructure program was coming soon   we re going to make it happen  this year  he said  according to drew greenblatt  the president of marlin steel in baltimore  who was present   that was actually the first thing that he talked about behind closed doors with us   greenblatt added  but putting a trillion dollar infrastructure program to work could be easier said than done  as some of the projects suggested to the administration underscore   project lists submitted by the north america s building trades unions and by an outside developer who helped with the transition both contain projects that infrastructure builders call  shovel ready   but  for a range of reasons  shovel ready does not always mean ready for shovels to break ground  that means any effort to jump start projects  put people to work and inject economic stimulus could drag on trump s promise for a  year    trillion infrastructure project after north america s building trades unions  nabtu  president sean mcgarvey met with trump on january   the group submitted a total of  bridge  pipeline and water projects  a second list of  projects was assembled by ohio developer dan slane  who assisted with the transition  including everything from inland waterways to ports to a new fbi headquarters  while details on trump s plans are scant  a senior administration official said they re looking for ways to shorten the lengthy permitting process   the current system has just lost its way   he said  nine projects have garnered the support of both slane and the nabtu  appearing on both lists  of those  seven have yet to start construction  and one has only done preliminary construction  highlighting how hard it is to launch infrastructure projects as quickly as trump wants to do   the shovel ready moniker that they put on projects  it s just rarely applicable   said bill miller  president and chief executive of two companies that overlap the two lists  the power company of wyoming llc is building the chokecherry and sierra madre wind energy project  and transwest express llc is developing the transwest express transmission project  crossing wyoming  colorado  utah and nevada   the chokecherry and sierra madre wind project  which is being built in part on federal land  took eight years and  tens of millions of dollars  before it could recently start construction  the transwest express transmission project is still waiting for several state level permits  miller said   to be shovel ready is incredibly expensive and time consuming   miller added  the administration says it wants to get ground broken fast  but some of that just might be out of the president s hands  such as state level permitting   a significant part of the president s infrastructure plan will focus on streamlining regulating and permitting so that it is easier for all viable projects to move forward in a timely manner  these reforms might not be driven by the hurdles facing a single project  but rather will create more certainty in the process overall   a white house spokesperson told reuters  the delays that have beset a desalination plant proposed by poseidon water  a developer of water related infrastructure  in huntington beach  california illustrate how clashing interests and regulations can hold up projects  poseidon first proposed the idea of a plant to turn salt water into drinking water for orange county in the late  and started permitting in the early   said scott maloni  a vice president at poseidon and the huntington beach project manager  the city of huntington beach originally approved the project in february   but poseidon still needed to secure  permits from state agencies  such as approval from the santa ana regional water quality control board for the plant s national pollutant discharge elimination system  which is required by the environmental protection agency   after the city issued the necessary local approvals in   project builder poseidon was able to apply to the california coastal commission   that application was amended several times over the years as the project evolved  for example  the plant had to alter its design after the state began phasing out power plants that use seawater for cooling purposes  poseidon had planned to desalinate that wastewater  and changed its design to instead take in water directly from the ocean instead  in   poseidon shelved the permit application after the state s coastal commission directed the company to look into concerns about the effects of the operation on fish larva in the area   the application was resubmitted in   and then withdrawn yet again in september   because the commission wanted proof the plans complied with new   passed rules from the state water board on desalination plants   that compelled poseidon to redesign the plant s seawater intake and discharge technologies  the project still needs three more approvals  from the state lands commission  the santa ana regional water quality control board and the california coastal commission  poseidon says they re confident they ll secure the last approvals soon  but even then  construction might not start until the second quarter of   maloni said  and the objections from environmentalists haven t stopped   the plant is  far from a done deal   said mandy sackett  the california policy coordinator for the surfrider foundation  the foundation argues that the plant is unnecessary  expensive and energy intensive  putting marine life at risk  sackett said the foundation will continue to fight the project    there s still several opportunities for public input and important regulatory review that is yet to be completed   she said
