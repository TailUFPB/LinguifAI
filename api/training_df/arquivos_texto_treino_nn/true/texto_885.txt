front royal  va   reuters    ralph and mike waller are such ardent backers of president donald trump that they help stage a counter protest every wednesday in front of their front royal  virginia  pawn shop  sparring with anti trump demonstrators who gather across the street   but ask them about ed gillespie  the republican candidate for virginia governor in next tuesday s election  and they show little enthusiasm    i would like somebody who s more closely aligned with trump   ralph waller  who is mike waller s uncle  said from the shop floor  racks of pawned rifles behind him   gillespie is  in fact  nothing like trump  a real estate magnate who had never before held political office  although both are members of the same party  gillespie is a washington lobbyist who worked in president george w  bush s white house  the kind of establishment mainstay trump bashed on the campaign trail   moreover  gillespie has largely kept his distance from trump  rarely mentioning him by name and notably not asking for trump s help in a tight race  but gillespie still needs voters like the wallers  trump  who lost virginia last year by  points to democrat hillary clinton  did best in rural areas such as the counties along virginia s mountainous spine  less so in urban areas  that tension has gillespie looking to thread the thinnest of needles  trying to appeal to voters turned off by trump while retaining enough of trump s passionate base to secure victory  should he win  gillespie might provide a blueprint for other republican candidates unsure how to campaign in an era when the president is popular with fewer than  percent of americans    if he manages to do this  he s shown how you engage trump voters while literally avoiding donald trump   said quentin kidd  a political scientist at christopher newport university in newport news  virginia  the virginia governor s race  one of only two in the country this year  is being watched nationally by political observers looking for clues about next year s midterm elections  in which democrats are seeking to seize one or both houses of congress   gillespie has been courting trump voters by focusing on what he says is the threat posed by illegal immigrants  a longtime trump campaign theme  he has criticized  sanctuary cities  and run ads warning of the street gang ms   which is largely composed of members from central america   he has also called for preserving confederate monuments following the clashes between white supremacists and protesters in august in charlottesville  virginia   once trailing significantly behind democrat ralph northam  the state s lieutenant governor  gillespie has risen in the polls since the ads began running regularly  kidd credits the spots for making the race competitive   sanctuary cities  gillespie told reuters in an interview  are  not going to make us safer    while virginia has no sanctuary cities  which often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce federal immigration laws  the issue arose earlier this year when a measure by the state s legislature to prohibit them was vetoed by democratic governor terry mcauliffe  but some argue gillespie is being too cautious  corey stewart  who ran against gillespie in the gubernatorial primary and garnered support from trump s base  said gillespie erred in not asking the president to campaign for him and in not doing more to harness the energy trump has stirred   he s put the president at a distance  and he has offended a lot of the president s supporters   stewart said   and it could cost him the election   trump has tweeted his support for gillespie  but that is as far as it has gone   gillespie said he appreciated trump s endorsement but declined to say whether he would ask for more  even parroting trump s own words in doing so    just like the president doesn t disclose his military strategy  we don t disclose our campaign strategy   he said   at a recent house party in fairfax county  virginia  just outside washington  gillespie mixed with a prosperous group of republicans who snacked on a catered spread and chatted about private schools  he spoke to them about traditional republican priorities such as economic growth and education reform   and never once mentioned trump  while referring to other politicians who  support him such as vice president mike pence and george w  bush   that s smart   said chris andreas  a great falls  virginia  resident who attended the event and said he believed trump had hurt the republican party  in   trump fared significantly worse in fairfax county than republican nominee mitt romney did four years earlier  there are more voters to be gained there than anywhere else in the state   the strategy s downside is that while democrats hold a large advantage in northern virginia  they are losing ground in rural areas   in warren county  where front royal is located  trump gained   votes more than romney largely by attracting wayward democrats  said stephen kurtz  a former chair of the county republican party  the pattern  he said  repeated across other counties in rural virginia   kurtz said he had heard grumbling over gillespie s washington background and worries some voters energized by trump may stay home    it is a hard sell  believe me   kurtz said
