washington  reuters    the united states on tuesday declined to name china as a currency manipulator although it remained critical of the chinese government s economic policies ahead of a planned visit to beijing by president donald trump  the semi annual u s  treasury currency report said no countries deserved the currency manipulator label  but it kept china on a currency  monitoring list  despite a fall in china s global current account surplus since   china s currency  the renminbi or yuan  also has strengthened sharply against the dollar this year  reversing three straight years of weakening  the treasury cited china s unusually large  bilateral trade surplus with the united states    treasury remains concerned by the lack of progress made in reducing the bilateral trade surplus   the department said in the report   china continues to pursue a wide array of policies that limit market access for imported goods and services   the u s  china trade deficit stood at    billion in august  near a two year high  four other trading partners which were on the monitoring list in april   japan  south korea  germany and switzerland   remained on the list  the administration said it was removing taiwan from the list because it had reduced the scale of its foreign exchange interventions  deputy governor ching long yang said taiwan s central bank will continue the currency dialogue with washington  south korea s finance ministry official in charge of currency markets said washington s decision was as expected  noting the shrinking trade surplus with the united states helped his country avoid the  currency manipulator  label   currency markets should be market oriented  and we conduct smoothing operations only in cases of sharp volatility   kim yoon kyung  director general at the ministry s international finance bureau  told reuters by phone  trump  who on the campaign trail blamed china for  stealing  u s  jobs and prosperity by cheapening its currency  had repeatedly promised to label the country as a currency manipulator on  day one  of a trump administration   a move that would trigger special negotiations and could lead to punitive duties and other action  but the president s comments on china have been less harsh since he took office in january  trump has said he would like beijing s help in pressuring north korea to abandon a nuclear weapons program  and plans to meet chinese president xi jinping on a trip to beijing in november  currency market analysts by and large had not expected the trump administration to take a hard line on the currency issue now in the context of the north korea tensions   there s a necessity for the best possible cooperation we can get out of china on the north korea issue  and labeling them a currency manipulator is probably not the best way to go about that   said joseph trevisani  chief market strategist at worldwide markets in woodcliff lake  new jersey  in addition  there are very specific criteria at the treasury for labeling someone a currency manipulator and over the past year and a half china simply does not fit those categories   as in its previous report on currencies in april  the treasury criticized china s past efforts to hold down the yuan s value  but it said more recent efforts by beijing to prevent a sudden depreciation of the yuan had probably helped the united states    a disorderly currency depreciation     would have had negative consequences for the united states  china and the global economy   the treasury said  in fact  after three years of depreciating against the dollar in which it weakened by more than  percent  the yuan this year has strengthened by nearly  percent  it was not yet trading following the report s release but the offshore yuan was little changed against the dollar  the treasury did not alter its three major thresholds for identifying currency manipulation put in place last year by the obama administration  a bilateral trade surplus with the united states of   billion or more  a global current account surplus of at least  percent of gross domestic product  and persistent foreign exchange purchases equal to  percent of gdp over  months   no countries were determined to have met all three of these criteria  treasury said a country would be put on the monitoring list if it met two of the criteria or if it accounted for a large and disproportionate share of the overall u s  trade deficit  it also said countries put on the list would stay there for at least two consecutive currency reports  to help ensure that any improvement in performance versus the criteria is durable
