washington  reuters    after failing to repeal obamacare  republicans in the u s  congress quickly pivoted on friday to president donald trump s next priority  overhauling the federal tax code  but their plan has already split the business community  division among republicans was the chief cause of the embarrassing setback on obamacare  and similar fault lines have been evident for months in the republicans  tax plan  mainly over an untested proposal to use the tax code to boost exports  house of representatives tax committee chairman kevin brady conceded the demise of a republican plan to roll back obamacare could make the path to tax reform harder   this made a big challenge more challenging  but it s not insurmountable   he told fox news after ryan canceled a vote on an obamacare rollback bill  but brady said he and house speaker paul ryan are all in on tax reform  brady said house republicans plan to begin moving on tax reform this spring and to pass legislation before congress s summer recess in late july   we re going to work with the administration to get this done   he said  trump has been unclear about his position on the most problematic feature of the house republicans  tax  blueprint   a proposal known as the border adjustment tax that would cut taxes on exports and raise them on imports   treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on friday that tax reform in many ways is  a lot simpler  than healthcare reform   we re able to take the tax code and redesign things and i think there is very  very strong support   mnuchin said at an event hosted by news website axios  comprehensive tax reform is a policy goal so complex that it has defied successive congresses and presidents since  when it was last accomplished under former president ronald reagan  the u s  tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes  many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit  such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility  brady s panel has been working on a plan since mid  that would cut the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent  end taxing foreign profits for u s  based multinationals and cut other tax rates for businesses and investors  the plan has divided businesses  prompting import dependent industries to warn of higher prices for consumer goods from clothing and electronics to gasoline  brady has been adamant that border adjustment will be part of the house tax reform  saying earlier this week that the provision was  a given  for final legislation but would include a transition period for import heavy industries
