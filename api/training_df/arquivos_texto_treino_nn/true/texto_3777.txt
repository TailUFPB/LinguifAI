seattle  reuters    u s  appeals court judges on monday questioned the lawyer defending president donald trump s temporary travel ban about whether it discriminates against muslims and pressed challengers to explain why the court should not defer to trump s presidential powers to set the policy  the three judge  u s  circuit court of appeals panel was the second court in a week to review trump s directive banning people entering the united states from six muslim majority countries  opponents   including the state of hawaii and civil rights groups   say that both trump s first ban and later revised ban discriminate against muslims  the government argues that the text of the order does not mention any specific religion and is needed to protect the country against attacks  in addressing the justice department at the hearing in seattle   circuit judge richard paez pointed out that many of trump s statements about muslims came  during the midst of a highly contentious  election  campaign   he asked if that should be taken into account when deciding how much weight they should be given in reviewing the travel ban s constitutionality  neal katyal  an attorney for hawaii which is opposing the ban  said the evidence goes beyond trump s campaign statements   the government has not engaged in mass  dragnet exclusions in the past  years   katyal said   this is something new and unusual in which you re saying this whole class of people  some of whom are dangerous  we can ban them all   the justice department argues trump issued his order solely to protect national security  outside the seattle courtroom a group of protesters gathered carrying signs with slogans including   the ban is still racist  and  no ban  no wall    paez asked if an executive order detaining japanese americans during the world war two would pass muster under the government s current logic   acting u s  solicitor general jeffrey wall  arguing on behalf of the trump administration  said that the order from the   which is now viewed as a low point in u s  civil rights history  would not be constitutional   if trump s executive order was the same as the one involving japanese americans  wall said   i wouldn t be standing here  and the u s  would not be defending it   judge michael daly hawkins asked challengers to trump s ban about the wide latitude held by u s  presidents to decide who can enter the country   why shouldn t we be deferential to what the president says   hawkins said   that is the million dollar question   said katyal  a reasonable person would see trump s statements as evidence of discriminatory intent  katyal said    in washington  white house spokesman sean spicer said at a news briefing that the executive order is  fully lawful and will be upheld  we believe that     the panel  made up entirely of judges appointed by democratic former president bill clinton  reviewed a hawaii judge s ruling that blocked parts of the republican president s revised travel order   the march order was trump s second effort to craft travel restrictions  the first  issued on jan    led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts  the second order was intended to overcome the legal problems posed by the original ban  but it was also suspended by judges before it could take effect on march    u s  district judge derrick watson in hawaii blocked  day entry restrictions on people from libya  iran  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  as well as part of the order that suspended entry of refugee applicants for  days  as part of that ruling  watson cited trump s campaign statements on muslims as evidence that his executive order was discriminatory  the  circuit previously blocked trump s first executive order   last week the  u s  circuit court of appeals in virginia reviewed a maryland judge s ruling that blocked the  day entry restrictions  that court is largely made up of democrats  and the judges  questioning appeared to break along partisan lines  a ruling has not yet been released  trump s attempt to limit travel was one of his first major acts in office  the fate of the ban is one indication of whether the republican can carry out his promises to be tough on immigration and national security  the u s  supreme court is likely to be the ultimate decider  but the high court is not expected to take up the issue for several months
