brussels berlin  reuters    on the eve of his trip to europe  rex tillerson gave a speech last week that european allies had waited months to hear  an  ironclad  promise of u s  support to its oldest allies  the relief in european capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a white house plan to oust the u s  secretary of state  plunging america s friends back into confusion over president donald trump s foreign policy  the uncertainty is particularly acute given washington s leading role in crises in north korea and syria   just as tillerson comes to brussels to give a public statement of support that the eu and nato have wanted all along  it seems he has no mandate  that the guillotine is hanging over his head   said an eu official involved in diplomacy with white house officials   it leaves europe just as doubtful as before about trump   u s  officials said on thursday the white house had a plan for cia director mike pompeo to replace tillerson but trump said on friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on saturday the reports were untrue  european leaders yearn for stability in u s  foreign policy  they are troubled by trump s  america first  rhetoric and inconsistent statements on nato and the european union  in addition  trump s decision to pull out of the paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify iran s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine european priorities   the chaos in the administration doesn t help in the current geopolitical climate   said a senior french diplomat  early last week  tillerson  a former exxon mobil chief executive  delivered a long address in support of europe in washington more akin to traditional u s  policy   the united states remains committed to our enduring relationship with europe  our security commitments to european allies are ironclad   he told a think tank   he said he would convey that message to the european union and nato  he is set to visit brussels on tuesday and wednesday  the organization for security and cooperation in europe in vienna on thursday and paris on friday  the question is whether european officials believe him  given tensions during his april visit to europe  when reuters reported tillerson initially planned to skip a nato meeting in brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies   if there were expectations that tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to trump  someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over american foreign policy   those expectations have been disappointed   said niels annen  foreign policy spokesman for germany s social democrats in parliament   on his watch  the state department has become a non actor   despite tillerson s pledge to reform the u s  foreign service  european governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the state department  with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration   the french have gone around tillerson to develop contacts with u s  secretary of defense jim mattis  white house national security adviser h r  mcmaster and white house chief of staff john kelly  while the eu s top diplomat federica mogherini has gone directly to vice president mike pence  berlin has focused on capitol hill  as well as kelly  mcmaster and mattis  yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on trump s foreign policy  diplomats said  there is hope that if pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the state department after tillerson  who is seen as ineffective  diplomats said  pompeo is an unknown quantity in europe but is viewed as closer to trump   we may be looking at a larger dose of trump at the state department   if pompeo did get the job  said thomas kleine brockhoff  head of the german marshall fund s berlin office  one european diplomat said tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the trump administration was hostile to iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line   so it never left tillerson much room   in addition  trump s son in law jared kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on middle east peace  but europeans see trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals  at a nato summit in brussels in may  the president publicly admonished european leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support  only to announce a jump in u s  military spending in europe months later  things may only become more unpredictable  diplomats say  european diplomats see tillerson and mattis as instrumental in talking trump out of making any rash decisions over north korea and its nuclear program  given administration comments about  utterly destroying  the country
