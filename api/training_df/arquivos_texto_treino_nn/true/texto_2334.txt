washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump grudgingly signed into law new sanctions against russia on wednesday  a move moscow said amounted to a full scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with the trump administration  congress overwhelmingly approved the legislation last week  passing a measure that conflicts with the republican president s desire to improve relations with moscow  trump signed the bill behind closed doors  without the fanfare that has customarily accompanied his signing of executive orders  he criticized the measure as infringing on his powers to shape foreign policy  and said he could make  far better deals  with governments than congress can  russian prime minister dmitry medvedev called the sanctions tantamount to a  full scale trade war   adding in a facebook post that they showed the trump administration had demonstrated  utter powerlessness    the hope that our relations with the new american administration would improve is finished   he wrote  trump s litany of concerns about the sanctions  which also affect iran and north korea  raised the question of how vigorously trump will implement them regarding russia   while i favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by iran  north korea  and russia  this legislation is significantly flawed   trump said in a message to lawmakers known as a signing statement  he also issued a statement for the press about the bill  the new law allows congress  which passed the measure to punish russia over interference in the  u s  presidential election and the annexation of ukraine s crimea  to halt any effort by trump to ease sanctions on russia   his hands were tied after the republican controlled congress approved the legislation by such a large margin last week that any presidential veto of the bill would have been overridden  the legislation provoked countermeasures by russian president vladimir putin  who said on sunday that the u s  diplomatic mission in russia must reduce its staff by  people  russia is also seizing two properties near moscow used by american diplomats  trump has repeatedly said he wants to improve relations with russia  that desire has been stymied by u s  intelligence agencies  findings that russia interfered to help the republican against democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton  u s  congressional panels and a special counsel are investigating  moscow denies any meddling and trump denies any collusion by his campaign  republican house of representatives speaker paul ryan welcomed the signing  saying it would send  a powerful message to our adversaries that they will be held accountable   in his statements on the sanctions law  trump complained about what he said was congressional infringement on the president s constitutional power to set foreign policy  saying the law reflected congressional  preferences  rather than a legal mandate   it is flagging those areas where the administration sees itself as having wiggle room to underenforce the law by citing claimed constitutional concerns   said harold koh  a yale law school professor who was a legal adviser to the state department during the obama administration  the house s top democrat  nancy pelosi  said the signing statement  raises serious questions about whether his administration intends to follow the law   trump said he was elected partly because of his successes in business  adding   as president  i can make far better deals with foreign countries than congress   trump s signing statement was the latest in a series of mixed signals from the administration on russia   i feel like there s several policies being implemented at once  and they re not very compatible with one another  this is one more   said olga oliker  a russia expert at the center for strategic and international studies  a think tank based in washington  vice president mike pence  touring baltic countries adjacent to russia  has followed a hawkish line  pence said trump s signing of the legislation would show that congress and the president were  speaking with a unified voice  on russia  however  secretary of state rex tillerson  like trump  has been critical of the legislation   the action by the congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did  neither the president nor i were very happy about that   tillerson said on tuesday  the sanctions will affect a range of russian industries and might further hurt russia s economy  already weakened by  sanctions imposed after the annexation of crimea  besides angering moscow  the legislation has upset the european union  which has said the new sanctions might affect its energy security and prompt it to retaliate if needed  several provisions of the law target the russian energy sector  with new limits on u s  investment in russian companies  american companies also would be barred from participating in energy exploration projects where russian firms have a stake of  percent or higher   the legislation includes sanctions on foreign companies investing in or helping russian energy exploration  although the president could waive those sanctions   it would give the trump administration the option of imposing sanctions on companies helping develop russian export pipelines  such as the nord stream  pipeline carrying natural gas to europe  in which german companies are involved
