 reuters    u s  environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt gave reuters a wide ranging interview on monday at his office in washington  discussing issues from climate science to automobile emissions   the following is a full transcript of the interview  reuters  you have said the epa will focus on a  back to basics  approach under your leadership  what does this mean for how epa enforces polluters  you have been critical of the idea of regulation by enforcement  pruitt  i think what i m speaking about there is a consent decree approach to enforcement  where you use judicial proceedings to actually engage in regulation  enforcement should be about existing regulations that you re actually enforcing against someone who may be violating that  very much in the prosecutorial manner  as attorney general   i lived that  there was a grand jury that i led  being a prosecutor  i understand very much the importance of prioritization  of enforcing the rule of law  of addressing bad actors  that s something we are going to do in a meaningful way across the broad spectrum of cases  whether it is in the office of air or the superfund area  or otherwise  reuters  do you want to see states play a bigger role in enforcing polluters  even though some have less of a capacity to do so   financially and personnel wise  pruitt  i think the state s role is really  when you look at this office working with states it should be how do we assist  how do we engage in compliance and assistance with states  the office  is called oeca  the office of enforcement  compliance and assistance  so those are the tools we have in the tool box to achieve better outcomes  so what we ought to be doing is working proactively with state deqs  to get their state implementation plans  timely submitted  provide assistance and technical support  drive a draft of state implementation plans and then actually work with them on how to achieve through those plans better outcomes and air and water quality  as far as enforcement is concerned we will actually work with states  we actually did that recently with colorado  there was an oil and gas company that was emitting some   tons  is that what it was  it was quite a bit  of  it was an ozone case  in any event  we joined with colorado in that prosecution  so sometimes states will do it  sometimes we will join with them  the importance is  in my view  that with respect to achieving good environmental outcomes  you need to use all of the tools in the toolbox to achieve that   compliance  assistance and enforcement   and use that enforcement in a meaningful impactful way to ensure that actions are addressed in a timely way  reuters  some of the pending settlements that are out there   harley davidson for example   where do they stand  and would you look at some of these previous settlements that were reached during the last days of the obama administration and revisit them  pruitt  well  i m not familiar with  i don t know the latest on the harley davidson case  my review predominantly has been with respect to the consent decrees that were being used to engage in regulation  there is a distinction there  i want to make sure i m saying that clearly  in one instance with respect to enforcement you have a regulation that has already been adopted and a standard that has to be met and a company that is not meeting the standard that was set by regulation  that is enforcement  this is what oeca should be working with the states to address  the part that has not been handled well over the past several years is the part where you have the epa sued by third party  not an enforcement mechanism  but sued by an ngo  and that ngo is asking the court to compel this agency to take certain steps  either through change in statute or time lines set by statute and then the agency will acquiesce through a consent decree changing the very statutory framework  that is regulation through litigation and that is inconsistent with the authority in my view of this agency  that has nothing to do with enforcement  reuters  what are some examples that are egregious  pruitt  there is a host of consent decrees that i ve inherited that we are evaluating on a case by case basis to see what authority we have to address those  but again  that is not enforcement that is completely under the banner of regulation by litigation  let me say to you that it is important because congress has said that as you engage in rulemaking you follow the administrative procedures act  which is you propose a rule  you take comment  you respond to that comment on the record  you make an informed decision and then you finalize the rule  the reason that is important is that is how you build consensus  that is how you hear from people at the state level  that is how you hear from states  that is how you hear from industry  all these various voices are heard in that process and you make a more robust and informed decision  and the merits of the rule  i think  are received better that way  and when you do it through one case  through litigation  and it is passed on to the rest of the country  voices are subverted in that process and it is not good decision making   reuters  with the cheat devises used by automakers to skirt epa vehicle emission standards  did you think that some of those penalties were too harsh  pruitt  look  what vw and fiat  you ve got this fiat case that is on the horizon as well  the emails and the communications that i m aware of  it was strategic and intentional and should be dealt with very aggressively  they knew very  very well what they did  i wouldn t call what was done too light at all  i m fact  i would tell you that as we look forward  what vw did was very  very troublesome and we need to make sure it doesn t happen again  reuters  will you model epa enforcement after what you did in oklahoma as attorney general  pruitt  it is a completely different role that i had as attorney general  in fact  as i said during my confirmation process  the ag is not the enforcement arm at the state level with respect to permitting  that is deq  the environmental unit that we set up in the previous administration was not set up to address enforcement  it was actually set up to address a nuisance claim that was filed against a company on poultry waste that we dealt with in other ways with the state of arkansas  long and short of it  the role that i have here is very different from the role  as it turned out we were not the front line enforcer  it was the deq and the state regulatory bodies  now we did provide assistance to them through general counsel  and they provided support and input to them  but as far as a standalone enforcement arm  that was handled by the individual agencies in the state of oklahoma  which is different than here   we have a robust  very important role of enforcement here  we are coordinating with the regions  making sure there is consistency across the regions i tried to explain it during the confirmation hearing  look at superfund  people don t usually equate that with enforcement  under the cercla statute  we have joint and several liability with respect to potential responsible parties  and a large percentage of our portfolio at the superfund is through responsible parties  private funding  i think the agency has not done the best job historically at holding those private parties accountable for the amount of waste and remediation that needs to take place  we have tremendous authority  i m going to have a very thoughtful and meaningful enforcement response to superfund to make sure that we are achieving good outcomes for citizens across the country with respect to that entire portfolio of   or so sites  again  that is not often thought about in terms of enforcement  we think about air  we think about permitting  but we don t often think about remediation under cercla and i think we have got a lot of room for improvement and opportunity to get accountability in that area  i ve got a report on my desk that spent thirty or so days  i m doing the task force recommendations right now  on how to better achieve accountability from enforcement across the board  reuters  but the administration s proposed budget for  proposes severe budget cuts across the board  including to superfund   pruitt  but there aren t  there aren t budget cuts across the board  we have a continuing resolution until the end of april that funded us around   billion or so  and congress is going through that process with respect to what the funding levels are going to be on superfund  so the fact that we have a proposed budget  congress is having that discussion and there haven t been any budget cuts taking place at this point and we re working with congress to make sure that there is adequate funding to address both the enforcement side and the superfund side  reuters  when you saw the president s budget proposal which called for a  percent cut to the epa budget  did it worry you  pruitt  i think there are certain parts of the agency that there is room for true legitimate cuts  and there are other parts of the agency where that is not the case   as it is in every department  but to take something like superfund and say that whatever the proposed budget was means that we can t do what we need to do as far as our reform and accountability is just simply not accurate  most of the challenges i ve seen from the superfund program have been related to attitude management leadership and less about money  but as i told congress during the budget and nomination process  if i determine that we need more moneys there  we ll ask congress  because that s the priority  enforcement and superfund are included in that category  when you re funding  million dollars you ve got room to cut  but i can tell you this  the core mission of the agency   improving air and water quality  addressing remediation as far as the superfund sites   those types of priorities   reuters  there have been reports about the epa launching what has been called a red team blue team review of climate change science  can you tell us more about this   will this lead to a re evaluation of the  endangerment finding that carbon dioxide endangers human health  pruitt  i m thinking about it  steve koonin  professor at nyu  did a very exciting piece in the wall street journal called red team blue team  i scheduled time with steve in my office the week that article came out  i didn t know it was coming out  so steve and i were meeting about some other things  and we didn t really focus on that  but i took the opportunity to talk to him about it and   we re considering it  i think the american people deserve and honest  open  transparent discussion  what do we know  what don t we know  does it pose an existential threat  what can be done about it  etc  there are lots of questions that have not been asked and answered  who better to do that than a group of scientists  red team scientists and blue team scientists getting together and having a robust discussion about that for all the world to see  so  i m not a scientist  i m an attorney  that does beg the question because there is a follow up question to that  which is what can be done about it  that is statutory and legal  but as i ve shared with senators in the confirmation process  congress has never responded to this issue  if you ask people that amended the clean air act in   including  congressman dingle  he is endlessly quoted as saying that if you try to regulate greenhouse gases under the clean air act of  that it would create  a glorious mess   so the clean air act was truly set up to address local and regional air pollutants  so  you hear often about the regulation of ghg and   but there has to be a determination of what can be done  what are the tools in the toolbox  if the tools are not in the toolbox to address this issue  i can t  and this agency can t  just simply make it up  we can t re imagine authority  the past administration tried to do that with its clean power plan  it was extraordinary what the supreme court did   it said a lot  it said the authority the previous administration was trying to say that they had in regulating carbon dioxide wasn t there  so there are two parts to this question  what do we know what don t we know  and two  what is the response the statutory response  the red team blue team is intended to be a response that provides answers to the american people  the american people deserve  in my view  an open transparent honest discussion about this issue   so we are contemplating being a part of that process  reuters  the consensus has been overwhelming that climate change has been caused by human beings  pruitt  that s not the question   it is not a question about whether the climate is warming  it is not a question about whether human activity contributes to it  it is a question about how much we contribute to it  how do we measure that with precision  and by the way  are we on an unsustainable path  and what harm   is it causing an existential threat  there is another great piece in the new york times by brett stephens  i think it was  that talked about the climate of complete certainty  his whole premise is that there is a basis of consensus we know but the politicians have done what  created an elasticity approach  they ve stretched it so far that it s reached a point where the credibility is being strained  that article  along with the red team blue team  i think those book end this approach where we have a discussion about that  some of the blue team scientists   they say oh we are not going to participate in that  why not  why don t you want to participate  it s like the new york yankees according to them  it s like the new york yankees playing a little league team  if you re going to win and if you re so certain about it  come and do your deal  they shouldn t be scared of the debate and discussion  that s what science is all about  that s what scientific debate is about  let s get red team scientists in  let s get blue team scientists in  let s let them question one another  that would be exciting to see  reuters  but what would it look like  pruitt  it s in its formative stages  the idea is a good idea because it s an idea that advances science  it advances discussion  it advances transparency  it advances for the american people to consume and participate through this debate because there is not consensus on this issue  how do we know that  there has been no policy response  that s why we haven t seen congress act because there has been such a question  it s not a question about whether warming is happening or whether we are contributing to it  that s not what we are debating  it s how much  to what degree  the precision of measurement  does it pose a meaningful threat  is it unsustainable  there is a host of questions that will be asked and answered during the process  it s exciting   reuters  but how would this be brought to the public  would you put it on television  pruitt   i think so  i think so  i mean  i don t know yet  but you want this to be open to the world  you want this to be on full display  i think the american people would be very interested in consuming that  i think they deserve it   reuters  how do you guarantee the objectivity of scientists  make sure there are no conflicts of interest  pruitt  that s why the red team blue team matters  steve modeled this after national security and defense    they kind of check one another  there is a consumption  an evaluation and interpretation  they will check one another    reuters  congress hasn t legislated on the endangerment finding  will this scientific review lead to a review of the endangerment finding  pruitt  you have the  massachusetts vs  epa ruling which most people misinterpret  mass vs  epa didn t say to the epa that you must regulate   what mass vs  epa said is that you must make a decision whether you regulate or not  you can t just simply not make a decision  that was whole thing about mass vs  epa  and then what happened in post script  what happened post script was in  with the endangerment finding but that was for mobile sources  that s another thing that important  the endangerment funding was focused on mobile sources  cars   and section    what the  clean power plan dealt with   was stationary sources  and they are separate requirements under section  of the clean air act  there are a lot of process  legal related issues here that the previous administration didn t comply with  but the endangerment finding is only on the mobile side  when i say congress hasn t responded  you ve had a court case and an endangerment finding and then you ve had an agency engage in regulatory response   by the way using tools currently in the clean air act   and failed twice  they tried to respond to the endangerment finding by regulating under section  and failed and failed with the uarg decision  with the tailoring rule   so the question is begged   what are the tools in the toolbox  i talked about that in my confirmation hearing  i ve talked about that with individual senators  it s something that congress has to ask and answer  we have no authority except that which congress gives us  we can t just simply make it up  the previous administration made it up with wotus   they re imagined authority in defining the waters of the united states to include things that included dry creek beds and puddles  it just went too far and the sixth circuit struck that down or put a stay in place and did the same with   this supreme court has been very  very clear that this agency  like any other agency in the federal government  can t simply re imagine authority and a large authority beyond the statutory text  the scientific review   the red team blue team discussion   is intended to have an open transparent debate about something that is a policy issue that is extremely important in this country that is not taking place  the endangerment finding in  was based on ipcc  information not on the science of this agency  the red team blue team is intended to provide that type of vehicle  mechanism  to have an open debate  discussion  reuters  so you might take a look at the endangerment finding  pruitt  that s not what this is about  what this is about is exactly what i described  reuters  let s move on to the california waiver  which allows california to set its own more stringent emissions standards for vehicles  is that something the epa will review or change  pruitt  it s not under review right now  reuters  will you review it in the future  pruitt  the governor of california and i have traded correspondence with respect to california s role   very important  congress has recognized it  they were regulating air quality before the clean air act was adopted in   which is why the california waiver exists  we ve reached out to the california governor as part of our cafe midterm review in   i m hopeful that the state of california  the governor there  will respond with reciprocity and we are working through that process  reuters  are there any meetings taking place now with automakers  pruitt  i don t know what conversations have taken place between automakers and california  the president and i were in detroit announcing that the midterm review was going to take place when it should have taken place which is april of   which is  months early  which occurred january this year  we restored process there and order there  we re going through the process now and we ve reached out to california and believe that it is important to have a holistic discussion with california and we re optimistic that they will respond with reciprocity  reuters  on the renewable fuel standard  how seriously is the epa taking the proposal by trump advisor and billionaire investor carl icahn to move the point of obligation  pruitt  as you know    comments were submitted  that was actually the process that began late in the last administration  we are still reviewing those comments  but the rfs is something   look  it s a statute that congress has passed  and congress   i take seriously the importance of enforcing a statute that congress has passed and there are some challenges to that statute as you know  there are targets that have been put in prescriptively in the statute such as billions of gallons of cellulosic being blended into the fuel supply when i think the last numbers we had as far as produced numbers are around  million that s actually production  that s a problem and it makes it tough administering the statute  i think whatever waiver authority we use we use it judiciously  tied to production and actual market demand  our job is to fulfill the objectives as best as possible of the statute and we re going to do that  the rvos  were supposed to be published every year in november  the past administration didn t do that timely   we are  we are going to have those out in november  we re on path to do that which is very good for people across the country to know what is expected of them  that s going to be done timely  we just released our proposed volume numbers and the preamble and in the language of the rvos we talked about production demand market realities with respect to those advanced fuels  we are seeking to do our job there in a very meaningful way  there is a lot of discussion on capitol hill about the statute and perhaps a bipartisan approach to update the statute because it actually expires in  and so there s a lot of discussion about trying to update the statute  it s well received here and i encourage congress to continue that  reuters  what is your strategy with your legal defense of your moves to undo the obama era rules  the d c  circuit court of appeals last week denied your bid to delay the obama administration s regulations on methane  pruitt  there are various authorities  that  methane case  was a case about our authority to stay certain rules  that s distinct from withdrawing rules  on wotus  we ve actually proposed a withdrawal  i signed that on june  on energy dominance week  i think that our section  stay that we used there was because we were up against the compliance time and try to use authority that we thought was well established  we are going to respond to that accordingly  but going forward  i think it was a case focused on the facts of that particular case  i don t think it says anything to us with respect to authority we have to stay under section  of the administrative procedures act or section  of the clean air act  those are well established procedures we have  we will use them accordingly as necessary  that s what we are doing on the clean power plan  we have a proposed rule to withdraw the cpp  what comes next is yet to be determined but what we do know with regards to that particular rule is that scotus has issued a stay against it which means there is a likelihood of success on the merits as far as it being inconsistent with statutory authority and so it s not wise of this agency to use resources to advance the defense of a rule that maybe deficient  we are going to withdraw that and see what our authority is  the tools in the toolbox on that particular issue  reuters  on paris and climate change  polls show younger people are more supportive of u s leadership on climate change  how do you explain your decision to a younger generation  pruitt  that s not what paris was about   i get what you re saying but here s the deal though  it was not about whether the u s  is going to continue leading on reducing our  footprint because paris didn t actually do that  paris was a bumper sticker  go back and read the articles about the criticism that was levied on the environmental left  they were very critical and dismissive of the paris agreement  you know why  because china didn t have to do anything until  and india conditioned all of their obligations upon receiving two and a half trillion dollars of aid  russia  india and china contributed  dollars to the green climate fund  people have short memories there  we are already at pre  levels and we exited kyoto in  and from  to  we reduced our  foot print by  plus percent  that s better than others across the globe  when people really want action and meaningful outcomes with regards to this  we are doing it   we are at pre  levels  paris was not in my view   it shouldn t be symbolic or optical with respect to whether progress or no progress is being made in  reduction  reuters  what do you think about the argument some major fossil fuel companies like exxon and cloud peak energy  coal company  made that it is better for the us to remain in the paris agreement because it gives them a competitive advantage  i don t understand that argument  i just simply don t understand that argument because if they are saying that the technology that is being developed domestically that we are not going to be able to export and other countries will be interested in  where is the evidence of that  china is still building coal facilities to the tune of almost one a day  they had  planned and they have scaled that back  india is going to continue burning coal   what we ought to be doing is exporting technology and innovation to help them do it cleaner  it is not the job of this agency and it shouldn t be the job of any regulatory body to force or pick winners and losers in the energy mix  we need fuel diversity as far as the generation of electricity because you can only get so much natural gas through the pipelines  so if there is an attack on your infrastructure with regards to the pipes and how natural gas is delivered to generate electricity  what do you do  you have to have a solid amount of hydrocarbons   coal stored on site   that allows you to address peak demand  if gdp growth is going to continue at  percent  then you ve got to have  diversity  it s energy security across the board  it s unwise in business to have one client or two clients  it s unwise in electricity to have one source or two sources  in oklahoma    percent of our electricity is wind generated  this is an all of the above approach and epa should not get in the business of foisting upon the markets decisions to say don t burn fossil fuels  the past administration was unapologetic  that s not what regulation should be about  now paris  paris was a bad business deal for this country at the end of the day  it put us at an economic disadvantage  the us has never been about agreeing to targets  in this case      percent  in this instance  every rule that the previous administration adopted their entire climate action plan   fell  percent short  it was failed from the very beginning  so why did they go to paris and agree to   percent targets  because it provided exposure domestically  third party groups   ngos   could sue this agency and say you need to do more under section  of the clean air act    so there was legal exposure and we were already leading the world with respect to  reduction  to interpret the president   who said by the way engagement  renegotiate or another agreement   but the paris agreement is bad for this country and doesn t achieve good environmental outcomes  we have nothing to be apologetic about with regards to what we are already going  it was absolutely a decision of courage and fortitude and truly represented an america first strategy with respect to how we are leading on this issue  germany is burning more coal  reuters  didn t the us position on paris isolate the united states at   pruitt  the past administration was all about words  this administration is all about action  look at the actions this country has taken  we have reduced our greenhouse gas levels to pre  levels primarily through technology and innovation  not through government mandate  we have nothing to be apologetic about with the rest of the world  and if we really want to do something about reducing the  footprint  then hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling need to be exported to china and india and europe because that has created the greatest reduction in   and nuclear  why is germany going away from nuclear  they are abolishing their nuclear portfolio and increasing what  their  emissions  why doesn t anyone talk to chancellor merkel about that  reuters  do you ever talk to your kids about climate change  do they agree with you  pruitt  my kids are wonderfully talented individuals and their world view is wonderful  they look at these issues in a smart way and i think they would probably echo the things that i have shared
