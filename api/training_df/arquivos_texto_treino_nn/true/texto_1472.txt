 washington  reuters    in the first two months after a june supreme court ruling allowed partial implementation of president donald trump s travel ban  visas issued on average each month to citizens of six countries targeted by the order were  percent lower compared to the month prior to the ban  a reuters analysis of government data shows   the   visas issued in july and   visas issued in august to citizens of the six majority muslim countries were down from   issued in june  the july figure was lower than the monthly average at any point since   when an average of   visas per month were issued to those countries   the lower july and august numbers were especially noteworthy  immigration attorneys say  because a larger number of visas are typically issued in the summer months  as foreign students prepare to arrive in the united states for the fall semester    we are processing visa applications for nationals of the six affected countries as directed by the executive order and to the extent permitted by court decisions   a state department official said on condition of anonymity when asked about the lower numbers   the decline comes on top of already plummeting figures for u s  visas issued to citizens of iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen after trump issued an executive order in late january halting entry of travelers from those countries for  days   that order  and a more limited form of the ban issued in march  were hamstrung by months of legal challenges until the supreme court approved a limited version in june  but in the interim  the state department issued far fewer visas to travelers from those six countries compared to the number issued in  under the administration of president barack obama   on sunday  trump issued a third version of the ban  which indefinitely restricts travelers from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  certain government officials from venezuela will also be barred   from march through june  a period when trump s order was mostly blocked by the courts  citizens of the six countries were issued an average of   visas monthly   percent fewer than the  monthly average of    according to state department data  after the supreme court ruling  that monthly average was  percent lower than in     for a graphic of visas issued to six countries affected by the travel ban  see tmsnrt rs    trump s initial travel ban  which barred citizens of the six countries as well as iraq  sparked chaos and protests at airports around the united states  issued with little forewarning  the order s scope was unclear and sowed confusion among travelers as well as authorities responsible for implementing it  courts quickly enjoined the main parts of the order  trump eventually issued a new order that excluded iraq and delayed its enactment to allow the administration and travelers time to prepare   but that order  too  was soon blocked by courts  the case eventually reached the supreme court  which allowed a limited version of the ban affecting only those citizens of the six countries lacking  bona fide  ties to the united states  after trump issued the revised ban on sunday  the supreme court canceled oral arguments scheduled  for oct   to decide whether or not the earlier version of the ban was discriminatory   even as sharply fewer visas were being issued  the president often complained on social media and in speeches about limits imposed by u s  courts on the two executive orders establishing the travel ban    the travel ban into the united states should be far larger  tougher and more specific but stupidly  that would not be politically correct   trump tweeted on sept      follow trump s impact on energy  environment  healthcare  immigration and the economy at the trump effect www reuters com trump effect   because the state department only releases data on how many visas are issued and not total application numbers  it is unclear if the drop is due to fewer people applying  or because the administration is denying more applications   in addition  a month by month comparison with prior years is not possible because the state department released only annual numbers   not monthly data   until march of this year   stephen pattison  a former u s  consular official and now an immigration attorney  said he suspects that the huge drop in visas issued is due to fewer people applying rather than higher rejection rates    quantifying the chilling effect of the trump administration s policies on the international public is hard to do  but i think that s the biggest impact of what this administration has done   pattison said   this atmosphere is causing bona fide  legitimate travelers to think twice about coming to the united states    michael boos  general counsel for the conservative nonprofit citizens united  which filed a brief to the supreme court in support of the trump administration in the travel ban case  said the figures show the ban is having its intended effect    clearly the purpose of the temporary ban was to reduce the number of visas that would be issued to persons from the affected countries  so it s not surprising that   when the court reinstated the ban  the number of visas would have dramatically diminished   boos said   if people are deterred from seeking admission to the united states because they re going to go through a vetting process that s real and substantial  then maybe they shouldn t be coming here in the first place     this version of the story corrects penultimate paragraph spelling to michael
