washington  reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions on thursday brushed off sharp criticism from president donald trump over his recusal from the justice department s russia investigation  saying he loved his job and planned to continue serving   we love this job  we love this department  and i plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate   sessions said at a news conference announcing a cyber crime bust  sessions was flanked by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and acting federal bureau of investigation director andrew mccabe  who were both also criticized by the president in an interview with the new york times on wednesday  trump took a broad swipe at his administration s top law officers in the interview  saying he would not have appointed sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself  the republican president also noted rosenstein s connection to democratic baltimore and that mccabe s wife took money from a leading democrat during a political campaign  the public lashing came after a turbulent first six months in office during which trump fired national security adviser michael flynn and fbi director james comey  then the top official leading the probe into whether russian meddled in the  presidential election and possible ties to the trump campaign   sessions recused himself in march from the russia criminal investigation  he did so after failing to disclose at his confirmation hearing that he had held meetings last year with russia s ambassador   sessions should have never recused himself and if he was going to recuse himself  he should have told me before he took the job and i would have picked somebody else   the times quoted trump as saying  white house spokesman sarah sanders said later on thursday that  while trump was disappointed in the recusal   clearly he has confidence in him or he would not be the attorney general   sessions was trump s first supporter in the u s  senate and helped shape his political team throughout the campaign and into the transition after the nov   election  he declined on thursday to acknowledge trump s criticism   i have the honor of serving as attorney general  it s something that goes beyond any thought i would have ever had for myself   sessions said  similarly  rosenstein declined to comment when asked about trump s remarks that there were very few republicans in baltimore  where he was a former federal prosecutor   i was proud to be here yesterday  i m proud to be here today  i ll be proud to work here tomorrow   he said  they took only a few questions before a spokesman asked if there were any questions about the department s dismantlement of alphabay  a  dark web  market  seeing no hands  sessions left as reporters shouted questions about whether he would resign    an aide to sessions said the recent disparaging remarks from trump are  nothing new   given news media reports last month that the president was upset with the attorney general over the russia recusal  a federal special counsel has been appointed to take over the russia investigation  and several congressional committees are conducting probes  next week  trump s son in law and white house adviser  jared kushner  and the president s eldest son  donald trump jr   are scheduled to testify before senate panels  as well as former trump campaign manager paul manafort  the kremlin says it did not interfere in the election  and trump has denied any collusion  in the times interview  the president also took aim at the special counsel appointed to take over the russia investigation  robert mueller  saying mueller would be crossing a  red line  if he began investigating trump s personal finances    i think that s a violation  look  this is about russia   trump told the times   at the white house  sanders said trump has no intention of firing mueller at this time  the times also reported on wednesday that deutsche bank ag  dbkgn de  has been in contact with federal investigators about trump s accounts  citing two people briefed on the matter  and the bank was expecting to eventually have to provide information to mueller  they said  deutsche bank  which has loaned the trump organization family business millions of dollars for real estate ventures  late last month rejected demands by democratic lawmakers in the u s  house of representatives to provide details of trump s finances  citing privacy laws  on capitol hill  the senate judiciary committee approved  trump s pick to replace comey at the fbi  christopher wray  the full senate was expected to confirm wray before its august recess  democratic senator dick durbin said at the hearing that trump s latest comments raised troubling questions about the independence and credibility of the justice department   now what happens next as members close to the president  his own administration  and his family are being asked critical questions   durbin asked   we have to make it clear that no one in this country  including the president of the united states  is above the law
