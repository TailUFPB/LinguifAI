boston  reuters    a proposed massachusetts ballot initiative that would allow voters to require u s  presidential candidates to release their tax returns cleared a key hurdle on wednesday  as state lawmakers mulled a similar bill after president donald trump declined to release his returns  the state s attorney general  maura healey  a democrat  certified the initiative petition along with  others covering a variety of topics as having met constitutional requirements for ballot questions  the proposed massachusetts law would require candidates for u s  president and vice president to submit to the state s secretary copies of their federal income tax returns for the last six years that could then be made public  certification of the petitions means backers can begin collecting the tens of thousands of signatures needed to get their questions onto the november  ballot  healey s office said her decision did not mean she supported the petitions  the election related initiative came after trump  a republican  last year became the first major presidential candidate since the  to not voluntarily release at least some of his tax returns  healey s certification of the petition came as state lawmakers held a committee hearing and took testimony on a bill that would require u s  presidential candidates to also disclose their tax returns in order to get onto the ballot  senator michael barrett  the bill s democratic sponsor  in an interview said the bill had  a lot of grassroots interest   and was receiving support from march forward mass  which formed after the women s march protest held in january a day after trump was inaugurated  william galvin  the democratic secretary of state  testified in support of the bill  saying the public disclosure of tax returns is needed in order for voters to know about a candidate s potential conflicts of interest   this bill is not about donald trump   he said   it s because of donald trump   barrett acknowledged such a law could be subject to lawsuits  the u s  constitution sets out qualifications to become president  and critics could argue the state s law would unconstitutionally do the same  but galvin testified that he believed that a law requiring tax returns  disclosures could survive a legal challenge as states have a right to set conditions to get on their ballots  similar proposals are being considered in other states  republican new jersey governor chris christie in may vetoed a bill that would have required the disclosure by presidential candidates of tax returns  calling it  politics at its worst
