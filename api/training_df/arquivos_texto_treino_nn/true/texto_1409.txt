 reuters    a bipartisan group of u s  lawmakers unveiled legislation on wednesday that would overhaul aspects of the national security agency s warrantless internet surveillance program in an effort to install additional privacy protections  the bill  which will be formally introduced as soon as thursday  is likely to revive debate in washington over the balance between security and privacy  amid concerns among some lawmakers in both parties that the u s  government may be too eager to spy on its own citizens  the legislation  written by the house of representatives judiciary committee  is seen by civil liberties groups as the best chance in congress to reform the law  known as section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  before its expiration on dec    senior u s  intelligence officials consider section  to be among the most vital tools they have to thwart threats to national security and american allies   it allows u s  intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states  but the program  classified details of which were exposed in  by former nsa contractor edward snowden  also incidentally scoops up communications of americans  including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas  those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant by the federal bureau of investigation  a discussion draft of the legislation  a copy of which was seen by reuters  partially restricts the fbi s ability to access american data collected under section  by requiring the agency to obtain a warrant when seeking evidence of a crime  that limit would not apply  however  to requests of data that involve counterterrorism or counter espionage  the narrower restriction on what some have called a  backdoor search loophole  has disappointed some civil liberties groups  several organizations sent a letter this week saying they would not support legislation that did not require a warrant for all queries of american data collected under section   the legislation would also renew the program for six years and codify the national security agency s decision earlier this year to halt the collection of communications that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target  but that codification would end in six years as well  meaning nsa could potentially resume the activity in    the spy agency has said it lost some operational capability by ending so called  about  collection due to privacy compliance issues and has lobbied against a law that would make its termination permanent   republican senators introduced a bill earlier this year to renew section  without changes and make it permanent  a position backed by the white house and intelligence agencies  but that effort is expected to face major resistance in the house  where an influential conservative bloc of republicans earlier this year said it opposed renewal unless major changes were made  reflecting disagreement within the majority party   separately  senators john cornyn  the no   republican in the chamber  and democratic senator dianne feinstein are working on section  legislation that may also be introduced this week and include fewer reforms  democratic senator ron wyden and republican senator rand paul are also planning to introduce a bill that would require a warrant for any query of section  involving data belonging to an american
