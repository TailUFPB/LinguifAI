 reuters    president donald trump s personal lawyer s legal arguments in defense of the president s tweets about former u s  national security advisor michael flynn have been greeted with some skepticism by legal experts  in seeking to explain a trump tweet on saturday lawyer john dowd told reuters on sunday that he wrote and  bollixed up  the president s tweet in which trump said he fired michael flynn for lying to the fbi and not just misleading u s  vice president mike pence   some observers have said the tweet showed trump knew flynn had committed a crime and sought to obstruct justice by  among other actions  firing then fbi director james comey   dowd denied trump knew flynn had lied to the fbi  but raised new questions by also providing a further account of the january meetings in which former acting u s  attorney general sally yates warned white house counsel don mcgahn that flynn was a security risk because he had lied about his conversations with former russian ambassador sergey kislyak  according to dowd  yates told mcgahn that flynn said the same thing to the fbi as he did to pence but yates did not convey that flynn was facing criminal prosecution  dowd said mcgahn reported the conversation to trump in that manner   you may conclude that s a lie  but the department of justice  that had the power to charge  did not   dowd said   the first time the president knows for a fact this guy lies was when he was charged   but several lawyers said  regardless of whether yates explicitly said flynn lied to the fbi  the white house counsel should have seen that possibility and communicated it to the president   it s not every day that the acting attorney general comes over to the white house with that sort of message   said alex whiting  a former federal prosecutor now teaching at harvard law school   it had to have been obvious to mcgahn that flynn probably lied to the fbi whether yates said it or not   michael gerhardt  a law professor at the university of north carolina  called dowd s argument  a stretch  but said there might be a  bit of credibility  in the idea that mcgahn might have been waiting for more clarity before informing the president about flynn s criminal liability  neither yates nor mcgahn could be reached for comment on monday  dowd also declined requests for further comment on monday  yates  testimony in may before a senate committee  in which she said she declined to answer mcgahn when he asked about flynn s fbi interview  appears to conflict with dowd s account  according to a person familiar with the matter  yates never said  that flynn told fbi agents the same thing he told pence  dowd said he stood by his version of events  flynn pleaded guilty last friday to a charge of lying to the fbi brought by special counsel robert mueller  who is leading a probe into alleged russian interference in the  election and possible obstruction of justice by the trump administration  russia has denied meddling in the  u s  election and trump has denied any collusion took place between russia and his election campaign  dowd also argued on sunday that trump could not commit the crime of obstruction of justice because  he s the chief law enforcement officer of the u s   former prosecutor robert ray said there was some merit to the argument that trump could not obstruct justice by firing comey because he had the power do so  but several other lawyers took issue with dowd s comments  noting president richard nixon faced impeachment for obstruction of justice prior to his resignation over the watergate scandal   it s a patently absurd argument   said andrew wright  a former white house lawyer under president barack obama   the president as the chief executive sits on top of the org chart  but he has to take care to see that the law is followed
