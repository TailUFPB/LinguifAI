washington  reuters    two u s  senators from both parties are close to finalizing a bipartisan deal to shore up the health insurance exchanges created under obamacare  the chamber s top democrat said on thursday  the move  which senate democratic leader chuck schumer said was  on the verge  of completion  would stabilize the market for individuals who buy their own insurance plans on the federal or state based exchanges  the potential agreement comes after republicans have repeatedly failed to carry out their years long pledge to repeal and replace the  affordable act  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare overhaul  schumer said senate health  education  labor and pension committee chairman lamar alexander  a republican  and ranking democrat patty murray had resurrected a bipartisan approach  which had been cast aside amid the latest near vote on a repeal bill  alexander and murray had been working to protect the government payments made to insurers to help reduce medical expenses for low income americans enrolled in obamacare  alexander also wanted states to have more flexibility to design insurance plans under the program   they both inform me that they re on the verge of an agreement  a bipartisan healthcare agreement to stabilize markets and lower premiums   schumer said on the senate floor on thursday   the pact could buoy health insurance companies  which came out forcefully against the republican repeal effort and have faced uncertainty since the november election of republican president donald trump  who vowed to sink the law  while the majority of insured americans receive coverage through their employers or government programs such as medicare and medicaid  more than  million people have individual plans through the online exchanges  and about  million are expected to sign up next year   most of these consumers receive income based tax credits and subsidies to reduce costs  insurers have filed their premium rates for   many of which are expected to rise at least  percent because of uncertainty that the government will continue paying some of those subsidies      despite those worries  insurers on wednesday signed contracts with the government that will result in every u s  county having at least one company selling obamacare plans  trump has signaled that his administration would take other action to unwind the law  and on wednesday said he would sign an order next week allowing people to buy insurance coverage across u s  state lines  republican senator rand paul  who has been pushing for the move  says trump can do this by legalizing nationwide health associations that individuals could then join
