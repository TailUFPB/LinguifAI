washington  reuters    a republican controlled committee of lawmakers approved a bill on tuesday to allow a congressional audit of federal reserve monetary policy  a proposal fed policymakers have opposed and which faces an uncertain path to final approval   democrats uniformly spoke against the proposal during a meeting of the house of representatives committee on oversight and government reform  suggesting the bill would face stronger resistance than in the past    we should not in any way hinder their independence   said representative carolyn maloney  a new york democrat  echoing the sentiment of fed policymakers who say they could come under political pressure to avoid making unpopular decisions such as raising interest rates to slow growth and control inflation   the next step for the bill would be a floor vote by the entire house  where republicans hold a solid majority  republican president donald trump expressed support for audits of the u s  central bank during his election campaign  but it remained unclear whether the white house would back the proposal  republicans proposed numerous bills during the obama administration to open the fed up to deeper scrutiny  arguing the added transparency would ensure the fed was accountable and free of outside influence   currently  the fed publishes detailed audits of its finances but it keeps the inner workings of its monetary policy deliberations secret  publishing transcripts of policy meetings only with a five year lag  the proposal approved on tuesday would  put an end to that reign of secrecy   said representative thomas massie  the kentucky republican who submitted the bill  the house has already passed versions of the bill twice  with dozens of democrats joining nearly unanimous republican support in  and   those versions of the legislation died in the senate  republicans control both houses of congress but only have a narrow majority in the senate   representative stephen lynch of massachusetts was among democrats who voted in favor of similar legislation in  and  but came out against the current proposal  saying it could lead to political interference at the fed  lynch said he hoped a compromise could be found that increased transparency at the fed  such as by requiring it to publish transcripts of policy meetings two years after they take place
