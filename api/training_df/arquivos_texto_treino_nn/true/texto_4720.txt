washington  reuters    in the middle of a confused three day scramble by u s  republicans to save their plan to dismantle obamacare  president donald trump telephoned a former small town sandwich shop owner from the north carolina mountains on wednesday afternoon  representative mark meadows took the call during a meeting of the freedom caucus  a conservative faction of the house of representatives he chairs  his talk with trump thrust meadows into the eye of a legislative storm that led to a pivotal vote on the bill being postponed  then  late on thursday after trump demanded action by the house  a final vote was set for friday  through it all  meadows has been a key player in trump s first major legislative initiative  an effort as chaotic and unpredictable as his campaign for the white house  with its ultimate outcome still in doubt late on thursday night  after promising for months as a candidate to repeal and replace obamacare  trump has still not produced his own plan to do so  choosing instead to support a rollback bill drafted by senior house republicans  including house speaker paul ryan  financial markets have watched the drama over the bill nervously  concerned that defeat or delay for it could undermine trump s ability to carry through on promises to cut taxes and reduce regulation that have lifted u s  stocks for weeks  in a schism among republicans who now control congress and the white house  moderates oppose ryan s bill  saying it goes too far  the non partisan congressional budget office has estimated it would result in  million fewer americans having insurance by  than if obamacare remained in place intact  meadows and the freedom caucus don t like it either  but for very different reasons  making a compromise challenging  they say it doesn t go far enough to repeal the healthcare law put in place in  by former democratic president barack obama   to deal with this problem  trump stepped in personally earlier this week to try to win over meadows and his maverick conservative faction  according to interviews with dozens of lawmakers and congressional aides  but  even after marathon phone calls and meetings at the white house  trump  who prides himself as a master negotiator  failed to secure the deal  meadows told reporters on thursday night he still opposed the bill  but was optimistic that a deal could be reached   i am still a no   he said  taking basically the same position he took on wednesday afternoon after his phone call with trump  when he embraced ryan s bill and then decided to intervene to try to save it  trump opted for a strategy in which he would concentrate on winning over meadows and the conservatives  ryan and house leaders would deal with  everybody else   republican representative tom rooney said thursday  that strategic approach soon had embarrassing consequences  trump s push began in earnest on tuesday  when he visited capitol hill seeking support for the plan among republicans  on wednesday  the house rules committee held marathon meetings to finalize the bill that would go to the floor  after his wednesday phone call with the president  meadows spent much of wednesday night negotiating with trump  said a republican lawmaker   mark meadows has been at the white house more in the last  hours than any other times in his life combined   said one conservative lobbyist with knowledge of internal discussions  as meadows and other freedom caucus members such as representative jim jordan negotiated with trump  more and more right wing amendments were added to the bill to placate conservatives  the conservative concessions hurt moderates   the vast majority of us in the republican conference have been left out of these discussions   representative bradley byrne said thursday   that is a growing problem for our leadership and i think it s a growing problem for the chances of this bill   at some point  ryan himself balked when he learned of the agreements struck between trump and the conservatives  according to the conservative lobbyist  setting in motion a frantic push to save a vote on the bill that had been set for thursday  by late afternoon  that rescue effort had collapsed and the vote was scrapped  trump responded forcefully  dispatching top white house lieutenants to a meeting with lawmakers with a clear message  the president was done negotiating  the message was  it s done tomorrow or obamacare stays   said republican representative chris collins  with that  lawmakers announced that a decisive vote on the bill would be held on friday afternoon  earlier  even as the vote that had been set for thursday was falling apart  trump was meeting with trucking industry representatives and gleefully climbed into the cab of an  wheeler  he said then that everyone would find out in a couple of hours whether republicans had enough votes to pass the healthcare bill  unaware that the vote had already been delayed
