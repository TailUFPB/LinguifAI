berlin  reuters    she is controlled and cautious  a physicist from east germany who takes her time making decisions and has never relished the attention that comes from being europe s most powerful leader  he is a wealthy real estate magnate from new york who shoots from the hip and enjoys the spotlight  it is hard to imagine two leaders more different  in style or substance  than angela merkel  the german chancellor  and donald trump  the new president of the united states  for months  they have been engaged in an uneasy long distance skirmish over policy and values  on friday  they meet for the first time   a high stakes encounter that will be watched by governments around the world for clues about the future of the transatlantic alliance  a partnership that has helped shape the global order since world war two but which trump is threatening to upend   do i think they are going to become good friends  probably not  they are very different personalities   said charles kupchan  who advised trump s predecessor barack obama on european policy as a member of the national security council   but i do think they have a strong interest  both politically and strategically  in learning how to work together  it is arguably the most important meeting with a foreign leader of trump s presidency   german officials say the detail oriented merkel    has been preparing assiduously for her trip  the meeting  initially due on tuesday  was postponed until friday due to a severe winter storm expected in washington  she has watched trump s speeches and pored over his interviews  including a lengthy q a with playboy magazine from  in which he floats many of the controversial ideas he is now trying to implement as president  they say  members of her entourage have also analyzed trump s encounters with other leaders   including britain s theresa may  japan s shinzo abe and canada s justin trudeau   and have had exchanges with some of their counterparts on how to handle the unpredictable former reality tv star  the officials added    we have to be prepared for the fact that he does not like to listen for long  that he prefers clear positions and does not want to delve into details   said one senior german official   on both economic and foreign policy  the divide between the two leaders appears vast  trump    has called merkel s decision to allow hundreds of thousands of refugees into germany a  catastrophic mistake   he has threatened to impose tariffs on german carmakers that import into the u s  market  and he has criticized berlin for not spending more on defense  a longstanding u s  complaint that merkel has promised to address  another source of tension is germany s  billion euro trade surplus with the united states  trump adviser peter navarro has accused germany of gaining unfair trade advantages through a weak euro  merkel and her ministers have pointed out that the european central bank   and not berlin   controls the fate of europe s single currency  russia will also be on the agenda  white house officials have said trump will seek advice from merkel on how to deal with russian president vladimir putin   for her part  merkel has been critical of trump s travel ban targeting the citizens of several mainly muslim countries  in a phone call in january  she explained to trump that the geneva convention obliges signatories  including the united states  to take in war refugees on humanitarian grounds  merkel is also concerned that trump  who has repeatedly praised britain s decision to leave the european union  might continue to undermine the bloc with his rhetoric at a time of deep crisis triggered by the rise of anti eu populist parties   europe is in a very fragile  precarious state and germany is trying to ensure that the european integration project holds together  i suspect the chancellor will want to make this clear to the president   said anthony gardner  who served as u s  ambassador to the european union until january   this is an opportunity to sketch out areas of common interest  to define a positive agenda   he added   but one meeting won t change the atmosphere on its own    trump is the third u s  president that merkel  europe s longest serving leader  has worked with  she established a good rapport with george w  bush  who was keen to repair ties with germany after his clash with merkel s predecessor gerhard schroeder over the iraq war  and although relations with obama got off to an awkward start when merkel rebuffed his request to speak at the brandenburg gate during the  presidential campaign  the two grew close over time  cooperating on sanctions against russia and launching negotiations on a transatlantic free trade deal   the parting is hard for me   merkel acknowledged when obama visited berlin in november  a week after trump s victory  the german leader will be walking a fine line in washington  with an election looming at home in september  she must avoid offering her political opponents ammunition by cozying up to trump  neither can she afford an open confrontation that might damage german interests  one of the biggest concerns in the chancellor s camp before the visit is the potential for surprises  japan s abe had an awkward  second handshake with trump  while may was criticized in some sections of the british media for holding hands with trump during a stroll at the white house  apparently after he reached out to steady himself  when israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu met trump last month  he and his team spent the day before running through endless scenarios  lines of questioning and role plays to ensure they were prepared for any scenario  but in the end  they were still taken aback when trump spoke off the cuff at their news conference on the sensitive issues of settlements and a future palestinian state  merkel has admitted to being so uncomfortable with surprises as a child that she drew up her christmas wish list months in advance to avoid being caught off guard by an unexpected gift  with trump  she might have to expect the unexpected
