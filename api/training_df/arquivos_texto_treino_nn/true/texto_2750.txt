washington  reuters    senate republicans pushing to overhaul obamacare largely ignored key players in the debate over insuring the poor  the health insurers and hospitals charged with carrying out the law if it gets approved  instead  conservative groups such as heritage action for america won the ears of senate republicans when it came to changing the medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled  the snub is fueling health industry opposition to the new plans for medicaid  and threatens to further frustrate the months long effort to dismantle obamacare   the latest version of the senate bill  released on thursday  left the medicaid overhaul largely unchanged from the radical makeover in the bill from the u s  house of representatives  a nonpartisan government agency has estimated an earlier version of the bill would trim nearly   billion in federal spending for medicaid over  years  while insurers successfully influenced the legislation when it comes to individual insurance markets  the fact that they and hospital groups largely struck out on medicaid is important because the new provisions shift more costs back to the states and hospitals   these groups  along with insurers  will be charged with enforcing the new law  so republicans need their buy in  health policy experts say    a health policy means nothing if it can t be implemented and doesn t work   said andy slavitt  former administrator under president barack obama of the centers for medicare and medicaid services  which oversaw obamacare  the republican bill ends obamacare s medicaid expansion and slashes traditional medicaid funding  with cuts that deepen beginning in   the u s  house of representatives passed its own version of the legislation in may    a lot of conservatives  heritage action included  desperately wanted to hold the line to make sure the medicaid portion wasn t watered down in the senate   said dan holler  vice president of heritage action for america  a conservative advocacy group   it was something we made known to folks up in the senate    when democrats and the white house enacted obamacare seven years ago  support from healthcare companies helped propel the legislation through congress  the administration actively courted the health industry  lobbyists and former obama administration officials said  viewing their support as critical to winning votes  while health insurer and hospital lobbyists said in recent weeks that they have been able to regularly meet with republican lawmakers  they said their input on the bill s medicaid changes was largely ignored  a representative for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was not immediately available for comment  in   the top hospital  doctor and insurer trade groups reported spending a total of more than   million on lobbying the federal government through the first quarter of   according to a congressional lobbying database   one hospital industry lobbyist said there has been no attempt by republican leadership to have a serious discussion with industry lobbyists or leaders about how to change the bill to win their support   that has not been the case with the portion of the bill that addresses the individual insurance market  insurers  including some of the biggest providers of obamacare individual plans  anthem inc  antm n  and molina healthcare  moh n   have been asking for changes to specific policies   for instance  the senate bill repeals the penalty associated with the individual mandate  the requirement that all people purchase insurance or pay a government fee  in its place  insurers received one of their biggest demands  a provision in the bill that provides incentives for americans to have continuous insurance coverage and allows insurers to charge them more if they let their policies lapse   if that back and forth between industry and lawmakers on the individual insurance side ends up winning new conservative votes  lawmakers may be ready to turn the next round of healthcare bill negotiations to medicaid  said elizabeth carpenter  senior vice president at avalere health  a consultant group to hospitals and insurers  the rubber meets the road on the medicaid provision   carpenter said
