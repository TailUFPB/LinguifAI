new york  reuters    the u s  justice department has issued new guidelines for immigration judges that remove some instructions for how to protect unaccompanied juveniles appearing in their courtrooms  a dec   memo  issued by the executive office for immigration review  eoir  replaces  guidelines  spelling out policies and procedures judges should follow in dealing with children who crossed the border illegally alone and face possible deportation   the new memo removes suggestions contained in the  memo for how to conduct  child sensitive questioning  and adds reminders to judges to maintain  impartiality  even though  juvenile cases may present sympathetic allegations   the new document also changes the word  child  to  unmarried individual under the age of   in many instances   link to comparison  tmsnrt rs  may  document  tmsnrt rs  december  document  tmsnrt rs    an eoir official said the new memo contained  clarifications and updates  to  year old guidance  in order to be consistent with the laws as they ve been passed by congress   the new memo was posted on the justice department website but has not been previously reported   immigration advocates said they worry the new guidelines could make court appearances for children more difficult  and a spokeswoman for the union representing immigration judges said judges are concerned about the tone of the memo  president donald trump has made tougher immigration enforcement a key policy goal of his administration  and has focused particularly on trying to curb the illegal entry of children  the administration says it wants to prevent vulnerable juveniles from making perilous journeys to the united states and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants   one changed section of the memo focuses on how to make children comfortable in the court in advance of hearings  the old guidance says they  should be permitted to explore  courtrooms and allowed to  sit in all locations   including  especially  the judge s bench and the witness stand     the new guidance says such explorations should take place only  to the extent that resources and time permit  and specifically puts the judge s bench off limits  the new memo also warns judges to be skeptical  since an unaccompanied minor  generally receives more favorable treatment under the law than other categories of illegal aliens   which creates  an incentive to misrepresent accompaniment status or age in order to attempt to qualify for the benefits   it also says to be on the lookout for  fraud and abuse   language that was not in the previous memo  immigration judges are appointed by the u s  attorney general and courts are part of the department of justice  not an independent branch  the only sitting immigration judges routinely allowed to speak to the media are representatives of their union  the national association of immigration judges   dana marks  a sitting judge and spokeswoman for the union  said the  overall tone  of the memo  is very distressing and concerning to immigration judges     there is a feeling that the immigration courts are just being demoted into immigration enforcement offices  rather than neutral arbiters   marks said   there has been a relentless beating of the drum toward enforcement rather than due process     former immigration judge andrew arthur  who now works at the center for immigration studies  which promotes lower levels of immigration overall  said the new guidelines were needed   in their previous form  he said   so much emphasis was placed on the potential inability of the alien to understand the proceedings     that it almost put the judge into the position of being an advocate     the courts have had to handle a surge in cases for unaccompanied minors  mostly from central america  after their numbers sky rocketed in  as violence in the region caused residents to flee north   while illegal crossings initially fell after trump took office  u s  customs and border protection said that since may  each month has seen an increase in children being apprehended either alone or with family members   attorney general jeff sessions said in a speech in boston in september that the special accommodations for unaccompanied minors had been exploited by  gang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep clothing   echoing some of these concerns  the new memo notes in a preamble that not all child cases involve innocents  and that the courts might see  an adolescent gang member  or  a teenager convicted as an adult for serious criminal activity    jennifer podkul  policy director of kids in need of defense  kind  said congress included special procedural protections for immigrant children in a  anti trafficking bill to  make sure that a kid gets a fair shot in the courtroom    these kids are by themselves telling a very complicated and oftentimes very traumatic story   said podkul   the approach of this memo  which is much more suspicious  is not going to help get to the truth of a child s story    in cases where children are called to testify  the old guidance instructed judges to  seek to limit the amount of time the child is on the stand   the new guidance says that judges should  consider  limiting the child s time on the stand  without compromising due process for the opposing party   which is generally a government prosecutor  the memo leaves in a range of special accommodations made for children  including allowing them to bring a pillow or booster seat or a  toy  book  or other personal item   it also maintains that cases involving unaccompanied minors should be heard on a separate docket when possible and that children should not be detained or transported with adults
