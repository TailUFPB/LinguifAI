washington  reuters    u s  house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on wednesday that a sweeping republican tax cut plan is entering its toughest phase yet as lobbyists swarm congress to try to protect valuable tax breaks  urging lawmakers to move quickly on the plan  ryan said in an interview with reuters that speedy action would prevent the legislation getting bogged down and deliver sooner the economic growth that republicans expect from it   k street   as washington s lobbying industry is known after the downtown street where much of it is based  will soon descend on capitol hill to defend tax benefits for companies and other special interests  said ryan  the top republican in congress       when the details come  that is when you re going to see k street coming to congress  and that s why this hasn t been done for  years   said ryan  looking back to the country s last major tax code overhaul under president ronald reagan in   while the broad parameters of the republican plan  backed by president donald trump  have been made public  detailed legislation is not expected to be revealed until next week   securing passage by congress of the tax plan would give trump his first major legislative win since he took office in january  republicans control the white house and both chambers of congress and are under pressure to deliver on their election campaign promises  final action on taxes is at least weeks away  the republican plan would cut taxes for businesses and people by up to   trillion over the next decade  according to independent analysts   it calls for reducing the corporate income tax rate to  percent from  percent and setting a lower rate for smaller businesses  as well as cutting taxes for individuals and allowing larger deductions for families  democrats have called it a gift to the rich and to corporate america that would cause the federal deficit to balloon and add to the   trillion u s  national debt      ryan referred to white water rafting to describe how the tax overhaul effort is entering its toughest phase   we ve been going through class  rapids  which is a pleasant ride  it s nice  everybody pretty much stays in the boat and it s pretty good  but we re about to go through class  rapids  which is the biggest rapid you can go through   he said   he called on republicans to hold tight as details are hammered out   we ve got to make sure that everybody stays in the boat and we get the boat down the river   ryan said      he dismissed concerns that tax cuts could expand the federal deficit   we don t anticipate a big deficit effect from this tax reform because we will broaden the base and lower the rates  plug loopholes and get faster economic growth        republicans intend to pay for their proposed cuts in part by broadening the tax base  that would require discarding trillions of dollars of tax deductions  loopholes and other breaks  each one protected by powerful interests  if lobbyists succeed in protecting such tax breaks  lawmakers would be looking at less revenue to offset the tax cuts  raising the risk of higher deficits and debt that could undermine long term economic growth      ryan has previously said he wants the house to pass the tax bill by the nov   u s  thanksgiving holiday  he predicted on wednesday that some democratic lawmakers would back the tax plan   at the end of the day  i do believe some democrats will end up voting for this thing   ryan said   it s hard for me to see why   no matter what party you re from   you d want to vote against this    at least some democratic support could end up being needed in the senate  where republicans hold only a   majority  party dissent in the senate led to republicans  failure this summer to push through an overhaul of the healthcare system that trump and the party leadership had pushed for   ryan  from wisconsin  blamed democrats for the lack of bipartisanship in washington  republicans are drafting the tax legislation on their own   i so wish we had bill bradley democrats around these days  we do not have bill bradley democrats  believe me  i really  really wish we did   ryan said  referring to democratic former senator bill bradley  who played a key bipartisan role in the reagan tax reform  among republicans  skirmishes around the tax breaks have already begun  some republican lawmakers are resisting a proposal to eliminate a popular deduction for state and local tax payments  which would hit middle class voters in high tax states like new york  new jersey and california    you do have to broaden the base in order to lower the rates  and that is what reform is   ryan said   with respect to state and local  i think there s a way of addressing the concerns that our members have for middle income taxpayers   so that they are net winners in tax reform as well         ryan also said republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize obamacare insurance markets or try again this year to repeal and replace former president barack obama s affordable care act  the house speaker said he wants congress to pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought to the united states as children but offered no timetable  asked about strong denunciations of trump this week by two republican senators  ryan said people should  settle their differences personally  rather than in public  he also urged the department of justice to immediately give congress documents related to the funding of a dossier on trump during the presidential campaign
