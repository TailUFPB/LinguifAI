washington  reuters    the trump administration on wednesday moved to amend the starting date of its proposed  day travel ban on people entering the united states from six muslim majority countries in a bid to keep its legal battle alive  the amendment appears intended to avoid the administration s legal case at the u s  supreme court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired  challengers to the ban  who say the order is intended to discriminate against muslims  have said in court papers that it should expire on wednesday   days after the executive order was due to take effect on march   a memo issued by the white house  as the supreme court considered two challenges to the ban  said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect  and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted  the move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after trump s first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts    omar jadwat  a lawyer with the american civil liberties union  which has challenged the ban  said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban s legal flaws   and yet again  these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a muslim ban   he added  lawsuits by hawaii and maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the constitution s first amendment  which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion  the trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security  soon after the memo was issued  acting solicitor general jeff wall filed court papers saying that it resolved  any doubt  about the order s effective date   if the case was moot  the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place  the supreme court on tuesday gave the trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on monday that upheld a block on the travel ban  the court s action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week   federal judges in maryland and hawaii blocked trump s  day ban on travelers from libya  iran  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen  the hawaii judge also blocked a  day ban on refugees entering the united states  the  u s  circuit court of appeals largely upheld the hawaii injunction on monday  in the second case  the richmond  virginia based  u s  circuit court of appeals  on may  upheld the maryland judge s ruling
