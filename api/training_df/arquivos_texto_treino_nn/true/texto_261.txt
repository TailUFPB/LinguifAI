washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump is open to reforming the country s biofuels policy if it can be done in a way that protects jobs in both the refining and agriculture industries  senators said on thursday after a meeting with trump on the issue  nine lawmakers had requested the meeting to argue that the renewable fuel standard  or rfs  a law requiring refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn based ethanol into the fuel supply every year  was threatening to put refineries in their districts out of business  the trump administration had ruled in favor of big corn and against the refining industry in a series of decisions this year  with senators on both sides using parliamentary procedures like holds on administrative appointments to punish rivals  senator ted cruz of texas  who led the lawmaker delegation  said trump was open to a  win win  solution   the group as a whole agreed with the president to reconvene next week and to expand the group and work together to find a  solution  that is a win for blue collar workers  a win for jobs  but also a win for farmers at the same time   he told fox news after the meeting  republican senators bill cassidy of louisiana and james lankford of oklahoma also said trump expressed a desire to help refiners in a way that protected the interests of farmers  but that more discussions were needed   it was just a recognition that this is a more complicated problem and we re going to have to get everybody together from all sides   lankford told reporters  the white house said the meeting was productive and that trump remained committed to the rfs  farmers and energy workers   he understands there are differing views on this issue  and the administration looks forward to working with all the stakeholders toward a mutually agreeable path forward   white house spokesman hogan gidley said in a statement  the rfs was introduced more than a decade ago by president george w  bush as a way to boost u s  agriculture  slash energy imports and cut emissions  and has since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to  billion gallons a year  refiners oppose the rfs because they say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year in blending and regulatory expenses while propping up demand for rival fuels  refiners that do not have the facilities to blend biofuels must purchase credits  called rins  from those that do and hand them into the epa once a year  a refining lobbyist briefed on thursday s meeting said one possible solution discussed was capping the rins   an idea that is opposed by the renewable fuels association  the largest biofuel trade group  the refining industry has requested tweaks to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume targets for biofuels  allow ethanol exports to be counted against those targets  or shift the blending burden to supply terminals   while the leadership of the epa  which administers the rfs  had considered some of the changes  it ultimately rejected them under pressure from midwestern lawmakers  and slightly increased biofuels volumes targets for     the meeting with trump could set the stage for negotiations over legislation  but any measure would likely require cooperation from representatives of the corn belt  republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said this week he was not invited to the meeting and called it  a waste of time   biofuels industry representatives did not attend the meeting  cruz has said he would block iowa agriculture secretary bill northey s nomination to a key post at the u s  department of agriculture until he gets a meeting about biofuels that includes all sides on the issue
