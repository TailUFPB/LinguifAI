washington  reuters    a democratic senator delivered a    hour  all night speech denouncing president donald trump s u s  supreme court nominee on wednesday  joining an effort to block senate confirmation of neil gorsuch in a heated political showdown with republicans  senator jeff merkley of oregon began his speech on the senate floor on tuesday evening and wrapped up mid morning on wednesday  the senate was expected to vote on thursday at  a m  to try to end a democratic procedural effort called a filibuster aimed at blocking gorsuch s confirmation to a lifetime post on the court  republicans were expected to fall short of being able to halt the filibuster  but said they had the votes needed to then immediately change the senate rules to prohibit filibusters against supreme court nominees  republicans said gorsuch would  be confirmed on friday one way or the other  senate confirmation of gorsuch    would reinstate the court s conservative majority  allow trump to leave an indelible mark on america s highest judicial body and fulfill a top campaign promise by the republican president  toward the end of his marathon speech  merkley looked weary  his suit jacket unbuttoned and his yellow tie billowing out  he stood beside an easel holding graphics that an aide would periodically adjust   for the first time in u s  history  a seat has been stolen from one president and delivered to another in a court packing scheme  if that were to succeed  it would set a precedent that will haunt the court for decades to come   merkley said  he noted that the republicans who control the senate refused last year to consider former democratic president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to replace justice antonin scalia  who died in february   the same seat gorsuch now has been named to fill  later on the senate floor  republican senator cory gardner countered that such an argument amounted to advocating that  two wrongs must make a right   merkley criticized gorsuch s legal opinions and said gorsuch would become a conservative legal activist on the court  at one point  merkley read a  speech by one of the past giants of the senate  democrat robert byrd  decrying partisanship in congress    i believe that the american people are more than tired of partisan warfare  i believe they wish for less of it from congress  especially in the senate  where more statesmanship and a longer view are expected   merkley said  quoting byrd  the senate has a lengthy history of long speeches  including notable ones in recent years by senators ted cruz  chris murphy and rand paul  the senate historical office listed merkley s speech at  hours and  minutes  the eighth longest in senate history  the longest came in  when segregationist senator strom thurmond spoke for  hours and  minutes against legislation  later enacted  protecting black voting rights  on the second day of formal senate debate on gorsuch s  nomination  various republicans called the conservative colorado based federal appeals court judge  incredibly qualified   an  intellectual heavyweight  and  always true to the law    democrats are bowing to hard left special interests that can t get over the results of the election and thus are demanding complete democratic opposition to everything this president touches   majority leader mitch mcconnell said  democrats accuse gorsuch of being so conservative as to be outside the judicial mainstream  favoring corporate interests over ordinary americans in legal opinions  and displaying insufficient independence from trump  republicans control the senate    the rule change  which requires a simple majority  has been dubbed the  nuclear option   and trump has urged mcconnell to  go nuclear   a filibuster requires a super majority of  votes in the  seat senate in order to proceed to a simple majority vote on a supreme court nominee or legislation  the  vote super majority threshold empowers the minority party to hold up the majority party and has forced the senate over the decades to try to achieve bipartisanship on legislation and presidential appointments  republican senator john mccain  known as a defender of senate traditions  offered reluctant support for the rule change  but said it likely would lead to judicial nominees  from the extremes of both left and right    what we are about to do at the end of this week will have tremendous consequences  and i fear that some day we will regret what we re about to do  in fact  i m confident we will   mccain said on the senate floor  the white house denied on wednesday that gorsuch had engaged in plagiarism after media reports accused him of copying some language and failing to cite relevant sources in his  book about assisted suicide and euthanasia   there is only one explanation for this baseless  last second smear of judge gorsuch  those desperate to justify the unprecedented filibuster of a well qualified and mainstream nominee to the supreme court   white house spokesman steven cheung said in a statement
