washington  reuters    the top republican in the u s  senate on tuesday rejected president donald trump s suggestion that his party change the chamber s rules to undercut the ability of democrats to block legislation with filibusters   there is an overwhelming majority on a bipartisan basis that is not interested in changing the way the senate operates on the legislative calendar   senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters  mcconnell was responding to a question about a tweet in which trump suggested changing the rules so that legislation could pass on a simple majority vote  currently  the rules require a super majority of  votes to overcome a filibuster   this version of the story corrects third paragraph to say  require a super majority  instead of  request a super majority
