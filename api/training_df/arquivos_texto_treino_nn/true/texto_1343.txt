 reuters    outside the morgan county fair in mcconnelsville  in a rural swath of ohio that fervently backed u s  president donald trump in last year s election  ticket seller john wilson quietly counts off a handful of disappointments with the man he helped elect   the  year old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the white house  he does not like trump s penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts  he wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system  and he worries that trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country    every president makes mistakes   wilson said   but if you add one on top of one  on top of another one  on top of another  there s just a limit    trump  who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like morgan county  has been losing his grip on rural america   according to the reuters ipsos daily tracking poll  the republican president s popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where  percent of the country s population lives  the poll of more than   adults in  non metro  areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of trump as they are to approve of him   in september   percent of people in non metro areas approved of trump while  percent disapproved  that is down from trump s first four weeks in office  when  percent said they approved of the president while  percent disapproved   the poll found that trump has lost support in rural areas among men  whites and people who never went to college  he lost support with rural republicans and rural voters who supported him on election day   and while trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security  rural americans are increasingly unhappy with trump s record on immigration  a central part of his presidential campaign   forty seven percent of rural americans said in september they approved of the president s handling of immigration  down from  percent during his first month in office   poll respondents who were interviewed by reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration   a few said they are tired of waiting for trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along america s southern border  while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration s efforts to restrict travel into the united states    there should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that s more controlled   said drew carlson    of warrensburg  missouri  who took the poll   but trump s  constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me    the trump administration would not comment about the reuters ipsos poll       to be sure  trump is still much more popular in rural america than he is elsewhere   since he took office   i like him less  but i support him more   said robert cody    a retired chemical engineer from bartlesville  oklahoma who took the poll   cody said that trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets  but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border   when trump called the election a  last shot  for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation s southern border with a  big  fat  beautiful wall   he was speaking directly to rural america  said david swenson  an economist at iowa state university    feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places   swenson said   and here comes a candidate  trump  who s offering simplistic answers  to issues that concern them   rural americans responded by supporting trump over democratic rival hillary clinton by  percentage points during the election  an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states  such as michigan  wisconsin and pennsylvania  where trump won by less than  percentage point   but after  months  many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural america  said karl stauber  who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central virginia    rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are   stauber said   they ve heard so many promises  and they ve not seen much done    despite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back  stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region  or anyone expand their workforce  due to new federal policies    it just seems like we ve dropped off the screen   he said    according to the poll  trump s overall popularity has dropped gradually  and for different reasons  this year   rural americans were increasingly unhappy with trump s handling of healthcare in march and april after he lobbied for a republican plan to overhaul obamacare and cut coverage for millions of americans   in may and june  they were more critical of trump s ability to carry out u s  foreign policy  and they gave him lower marks for  the way he treats people like me    in august  they were increasingly unhappy with  the effort he s making to unify the country  after he blamed  both sides  for the violence in charlottesville  virginia  in which a suspected white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of anti racist demonstrators   the reuters ipsos poll was conducted online in english across the united states  it asked people to rate the president s performance and the results were filtered for people who lived in zip codes that fell within counties designated as  non metro  by the federal government   the poll combined the results of  non metro  respondents into nine  four week periods  each period included between   and   responses and had a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of  percentage points
