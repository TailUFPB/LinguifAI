washington  reuters    supreme court justices clashed on tuesday over whether courts should curb the long standing u s  political practice of drawing electoral maps to entrench one party in power  with conservative anthony kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote  the nine justices heard an hour of arguments in the major voting rights case out of wisconsin involving the practice known as partisan gerrymandering  their ruling  due by june  could have an impact on u s  elections for decades by setting standards for when electoral districts are laid out with such extreme partisan aims that they deprive voters of their constitutional rights  kennedy  who sometimes sides with the court s liberal justices in big rulings  did not definitively tip his hand on how he would rule but posed tough questions to wisconsin s lawyers that signaled his aversion to electoral districts drawn to give one party a lopsided advantage in elections   liberal justices voiced sympathy for the democratic voters who challenged the republican drawn legislative map in wisconsin as a violation of their constitutional rights  conservative justices expressed doubt about whether courts should intervene in such highly political disputes  and questioned the challengers  legal standing to bring the case  the court has a   conservative majority  gerrymandering  a practice that began two centuries ago  involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another  democratic and republican critics argue that gerrymandering is becoming more extreme because it now can be guided by precise voter data and mapmaking technology  distorting the democratic process by letting politicians choose their voters rather than the other way around  legislative districts in the  u s  states  redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes  represent the individual components of representative democracy  kennedy pressed erin murphy  a lawyer for wisconsin s state senate  on whether it would be unconstitutional for a state law to contain explicit provisions favoring one party over another  murphy conceded it would be   a federal three judge panel ruled   last november that wisconsin s redistricting plan violated the constitution s first amendment right to freedom of expression and association and  amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law  because of the extent to which it marginalized democratic voters  wisconsin appealed that ruling to the high court  in a  ruling in another case  kennedy parted with his conservative colleagues to suggest that if partisan gerrymandering went too far  violating the constitution  courts may have to step in if a  workable standard  for deciding when to do that could be found    gerrymandering is distasteful   conservative justice samuel alito said  but alito voiced doubt over whether the metrics used to measure gerrymandering  drawn from social science and endorsed by the lower court  were manageable  conservative chief justice john roberts called those metrics  sociological gobbledygook   conservative justice neil gorsuch said a court approved formula for identifying unconstitutional gerrymandering would be hard to achieve  comparing various standards proposed to spices on a steak dinner   what s this court supposed to do  a pinch of this  a pinch of that   he asked  he voiced doubt that the constitution authorizes courts to step in at all  the challengers received some muscular support   it is time to terminate gerrymandering   republican former california governor arnold schwarzenegger  the star of the  terminator  movies  told a rally outside the courthouse  redistricting typically is done by the party controlling a state s legislature  gerrymandering is usually accomplished by concentrating voters who tend to favor a particular party in a small number of districts to reduce their statewide voting power   called packing   while scattering others in districts in numbers too small to be a majority   called cracking  the supreme court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage  roberts raised concerns about the high court approving or rejecting future state electoral maps  suggesting the public could start viewing the court as a political body    that is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country   roberts added  some liberal justices wondered what would happen to voters if partisan gerrymandering made election results preordained   what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote   justice ruth bader ginsburg asked   what becomes of the precious right to vote   wisconsin s electoral map  drawn after the  u s  census  enabled republicans to win a sizable majority of wisconsin legislative seats despite losing the popular vote statewide to the democrats  the party s majority has since expanded  the plaintiffs  attorney  paul smith  urged the justices to act   if you let this go   he said   in  you re going to have a festival of copycat gerrymandering  the likes of which this country has never seen    you are the only institution in the united states     that can solve this problem   smith added
