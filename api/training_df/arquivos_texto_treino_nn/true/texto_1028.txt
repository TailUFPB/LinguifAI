washington  reuters    former u s  senator bill bradley  a democrat who helped bring about former republican president ronald reagan s bipartisan tax reform more than  years ago  said on wednesday that president donald trump s tax plan could backfire on republicans  bradley said the lack of detail in the nine page plan and the ambitious goal of passing legislation before january could give lawmakers little time to digest the implications of the tax overhaul  the details are expected to be unveiled next week when lawmakers introduce legislation     that s like handing somebody a molotov cocktail with the fuse going   he told reuters in an interview    nobody will know what it is  you hand this to somebody  they re supposed to vote  then they vote and the whole thing explodes   said bradley who represented new jersey and was a former professional basketball star and presidential candidate  as a senator  bradley co sponsored a bill in  that moved reagan and congress toward tax reform  he worked with the republican administration and a republican led senate to get a final bill enacted   by contrast  trump and senior republicans plan to pass their bill over a span of several weeks with little support from democrats       earlier on wednesday  house of representatives speaker paul ryan lamented the absence of  bill bradley democrats  in congress  saying in a separate reuters interview that the republican plan would see significant bipartisan support if today s democrats were more like bradley  but bradley criticized republicans for not providing details to democrats and for pursuing a tax reform plan that he said lacks concrete principles and an effective strategy       we haven t seen anything specific  in the   you had three separate extremely detailed proposals   bradley said  referring to two in depth treasury department reports on tax reform and his own legislation  the senate finance committee also held more than  days of hearings   you can t work bipartisan unless you have something to work with   bradley added   and the whole strategy is   do what i say or i m going to come into your state and defeat you   that s the whole strategy  that s not a strategy  what about the country    bradley dismissed trump s four principles of tax reform  simplification  middle class tax relief  international repatriation and competitive business tax rates   those aren t principles  those are objectives   bradley said  in the   lawmakers  tax reform principles included equal incomes having equal taxes  those who earn more paying more in tax and the market as the best allocator of resources  since reagan  other presidents and congresses have tried to thoroughly reform the tax code  but all have failed   democrats and republicans generally agree the code is too complex and inefficient  but each of its many tax breaks is zealously defended by lobbyists and lawmakers representing special interests  making comprehensive reform difficult  bradley s advice to trump and republicans   put something out and wait three months  four months  five months  see what the reaction is  and then you re probably going to have to modify it because certain things are not going to work   he said
