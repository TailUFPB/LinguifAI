washington  reuters    president donald trump on friday fired his chief strategist stephen bannon  a right wing political activist credited with driving parts of the trump policy agenda  with mixed results  bannon was a top trump administration critic of the international paris climate agreement  along with scott pruitt  the head of the environmental protection agency  they helped persuade trump to announce in june that the united states would withdraw from the pact struck in  by nearly  countries  trump s daughter ivanka and son in law jared kushner  who were not fans of bannon  wanted washington to stay in the pact  bannon also opposed government support of green energy  which he called  madness  and a carbon tax on fossil fuels  bannon was a driving force behind trump s travel ban  it   barred u s  entry by people from several muslim majority countries  the ban was announced by trump  but poorly implemented  it immediately caused nationwide protests and confusion and was challenged in the courts  where it is still tied up  making it so far a partial win for bannon  bannon opposed an april military strike ordered by trump against a syrian air base in response to what the trump administration and u s  allies say was a poison gas attack by syria s military in which scores of civilians  including many children  died  trump has since touted his decision to carry out the strike as a bold one in contrast to former president barack obama  in line with bannon s position  trump initially threatened to scrap the north american free trade agreement  but then the president backtracked and said he was willing to renegotiate the trade pact with canada and mexico  bannon has long been skeptical of international alliances  trump alarmed u s  allies on the campaign trail by calling the nato security alliance  obsolete  and berating washington s western allies for not paying enough for their defense  after massive pressure from the pragmatist wing of trump s national security council  trump eventually underscored u s  commitment to article   a crucial part of the nato treaty  the mutual defense doctrine  the white house has been mired in a months long debate over a strategy for south asia  including afghanistan  one of the divisions was between bannon  who favored a withdrawal of u s  troops from washington s longest foreign conflict  versus national security adviser h r  mcmaster and most of the military brass who support a modest troop increase  trump met with his national security team on friday to try to reach agreement on a strategy for afghanistan  but made no decision on whether he would commit more troops  bannon has been a china hawk  urging a tougher line on trade toward beijing and dismissive of efforts to get china s help in reining in north korea  in an interview with the american prospect magazine published on wednesday  bannon said the united states was in an economic war with china and ridiculed suggestions of a military solution to the north korea issue  bannon supported a  border adjustment tax   part of a tax reform package drawn up by senior republicans in the house of representatives  the bat was meant to encourage exports  discourage imports and raise tax revenue  but it divided the business community because it would have raised consumer prices  house republicans recently dropped the bat from their proposal  a defeat for bannon  although he was not a central player in tax policy  bannon also pushed for tax cuts for the middle class  still not yet delivered   a major  trump campaign promise was to build a wall on the mexican border  a position supported by bannon  trump s vow that mexico would pay for the wall  which the mexican government has insisted it will not do  has strained relations between the two neighbors  work on the wall has not begun
