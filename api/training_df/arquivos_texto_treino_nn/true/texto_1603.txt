washington  reuters    president donald trump is considering a new order to replace his soon to expire travel ban on people from six muslim majority countries that would be tailored on a country by country basis to protect the united states from attacks  u s  officials said on friday  with the current ban on people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen due to expire on sunday  trump was given recommendations by elaine duke  the acting homeland security secretary  but has not yet made a decision on the details of any new order  the officials told reporters  miles taylor  counselor to duke  said she recommended to trump  actions that are tough and that are tailored  including travel restrictions and enhanced screening for certain countries   taylor declined to say which or how many countries would be targeted  including the status of the six countries covered by the current ban  white house spokesman raj shah said that while  we can t get into decision making   the next step will be a presidential proclamation setting out the new policy  he declined to say when that would come  including whether trump would act before the existing ban expires  the american civil liberties union  the rights group that mounted one of the legal challenges to the march order  expressed skepticism about trump s forthcoming action   this looks to be the trump administration s third try to make good on an unconstitutional campaign promise to ban muslims from the united states   aclu executive director anthony romero said  trump s six nation travel ban was laid out in a march  executive order that was blocked by federal courts before being allowed to go into effect with some limits by the u s  supreme court in june  under the recommendations trump is weighing  there would be restrictions on u s  entry that differ by nation  based on cooperation with american security mandates  the threat the united states believes each country presents and other variables  taylor said  he did not specify the nature of the restrictions  but said that after being imposed they could be lifted  if conditions change   the legal question of whether the existing ban discriminates against muslims in violation of the u s  constitution  as lower courts previously ruled  will be argued before the supreme court on oct    officials declined to say how the proposed change in policy could affect the upcoming supreme court case   the march travel ban and an earlier january one that targeted the same six countries as well as iraq are some of the most controversial actions taken by trump since assuming office in january  critics have called the policy an unlawful  muslim ban   accusing the republican president of discriminating against muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law  breaking existing u s  immigration law  and stoking religious hatred  trump  who has promised that  radical islamic terrorism  will be  eradicated   wrote on twitter on sept     the travel ban into the united states should be far larger  tougher and more specific but stupidly  that would not be politically correct   the expiring ban blocked entry into the united states by people from the six countries for  days and locked out most aspiring refugees for  days to give trump s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of u s  vetting procedures for foreign visitors  the existing refugee ban expires on oct    taylor said american officials in july notified every foreign government of requirements for the minimum cooperation the united states needs to validate traveler identities to ensure they do not represent a national security threat  those countries were given  days to respond  people from countries that did not meet the requirements may not be allowed to enter the united states or may face other travel restrictions  taylor said  most countries met those requirements or agreed to work toward meeting them  taylor added   at the end of the day  some countries were still unable or  worse yet  deliberately unwilling to comply with the new baseline that we laid out   taylor said  trump  who promised as a candidate to impose  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   has said the soon to expire ban was needed to protect the united states from terrorism   we need to know who is coming into our country   taylor said   we should be able to validate their identities and we should be able to confirm that our foreign partners do not have information suggesting such individuals may represent a threat to the united states   while trump s january and march orders were quickly blocked by federal courts  the expected new restrictions might be harder to challenge because they are the product of a worldwide review process examining vetting procedures of foreign countries  legal experts said
