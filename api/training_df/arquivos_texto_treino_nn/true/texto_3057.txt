washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans on thursday unveiled legislation that would replace obamacare with a plan that scales back aid to the poor and kills a tax on the wealthy  but the bill s fate was quickly thrown into question as several senators voiced skepticism  four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form  leaving republicans short of the votes they need for passage  democrats are united in opposition      the  page proposal  worked out in secret by a group led senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of president donald trump by rolling back former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  which has provided coverage to millions of americans since it was passed in   republicans view the law  formally known as the affordable care act  as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace  trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store   i am very supportive of the senate  healthcarebill  look forward to making it really special   he wrote on twitter  trump urged the house of representatives to pass a similar bill in may  only to criticize it in private as  mean  once it passed  he said on wednesday he wanted a health plan  with heart    democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage   the president said the house bill was mean   said senate democratic leader chuck schumer   the senate bill may be even meaner   obama weighed in on facebook   if there s a chance you might get sick  get old  or start a family   this bill will do you harm   he wrote  the senate s most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the u s  government s role   this current bill does not repeal obamacare  it does not keep our promises to the american people   said senator rand paul  who along with fellow republican senators ted cruz  mike lee and ron johnson said they could not support it in its current form  shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bill s release  with the overall s p  healthcare sector closing up   percent at an all time high   the initial proposal i think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected   said jeff jonas  a portfolio manager with gabelli funds  over months of often bitter debate  republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement  while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one sixth of the world s largest economy  the nonpartisan congressional budget office found that the house bill would kick  million americans off their health plans  and the legislation is unpopular with the public  fewer than one in  americans supports it  according to reuters ipsos polling  the senate measure maintains much of the structure of the house bill  but differs in several key ways  the senate bill would phase out obamacare s expansion of the medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the house version  waiting until after the next presidential election in   but would enact deeper cuts starting in   it would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the  million americans who depend on the program   the legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the house bill to help low income people buy private insurance   those subsidies would be based on income  rather than the age based subsidies contained in the house bill   a  major improvement   according to republican senator susan collins  a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bill s impact on the poor   the senate legislation provides less money  however  for the opioid epidemic  allocating   billion in   compared with    billion over  years in the house version   both versions would repeal the   percent net investment income tax on high earners  a key target for republicans   they also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers  and remove the fine that obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured  policy experts said that would keep more young  healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool  the senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market  allotting   billion a year in  and  and   billion a year in  and   it proposes defunding planned parenthood for a year  but abortion related restrictions are less stringent than the house version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with senate rules  they could be included in another senate bill  mcconnell said democrats chose not to help frame the bill  which republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace   republicans believe we have a responsibility to act  and we are   he said  democrats say they offered to help fix obamacare but were rebuffed  the bill s real world impact is not yet known  but the cbo is expected to provide an estimate early next week  as lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the senate floor  a protest erupted outside mcconnell s personal office  with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway  holding signs and chanting   no cuts to medicaid   u s  capitol police said  protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction  aside from the quartet of conservatives  none of the other  republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand  but several said they would check with home state constituents before taking a position   i expect there s going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote   said senator john barrasso of wyoming
