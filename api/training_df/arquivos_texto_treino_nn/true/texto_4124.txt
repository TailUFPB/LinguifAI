washington  reuters    the u s  department of justice threatened on friday to cut some funding to california as well as eight cities and counties across the united states  escalating a trump administration crackdown on so called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities  president donald trump has vowed to strip federal funds from dozens of state and local governments that do not fully cooperate with u s  immigration agents  arguing they endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants who are arrested for crimes    sanctuary cities  in general offer safe harbor to illegal immigrants and often do not use municipal funds or resources to advance the enforcement of federal immigration laws   many of these localities say they do not have the funding or space to hold immigrants until federal agents can take custody of them    those threatened were  the state of california  new york city  chicago  philadelphia  clark county  nevada  new orleans  miami dade county  florida  and milwaukee county  wisconsin  cook county  illinois  also received a warning  even though it did not get money from the justice department last year  the jurisdictions have until june  to provide evidence to the federal government that they are not violating any laws  at stake is roughly   million in law enforcement aid under the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant program  which helps local governments pay for everything from forensics labs to drug courts  the grants in question are among the largest handed out under the program  collectively amounting to  percent of the   million distributed in the last fiscal year   in a statement  the justice department singled out chicago and new york as two cities that are  crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime   even though new york city is experiencing its lowest crime levels in decades and experts say chicago s recent spike in violent crime has little to do with illegal immigration      several state and local officials responded with defiance to the threat    new york is the safest big city in the country  with crime at record lows in large part because we have policies in place to encourage cooperation between nypd and immigrant communities   said seth stein  a spokesman for new york city mayor bill de blasio   in california  the state senate approved a bill earlier this month to curb cooperation between police agencies and federal agents seeking to deport illegal immigrants  the measure is now in the state assembly   it has become abundantly clear that attorney general  jeff  sessions and the trump administration are basing their law enforcement policies on principles of white supremacy   not american values   california senate president pro tempore kevin de le√≥n  a democrat  said in a statement on friday   a spokeswoman for the california board of state and community corrections said some of the federal funding in question went to local communities after emergencies  including san bernardino after a mass shooting there in   officials in philadelphia  milwaukee county and cook county said they believed they were complying with immigration laws    milwaukee county has its challenges but they are not caused by illegal immigration  my far greater concern is the proactive dissemination of misinformation  fear  and intolerance   said milwaukee county executive chris abele  the fraternal order of police  the largest police union  told trump in a meeting last month that they were concerned the cuts could threaten public safety
