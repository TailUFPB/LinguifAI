washington  reuters    democratic leaders in the u s  congress on monday demanded that lawmakers wait to find out the budgetary and healthcare impacts of a new  last ditch legislative effort by republicans to repeal obamacare before voting on it  in their long running war on former president barack obama s signature healthcare law  senate republicans are now proposing to replace it with a system that would give states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programs  drafted by republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy  the bill was introduced last week  graham and cassidy said they were close to securing the votes needed for passage  but the bill s outlook was uncertain  if approved  it would replace the  affordable care act  known informally as obamacare  which republicans have long seen as government overreach into the healthcare business  the graham cassidy measure has revived a fight that many in washington thought was over when an obamacare repeal and replace bill flopped in the senate in july  humiliating republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and president donald trump  two senate committees  including the powerful finance committee  on monday announced they would hold hearings on the bill next week  the first public hearings all year for any republican senate proposal to overhaul obamacare   republican senator john mccain had called for a return to regular order and public hearings before voting against a repeal and replace bill in july  senator ron wyden  the top ranking democrat on the finance committee hearing  said next week s hearing  makes a mockery of regular order   the congressional budget office  a non partisan fiscal analysis unit of congress  said on monday it will make a preliminary assessment of the bill s impact next week  but it said it will not be able to estimate the impact on the deficit or changes in insurance coverage or premiums for several weeks  worried democrats seized on the statement to urge republicans to wait for a full cbo score before holding a vote   have the courage and decency to wait for a cbo score   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor on monday  the house of representatives is on a break this week  a delay to wait for a cbo analysis is something republicans can ill afford since in two weeks senate procedural rules will make it much more difficult for them to advance the legislation  a special parliamentary procedure that would allow the bill to move forward in the senate with a simple majority of only  votes will expire in two weeks  after that  it would need  votes  like most senate legislation  republicans have a slim  vote senate majority   schumer called graham cassidy a  frankenstein monster of a bill  that would be costly for some states  he said democrats would use every procedural tool to slow or stop its passage  stock prices fell for small hospital chains that have high corporate debt loads and that likely would be hurt under the plan s probable decrease in government payments for patients  community health systems closed down  cents  or   percent  to     and tenet healthcare fell     or   percent  at     trump has been telephoning members of congress in recent days urging action on dismantling obamacare  mcconnell has not promised to bring graham cassidy to the floor for a vote  but he asked the cbo for a quick assessment  not all the senate s conservatives back the bill  senator rand paul said it did not go far enough to repeal obamacare  senator john kennedy of louisiana told reporters he was worried that the bill would allow some states to set up their own single payer healthcare system  mccain and two other republican senators  lisa murkowski and susan collins  all of whom voted against the last republican effort to repeal obamacare  were said by aides to be undecided on the latest proposal  collins  of maine  told reporters she was still analyzing the measure  but listed several concerns  including possibly higher insurance premiums for older americans  she said the maine hospital association calculated her state would receive a billion dollars less in medicaid and other federal healthcare spending over the next decade under the bill  and  that obviously is of great concern to me    but if it can get through the senate  the plan may have a chance in the house of representatives  also controlled by republicans  past republican proposals to dismantle obamacare have been hampered  in part  by cbo estimates that showed the bills would have left millions more americans without health insurance  obama s healthcare reform has provided health benefits to  million americans
