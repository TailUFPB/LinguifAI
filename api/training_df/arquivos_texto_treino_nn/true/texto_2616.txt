washington  reuters    white house press secretary sean spicer resigned on friday  ending a short and turbulent tenure that made him a household name and the butt of late night television comedy lampoons  amid further upheaval within president donald trump s inner circle  while not a surprise  spicer s departure was abrupt and accompanied other changes in trump s media and legal teams  as an investigation of possible ties between his campaign and russian meddling in the  presidential election widened  after six months in power and still without a major legislative win  trump shuffled some of his closest staff  parting ways with spicer after naming anthony scaramucci as the new white house communications director  spicer had been communications director as well as press secretary following the resignation of mike dubke as director early last month  a republican close to the white house told reuters that trump settled on scaramucci    a political supporter and former goldman sachs banker  for the head media job on thursday and met with him on friday morning to formally offer it to him  a white house official briefed on what happened next said spicer was told of scaramucci s hiring and trump urged spicer to stay on  but spicer    said he did not want to stay on under the terms and conditions described to him and quit  a source close to the white house said   basically donald trump likes scaramucci on tv and saw the communications director job as a way to     make him a top tv surrogate   the source said trump wanted spicer to be press secretary and do much of the communications director s work as well   with scaramucci holding the ceremonial title with no responsibility  and that was the real challenge   at an early afternoon briefing  scaramucci  in his debut before the white house press corps  named sarah sanders as the new press secretary  she had been spicer s deputy  known by insiders as  mooch   the new communications director is a harvard law school educated long islander who founded a hedge fund after leaving goldman  and sold it to join the trump administration   spicer  a veteran washington staffer  was parodied memorably by actress melissa mccarthy on the  saturday night live  tv comedy show for his combative encounters with reporters   i am grateful for sean s work on behalf of my administration and the american people   trump said in a statement   i wish him continued success as he moves on to pursue new opportunities  just look at his great television ratings   spicer will stay on the job through august  from the start  spicer invited controversy  attacking the media in his first appearance as press secretary for reporting what he called inaccurate crowd numbers at trump s jan   inauguration   this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration  period  both in person and around the globe   he said  an assertion that quickly drew scorn  in a twitter post on friday  spicer wrote   it s been an honor   privilege to serve  potus  realdonaldtrump   this amazing country  i will continue my service through august   before trump tapped him for the job of press secretary  spicer was the republican national committee s spokesman  he had previously worked in the administration of former president george w  bush  during that time  he dressed up in an easter bunny costume for the annual white house easter egg roll  spicer and other trump aides shook up white house dealings with the media  including cutting back daily televised news briefings and replacing them with audio briefings only  scaramucci told reporters   i love the president      it s an honor to be here   asked how he was going to right the white house ship  scaramucci said there was nothing to fix    the ship is going in the right direction  i like the team  let me rephrase that  i love the team   he said  separately  special counsel robert mueller  who is investigating the possible trump russia ties  has asked white house officials to preserve any records of a meeting last year between the president s eldest son  donald trump jr   and a russian lawyer  a source with knowledge of the request said on friday  the spokesman for trump s outside legal team  mark corallo  resigned  his departure came amid media reports that the role of marc kasowitz  who had been leading the team  was being reduced  on thursday  attorney general jeff sessions brushed off sharp criticism from trump  saying he loved his job and planned to stay in it  trump took a broad swipe at his administration s top law officers this week in a new york times interview  saying he would not have appointed sessions as attorney general if he had known he would recuse himself  white house unrest was not limited to communications and legal staff  said two officials familiar with the situation  trump has ignored the recommendations of national security adviser h r  mcmaster and his senior director for russia  fiona hill  on dealing with russian president vladimir putin  the officials said  speaking on condition of anonymity  they said mcmaster is frustrated by continuing debate about sending more u s  forces to afghanistan  one official said tension persists between mcmaster and chief white house strategist steve bannon and chief speechwriter stephen miller
