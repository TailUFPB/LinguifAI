washington  reuters    democrats said on wednesday their u s  senate victory in alabama could lead to a sweeping comeback for the party in  elections  while republicans sought to assess blame for a defeat in one of the country s most conservative states  doug jones  a democrat and former federal prosecutor  won the special election on tuesday night after a bitter campaign that drew national attention amid sexual misconduct accusations against conservative republican candidate roy moore  president donald trump had endorsed moore and the loss was a stunning upset for him and fellow republicans  narrowing their majority in the senate to    it also boosted democrats who hope to retake control of congress in elections next november  trump  speaking to reporters at the white house  said the alabama outcome would not affect his policy agenda  republicans are rushing to pass a tax overhaul package by the end of the year  jones is expected to take office in early january after the election results are certified   wish we would have gotten the seat   trump said   a lot of republicans feel differently  they re very happy with the way it turned out   at a news conference in birmingham  alabama  on wednesday  jones said he received congratulatory calls from trump  as well as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  and senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader   some congressional republicans were quick on wednesday to slam former trump strategist steve bannon for his steadfast support of moore  saying it split the party and paved the way for jones  shocking victory  jones    was the first democrat elected to the senate from alabama in a quarter century and the party sees potential nationwide   this campaign has given a lot of people a reason to believe   jones said   schumer said the defeat of moore reflected a distaste among voters for trump s policies  which he said help the wealthy and powerful to the detriment of the middle class   things are looking good for us   schumer told reporters   if they  republicans  continue to run the government for the benefit of the few special powerful wealthy interests  there will be many more alabamas in    some senate republicans expressed relief that moore would not be joining their ranks  including bob corker  a frequent trump critic who is retiring next year     i know we re supposed to cheer for our side of the aisle     but i m really  really happy with what happened for all of us in our nation  for people serving in the senate  to not have to deal with what we were likely going to have to deal with should the outcome have been the other way   corker said   bannon  trump s former chief white house strategist  worked hard for moore as part of his broader campaign against more centrist republican leaders  and his critics were quick to attack on wednesday   this guy does not belong on the national stage    republican representative peter king said on cnn   he s not representing what i stand for  i consider myself a conservative republican      and he sort of parades himself out there with his weird  alt right views that he has  and  to me  it s demeaning the whole governmental and political process   moore  a hard line conservative who was twice removed from his seat on the alabama supreme court for refusing to abide by federal law  became the republican candidate by beating incumbent senator luther strange in a primary race earlier this year  strange had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by republican jeff sessions when he became trump s attorney general  mcconnell and other republican leaders in congress backed strange in that race and then pressured moore to withdraw his candidacy after he faced allegations from several women that he sexually assaulted or pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his  moore    denied the accusations  mcconnell  who has been a frequent bannon target  declined to address bannon s role in the race when speaking to reporters on wednesday   it was quite an impressive election   mcconnell said   it was a big turnout and an unusual day    strange had harsh words for bannon    he has accomplished one thing that i don t think anybody in america thought was possible  and that s getting a democrat elected in the state of alabama   strange said on fox news channel  trump backed strange in the republican primary but then endorsed moore and threw his full support behind him even as other party leaders in washington walked away  trump tried to minimize the damage to his own credibility on wednesday   the reason i originally endorsed luther strange  and his numbers went up mightily   is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election  i was right   he said on twitter   roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him   some republicans defended trump   it had zero to do with donald trump   republican representative bradley byrne of alabama told msnbc  calling the race  a purely weird  unique election   as of wednesday night  moore had not conceded the race to jones  saying in a video statement that there are military and provisional ballots still to be counted and that the campaign was waiting for certification by the secretary of state      we are indeed in a struggle to preserve our republic  our civilization  and our religion and to set free a suffering humanity   he said   and the battle rages on     jones  victory was not expected to affect pending votes in congress on funding the government or the republican overhaul of the tax code  republican congressional leaders have vowed to get the tax changes approved before christmas  the alabama outcome could push democrats to make sexual harassment a key election issue at a time when many powerful men in entertainment  the media and politics   including trump   have faced accusations of misconduct  such a move could help boost support from women   the results also highlighted jones  success in mobilizing  african americans voters  who constituted about  percent of those voting on tuesday and overwhelmingly voted democratic  according to network exit polls   jones also fared surprisingly well in suburban counties outside of cities such as birmingham and huntsville  a trend that has republicans nervous ahead of next year s elections  when dozens of congressional districts are likely to be highly competitive  part of the reason for that in alabama was that many upscale republican voters did not vote as compared with last year s presidential election
