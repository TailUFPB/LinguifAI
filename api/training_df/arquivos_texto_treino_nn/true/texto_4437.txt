washington  reuters    republicans are poised to repeal a u s  senate rule that allows minority party democrats to block confirmation of supreme court nominees  including president donald trump s choice of neil gorsuch for the lifetime post  the expected rule change  amid deepening partisanship in a chamber known as  the world s greatest deliberative body   is raising questions over whether there could be a future move to prohibit  filibusters  on legislation  here is how the filibuster has been used and what curtailing it could mean  it is a procedural move  often by a minority of senators  to block legislation or supreme court nominations that typically enjoy the support of majority party senators  in this case  republicans  according to senate historians   filibuster  comes from a dutch word meaning  pirate   the practice became popular in the  and was also used by house of representatives members  until that body became so large with an expanding u s  population as to require stricter rules governing floor debates  senate democrats have gathered more than the  votes they need in the  seat chamber to mount a filibuster against gorsuch  a conservative appeals court judge  the first u s  president is said to have observed that the senate was created to cool legislation from the hot tempered house just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea  the filibuster is just such a coolant  when a bill or supreme court nomination hits the senate floor  senators who oppose it can talk until at least  senators band together to limit debate  that gives a minority of senators huge power  if a bill or a nomination fails to draw the needed  votes  it is effectively killed  the all time record for a senate filibuster speech    hours   minutes   was set by the late segregationist senator strom thurmond  who tried unsuccessfully in  to kill a civil rights bill  this week  democratic senator jeff merkley delivered the eighth longest speech  against gorsuch  that was  hours   minutes  it is senate slang for banning filibusters through a rules change by the majority party  in recent years  as filibusters have added to senate gridlock  there have been threats to execute the nuclear option  groups of senators  known as  gangs   have sometimes defused the threats  in   democratic senate majority leader harry reid deployed the nuclear option when he became fed up with republican filibusters against then president barack obama s nominees  he changed senate rules to ban filibusters against the president s judicial and executive branch nominees but left it in place for supreme court appointees  now  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  is thought to be ready to expand the ban to supreme court nominees  mcconnell has told reporters he will not broaden the ban on filibusters to legislation and does not believe republican senators would want to do that  some political scientists think democrats have more to gain than republicans by ending filibusters on legislation   my sense has always been that democratic policy priorities have suffered more from the filibuster than republican priorities   said george washington university political science professor sarah binder  that is because democrats are more likely than republicans to back an expansion of government programs  which generally requires legislation  but binder said she could imagine democrats or republicans trying to score a major win on an issue central to their constituencies  for democrats  no filibuster could mean trying to pass another major healthcare or campaign finance reform or new gun controls  for republicans  some sort of major deregulation of an industry or changes to  entitlement  programs such as social security  medicare or medicaid
