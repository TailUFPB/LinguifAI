washington  reuters    president donald trump said on tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow americans to buy stripped down health insurance policies  a step some experts say would further undermine the obamacare law that trump opposes  unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the  law in a congress led by his own party  trump indicated he would take unilateral action  he offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain  great  competitive healthcare  costing the united states  nothing   the expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some obamacare requirements  these include mandatory coverage for  essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care  prescription drugs and mental health treatment   it would also expand the amount of time people can use short term medical insurance plans  which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits  people could use those plans for up to a year  compared to three months under current law    i ll also be signing something  probably this week  which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare   trump told reporters in the oval office   with congress the way it is  i decided to take it upon myself   trump added  saying the plan is  largely worked out   white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump will make his announcement  by the end of friday   trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines  the association health plans  for instance  could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements  such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under obamacare  potentially making them attractive to people in other states  it is unclear when these plans would become available  it is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the  open enrollment period  which begins nov     experts questioned trump s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation  the action could open trump to legal challenges from democratic state attorneys general  who have said they will sue trump if he tries to destroy obamacare  the plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the  affordable care act  dubbed obamacare  that could further destabilize those markets  where insurers have already exited the markets altogether  pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the trump administration   experts said trump s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the obamacare markets  raising premiums and effectively eroding the law s protection that people with pre existing medical conditions cannot be charged more   there s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets   said craig garthwaite  director of the healthcare program at northwestern university s kellogg school of management  referring to the trump administration    it unwinds the ability of people with pre existing conditions to get insurance under the aca   garthwaite said  republicans have failed to make good on their seven year promise to repeal and replace obamacare  the signature domestic policy achievement of trump s democratic predecessor barack obama  gutting obamacare was a top trump campaign promise  trump  who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it  implode   has undermined obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions  last week  the u s  department of health and human services issued a rule that will let businesses and non profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co payment  trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under obamacare  the payments are estimated to be about   billion this year and help lower out of pocket medical costs for low income consumers  insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums   his administration has slashed the obamacare advertising budget  halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law
