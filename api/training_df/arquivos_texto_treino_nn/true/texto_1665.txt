washington  reuters    the trump administration and top u s  senate republicans pushed on tuesday for action on a bill to dismantle obamacare  but time was running out and they were still hunting for the votes needed to pass their latest attempt to gut the  healthcare law   vice president mike pence lunched with republican lawmakers on capitol hill to urge them to approve the legislation introduced last week by republican senators lindsey graham and bill cassidy  pence said president donald trump backs the bill   now is the time  we have  days  to pass it  pence said before the lunch  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  who fell a single vote short of securing passage of another healthcare overhaul bill in july  said the graham cassidy legislation  has a great deal of support   but would not commit to bringing it to the senate floor for consideration  after sept    the last day of the fiscal year  procedural rules will make it much more difficult for republicans  the bill after oct   would need  votes in the  seat senate to be brought up for consideration  rather than a simple majority until the end of the month  despite controlling both chambers of congress and the white house  republicans this year have failed to make good on their seven year effort to dismantle a law that was the top legislative achievement of trump s democratic predecessor barack obama  having suffered the humiliating failure in july  republican congressional leaders only want to hold a vote on legislation they know can pass   at the end of the day  i really believe we re going to get  republican votes   graham told reporters  but he would not say how many committed votes he has now in a senate that his party controls    dismantling the affordable care act  known informally as obamacare  was a central campaign promise last year by trump  republicans call that law a government overreach into the healthcare system  democrats point out that it has expanded health insurance coverage to some  million more people  the new bill could give republicans one last shot this year on healthcare  it proposes to replace obamacare with a system giving states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programs  it would allow states to opt out of certain obamacare protections for consumers and waive regulations requiring insurers to cover certain health benefits  it also would end the obamacare expansion of the medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled   similar to proposals that were considered in the senate in july  we believe the graham cassidy amendment would result in millions of americans losing their health insurance coverage  destabilize health insurance markets  and decrease access to affordable coverage and care   said james madara  chief executive of the american medical association  senate democratic leader chuck schumer said republicans were  grossly irresponsible  to consider the cassidy graham legislation before getting a full assessment of its effects from the non partisan congressional budget office  several republicans  including the same three senators whose  no  votes blocked the earlier bill in july  are still undecided  including graham s close friend john mccain  a bipartisan group of  governors wrote a letter to senate leaders asking them not to consider the cassidy graham bill  and instead urged support for bipartisan talks on healthcare legislation now going on in the senate health committee  alaska governor bill walker was among those who signed the letter  one of his state s two senators  republican lisa murkowski  is among those undecided on the cassidy graham bill  meanwhile the clock is ticking  the senate will not be in session wednesday through sunday  the senate finance committee said it will hold a hearing on the bill next monday  graham said house of representatives speaker paul ryan has told him that if the senate passes the cassidy graham bill  the house will  too  ryan has told mcconnell that the separate bipartisan healthcare effort in the senate that aims to protect some subsidies being paid to insurance companies to help people buy insurance policies would not be viable in the house  according to a source familiar with the discussion who asked not to be identified  trump s administration has repeatedly threatened to cut off payments made directly to insurers  called cost sharing reductions  that help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income consumers  it faced a deadline on wednesday to make the payments for the month of september  and insurers expected to receive the payments   if the bill were to go through  it would likely affect revenue at most insurers  including small companies like centene corp  cnc n  and molina healthcare  moh n  that focus on medicaid  and larger more diversified companies like anthem inc  antm n   aetna inc  aet n  and unitedhealth group  unh n   wall street analysts said  aetna shares were off   percent on tuesday and unitedhealth was down   percent while the stocks of hospital chains were also lower on the possibility of less government funding  including hca healthcare s  hca n  decline of  percent
