washington  reuters    the anti establishment wave that propelled donald trump to the white house is developing into a political force that perhaps even the president cannot control and could shake his republican party ahead of next year s congressional elections  that became clear on tuesday night when trump s favored candidate in an alabama senate primary  luther strange  was soundly defeated by roy moore  an archconservative who cast himself as an inheritor of trump s insurgent mantle   moore s win is expected to encourage more outsider candidates to challenge republican incumbents ahead of the november  elections  where the party will seek to maintain its control of the senate and house of representatives  crucial to enacting trump s agenda  conservative donors were  ecstatic  and  beside themselves  after moore s victory  said ken cuccinelli  head of the senate conservatives fund  which spent about    in alabama to help moore  cuccinelli said he believed conservatives could build on moore s victory   it will have ripple effects   it s going to have effects all across the country   he said  trump  who appeared at a campaign rally for strange last week  congratulated moore on his win and wished him success against democrat doug jones in the december special election to fill the seat held by jeff sessions before he became u s  attorney general in february  strange had been appointed to fill the seat until the election   congratulations to roy moore on his republican primary win in alabama  luther strange started way back   ran a good race  roy  win in dec   trump wrote on twitter   establishment republicans have been wary of insurgent firebrands since the  congressional elections  that year  donations from conservative groups helped bring about primary wins by ultra conservative candidates christine o donnell in delaware and sharron angle in nevada  but both suffered crushing defeats to democrats in the general election  in november   elections will be held for all  seats in the u s  house and  seats in the  member senate  including  democrats and eight republicans in fights that will likely be cast as a referendum on trump s legislative agenda  the republican establishment poured millions of dollars into the alabama nominating primary to help strange  giving him a   million money advantage over moore   some republican strategists fear that if more extreme republicans win primaries  it would give democrats a better chance of winning in the general election  that is less of a concern in conservative alabama  where moore will likely prevail  but is a bigger risk in states with greater numbers of moderate voters  such as arizona and nevada  where republican senators jeff flake and dean heller are already top targets for conservative groups  also this week  republican senator bob corker of tennessee said he would not run again in   a decision that was widely seen as trying to avoid a potential primary fight   i know we are all listening and watching very closely  trying to understand the message that s being sent   senator john cornyn of texas  the no   senate republican  said of the alabama result   while trump endorsed strange  his former adviser steve bannon backed moore  as did several outside political groups that support the president s agenda  bannon  and his influential news site  breitbart  are poised to spearhead attacks on republican incumbents  while political groups aligned with trump that can raise unlimited sums of money will help those challengers compete with better financed establishment candidates  having served as a high profile state supreme court justice for years  moore was better known than most insurgent candidates  allowing him to neutralize attacks from establishment groups  said constantin querard  a conservative republican strategist in arizona  the road will be tougher for outsiders in arizona and nevada  he said  still  candidates such as flake will be hampered by their ties to the d c  establishment  especially with the failure this year by republicans to deliver on long standing promises to repeal the obamacare healthcare law despite controlling the white house and congress  querard said that flake  is seen as the poster child for everything that is wrong in washington   jonathan gray  a republican consultant in alabama  said moore s win should frighten vulnerable republicans worried about primary challenges not so much because trump s endorsement failed to sway voters  but because the money spent at the behest of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell to back strange was fruitless    the people of alabama saw washington telling them what to do  and they thumbed their nose at it   gray said
