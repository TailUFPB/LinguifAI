geneva  reuters    u s  president donald trump risks driving iran towards nuclear proliferation and worsening a standoff with north korea if washington ends a nuclear deal with tehran  former u s  secretary of state john kerry said late on thursday  kerry  who negotiated the  deal between iran and world powers  was speaking a week after trump refused to certify that tehran was in compliance with it  amid growing tensions with pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs   if you want to negotiate with  north korean leader  kim jong un  and your goal is to avoid war and try to be able to have a diplomatic resolution  the worst thing you can do is first threaten to destroy his country in the united nations   kerry said  he was speaking in a private lecture delivered at geneva s graduate institute   and secondly  screw around with the deal that has already been made because the message is  don t make a deal with the united states  they won t keep their word   he said  the nuclear deal places iran under tough restraints  including inspections  round the clock surveillance and tracking every ounce of uranium produced  kerry said   we would notice an uptick in their enrichment  like that   he said  snapping his fingers   and nobody that i know of with common sense can understand what the virtue is in accelerating a confrontation with the possibility that they might decide they want to break out and make it  a nuclear bomb  now instead of  or  or  years from now   kerry  a former senator who headed the u s  senate foreign relations committee  told swiss media that trump s leaving the iranian deal s fate to congress was  very dangerous  and opened the door to  party politics   congress cannot unilaterally renegotiate a multilateral accord  the geneva daily le temps quoted him as saying   it is possible that congress would make an unreasonable decision that would put iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei in a very complicated political situation that could force him to retaliate  it s a slippery slope    khamenei said on wednesday that tehran would stick to its accord as long as the other signatories respected it  but would  shred  the deal if washington pulled out  state tv reported  if iran violated the accord  u n  sanctions would snap back into place  kerry told the audience   moreover  at that point in time folks  we have a year of break up  we have all the time that we need in the world to be able to bomb their facilities into submission   ending the deal could lead to iran hiding fissile production facilities  deep in a mountain where we have no insight    so the scenario that trump opens up by saying  let s get rid of the deal  is actually proliferation  far more damaging and dangerous   kerry said
