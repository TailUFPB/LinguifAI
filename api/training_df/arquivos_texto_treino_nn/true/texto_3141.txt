miami  reuters    president donald trump on friday ordered tighter restrictions on americans traveling to cuba and a clampdown on u s  business dealings with the caribbean island s military  saying he was canceling former president barack obama s  terrible and misguided deal  with havana  laying out his new cuba policy in a speech in miami  trump  signed a presidential directive rolling back parts of obama s historic opening to the communist ruled country after a  diplomatic breakthrough between the two former cold war foes  but trump left in place many of obama s changes  including the reopened u s  embassy in havana  even as he sought to show he was making good on a campaign promise to take a tougher line against cuba  especially over its human rights record   we will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer   trump told a cheering crowd in miami s cuban american enclave of little havana  including republican senator marco rubio of florida  who helped forge the new restrictions on cuba   effective immediately  i am canceling the last administration s completely one sided deal with cuba   trump declared as he made a full throated assault on the government of cuban president raul castro  cuba later denounced the move as a setback in u s  cuban relations  saying trump had been badly advised and was resorting to  coercive methods of the past  that were doomed to fail  the government remained willing to engage in  respectful dialogue   it said in a statement  trump s revised approach calls for stricter enforcement of a longtime ban on americans going to cuba as tourists  and seeks to prevent u s  dollars from being used to fund what the trump administration sees as a repressive military dominated government   tmsnrt rs   but  facing pressure from u s  businesses and even some fellow republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with cuba  the president chose to leave intact some of his democratic predecessor s steps toward normalization      the new policy bans most u s  business transactions with the armed forces business enterprises group  a cuban conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy  but it makes some exceptions  including for air and sea travel  according to u s  officials  this will essentially shield u s  airlines and cruise lines serving the island    we do not want u s  dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of cuba   trump said  pledging that u s  sanctions would not be lifted until cuba frees political prisoners and holds free elections  while the changes are far reaching  they appear to be less sweeping than many u s  pro engagement advocates had feared      trump based his partial reversal of obama s cuba measures largely on human rights grounds  his critics  however  have questioned why his administration is now singling out cuba for human rights abuses but downplaying the issue in other parts of the world  including saudi arabia  a close u s  ally trump visited last month where political parties and protests are banned  trump  however  stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in  after more than five decades of hostilities  he also will not cut off recently resumed direct u s  cuba commercial flights or cruise ship travel  though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall  the administration  according to one white house official  has no intention of  disrupting  existing business ventures such as one struck under obama by starwood hotels inc  which is owned by marriott international inc  to manage a historic havana hotel      nor does trump plan to reinstate limits that obama lifted on the amount of the island s coveted rum and cigars that americans can bring home for personal use      still  it will be the latest attempt by trump to overturn parts of obama s presidential legacy  he has already pulled the united states out of a major international climate treaty and is trying to scrap his predecessor s landmark healthcare program  when obama announced the detente in   he said that decades of u s  efforts to achieve change in cuba by isolating the island had failed and it was time to try a new approach  critics of the rapprochement said obama was giving too much away without extracting concessions from the cuban government  castro s government has clearly stated it does not intend to change its one party political system  trump aides say obama s efforts amounted to  appeasement  and have done nothing to advance political freedoms in cuba  while benefiting the cuban government financially   it s hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administration s terrible and misguided deal with the castro regime   trump said in miami  international human rights groups say  however  that renewed u s  efforts to isolate the island could worsen the situation by empowering cuban hard liners  the cuban government  which has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms  had no immediate comment  but ordinary cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the united states with potential economic fallout for them   it s like we are returning to the cold war   said cuban designer idania del rio  who joined a group of friends in a hotel in old havana to watch the speech in english on cnn  trump announced his new approach at the manuel artime theater in the heart of the united states  largest cuban american and cuban exile community  whose support aides believe helped him win florida in the election  the venue is named after a leader of the failed u s  backed bay of pigs invasion of cuba in  against fidel castro s revolutionary government   i have trust in trump to do the right thing when it comes to cuba   said jorge saurez    a retired physician in little havana  trump s vow to keep the broader decades old u s  economic embargo on cuba firmly in place drew criticism from some u s  farmers  especially growers of corn  soybeans and rice  obama s d√©tente has already lifted exports and raised hopes for more gains  which they said were now in doubt      mexico s foreign ministry urged the united states and cuba to resolve their differences  via dialogue   but venezuelan president nicolas maduro  whose leftist government is cuba s main regional ally  slammed trump s tightening of restrictions as an  offence  against latin america   his speech was aggressive and threatening      revealing his contempt and ignorance   president nicolas maduro said in a speech   we reject donald trump s declarations against our brother cuba  it is an offence against latin america   the biggest change in travel policy will be that americans making educational people to people trips  one of the most popular authorized categories  can no longer go to the island on their own but only on group tours  trump s aides said the aim was to close off a path for americans seeking beach vacations in a country where u s  tourism is still officially banned  u s  senator jeff flake  one of the republican party s most vocal advocates for easing rules  on u s  dealings with cuba  called for a vote on legislation lifting restrictions on american travel there  but the republican leadership in congress has long blocked such a move  and it appears unlikely to budge  under trump s order  the treasury and commerce departments will be given  days to begin writing new regulations  which will not take effect until they are complete  in contentious deliberations leading up to the new policy  some aides argued that trump  a former real estate magnate who won the presidency vowing to unleash u s  business  would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the cuban market  but other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to cuban americans
