washington  reuters    president donald trump s administration is exploring hardening its approach toward pakistan to crack down on pakistan based militants launching attacks in neighboring afghanistan  two u s  officials tell reuters   potential trump administration responses being discussed include expanding u s  drone strikes  redirecting or withholding some aid to pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading pakistan s status as a major non nato ally  the two officials said  speaking on condition of anonymity  other u s  officials are skeptical of the prospects for success  arguing that years of previous u s  efforts to curb pakistan s support for militant groups have failed  and that already strengthening u s  ties to india  pakistan s arch enemy  undermine chances of a breakthrough with islamabad   u s  officials say generally they seek greater cooperation with pakistan  not a rupture in ties  once the administration finishes a regional review  due by mid july  of the strategy guiding the  year old war in afghanistan   the discussions include officials from across the trump administration  including the white house and the defense department  both of which declined comment on the review before its completion  precise actions have yet to be decided  but pakistan s embassy in washington warned against  scapegoating  pakistan to explain the stalemate in afghanistan  pointing instead to afghanistan s own troubled internal dynamics  it also noted past pakistani efforts to battle militants and expressed willingness to work with the united states and afghanistan on border management   singling out pakistan and pinning the entire blame on pakistan for the situation in afghanistan is neither fair nor accurate  nor is it borne out by the ground realities   said abid saeed  press minister at the embassy  experts on america s longest war argue that militant safe havens in pakistan have allowed taliban linked insurgents a place to plot deadly strikes in afghanistan and regroup after ground offensives   although long mindful of pakistan  the trump administration  in recent weeks has put more emphasis on the relationship with islamabad in discussions as it hammers out a regional strategy to be presented to trump  who took office in late january  one official said   we ve never really fully articulated what our strategy towards pakistan is  the strategy will more clearly say what we want from pakistan specifically   the u s  official said  speaking on condition of anonymity  other u s  officials question whether any mix of carrots and sticks can get islamabad to change its behavior  at the end of the day  washington needs a partner  even if an imperfect one  in nuclear armed pakistan  they say  the united states is again poised to deploy thousands more troops in afghanistan  an acknowledgment that u s  backed forces are not winning and taliban militants are resurgent  without more pressure on militants within pakistan who target afghanistan  experts say additional u s  troop deployments will fail to meet their ultimate objective  to pressure the taliban to eventually negotiate peace   i believe there will be a much harder u s  line on pakistan going forward than there has been in the past   hamdullah mohib  the afghan ambassador to the united states  told reuters  without citing specific measures under review   kabul has long been critical of pakistan s role in afghanistan   pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militants safe haven on its territory  it bristles at u s  claims that pakistan s spy agency  the inter services intelligence  isi  directorate  has ties to haqqani network militants blamed for some of the deadliest attacks in afghanistan  a senior pakistani government source  speaking on condition of anonymity  doubted the trump administration would press too hard  saying   they don t want to push pakistan to abandon their war against terrorism   pakistani officials point towards the toll militancy has taken on the country  since   almost   civilians and nearly   pakistani security forces have been killed as a result of militancy  according to the south asia terrorism portal  which tracks violence  but the pentagon  in a report to congress released on tuesday  explicitly accused elements of pakistan s government of supporting afghanistan focused militant groups  including the taliban and haqqani network  who it said retained  freedom of action  within pakistan   it called pakistan  the most influential external actor affecting afghan stability   pakistan won the status as a major non nato ally in  from the george bush administration  in what was at the time seen in part as recognition of its importance in the u s  battle against al qaeda and taliban insurgents  the status is mainly symbolic  allowing limited benefits such as giving pakistan faster access to surplus u s  military hardware  yanking the title would be seen by pakistan as a major blow  some u s  officials and experts on the region scoff at the title   pakistan is not an ally  it s not north korea or iran  but it s not an ally   said bruce riedel  a pakistan expert at the brookings institution think tank   lisa curtis  prior to becoming senior director for south and central asia at the national security council  co authored a report with husain haqqani  pakistan s former ambassador to washington  in which they recommended the trump administration warn pakistan the status could be revoked in six months    thinking of pakistan as an ally will continue to create problems for the next administration as it did for the last one   said the february report  published by the conservative hudson institute think tank  it was unclear how seriously the trump administration was considering the proposal  the growing danger to afghanistan from suspected pakistan based militants was underscored by a devastating may  truck bomb that killed more than  people and wounded  in kabul    afghanistan s main intelligence agency said the attack   one of the deadliest in memory in the afghan capital   had been carried out by the haqqani network with assistance from pakistan  a charge islamabad denies  washington believes the strikes appeared to be the work of the haqqani network  u s  officials told reuters  u s  frustration over the haqqani s presence in pakistan has been building for years  the united states designated the haqqani network as a terrorist organization in   u s  navy admiral mike mullen  then the top u s  military officer  told congress in  that the haqqani network was a  veritable arm  of the isi  any u s  pivot in its approach would be sharply different than the one taken at the start of the obama administration  when u s  officials sought to court pakistani leaders  including army chief general ashfaq kayani  david sedney  who served as obama s deputy assistant secretary of defense for afghanistan  pakistan and central asia from  to   said the attempt to turn islamabad into a strategic partner was a  disaster    it didn t affect pakistan s behavior one bit  in fact  i would argue it made pakistan s behavior worse   sedney said  more drones  cash cut off pakistan has received more than   billion in u s  assistance since   including more than   billion in so called coalition support funds  csf   a u s  defense department program to reimburse allies that have incurred costs in supporting counter insurgency operations  last year  the pentagon decided not to pay pakistan   million in csf funding after then u s  secretary of defense ash carter declined to sign authorization that pakistan was taking adequate action against the haqqani network       u s  officials said the trump administration was discussing withholding at least some assistance to pakistan  curtis  report singled out the aid as a target  but u s  aid cuts could cede even more influence to china  which already has committed nearly   billion in investments in pakistan   another option under review is broadening a drone campaign to penetrate deeper into pakistan to target haqqani fighters and other militants blamed for attacks in afghanistan  u s  officials and a pakistan expert said   now the americans  will be  saying  you aren t taking out our enemies  so therefore we are taking them out ourselves   said the pakistan expert  who declined to be identified  pakistan s army chief of staff last week criticized  unilateral actions  such as drone strikes as  counterproductive and against  the  spirit of ongoing cooperation and intelligence sharing being diligently undertaken by pakistan
