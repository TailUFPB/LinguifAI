washington  reuters    the u s  justice department  in the face of rising pressure from capitol hill  named former fbi chief robert mueller on wednesday as special counsel to investigate alleged russian interference in the  u s  election and possible collusion between president donald trump s campaign and moscow  the move followed a week in which the white house was thrown into uproar after trump fired fbi director james comey  democrats and some of the president s fellow republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether russia tried to sway the outcome of november s election in favor of trump and against democrat hillary clinton  trump  whose anger over the allegations has grown in recent weeks  took the news calmly and used it to rally his team to unite  move on and refocus on his stalled agenda  a senior white house official said   we are all in this together   trump told his team  the official said  trump said in a statement after the justice department announcement he looked forward to a quick resolution   as i have stated many times  a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign and any foreign entity   he said  mueller said in a statement tweeted by cbs news   i accept this responsibility and will discharge it to the best of my ability    trump  who said in a speech earlier on wednesday that no  politician in history  has been treated worse or more unfairly   has long bristled at the notion that russia played any role in his election victory  the russia issue has  however  clouded his early months in office  moscow has denied the conclusion by u s  intelligence agencies that it meddled in the campaign  pressure on the white house intensified after trump fired comey  who had been leading a federal probe into the matter  and allegations that trump had asked comey to end the fbi investigation into ties between trump s first national security adviser  michael flynn  and russia  that raised questions about whether the president improperly attempted to interfere with a federal investigation  the issue spilled over onto wall street on wednesday  where the s p  and the dow had their biggest one day declines since september as investor hopes for tax cuts and other pro business policies faded amid the political tumult  the justice department announcement came after the market close   my decision  to appoint a special counsel  is not the finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted  i have made no such determination   deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said in a statement announcing the special counsel   i determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the american people to have full confidence in the outcome   he said  trump heard about mueller s appointment from his white house lawyer don mcgahn about  minutes before it was made public  the senior white house official said  trump assembled his inner circle in the oval office   vice president mike pence  chief of staff reince preibus  economic adviser gary cohn  senior strategist steve bannon  and others   and gave them a pep talk  dictating the statement that was soon released  trump told them the appointment would allow them to refer questions to mueller  giving them space to focus on policies such as tax reform  lawmakers on capitol hill generally welcomed the justice department action and praised mueller for his integrity  but house and senate republican leaders said they would go on with their own investigations of the russia matter   a special counsel is very much needed in this situation and deputy attorney general rosenstein has done the right thing   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a statement  republican house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte said he was confident mueller  will conduct a thorough and fair investigation   a discordant note was sounded by republican representative jason chaffetz  chairman of the house of representatives oversight committee  who praised mueller s credentials but said   i don t think they should have appointed someone    i have not seen any evidence of actual collusion  where is the actual crime that they think they need a special prosecutor to prosecute   chaffetz told fox news  mueller    was decorated as a marine corps officer during the vietnam war  a former federal prosecutor  he is known for his tough  no nonsense managerial style  appointed by republican president george w  bush  he became fbi director one week before the sept      attacks  he was asked by democratic president barack obama in  to stay on for two more years and was replaced by comey in   mueller was credited with transforming the fbi  putting more resources into counterterrorism investigations and improving its cooperation with other u s  government agencies  although mueller will serve at the pleasure of rosenstein  the job comes with independence and autonomy  some past independent investigations have stretched for years  kenneth starr  who investigated former president bill clinton  probed allegations surrounding clinton s past real estate deals but later expanded the inquiry into his relations with then white house intern monica lewinsky  leading to clinton s impeachment by the house  the white house was conducting interviews on wednesday of candidates to replace comey as head of the fbi  a senior administration official said former democratic vice presidential candidate and senator joe lieberman  one of those interviewed by trump  was among the leading candidates  trump s spokesman  sean spicer  said others being interviewed were acting fbi director andrew mccabe  former oklahoma governor frank keating and former senior fbi official richard mcfeely
