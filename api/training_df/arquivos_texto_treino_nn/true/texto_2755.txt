washington  reuters    president donald trump s effort to reshape influential u s  courts by stocking them with conservative judges faces at least one significant impediment  some of the courts best placed to thwart his agenda have liberal majorities that are likely to stay in place in the short term  those courts  including an influential washington appeals court and two appellate courts that ruled against trump in cases involving his travel ban  all had an influx of fresh liberal blood under president barack obama    trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the democrats  control of those three  appellate  circuits   said arthur hellman  a professor at the university of pittsburgh school of law  after eight years in office  obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts  when he left the white house in january  nine of the  federal appeals courts had a majority of democratic appointed judges  the federal appeals courts  divided into  geographic regions plus two based in the district of columbia  often have the final say in major legal disputes  the conservative leaning u s  supreme court  which now includes trump appointee neil gorsuch  can overrule appeals court decisions  but hears only a small number of cases  which leaves lower court rulings in place most of the time   the appeals courts can shape the interpretation of such issues as abortion  religious freedom  voting rights and race   appellate court judges serve lifetime terms  and so far trump s opportunities to appoint new ones have been mostly limited to courts that already lean conservative  among the courts conservatives would most like to shift are the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals and the richmond  virginia based  u s  circuit court of appeals  both of which ruled against trump in cases challenging the republican president s executive orders temporarily banning travel to the united states by people from six predominantly muslim countries  the supreme court partially revived the ban last month  the ideological balance of those courts has provided some hope to trump s legal opponents  including democratic state attorneys general  who have already sued the administration over the travel ban and other issues   strategic attorneys general can likely chart a path through democratic leaning courts   making it harder on the trump administration to pursue its agenda through executive action   said sarah binder  a scholar the nonpartisan brookings institution think tank  thanks in part to efforts by the republican led senate in the final two years of obama s presidency to block the democratic president s judicial appointments  trump has  appeals court slots to fill  according to the federal judiciary s administrative office  the senate judiciary committee approved two of trump s appeals court nominees on thursday  in some of the key courts  new vacancies in the near term are more likely to be in slots currently filled by republican appointees  so trump s early appointments will be unlikely to change the court balance  a case in point is the announcement this week by republican appointee janice rogers brown on the washington appeals court that she plans to step down   in washington  the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit is often called the second highest court in the land  in part because it hears a large number of cases concerning major government regulations on issues such as the environment and labor   democratic appointees hold a   advantage among the  active judges   of the democratic appointees  judge david tatel is  and judge judith rogers is   the next oldest is merrick garland at   obama made four appointments to the court  the oldest of whom is   the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals is also stacked against trump  out of  full time judges  democratic presidents appointed  and republican presidents seven  the oldest democratic appointee  liberal icon stephen reinhardt  is  years old  the   circuit judges appointed by president bill clinton who still work full time range in age from  to   and none have given any indication they plan to reduce their caseloads   the court currently has four vacancies  but three of those seats are based in states   california  oregon and hawaii   with two democratic senators who are likely to resist attempts to place extreme conservatives on the court  those dynamics make it extremely unlikely that trump will be able to significantly alter the  circuit s orientation  hellman said   the virginia based  circuit has a   majority of democratic appointees and no current vacancies  the oldest democratic appointee is judge robert king  who is   leonard leo  executive vice president of the conservative federalist society  who has advised the white house on judicial nominations  is optimistic about trump s long term prospects   it takes time to recalibrate the federal courts   he said     in the meantime  leo said  every slot matters  since conservative judges on liberal majority courts can offer critical dissents in important cases and serve a kind of signaling function to the supreme court
