washington  reuters    donald trump took power in january pledging to overhaul a global order that he said cheated middle class americans with a promise to tear up trade agreements and impose tariffs on china and mexico  some of trump s policy advisers named allies like germany and japan as possible targets for economic retaliation  fast forward almost  days into trump s presidency and the world s most powerful finance officials  gathered in washington for the international monetary fund spring meetings  have found an administration that is far from the disruptive force trump promised  although trump did act on his campaign promise to tear up a  nation pacific trade pact that had been the cornerstone of president barack obama s asian pivot  he has taken a much softer stance on other issues  he has refrained from pulling out of the north american free trade agreement  did not carry out a pledge to label china a currency cheat  and his administration has signaled the united states may stay in the paris climate accord  constraints being put on trump by congress and the courts on issues ranging from healthcare to immigration that would have filtered into the economy and the slow pace with which he is filling key administration jobs have played a role  and some foreign policy makers say they are still not sure who their counterparts are in the trump administration  but these policy makers said that important initial decisions have been far more centrist than might have been expected  the european union s commissioner for economic and financial affairs  pierre moscovici  summed up a widely shared sentiment as he highlighted how two people at the top of trump s economic team   treasury secretary steven mnuchin and gary cohn  director of the national economic council   have curbed the worst fears over the young u s  presidency   we have the feeling that mnuchin and cohn are sensible people with whom we can discuss things  who are conscious of what an open economy requires   moscovici told reuters in an interview  the european union s view of a more pragmatic administration was shared by mexico  which attracted some of trump s greatest ire  trump s threat to impose punitive tariffs on mexican exports sent the peso currency tumbling  but it has since recovered  mexico s finance undersecretary  vanessa rubio marquez  said  discussions with the trump administration so far have become  anchored  around a handful of issues  that mexico would be able to deal with     there is still a lot of uncertainty   she said in a seminar on wednesday  but  dialogue has been more structured  more constant   what trump might mean for the u s  and world economies has preoccupied central bankers  investors and analysts since the new president took office promising a virtual revolution in the way the united states relates to the rest of the world  though much about trump s policies remain unformed as the administration approaches the  day mark  the more extreme risks   such as a trade war or a budget busting fiscal program that unhinges inflation   seem to have receded   my belief is that a multilateral framework promoting free trade will continue  there won t be huge changes to that   bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda told reporters on thursday  in remarks on thursday  mnuchin said tax reform remained a priority as are other steps to boost u s  growth  but he said the hope for faster growth would mean a stronger world economy  and that it was constructive to coordinate policies through international organizations like the group of    this administration is willing to reach out and get ideas from the outside   mnuchin told top level bankers at a conference organized in parallel with the imf meeting  there are still risks  the trump administration said on thursday it would embark on a study of whether cheap steel imports from china and other countries were damaging national security  and there are still huge gaps in personnel at key bodies like treasury and commerce   many of the top jobs are still vacant   said one european diplomat who was attending the imf meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity   nobody outside the u s  really knows who is the most powerful or influential one at moment   the official said
