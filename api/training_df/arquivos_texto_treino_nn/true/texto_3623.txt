washington  reuters    the budget proposal unveiled by the white house on tuesday cut all funding to a department of homeland security program known as  countering violent extremism   which provides grants to communities to counter radicalism through outreach  the program  whose roots go back to the obama administration  has come under scrutiny by the trump administration and some congressional republicans who favor law enforcement  rather than community outreach  to fight what they see as a growing islamic extremist threat  at the beginning of the administration  some white house and dhs officials considered changing the name of the program to  countering islamic extremism   and refocusing the funding only on grants that dealt with the islamic community   not other communities that may have extremist views like white supremacists  the trump administration has frozen   million in grants allocated at the end of the obama administration under the countering violent extremism program and has yet to reallocate the funds   the funding cuts proposed by the budget would reduce the   million currently allocated for the program down to zero for fiscal year    congress must vote to pass the budget and it will likely be amended before being enacted
