frankfort  ky  san francisco  reuters    for nearly three years  democrats and former president barack obama pointed to kentucky as one of the affordable care act s biggest success stories  a poor  rural state that straddles the north and south  kentucky was an early adopter of the healthcare law commonly known as obamacare and saw one of the country s largest drops in the uninsured rate  now kentucky is poised for a new distinction  to be the first state to save money by reducing the number of people on medicaid  the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled and a central tenet of obamacare  if successful  kentucky would provide a roadmap for other states who are worried about paying an increasing share for people on medicaid   a new republican health law that passed the u s  house of representatives on thursday  along with state initiatives like kentucky s  would dramatically change the national healthcare system and cut more than   billion from medicaid over the next  years   the republican bill still faces a long road ahead in the u s  senate and its final passage is far from assured  making initiatives like kentucky s all the more important   kentucky has proposed to lessen its financial burden before it grows by reducing the number of residents on medicaid by nearly   within five years  saving more than   million in the process   for a graphic click tmsnrt rs   kentucky s plan also calls for new work requirements for able bodied adults to get insurance  plus  it would establish new fees for all members based on income and lock out some people who miss a payment or fail to re enroll  by following these proposed rules  kentucky believes medicaid enrollees will over time graduate from medicaid to private and employer insurance plans    one of the most remarkable lies that has perpetrated in recent years in the healthcare community in america is that expanded medicaid was working well in kentucky   republican governor matt bevin  who is leading the state effort  told reuters from the governor s mansion in frankfort  kentucky  that view is in line with president donald trump s administration  which has criticized obamacare s medicaid expansion and urged states to pursue similar medicaid reforms to what kentucky is now attempting    if kentucky is successful  you ll see this spread through the more conservative leaning states  it s possible even a democratic blue state could do it   said george huang  director and senior municipal healthcare research analyst at wells fargo securities   it s the flexibility that some states are seeking    kentucky  a state trump won handily last november  has been devastated by the loss of coal mining jobs and an opioid epidemic  the state sits near the bottom of health rankings for smoking rates  cancer deaths and diabetes   to me  morally  it was the right thing to expand medicaid  but i had a responsibility to not to do something that would bankrupt the state   said former governor steve beshear  a democrat  referring to the increased costs of caring for a larger population with medicaid insurance  more than  states  about a dozen of which are led by republican governors  expanded medicaid under obamacare  in kentucky  more than   people gained health insurance through the program  the highest growth rate of medicaid coverage of any state  beshear commissioned independent studies by pricewaterhousecoopers and deloitte on the financial and health impacts of expanding medicaid  both studies found health and economic gains  deloitte reported that   newly covered residents received cholesterol screening and   got preventative dental care within a year  it estimated kentucky would see an economic boost of   billion and   new jobs by   beshear s successor  republican governor bevin  was elected in  on a promise to repeal and replace the healthcare law on the view that thousands of kentuckians had unaffordable premiums and only one health insurer to choose from  he dismissed the projections in the beshear commissioned studies as  preposterous   and says the state s share of expanded medicaid     million in  and totaling    billion over five years   was too expensive and unsustainable    we want this to be a helping hand for people at a time when they need it  but then be able to return to the commercial marketplace   bevin said   last year  bevin submitted the waiver to restrict medicaid eligibility by requiring enrollees to work or volunteer at least  hours per week and to pay monthly premiums based on income  he s still awaiting approval  bevin said he has spoken with several governors about the waiver and has had extensive conversations with health and human services secretary tom price about fast tracking the approval process in order for other states to quickly adopt similar programs  such conversations are occurring across the country in response to encouragement from the new administration to reform state medicaid programs  said alleigh marre  a health and human services spokeswoman   louisiana and wisconsin are considering work requirements for medicaid enrollees  the obama administration rejected previous attempts by other states  including ohio and arizona  to require work programs and monthly premiums for medicaid  historically a free program for those eligible    every state is watching this to see what happens   said bevin of kentucky s waiver   it s the first one in the queue   the odds look good for kentucky to get the waiver in the coming months  based on the track records of health officials that trump named after his inauguration   seema verma  the new head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services  which approves medicaid waivers  said during congressional testimony that the agency will usher in  a new era of state flexibility and leadership    verma helped craft kentucky s waiver  but said she will recuse herself from the approval process to avoid conflicts of interest   she and tom price wrote a letter to governors in march encouraging medicaid reforms that more closely resemble commercial insurance plans  in the letter  they suggested features such as premium fees  health savings accounts  and emergency room co payments that encourage the use of primary care   cms declined to comment on kentucky s waiver and said it does not speculate on the process while ongoing  under federal law  waivers must promote medicaid s objective of delivering healthcare services to vulnerable populations who cannot otherwise afford them    waivers have never been used to cut people from the rolls   said emily parento  associate professor at the university of the pacific s law school and the former executive director of kentucky s office of health policy  but verma s office is encouraging changes to medicaid that make the government program look more like private insurance policies   goals that are similar to bevin s in kentucky   i think what will happen is that other states will look at it and go   we want everything they got    bevin said   this story has been refiled to fix spelling in paragraph
