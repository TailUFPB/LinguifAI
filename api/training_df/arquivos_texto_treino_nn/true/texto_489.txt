washington  reuters    u s  senate republicans rammed forward president donald trump s tax cut bill on tuesday in an abrupt  partisan committee vote that set up a full vote by the senate as soon as thursday  although some details of the measure remained unsettled  as disabled protesters shouted   kill the bill  don t kill us   in a capitol hill hearing room  the senate budget committee  with no discussion  quickly approved the legislation on a   party line vote that left democrats fuming  republican committee members quickly left the room after the vote as democrats complained about a lack of discussion on a bill that would overhaul the u s  tax code and add an estimated    trillion to the   trillion national debt over  years  after the vote  trump told reporters   i think we re going to get it passed   adding that it would have some adjustments    republicans are hurrying to move their complex tax legislation forward  hoping to avoid the protracted infighting that doomed their effort to repeal obamacare four months ago  since trump took office in january  he and fellow republicans in command of both chambers of congress have approved no major legislation  a fact they want to change before facing voters in the  congressional elections  if the senate approves its tax measure later this week  it would need to be reconciled with a version already approved by the house of representatives before anything could be sent to the white house for trump to sign into law  republican leaders conceded that they had yet to round up the votes needed for passage in the senate  where they hold a narrow   majority   it s a challenging exercise   senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said at a news conference  democrats have called the republican tax plan a giveaway to corporations and the rich  the senate bill would slash the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent after a one year delay  it would impose a onetime  cut rate tax on corporations  foreign profits  while exempting future foreign profits from u s  taxation  tax rates for many individuals and families would also be cut temporarily before rising back to their previous levels in   key tax breaks would also be curbed or eliminated  making the bill a mixed bag for some middle class families  some taxes paid by wealthy americans would be repealed  wall street moved higher on the news that the bill would move to a full senate vote  with the benchmark s p   spx index closing up a little over  percent  as written  the bill would widen the u s  budget deficit by an estimated    trillion over  years  republicans maintain that gap would be narrowed by additional economic growth  senator bob corker  one of few remaining republican fiscal hawks in congress  said he worked out a deal satisfying his concerns that the tax cuts add too much to the national debt  he said the bill would be modified to automatically raise tax revenues if growth targets were not reached   we got a commitment that puts us in a pretty good place   he said  although details were not immediately available  corker said he expected more information to come out on thursday as part of the bill  the concession immediately drew a detractor as republican senator john kennedy told reporters he  would rather drink weed killer than vote for the thing   adding   i don t like voting for automatic tax increases    the corker concession was one of several lingering uncertainties in the bill that senate aides said would be nailed down as the measure neared a floor vote  republican senator susan collins  who remains undecided on how she will vote on the bill  said  productive discussions  continued and that she would offer an amendment preserving the    deduction for property tax payments  the deduction is in the house bill  but not the senate version      republican senator ron johnson voted for the bill in the budget committee  even though he had said it did not cut taxes deeply enough for some non corporate businesses  the final version could address his concerns  aides said tax writers were working to change the tax rate for non corporate businesses  preserve an individual deduction for property tax payments  and incorporate corker s tax revenue idea  democratic senator jeff merkley told msnbc that the corker concession was  an absolute gimmick  that could be undermined later   it s just a justification to let those who have argued that they don t believe in increasing the deficit actually vote for a bill which does exactly that   merkley said  as the tax fight played out  a new battle opened on another front as democratic congressional leaders chuck schumer and nancy pelosi skipped a white house meeting with trump to discuss spending  immigration and other issues after trump criticized them on twitter  lawmakers must renew government funding before it expires on dec   or risk a shutdown  democrats hope to use their leverage on the budget issue to renew protections for young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children
