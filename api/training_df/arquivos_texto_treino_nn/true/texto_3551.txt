 reuters    in a stinging rebuke to president donald trump  a u s  appeals court refused on thursday to reinstate his travel ban on people from six muslim majority nations  calling it discriminatory and setting the stage for a showdown in the supreme court   the decision  written by chief judge roger gregory  described trump s executive order in forceful terms  saying it uses  vague words of national security  but in context drips with religious intolerance  animus  and discrimination    attorney general jeff sessions said in a statement that the government  which says the temporary travel ban is needed to guard against terrorist attacks  would seek a review of the case at the supreme court    these clearly are very dangerous times and we need every available tool at our disposal to prevent terrorists from entering the united states and committing acts of bloodshed and violence   said michael short  a white house spokesman   more from reuters    kushner under fbi scrutiny in

ultimately be upheld by the judiciary   in its   ruling  the u s   circuit court of appeals said those challenging the ban  including refugee groups and individuals  were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violates the u s  constitution s bar against favoring one religion over another   gregory cited statements by trump during the  presidential election calling for a muslim ban  during the race  trump called for  a total and complete shutdown of muslim s entering the united states  in a statement on his website   the judge wrote that a reasonable observer would likely conclude the order s  primary purpose is to exclude persons from the united states on the basis of their religious beliefs    the government had argued that the court should not take into account trump s comments on the campaign trail since they occurred before he took office on jan    but the appeals court rejected that view  saying they provide a window into the motivations for trump s action in government   the appeals court questioned a government argument that the president has wide authority to halt the entry of people to the united states    congress granted the president broad power to deny entry to aliens  but that power is not absolute  it cannot go unchecked when  as here  the president wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation   the majority opinion said   the virginia based appeals court was reviewing a march ruling by maryland based federal judge theodore chuang that blocked part of trump s march  executive order barring people from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days while the government put in place stricter visa screening   a similar ruling against trump s policy from a hawaii based federal judge is still in place  that ruling went farther than chuang s order  blocking a section of the travel ban that also suspended refugee admissions for four months  the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals is still reviewing that decision   trump has lashed out at the judges and courts that have ruled against him  saying the  circuit has a  terrible  record and calling its rulings on his policies  ridiculous    the march ban was trump s second effort to implement travel restrictions through an executive order  the first  issued on jan    led to chaos and protests at airports before it was blocked by courts   the second order was intended to overcome the legal issues posed by the original ban  but it was blocked by judges before it could go into effect on march    in an opinion that concurred with the majority on thursday  judge stephanie thacker wrote that the administration did nothing to distance itself from the first order  describing the revised ban as  the proverbial wolf in sheep s clothing    chief judge gregory  who wrote the majority opinion  was first installed in a recess appointment by democratic president bill clinton and then nominated to the same post by republican former president george w  bush   nine other judges appointed by democrats agreed to block the travel ban  while three republican appointed judges dissented    this to us is a complete win and overwhelming in terms of the votes   said omar jadwat  director of the american civil liberties union immigrants  rights project  who argued the case in the  circuit   the dissenting judges said the executive order was constitutional and a valid exercise of presidential authority  and that trump s campaign statements should not have come into play  the order itself  contains no reference to religion whatsoever   judge paul niemeyer wrote   the white house also pointed to a dissent by judge dennis shedd that said  the real losers in this case are the millions of individual americans whose security is threatened on a daily basis by those who seek to do us harm    two other  circuit judges  both appointed by republicans  were recused from the case
