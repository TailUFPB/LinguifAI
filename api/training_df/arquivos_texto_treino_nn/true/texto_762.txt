beijing  reuters    u s  president donald trump arrived in china on wednesday seeking help to rein in north korea  telling the reclusive state s leader he was putting his country in grave danger by developing nuclear weapons  trump used some of his toughest language yet against north korea in a wide ranging address in seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses  he called on countries around the world to isolate pyongyang by denying it  any form of support  supply or acceptance    do not underestimate us and do not try us   trump told north korea as he wrapped up a visit to south korea with a speech to the national assembly before heading to beijing  where he was making his first official visit  trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive north  saying people were suffering in  gulags  and some bribed government officials to work as  slaves  overseas rather than live under the government at home  he offered no evidence to support those accusations  trump s return to harsh  uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east asia of the risk of military conflict  on tuesday  trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to pyongyang to  make a deal   he went mostly on the attack in wednesday s speech but did promise a  path to a much better future  if north korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to  complete  verifiable and total denuclearization    something pyongyang has vowed never to do   we will not allow american cities to be threatened with destruction  we will not be intimidated   he told south korean lawmakers   and we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here  on this ground we fought and died to secure   the north defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are u s  plans to invade  the united states  which has   troops in south korea  a legacy of the   korean war  denies any such intention       the world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation   trump said  speaking as three u s  aircraft carrier groups sailed to the western pacific for exercises   a rare show of such u s  naval force in the region   state visit plus  in beijing  trump and chinese president xi jinping resumed their  bromance  struck in april at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  making small talk as they toured the forbidden city   which was shut down to tourists   with their wives before taking in a chinese opera performance  while the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries  it is rare for a chinese leader to act as a personal escort  confirmation of the  state visit plus  treatment that china had promised for trump    trump has threatened action over china s wide trade surplus with the united states and called on beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor north korea  but has expressed admiration for xi and held off on imposing trade measures  during his two day visit  trump will ask china to abide by u n  resolutions and cut financial links with north korea  a senior white house official said on the plane from seoul  he also plans to discuss with xi the long contentious trade imbalance  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said at a ceremony with u s  business leaders where   billion worth of deals were signed  the white house expects to announce deals in china this week worth more than   billion  bloomberg reported  citing an administration official  trump believes any talks with north korea would require it to reduce threats  end provocations and move toward denuclearization  and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization  the official added  trump and xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on thursday  before leaving for beijing  trump cited china as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties   to those nations that choose to ignore this threat or  worse still  to enable it  the weight of this crisis is on your conscience   he said  while trump will try to convince xi to squeeze north korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions  it is not clear if xi  who has just consolidated his power at a communist party congress  will agree to do more  china has repeatedly said its leverage over pyongyang is exaggerated by the west and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions  the chinese foreign ministry said that china fully and strictly implements u n  security council resolutions on north korea  but will investigate if there have been any contraventions  during his speech in seoul  trump directed his words at north korean leader kim jong un   the weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer  they are putting your regime in grave danger   he said   every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face   however trump  whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy  did not spell out any new approach  north korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear tipped missile capable of hitting the u s  mainland  something u s  intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving   north korea is a country ruled by a cult   trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation   he stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname  little rocket man  that he has used to describe the young north korean leader  kim  for his part  has called trump  mentally deranged   the speech came after trump s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating north and south korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing  officials said  a visit to the dmz  despite his aides  earlier insistence he had no plans to go there  would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with north korea  arriving in beijing on wednesday  trump and his wife melania descended from a red carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of air force one  that was in contrast to a  visit to china by his predecessor  barack obama  who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub  and while in china  trump will not be deterred from using twitter  his favored form of communication  despite its being banned there  according to an administration official   the president will tweet whatever he wants   the official told reporters on air force one   i m sure we ve got the gear aboard this airplane to make it happen
