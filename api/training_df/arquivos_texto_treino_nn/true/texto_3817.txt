washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump signed an executive order on thursday to bolster the government s cyber security and protect critical infrastructure from cyber attacks  marking his first significant action to address what he has called a top priority  the order seeks to improve the often maligned network security of u s  government agencies  from which foreign governments and other hackers have pilfered millions of personal records and other forms of sensitive data in recent years  the white house said the order also aimed to enhance protection of infrastructure such as the energy grid and financial sector from sophisticated attacks that officials have warned could pose a national security threat or cripple parts of the economy  the directive  which drew largely favorable reviews from cyber experts and industry groups  also lays out goals to develop a more robust cyber deterrence strategy  in part by forging strong cooperation with u s  allies in cyberspace  white house homeland security adviser tom bossert said the order sought to build on efforts undertaken by the former obama administration   among the notable changes  heads of federal agencies must use a framework developed by the national institute of standards and technology to assess and manage cyber risk  and prepare a report within  days documenting how they will implement it  the obama administration had encouraged the private sector to adopt the voluntary nist framework  but it did not require government agencies to do so  which opened it up to criticism as it frequently scrambled to respond to major hacks  such as the theft of more than  million personnel records from the office of personnel management  government agencies would now  practice what they preach   bossert told reporters during a white house briefing   a lot of progress was made in the last administration  but not nearly enough   michael daniel  who served as white house cyber security coordinator under former democratic president barack obama  generally praised the order but said it was largely  a plan for a plan   trump  a republican  has also asked agencies to review their federal workforce s cyber talent  an area where the government has faced a growing shortfall of qualified personnel in recent years  the order calls for an examination of the impact of moving agencies toward a shared information technology environment  such as through cloud computing services  it also urges voluntary cooperation with the private sector to develop better strategies to fend off and reduce attacks from botnets  or  networks of infected devices  trump nearly signed a cyber security measure just days into his presidency in january  but it was pulled back to allow for more input from federal agencies and consultation with experts  before taking office  trump said he intended to make cyber security a priority of his administration  but he has raised alarm among cyber security experts by frequently using a personal twitter that could be hacked by an adversary  his skepticism of the conclusion by u s  intelligence agencies that russia hacked democratic emails during the election to help him win has drawn criticism  russia has repeatedly denied assertions it used cyber means to meddle in the u s  election  bossert said russia s alleged hacks were not a motivation for the order  adding that  the russians are not our only adversary on the internet
