washington  reuters    some provisions of the trans pacific partnership president donald trump quit as part of his pledge to protect american workers from  bad trade deals  may still serve to shape a revised nafta trade pact  u s  officials and trade experts say  trump threatened to ditch the  north american free trade agreement too  but eventually decided to renegotiate the pact in talks with mexico and canada due to begin in mid august  on monday u s  trade representative robert lighthizer will offer first insights into the administration s strategy when he presents congress its objectives for the nafta negotiations  several u s  administration  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the lighthizer will outline plans for updating nafta rather than seek a major overhaul of the agreement  while the administration has said it hopes to complete nafta negotiations by the end of the year  the strategy will not set a timeline  they say  thus far  the trump administration offered few specifics  other than expressing its desire to modernize the pact to account for digital trade that was in its infancy in the early  and to tackle festering issues on labor  environment  intellectual property rights and state owned enterprises     since those areas have already been addressed in the tpp negotiated under democratic president barack obama and agreed by canada and mexico  the pact provides a useful template that could help speed up the nafta negotiations  u s  officials say  they warn  however  that no final decision has been made on using tpp language  tpp requires members  for example  to allow independent unions  set working hours and safety standards and deter forced labor and has set higher environment standards than any other previous u s  trade deal   the pact also set a  year copyright term and eight years of patent protection for costly biologic drugs  significantly less than the  years applied in the united states  lawmakers from the u s  industrial heartland particularly want to see enforceable labor standards that would lift mexico s chronically low wages  which they blame for u s  factories migrating south of the border   a lot of the negotiators were just in the room a few years ago doing this stuff  they know where the bodies are buried   said one business executive with knowledge of nafta deliberations  some lawmakers want a more ambitious deal than tpp   donald trump promised to get a better deal than tpp  and americans are going to be deeply disappointed if he doesn t follow through on nafta negotiations   said senator ron wyden of oregon  the ranking democrat on the senate finance committee and an influential voice on trade matters  in particular  canada and mexico should be able to agree to u s  proposals on digital trade and environment that got watered down in the final tpp text  wyden told reuters   this is a once in a generation chance to rewrite nafta  trump can t squander this opportunity   the demands the trump administration makes in the talks  could have far reaching implications for u s  trade relations across the globe  with china keen to make inroads with mexico and canada if the united states is seen to be pulling back  one area to watch will be the so called rules of origin that determine how much regional content a product must have to be exempt from tariffs  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross has frequently said nafta needed to tighten those rules to prevent china from using the trade bloc as a tariff free  back door  to the u s  market  analysts say any u s  demands for more specifically u s  rather than broadly north american content for autos or other manufactured goods would be a tough sell  though mexico has indicated it could be ready for some concessions to strengthen the region s defenses against asian competition  christopher padilla  former u s  under secretary for international trade at the u s  commerce department now at ibm  believes that merely  tweaking  the rules of origin would be enough to satisfy trump s political agenda  but it still may require companies to alter their supply chains  the clarion call from u s  business groups in the lead up to the talks is  do no harm   u s  and international companies have invested hundreds of billions of dollars building integrated north american supply networks and trump rang alarm bells in corporate boardrooms in april when he threatened to terminate the pact  trump backed off after a furious lobbying effort  but analysts say he may still choose a  hard exit  if the talks fail to achieve his goal of shrinking the u s  trade deficit with mexico  nafta has quadrupled trade between the three countries  surpassing   trillion in   over a decade through to   however  the united states lost nearly  million manufacturing jobs  a figure that resonates with trump  u s  trade balance with mexico also swung from a small surplus in  to deficits that have exceeded   billion for most of the past decade   graphic tmsnrt rs   fred bergsten  a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics  said the administration would risk derailing the talks if it focused on reducing the trade imbalance with mexico  like it has threatened to do   we re talking about an imbalance of   billion and there is no way under the sun that mexico can eliminate that or even make a big dent in that without doing some really massive uneconomic distortion of trade flows
