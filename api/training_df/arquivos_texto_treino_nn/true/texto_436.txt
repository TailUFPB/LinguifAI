washington  reuters    a spate of sexual misconduct accusations against u s  politicians and other powerful men will force candidates for the november  congressional elections to weigh more carefully than ever whether their past behavior could doom their chances   following allegations against republican u s  senate candidate roy moore  democratic u s  representative john conyers and democratic u s  senator al franken  campaign operatives from both parties warned that past behavior that might once have been excused may now be disqualifying   this is a game changer   said democratic strategist dane strother   every man who wants to run for office needs to give some serious thought to his past   politicians have been among a growing number of prominent men  including in the entertainment and media fields  accused of sexual harassment  there will be increased pressure on candidates to undertake  self vetting   where  as one republican strategist said  they are willing to subject themselves to a  trial on what the other side will put them through   but he cautioned   a lot of this is still dependent on what the candidate is willing to talk about and how forthcoming they are   in next year s elections  democrats will seek to wrest one or both houses of congress from republican control  thirty three u s  senate seats and all  seats in the u s  house of representatives will be contested   sex scandals have long been a part of u s  politics  but in the current environment  operatives are encouraging candidates and office holders alike to level with advisers about past conduct  even behavior that might in the past have fallen into a gray area   you may have to press the candidate particularly aggressively to be sure that he confronts what he may have passed off as a failed advance and not have imagined would come back to haunt him   a veteran democratic lawyer who advises campaigns told reuters  sonia van meter  a democratic opposition researcher  said candidates would have to think carefully about  their demeanor  their offhanded remarks  the way they carried themselves  everything will be under more scrutiny   if candidates are not careful about self vetting  operatives said  researchers working for opposing candidates would do it for them  verifiable facts   court documents  voting records  speeches and more   usually form the backbone of opposition research conducted by rival campaigns  such research may expand into behavior that has not been documented  strother said  adding that might include conversations with former female staffers to find out if there are any issues  tracy sefl  a strategist in chicago who has directed opposition research for the democratic national committee  said workplace relationships between a male candidate and women  could now be targeted by opposing campaigns   in the context of employment  was a man supervising women  were those women younger  older  or his peers   sefl said   how long did those women tend to work there  what do they have to say about their experience there and about him  specifically    but alex conant  a republican consultant who worked for presidential candidates tim pawlenty and marco rubio  doubted opposition research would see a dramatic shift  largely because most campaigns cannot afford it and must instead rely on public records  internet searches and news reports    opposition research in early stages of congressional campaigns is not going back and interviewing every single person who has worked with a candidate   conant said  there are also limits on the effectiveness of opposition research in identifying potential misconduct   rumors surrounding moore s alleged interest in teenage girls had circulated in alabama politics for years  but it took reporters from the washington post  not researchers from campaigns  to persuade his accusers to go on the record  moore  who is running against democrat doug jones in a dec   special election  has denied the allegations  which reuters has been unable to independently verify  republican lawmakers in washington  including senate republican leader mitch mcconnell  have distanced themselves from moore and urged him to quit the race  self vetting is all the more important  operatives said  because the national parties have little capacity to weed out problematic candidates  in   the insurgent white house bids of republican donald trump and democrat bernie sanders highlighted the limited ability of parties to hand pick candidates for major public offices  trump won the presidency despite himself being accused by several women of having in the past made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate personal remarks about them  trump denied the allegations  saying they were part of a smear campaign  in the race for the u s  senate seat in alabama  moore prevailed in the republican primary over luther strange  the incumbent backed by the party establishment   while the parties still vet some candidates for congress and big ticket donors  they largely rely on local party officials to screen and refer them  van meter said the string of scandals had altered the landscape because victims now felt empowered to go public  which may topple some candidates and keep others from running at all   what has changed is the culture  the number of women coming forward   she said   we re going to see more of these cases
