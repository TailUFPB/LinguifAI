washington  reuters    neil gorsuch  president donald trump s u s  supreme court nominee  on monday emphasized the need for judicial independence even as trump castigates jurists who have ruled against him  while democrats questioned whether he would rule against abortion rights and gun control while favoring corporations  with the ideological balance of the supreme court at stake  the senate judiciary committee opened its confirmation hearing for gorsuch  a conservative federal appeals court judge from colorado  republicans praised gorsuch    as highly qualified for a lifetime appointment as a justice   i think we re off to a good start   republican chuck grassley  the committee s chairman  said afterward  with senators getting their first shot at questioning gorsuch on tuesday  committee democrats noted gorsuch has the chance to join the court only because senate republicans last year refused to consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of federal appellate judge merrick garland  despite slim chances of blocking his nomination in the republican led senate  democrats raised questions about gorsuch s suitability for the job   our job is to determine whether judge gorsuch is a reasonable  mainstream conservative or is he not   said the panel s top democrat  dianne feinstein  speaking publicly for the first time since trump nominated him on jan    gorsuch defended his judicial record in the face of democratic criticism of his rulings   gorsuch  speaking mostly in generalities that could not cause him any trouble  emphasized the need for  neutral and independent judges to apply the law   warned against judicial overreach  and referred to  the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy    if judges were just secret legislators  declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be  the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk   gorsuch said in comments in harmony with conservative criticism of unelected  activist judges   gorsuch  a cool headed and amiable jurist  gave democrats very little ammunition to use against him  although there could be more drama when he takes questions  the hearing could last four days  providing classic washington political theater  grassley said the panel is likely to vote on the nomination on april   with the full senate vote likely soon after  if gorsuch is confirmed by the senate  as expected  he would restore a narrow   conservative court majority  the seat has been vacant for  months  since the death of conservative justice antonin scalia in february   democratic senator richard blumenthal underscored the importance of judicial independence at a time when trump has excoriated federal judges who have ruled against him on matters including two executive orders  put on hold by courts  to block people from several muslim majority nations from entering the united states  blumenthal said it was not  idle speculation  to suggest the supreme court might be asked to enforce a subpoena against trump  citing fbi director james comey s testimony before congress on monday confirming an ongoing investigation into alleged collusion between trump s presidential campaign and russia   republican ted cruz said there is no reason for gorsuch to be questioned about trump  noting that previous nominees have not had to speak about allegations made against the president who nominated them  democrats highlighted cases on which gorsuch has ruled and questioned the influence of conservative interest groups in advising trump on his selection  feinstein emphasized abortion  conservatives have long opposed the landmark  roe v  wade ruling legalizing abortion nationwide  feinstein called that ruling and others since then buttressing abortion rights  super precedents  deserving special deference  feinstein cited two gorsuch legal opinions in which she said he  argued in favor of making it harder to convict felons who possess guns   democratic senator patrick leahy said he was worried that gorsuch s conservative method of interpreting the constitution  goes beyond being a philosophy and becomes an agenda  that is anti abortion  anti environment and pro business   will you allow the government to intrude on americans  personal privacy and freedoms  will you elevate the rights of corporations over those of real people  will you rubberstamp a president whose administration has asserted that executive power is not subject to judicial review   leahy said  many democrats contend trump s party  stole  a supreme court seat by freezing out garland   your nomination is part of a republican strategy to capture our judicial branch of government   senator dick durbin told gorsuch   that is why the senate republicans kept this supreme court seat vacant for more than a year and why they left  judicial nominees who had received bipartisan approval of this committee to die on the senate calendar as president obama left office   gorsuch said he has tried to treat all who come to court fairly and with respect   i have decided cases for native americans seeking to protect tribal lands  for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of nuclear waste pollution by corporations in colorado   he said  he also said he has ruled for disabled students  prisoners and workers alleging civil rights violations  and for immigrants who entered the country illegally  the court s ideological leaning could help determine the outcome of cases involving the death penalty  abortion  gun control  environmental regulations  transgender rights  voting rights  immigration  religious liberty  presidential powers and more  republicans hold  of the senate s  seats  under present rules  gorsuch would need  votes to secure confirmation  if gorsuch cannot muster   republicans could change the rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority
