washington beijing  reuters    when u s  president donald trump meets chinese president xi jinping this week  their summit will be marked not only by deep policy divisions but a clash of personalities between america s brash  tweeter in chief  and beijing s cautious  calculating leader  they may have one thing in common  their rhetoric about restoring their nations to greatness  but the two men differ in almost every other respect  from their political styles to their diplomatic experience  adding uncertainty to what has been called the world s most important bilateral relationship  five months after his election on a stridently anti china platform  trump appears to have set himself on a course for collision rather than conciliation with xi  raising doubts as to whether the world s two biggest economies can find common ground  topping the agenda at trump s mar a lago resort in florida will be whether he will make good on his threat to use crucial u s  china trade ties to pressure beijing to do more to rein in its nuclear armed neighbor north korea  which is working to develop missiles capable of hitting the united states  trump  a  year old former real estate magnate with no foreign policy experience before entering the white house  has tweeted that it will be a  very difficult  meeting with the veteran communist party leader seven years his junior  given chinese trade practices he says are killing u s  jobs  he has also demanded that beijing do more to  solve  the north korean problem   his biggest national security challenge   or he will act alone to deal with pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs  some white house aides believe trump s son in law and senior adviser jared kushner could be an influential moderating voice on how he handles xi in their talks on thursday and friday  contacts between kushner and china s u s  envoy helped smooth the way for the meeting  according to current and former u s  officials  even so  what worries the protocol conscious chinese more than policy clashes is the risk that the unpredictable trump could publicly embarrass xi  after several foreign leaders experienced awkward moments with the new u s  president   ensuring president xi does not lose face is a top priority for china   a chinese official said  u s  presidents  meetings with their chinese counterparts are usually more tightly scripted than with other foreign leaders  something chinese officials insist on to make sure they are treated with the decorum they believe befits a global power  this summit should offer a study in contrasts  trump impatient  outspoken and prone to angry tweet storms  xi  outwardly calm and measured  with no known social media presence  their shared nationalist tendencies could aggravate  friction between their countries  which are increasingly global rivals  trump insists the united states has been cheated economically for decades by countries like china and must regain its luster  while xi wants china  once an ancient empire  to be able to flex its muscles on the world stage   xi and trump are not natural friends   said a former senior u s  official specializing in asia   the question is when trump s  make america great again  hits xi s  chinese dream   what s the result   it remains unclear how far trump will go in translating populist rhetoric into policy that steps up pressure on china  given the risk of a trade war neither country can afford  but aides say he won t pull his punches  especially on trade  on which he has held an outspoken view for decades  this adds to doubts as to whether the two leaders can find  common ground on north korea and china s expansive claims in the south china sea  some analysts question whether trump can get the better of xi  who was born into a life of politics and has a reputation for being a tough tactician   xi s performed pretty well in these types of environments   said christopher johnson  a china expert and former cia analyst at washington s center for strategic and international studies  while trump has been in office little more than  weeks  xi has honed his u s  strategy since assuming the chinese leadership in   the son of a revolutionary leader  xi has sought to project the image internationally of a strong advocate of globalization at a time when trump has stoked fears of u s  protectionism  still  chinese officials are mindful of the pitfalls if trump veers off script  japanese prime minister shinzo abe found himself in a long  uncomfortable handshake at the white house in february  and trump appeared to ignore german chancellor angela merkel s offer of a handshake during their meeting last month  an acrimonious call between trump and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull caused particular concern in beijing  officials there say   still  the decision to hold a summit so early in trump s presidency suggests both washington and beijing see the value of trying to build a personal relationship between the two leaders  trump goes into the meeting with significant gaps in his team of asia advisers and his china policy still not fully formulated  hardliners like trade adviser peter navarro  who authored a book  death by china   have feuded over the administration s approach to china with more pragmatic aides such as economic adviser gary cohn  a former goldman sachs president  current and former u s  officials say  administration officials argue trump can use his  art of the deal  sales techniques to convince xi that china needs the united states more than the united states needs china  especially when it comes to market access  but analysts say the chinese are shrewd enough at geopolitics to fend off u s  demands  xi may also see trump politically weakened by his high profile legislative failure on healthcare as well as his low public approval ratings  trump has already backed down on china s most sensitive issue   taiwan   having first infuriated beijing by suggesting he might not abide by washington s long standing  one china  policy  trump may now feel he is owed a favor in return  a fence mending phone call in february was arranged by kushner and china s u s  ambassador  cui tiankai  officials say  after cui invited trump s daughter ivanka to the chinese embassy s lunar new year reception  where her daughter sang in mandarin  both sides are keeping expectations low for tangible outcomes from the summit  billed as informal  get to know you  meetings similar to the  sunnylands summit in california between xi and trump s predecessor  barack obama  and whatever else  unlike abe s february visit to mar a lago  there will be no golf diplomacy  china s communist party associates golf with shady dealings and has sought to stop officials from playing it as part of xi s fight against corruption
