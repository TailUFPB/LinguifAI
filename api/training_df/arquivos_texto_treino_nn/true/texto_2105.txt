 reuters    billionaire investor carl icahn ended his role as a special adviser to u s  president donald trump on friday after facing criticism that policy recommendations he offered could help his own investments  some democratic lawmakers and biofuels advocates argued that icahn s guidance to the republican administration created a conflict of interest with his businesses  including oil refining company cvr energy inc  icahn has denied any conflict of interest  icahn s departure followed a flurry of changes at the white house  trump on friday fired his chief strategist  stephen bannon  two days after disbanding two high profile business advisory groups   i chose to end this arrangement  with your blessing  because i did not want partisan bickering about my role to in any way cloud your administration   icahn wrote in a letter to trump released on his website  the white house declined to comment  a call to icahn s office was not immediately returned  the activist investor  who leads icahn enterprises lp  was an early and close ally of trump who was often praised by the republican for his business acumen  one of icahn s first tasks was to vet the future securities and exchange commission chairman and a number of candidates met with the octogenarian investor in his fifth avenue office just a few blocks north of trump tower in manhattan  while icahn stopped managing money for clients years ago  he still has large stakes in companies like herbalife ltd   cvr and american international group inc   which have faced regulatory issues      icahn was so sure trump s election last year would give a boost to stocks that he left the campaign s victory party to make a   billion bet on the market  he told reuters last year  the day after the election  stocks leapt  in his letter to trump  icahn downplayed his role as an adviser on regulatory matters  saying  i never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position   trump  who came to office promising to roll back regulation  reform the tax code and boost infrastructure spending  never put icahn on the payroll  but icahn s involvement was considerable  he interviewed scott pruitt  now the administrator of the environmental protection agency  the very agency that would determine regulations about requiring refiners to blend biofuels  his web of financial interests became a lightning rod   if he was not willing to admit he was a de facto special government employee  and follow the rules  then he had no place serving in government   said norman eisen  co founder of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington  who served as the chief ethics lawyer for former president barack obama   his short tenure  marred by serious conflicts allegations  was yet another black eye for an administration that has become notorious for violations of ethics and the rule of law   icahn has been one of the loudest critics of the federal biofuels program  and he was working at price crushing reforms of the program at the same time he was betting that credits at the center of the program would fall  biofuels regulations require refiners either to blend biofuels into gasoline or   in the case of companies like cvr that have no blending facilities   to buy credits from competitors  the regulation  the renewable fuel standard  also allows companies to delay those credit purchases by a year  as an adviser to trump  icahn urged the president in february to alter the policy to lift the blending burden from refiners  yet environmental regulators are preparing to formally reject that proposal  sources told reuters  investors have built up a large short position in cvr in the past three months  according to reuters data  as evidence mounts that the company s gamble on the biofuels market is going sour
