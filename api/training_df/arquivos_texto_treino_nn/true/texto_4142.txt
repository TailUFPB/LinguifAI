mumbai  reuters    for grishma  an indian software designer  president donald trump s review of the visa programme for bringing highly skilled workers into the united states comes at a bad time  fresh from gaining a master s degree in europe  and with an offer of employment from a well known u s  design firm  she was well on her way to fulfilling the ambition of many young indian it workers   a dream job in america  but as she waits in the h  visa queue for the green light  she is caught in a bind   it s a weird time to be applying  with all the scrutiny   said grishma  who gave only her first name for fear of jeopardizing her chances of getting a visa  the united states has already suspended the  expedited processing option  for applicants  under which she may have received a visa in weeks  more broadly  uncertainty over the review announced this week has unsettled grishma and many others like her  she will have to wait until at least around august to learn her fate  but having accepted the u s  job offer she is not in a position to apply for positions elsewhere  including in europe   it s pretty debilitating   grishma told reuters   i d like to start work to mitigate the financial damage   trump s decision was not a huge surprise  given his election campaign pledge to put american jobs first  but the executive order he signed  though vague in many areas  has prompted thousands of foreign workers already in the united states or applying for visas to work there to re think their plans  companies who send them also face huge uncertainty  the concerns are particularly acute in india  where it firms like tata consultancy services  infosys ltd and wipro ltd are top beneficiaries of the h  visa programme  using it to send computer engineers to service clients in the united states  their largest overseas market  experts say trump s order to review visa processes is aimed at firms like tcs  infosys and wipro  which from   snagged around   h  visas  roughly equivalent to the number of h  visas the united states issues in total each year  two industry sources said infosys  india s no   information technology  it  services company  is applying for just under   h  visas this year  which one of the sources said was down from   applications in  and some   in   it was not clear whether the sharp reduction in  was in direct response to trump s presidency  although the company has said for some time it wanted to cut dependence on  fly in  staff  tcs  infosys and wipro said they would not share data on the number of h  visas they had applied for this year  with fewer visas going to infosys  more might become available for smaller it companies and big u s  tech companies  like facebook and microsoft corp  that typically send in fewer h  applications each year  u s  based immigration lawyer murali bashyam  managing partner of bashyam spiro llp which advises and works with small to mid sized indian it firms  said clients had been in contact seeking clarity  while the number of visa applicants had fallen   i think the reason for that is they get the sense that it s going to get so much tougher to comply with all of the changes     that it might not be worth their money   he said   there is a fear that radical immigration changes are coming  and if those radical immigration changes come then it could completely change the way it staffing companies do business   bashyam said the number of people on h  visas already working in the united states who were considering returning to their home country had risen  an engineer working at cisco  who has been in the united states since   said that three months ago he would not have considered returning to india  but the review of the visa system  and any rule change that revoked the right for his wife to work in the united states on a dependent visa  could force him to change his mind   if that happens  then i would definitely be interested in going back to india  even though i m secure  i don t want to be in a situation where my wife cannot work   said the engineer  who declined to be named   those who have heavily invested here  who ve bought houses  property and are still on visas  are afraid   according to bashyam  some indians on h  visas were cancelling plans to return home to visit their families in case they had problems getting back into the united states   with everything that s going on  traveling outside the u s  is the biggest fear for a lot of the h  workers working in the it staffing industry   he said  and the uncertainty is not limited to it  trump s campaign rhetoric around tighter visa rules has led some indian students considering studying abroad to look beyond the united states  which typically draws in over   indian students annually  one canadian official said the number of student visa applications for certain courses in canada had spiked over  percent since trump s election win in november  akshay baliga  a management consultant with a h  visa that is valid until   said he was not considering returning to the united states for work any time soon   as a professional i m looking eastward   said baliga  now based in india but who earlier studied and lived for years in america
