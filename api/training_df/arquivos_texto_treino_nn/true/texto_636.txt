washington  reuters    u s  attorney general jeff sessions acknowledged on tuesday he was aware of contact between donald trump s election campaign and russian intermediaries  again modifying a previous statement about the extent of connections to moscow  the comment by sessions to a house of representatives panel did not reveal any new link between the trump team and russia but it was another example of the top u s  law enforcement official offering a different version of events as lawmakers try to work out if the trump campaign colluded with russia in the  election  sessions told the house judiciary committee that he now recalls a meeting last year with then candidate trump where a campaign adviser said he had connections with moscow and could help arrange a trump meeting with russian president vladimir putin   i do now recall  the meeting where adviser george papadopoulos made the proposal  sessions said   but i have no clear recollection of the details of what he said during the meeting   sessions has previously told congress he was unaware of any trump campaign contacts with russia  leading democrats on tuesday to accuse him of lying under oath   i will not accept and reject accusations that i have ever lied under oath  that is a lie   sessions told the panel  accusations of collusion with russia during the election campaign have dogged trump s first  months in office  sessions  testimony appears likely to keep the controversy over russia boiling as special counsel robert mueller accelerates his investigation into possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia   since mueller s probe began  numerous trump advisors have acknowledged interactions with russian intermediaries  they include donald trump jr   former campaign manager paul manafort  and trump s son in law and senior advisor  jared kushner  papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his interactions with russian representatives  u s  intelligence agencies have concluded that moscow meddled in the  election to help republican trump s campaign           the kremlin denies that and trump says there was no collusion between his campaign and russian officials  sessions faced tough questioning from committee democrats on tuesday  representative hakeem jeffries accused sessions of hypocrisy  saying sessions  while he was a u s  attorney  had prosecuted a police officer for perjury after the officer corrected his testimony   the attorney general of the united states should not be held to a different standard than the young police officer whose life you ruined   jefferies said  that prompted an angry backlash from sessions   nobody  nobody   not you or anyone else  should be prosecuted  not me     for answering a question the way i did in this hearing  i have always tried to answer the questions fairly and accurately   during the march  campaign meeting where russia was discussed  sessions shut down papadopoulos  idea of engaging with russian contacts  according to a source familiar with the matter   sessions said that was the version of events he recalled   after reading his account  and to the best of my recollection  i believe that i wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the russian government  or any other foreign government  for that matter   sessions said on tuesday  after that meeting  sessions said  he did not have  any further knowledge  of additional contacts between the campaign and russian officials  it was not the first time that sessions  who was a senior trump campaign aide and republican senator  has revised his comments about contact between the campaign and russia   he said during january s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of such communications  news reports then emerged showing that sessions had himself met russian ambassador sergei kislyak at least twice in     under pressure  sessions recused himself from the russia investigation  he told reporters he was  honest and correct  in his response in the hearing  although he acknowledged he should have mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator   sessions also said on tuesday he did not challenge a statement by another campaign foreign policy adviser  carter page  that he told sessions in a brief encounter that he was about to leave for moscow  but he said he had no memory of that conversation  the hearing was starkly divided  majority republicans demanded that sessions appoint a second special counsel to investigate a series of issues involving trump s election rival  democrat hillary clinton  including the sale of a uranium company to russia while she was u s  secretary of state  sessions was cautious on that score  when republican representative jim jordan detailed what the controversy  looks like  to him  the attorney general responded    looks like  is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel   earlier  sessions confirmed that he has asked senior federal prosecutors to look into the potential appointment of a second special counsel  democrats say that five congressional committees have looked into the uranium sale and found nothing improper
