washington  reuters    the sweeping tax overhaul that passed the u s  senate on saturday contains the republicans  biggest blow yet to former president barack obama s healthcare law  repealing the requirement that all americans obtain health insurance  the individual mandate is meant to ensure a viable health insurance market by forcing younger and healthier americans to buy coverage to help offset the cost of sicker patients  it helps uphold the most popular provision of the law  which requires insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates  removing it while keeping the rest of obama s affordable care act intact is expected to cause insurance premiums to rise and lead to millions of people losing coverage  policy experts say   it s going to take a bunch of healthy people out of the insurance market   said craig garthwaite  director of the healthcare program at northwestern university s kellogg school of management   obamacare  is going to collapse even more now   he said  republican lawmakers failed several times this year to scrap the mandate as part of a broader repeal of obamacare  blocked by opposition from a few of the party s senators  including susan collins of maine   collins  still opposed to removing the mandate  said she voted for the tax bill on saturday after being assured by republican leaders that they will support legislation to prop up u s  health insurance markets  the tax bill is not yet final  the u s  house of representatives and senate must now reconcile the differences in their respective versions of the legislation   repealing the individual mandate simply restores to people the freedom to choose   republican senator lisa murkowski  who has opposed previous obamacare repeal efforts  wrote in an opinion piece in alaska s fairbanks daily news miner    instead of taxing people for not being able to afford coverage  we should be working to reduce costs and provide options   one of the obamacare stabilization bills  co authored by republican senator lamar alexander and democratic senator patty murray  would restore billions of dollars in subsidies that health insurers use to reduce out of pocket costs for low income americans   a second  co authored by collins and democratic senator bill nelson  would create an additional    billion fund to compensate insurers for covering health care for the sickest patients  still  health policy experts said both of those measures would be needed without a mandate repeal and would not make up for expected premium increases and the rise in the numbers of uninsured americans    neither of these bills would do anything to offset the increase in uninsured resulting from a mandate repeal   said larry levitt  health economist at the kaiser family foundation   the marketplaces would limp along without a mandate but it s probably not a stable place    without the mandate  health insurance premiums would rise  percent in most years over the next decade on the individual market and  million people would lose coverage by   the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last month   levitt said that insurers would need around   billion per year to offset the lost revenue from the individual mandate rather than raise premiums  republicans  who control the white house  u s  house of representatives and senate  failed for months to make good on a top campaign pledge of president donald trump   trump has said congress will return to repeal and replace efforts next year and over the past several months has taken regulatory and executive actions to steadily undermine the obamacare law     insurers and leading medical groups have already urged congress to preserve the individual mandate and warned of  serious consequences  such as rising premiums and a rise in the number of uninsured if it were repealed
