newark  n j   reuters    the bribery case against u s  senator bob menendez survived a key test on monday  as the federal judge overseeing his trial rejected a defense motion to throw out the most serious charges  u s  district judge william walls in newark  new jersey  allowed the trial to proceed on all charges  five days after suggesting he was inclined to dismiss the heart of the case based on a u s  supreme court decision last year that narrowed the legal definition of public corruption  prosecutors have accused menendez  a  year old democrat  of taking bribes from florida ophthalmologist salomon melgen in exchange for using his office to help the doctor in a variety of ways  both men deny wrongdoing and say melgen was acting out of friendship  after prosecutors rested their case on wednesday  defense lawyers renewed their argument that the supreme court s decision last year vacating the corruption conviction of former virginia governor bob mcdonnell also undermined the bribery counts against menendez  walls initially appeared ready to accept the contention that the mcdonnell ruling invalidated a bribery theory known as  stream of benefits   in which someone offers bribes essentially to keep a politician on retainer  rather than paying for specific acts  but following additional filings over the weekend and more arguments on monday  walls said he believed the stream of benefits theory is still valid under the law  the mcdonnell decision has caused several other corruption convictions to be overturned  including those of former top new york state lawmakers sheldon silver and dean skelos  during the trial s first six weeks  prosecutors presented evidence that menendez pressured federal officials to secure visas for melgen s girlfriends  resolve a port dispute involving one of melgen s businesses and change a medicare reimbursement policy after the agency determined melgen had overbilled it by millions of dollars  in exchange  melgen showered menendez with private flights  luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign backing  prosecutors said  the defense is expected to begin on monday afternoon  it is unlikely that menendez will take the witness stand  though his lawyers have not said whether he plans to do so  the case has been closely watched in washington  where republicans hold a   edge in the senate  if menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled before republican new jersey governor chris christie s term expires in january  then christie would name his replacement
