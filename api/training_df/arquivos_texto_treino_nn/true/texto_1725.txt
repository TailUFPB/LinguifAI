washington  reuters    president donald trump said on thursday he was close to a deal with democratic congressional leaders on protections for illegal immigrants brought to the united states as children  astounding fellow republicans again while alarming conservative supporters  trump said any final agreement must include border security measures including surveillance systems but would not include funding for his planned wall along the u s  mexican border  a central  campaign promise  trump said the wall would  come later  and warned democrats not to obstruct it  trump described the parameters of an agreement on the fate of the roughly   so called dreamers reached in his white house meeting on wednesday evening with top senate democrat chuck schumer and top house of representatives democrat nancy pelosi   we have to have an understanding that  whether it s in the budget or some other vehicle  in a very short period of time the wall will be funded  otherwise  we re not doing anything   trump said after landing in florida to survey hurricane damage  schumer and pelosi reiterated their opposition to the wall  and democrats in the past have promised to block funding for it   i think we re fairly close but we have to get massive border security   trump told reporters earlier in the day of a potential deal   trump said republican house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell were both  on board  with the potential deal and that  we re doing it in conjunction with the republicans   trump spoke with ryan and mcconnell on thursday morning only after he had reached the outline of the deal with the democrats  the potential agreement was the latest development in the president s newfound willingness to work with democrats after republicans  who control congress  failed to deliver legislative victories on healthcare and other matters  trump stunned republican leaders last week by reaching an agreement with schumer and pelosi to fund the government and raise the u s  debt ceiling through mid december  the president defended his outreach to the opposition party  saying if republicans did not stick together   then i m going to have to get a little bit of help from the democrats    we have to get things passed   trump told reporters aboard air force one  trump rescinded the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program earlier this month but made that effective in march  giving lawmakers six months to come up with an alternative for the dreamers  daca  created by trump s democratic predecessor  barack obama  shields the dreamers  mostly hispanic young adults  from deportation and provides work permits  pelosi pointed to a bill offered by republican house homeland security committee chairman michael mccaul as a possible basis for a deal with trump on border security  it calls for more money for high tech surveillance equipment  stronger measures at u s  ports of entry  more border patrol and customs agents and letting national guard personnel help with aviation and intelligence support on the u s  mexico border  trump said that  we re not looking at citizenship  for the dreamers  a comment that differed with how pelosi and schumer described their understanding with the president  they told reporters trump had embraced the provisions of a bipartisan proposal called the dream act that would grant permanent legal resident status to dreamers who qualify  allowing them to attend college  work and serve in the u s  military without fear of deportation  it also would provide a pathway to u s  citizenship after at least eight years  before trump made his comment on citizenship  a white house spokeswoman  lindsay walters  told reporters traveling with him to florida that the administration would discuss  a responsible path forward  that could include  legal citizenship over a period of time   mcconnell and ryan  both of whom have had a tense relationship with trump  made comments that suggested they might not be on board  as the president said   there is no agreement   ryan told reporters about daca   i think the president understands that he s got to work the congressional majority   he told reporters  referring to republicans  adding that  we have not begun negotiations   although he expected a compromise to be reached  mcconnell issued a noncommittal statement   as congress debates the best ways to address illegal immigration through strong border security and interior enforcement  daca should be part of those discussions  we look forward to receiving the trump administration s legislative proposal as we continue our work on these issues   he said  trump faced a quick backlash from his hard line conservative political base over his potential deal on daca  he had promised as a candidate to deport all of the estimated  million illegal immigrants in the united states  and said a border wall would be built  paid for by mexico  to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs  mexico has said it will not pay for the structure   it looks to me like he s preparing to keep hillary clinton s campaign promise rather than his own   republican representative steve king told cnn  referring to trump s democratic election rival   breitbart news  the hard line conservative news website headed by trump s former top strategist  steve bannon  called the president  amnesty don  in a headline  many conservatives oppose giving legal status or a path toward citizenship to illegal immigrants  calling such steps  amnesty  to lawbreakers  trump said on thursday he did not support amnesty  conservative pundit ann coulter wrote on twitter   at this point  who doesn t want trump impeached
