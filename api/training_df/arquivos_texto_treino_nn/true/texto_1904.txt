cincinnati  reuters    democrat richard cordray delivered a campaign style stump speech at a sprawling labor day celebration on monday  but the u s  consumer financial protection bureau chief stopped short of saying whether he intends to run for governor of ohio  if cordray were to step down to run for political office it would allow president donald trump to appoint a successor as head of the consumer watchdog agency  which has stoked the ire of wall street with steep penalties for misconduct and tougher rules on lending   we need to join together to help each other rekindle the hope  the enthusiasm  and the willingness to find and make our own opportunities   cordray said to hundreds of union members  a key democratic constituency  at an afl cio picnic in cincinnati  cordray is the first director of the cfpb  a consumer watchdog agency created under former president barack obama in the aftermath of the   financial crisis  an ohio native  he has been widely expected to jump into the race for governor and clearly appeared to be testing the political waters with his speech on monday  though many had speculated he would use the occasion to   announce his candidacy  activists and political leaders said any formal announcement about cordray s plans to enter the  contest would wait until the cfpb finalizes a long awaited rule restricting the activity of payday lenders  current ohio governor john kasich  among more than a dozen republican candidates to be defeated by trump in last year s presidential primary campaign  is barred by term limits from running again in the pivotal election battleground state  as cfpb director  cordray has rained down steep penalties on banks  auto dealers  student lenders and credit card companies for alleged predatory lending practices  his reputation as being tough on banks and sticking up for consumers has many democrats saying he is their best hope for taking the governors mansion  and chipping away at republicans  dominance in state government   due to a law forbidding public officials from using their office to advance political campaigns  cordray would have to resign to run for governor  his term does not expire until next summer  when democrats will already have selected their gubernatorial nominee in primary elections  members of both parties have said trump would seize on a vacancy at the top of the cfpb to make good on campaign promises to slash regulations and weaken or perhaps even dismantle the agency  republicans have long fought to take the agency apart  saying it oversteps its authority and that the single director  who both writes and enforces rules  has too much power  the agency itself has repeatedly declined to comment on cordray resignation rumors  cfpb critics say trump could use a  law to slide in a current administration appointee  already confirmed by congress  as temporary director if cordray resigns  a legal ruling that trump can fire cordray is currently under appeal   he s done a great job and i don t think he should leave for  any reason   said karl frisch  executive director of the liberal group allied progress
