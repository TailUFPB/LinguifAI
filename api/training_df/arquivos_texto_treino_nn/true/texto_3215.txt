washington  reuters    u s  secretary of state rex tillerson said on tuesday a policy of engagement with cuba has financially benefited the island s government in violation of u s  law  further fueling expectations that president donald trump this week will roll back parts of former president barack obama s opening to havana  speaking ahead of trump s expected trip to miami on friday to announce his new cuba policy  tillerson insisted that havana  must begin to address human rights challenges  if it wants washington to continue normalizing relations between the cold war era foes  tillerson  testifying before the senate foreign relations committee  acknowledged that rapprochement with the communist ruled island has led to an increase in u s  visitors and u s  business ties  however  tillerson added   we think we have achieved very little in terms of changing the behavior of the regime in cuba      and it has little incentive today to change that   his comments came as trump s aides sought to finalize rules that  according to u s  officials and people familiar with the discussions  are likely to bar u s  trade with cuban enterprises linked to the military   which controls a large part of the economy   and tighten some rules on americans traveling there   but the new policy will stop short of closing embassies or breaking off relations re established in  after more than five decades of hostility  the sources said  in his speech  trump is expected to claim fulfillment of a campaign promise to the cuban american community to tighten the screws on the government of cuban president raul castro  while tillerson declined to confirm any details  he left no doubt that the trump administration was prepared to undo some pieces of obama s policy that it sees as boosting the cuban government financially  which would violate u s  law   as we re developing these business relationships and as we re enjoying the benefits on the economic and development side  are we inadvertently or directly providing financial support to the regime  our view is we are   tillerson said   and the question is     how how do we bring that back into compliance with longstanding statutory obligations  he said  many of trump s fellow republicans  and some democrats  objected to obama s policy shift  saying he gave too much for too few concessions from cuba  but obama s measures have proven popular with the public  u s  businesses and many lawmakers from both parties  tillerson agreed that moves toward more normal relations with the united states have helped some cubans lift themselves out of poverty and provided opportunities for u s  companies  however  tillerson said there is a  dark side  to relations with cuba  noting that the government in havana continues to jail political opponents and harass dissidents   we are supportive of the continued economic development  as long as it is done in full compliance with our existing statutes to not provide financial support to the regime   tillerson said   that s the focus of our current policy review   but divisions remain within the trump administration over how far to go  some aides have argued that trump  a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash u s  business and create jobs  would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the cuban market  but other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to cuban americans whose support they considered significant in winning florida in the  election  miami is home to the largest cuban american community  one proposal under consideration  according to the u s  sources  would tighten enforcement to make sure americans legally fit the authorized categories they claim to be traveling under  another tougher change being weighed would revert to regulations requiring at least some types of u s  travelers to seek a special license to travel to cuba  however  airline officials say they do not expect the trump administration to revoke any flights to cuba approved by the obama administration but said new measures to restrict visits to cuba could result in less demand for seats
