san francisco washington  reuters    a u s  judge on tuesday blocked president donald trump s latest bid to impose restrictions on citizens from several countries entering the united states  which would have taken effect this week    the open ended ban  announced last month  targeted people from iran  libya  syria  yemen  somalia  chad and north korea  as well as certain government officials from venezuela  it was the third version of a policy that had previously targeted some muslim majority countries but had been restricted by the courts   tuesday s ruling sets up another high stakes battle over trump s executive authority which legal experts expect will ultimately land in the u s  supreme court  trump s first travel ban in january caused chaos and protests at u s  airports before judges halted it  the state of hawaii sued to block trump s latest travel restrictions  arguing that federal immigration law did not give him the authority to impose them on six of those countries  hawaii did not challenge entry restrictions relating to north korea and venezuela  u s  district judge derrick watson in honolulu said hawaii was likely to succeed in proving that trump s latest travel ban violates federal immigration law  the policy  suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor  it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than  million nationals from six specified countries would be  detrimental to the interests of the united states    watson wrote  the white house in a statement said the ruling was   dangerously flawed  and that it was confident the courts would ultimately uphold trump s policy    these restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our nation   the statement said  the justice department called watson s ruling  incorrect  and said it would appeal  in an expeditious manner    following the ruling  the u s  state department instructed embassies and consulates around the world to  resume regular processing of visas  for citizens of chad  iran  libya  somalia  syria and yemen  a department official said on condition of anonymity  the department will carry out the proclamation for north korea and venezuela  with the objective of maximizing national security   the official said  because the order did not apply to  restrictions on those countries  as a candidate  trump had promised  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   in announcing the newest travel restrictions  the white house had portrayed them as necessary consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas  those requirements were shared in july with foreign governments  which had  days to make improvements if needed  the white house said  a number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen  others did not  sparking the restrictions  immigrant advocacy groups cheered the hawaii ruling    we re glad  but not surprised  that president trump s illegal and unconstitutional muslim ban has been blocked once again   omar jadwat  director of the american civil liberties union immigrants rights project  said in a statement  the aclu and other groups have filed separate challenges to trump s policy in a maryland federal court  a ruling is still pending  in the hawaii case  the judge said that the ban s national security rationale was undermined by not knowing how the president settled on the countries designated by the ban   the judge also said the proclamation likely runs afoul of a prohibition in immigration law on nationality based discrimination in issuing visas  watson had blocked trump s second travel ban in march  in a statement on tuesday  hawaii attorney general doug chin said   today is another victory for the rule of law   kiyanoush razaghi  an immigration attorney with the catholic legal immigration network who has many iranian clients  said  iranians still have problems when applying for u s  visas  including particularly lengthy wait times for security checks  razaghi said he has told his clients   you can celebrate  there is no travel ban right now  but be careful because that doesn t mean you are going to get a visa in a reasonable amount of time
