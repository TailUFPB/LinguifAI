boston new york  reuters    u s  hedge fund managers began warming to president donald trump soon after his surprise election ignited a powerful stock market rally  now  his dramatic tax cut plans give them even more reasons to cheer  trump  looking to make good on pledges for sweeping tax reform  on wednesday unveiled plans for a cut in the tax rate to  percent for so called pass through businesses  while the proposal is being billed as a boon for small businesses from pizzerias to investment management firms  one clear winner looks to be the hedge fund set  where owners can earn hundreds of millions in income a year  tax experts  managers  and their lawyers said on wednesday   for hedge funds  this is an unmitigated benefit as their tax liabilities could drop significantly   said robert willens  an independent tax consultant   obviously  they are quite enthusiastic and there may be a few fist bumps along the way   a manager whose hedge fund earns   million a year  for example  would be paying some    million in taxes  or   percent  under the current rules  that could drop to as little as    million if the rate were cut to  percent  to be sure  trump s plan has a long  hard road to becoming reality  but that didn t stop fund managers from blitzing their tax lawyers with calls about how to play it  most attorneys advised patience  saying they would need to wait at least until early june  when a bill with more specific language might be hammered out   if the goal is to get people talking  then it is working   said jeffrey parker  a partner at law firm eisneramper   a proposal is just a proposal  the final version often differs significantly from the final draft   aside from the pass through proposal  an open question is what kind of treatment will be given to so called carried interest  that allows managers to pay a tax rate as low as  percent  a loophole that trump has railed against in the past  similarly  there is no clarity on whether businesses would be required to pay  reasonable compensation  to their managers  income that could be taxed at a higher rate  experts said  including that could help trump appeal to his base and mollify critics who say the plan is a giveaway for millionaires   who needs to worry about carried interest going away if you have a  percent pass through tax rate   said hedge fund manager jim chanos  who runs kynikos associates   this should really be called the  put rich guys back on top tax act of     tax reform has been a signature goal for trump since the campaign and his closest aides  including former goldman sachs  gs n  president gary cohn who now directs the national economic council  are pushing to get it done this year  but in the wake of other stalled initiatives  plenty on wall street expect the plan to hit some roadblocks    so the first draft   prepared quickly just like his failed travel ban and healthcare proposal before the  days runs out   will be push backed and maybe dramatically changed by the democrats and members of his own party   said douglas kass  who runs hedge fund seabreeze partners management
