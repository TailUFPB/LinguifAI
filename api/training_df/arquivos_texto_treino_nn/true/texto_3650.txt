washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on monday ruled that republicans in north carolina unlawfully took race into consideration when drawing congressional district boundaries  concentrating black voters in an improper bid to diminish their statewide political clout  the justices upheld a lower court s february  ruling that threw out two majority black u s  house of representatives districts because republican lawmakers improperly used race as a factor when redrawing the legislative map after the  census  the decision came in one of a number of lawsuits accusing republicans of taking steps at the state level to disenfranchise black and other minority voters who tend to back democratic candidates  the justices found that the manner in which the north carolina voting district boundaries were sketched violated the u s  constitution s guarantee of equal protection under the law  the ruling may offer a roadmap for challenging similarly drawn districts nationwide  the justices unanimously upheld the lower court on one of the districts and split   on the other  with three conservatives dissenting   the north carolina republican legislature tried to rig congressional elections by drawing unconstitutional districts that discriminated against african americans and that s wrong   said north carolina governor roy cooper  a democrat took office in january  critics accused republicans of cramming black voters into what the naacp civil rights group called  apartheid voting districts  to diminish their voting power and make surrounding districts more white and more likely to support republicans  both districts are held by the democrats  of north carolina s  representatives in the u s  house   are republican   i don t know how any legislature can perform this task when the rules change constantly from case to case  often after the fact   robin hayes  chairman of the state republican party  said of redistricting  democrats have accused republicans of taking a number of actions at the state level  also including laws imposing new requirements on voters such as presenting certain types of government issued identification  in a bid to suppress the vote of minorities  the poor and others who generally favor democratic candidates  republicans have said the laws are needed to prevent voter fraud  race can be considered in redrawing boundaries of voting districts only in certain instances  such as when states are seeking to comply with the federal voting rights act  that law protects minority voters and was enacted to address a history of racial discrimination in voting  especially in southern states  eric holder  who was u s  attorney general under president barack obama and now heads the national democratic redistricting committee  a group backing democrats in redistricting fights  welcomed the decision   today s ruling sends a stark message to legislatures and governors around the country  racial gerrymandering is illegal and will be struck down in a court of law   holder said  referring to altering political boundaries to give a party an unfair advantage  the ruling was a rebuke to north carolina republicans but the districts in question have already been re drawn  the new districts already have been challenged in court   the supreme court has never said legislative districts cannot be mapped based on plainly partisan aims like maximizing one party s election chances  north carolina republicans said one of the two districts  called the  congressional district  was drawn on purely partisan grounds to benefit republicans at the expense of democrats  and the other was drawn to comply with the demands of the voting rights act  the split among the justices was over the  district  conservative justice samuel alito wrote in dissent that the court should have followed an earlier precedent in which a previous version of the same district was challenged   a precedent of this court should not be treated like a disposable household item   say a paper plate or a napkin   to be used once and then tossed in the trash   alito wrote  writing for the court s majority  liberal justice elena kagan countered that evidence at trial  adequately supports the conclusion that race  not politics  accounted for the district s reconfiguration   conservative clarence thomas  the court s only black justice  joined kagan s ruling  justice neil gorsuch  who had not yet joined the court when it heard arguments in the case in december  did not participate  the justices last week rebuffed a republican bid to revive a strict north carolina voter identification law that a lower court found deliberately discriminated against black voters  the supreme court in  struck down a key part of the voting rights act in a ruling driven by its conservative justices  since then it has faulted some republican redistricting efforts for racial reasons  in   the supreme court ruled that alabama s republican backed legislature improperly crammed black voters into certain districts  the justices on march  ordered a lower court to reassess whether virginia s republican led legislature unlawfully tried to dilute the power of black voters  the justices threw out the lower court s decision upholding  state legislature districts
