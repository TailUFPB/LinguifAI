washington  reuters    a native american tribe in montana and a coalition of conservation groups sued the trump administration on wednesday for lifting a moratorium on coal leases on public land without consulting tribal leaders and conducting a full environmental review   it is alarming and unacceptable for the united states  which has a solemn obligation as the northern cheyenne s trustee  to sign up for many decades of harmful coal mining near and around our homeland without first consulting with our nation   tribal council chairman and president jace killsback said in a statement  the northern cheyenne tribe in southern montana said the administration had lifted the moratorium without hearing the tribe s concerns about the coal leasing program s impact on its members and lands  the tribe sent a letter earlier this month to interior secretary ryan zinke requesting a meeting to discuss the issue  zinke did not respond  and signed the order lifting the moratorium on tuesday  in a press call on wednesday  zinke did not respond to a query about the northern cheyenne lawsuit  killsback said the tribe  which filed the lawsuit in u s  district court in great falls  would be harmed by lifting the ban   the northern cheyenne rarely shares in the economic benefits to the region generated by coal industry and other energy development projects   he said   about  million tons of federal coal are located near the northern cheyenne reservation at the decker and spring creek mines in montana  the tribe said  however  neighboring tribe  the crow  relies on coal production as its predominant industry and has called for the relaxation of coal regulations for years   a war on coal is a war on the crow people   zinke said on the call  legal group earthjustice argued that lifting the coal moratorium imperils public health for the benefit of coal companies   no one voted to pollute our public lands  air or drinking water in the last election  yet the trump administration is doing the bidding of powerful polluters as nearly its first order of business   earthjustice attorney jenny harbine said in a statement  the legal filing said that undoing the moratorium violates the national environmental policy act  which requires a full environmental review prior to major policy changes
