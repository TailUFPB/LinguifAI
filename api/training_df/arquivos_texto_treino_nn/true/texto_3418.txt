washington  reuters    president donald trump faces an uphill fight convincing the supreme court it should grant his emergency request to reinstate his travel ban on people entering the united states from six predominantly muslim countries  his legal team on thursday night asked the nine justices to allow his controversial march  executive order to take effect immediately despite being blocked by lower courts  the supreme court rarely grants emergency requests  at issue is a ban trump has said is necessary to protect americans from terrorist attacks  critics say his reasoning is flawed and assail the ban as discriminatory  trump s proposed ban was a centerpiece of his  presidential campaign  the fight over the emergency application is likely to determine whether the ban ever takes effect  that is because if the court grants the request  the ban s  day term will have expired by the time the court decides the legal fate of the proposal  the   conservative majority on the high court means trump  a republican who took office on jan    likely has a better chance than he has had to date in more liberal leaning lower courts   even though it s a heavy lift getting a stay  it seems to me that the supreme court is the most favorable court they ve had access to so far   said john elwood  a washington lawyer  the administration needs five votes on the nine justice court to put the ban into effect  in this instance  the merits  of whether it violates the u s  constitution s ban on religious discrimination by targeting muslims matter less  the court weighs several factors when considering emergency applications  one such application met with success when in february  the court granted on a   vote a request by states and industry groups to block president barack obama s climate regulations  under supreme court precedent  several criteria need to be met for an emergency application to be granted  including that there would be  irreparable harm  if denied and that there is a  reasonable probability  the court would agree to hear the case on the merits  in the government s request  acting solicitor general jeff wall wrote that the nationwide injunctions blocking the travel ban have caused irreparable harm by  preventing the executive from effectuating his national security judgment   the challengers contest the administration claim that urgent action is needed to protect americans from terrorist attacks  they stress that the government did not previously ask the supreme court to intervene  even when lower courts denied earlier emergency applications seeking to lift the injunctions   this is different from the kind of case you would expect the supreme court to grant the extraordinary relief of a stay  because of the lack of any demonstrable urgency or harm and because the law and the facts are on our side   said american civil liberties union lawyer omar jadwat  on friday  the court asked the challengers  including the aclu and hawaii  to file responses to the trump requests by june   the administration is then likely to file its own response to the challengers  legal arguments before the justices issue an order granting or denying the administration s applications  one thorny issue the supreme court may have to resolve if it grants the stay is whether the  day ban trump sought to impose would begin from the day of the court s action or whether the clock has been ticking throughout the litigation  meaning it would expire in mid june  challengers will argue for the latter  which would mean it is almost set to expire  that would limit the practical impact if the application were granted  the court s conservative majority includes justice anthony kennedy  he sometimes sides with the court s four liberals and could be the pivotal vote  the travel ban s challengers have relied in part on a concurring opinion kennedy wrote in a  supreme court immigration case  kennedy wrote that in the immigration context  the government s actions can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith  another conservative justice is the man trump appointed to the high court  neil gorsuch  during his u s  senate confirmation hearing  gorsuch vowed not to be a rubber stamp for any president when asked about trump s statements criticizing judges who ruled against the travel ban   if the court agrees with trump  the  day ban on people entering the united states from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen will be immediately revived  the court could also put a  day ban on all refugees into effect and allow the administration to consider new vetting procedures  even if the court allows the travel ban to take effect  the bigger constitutional questions of religious discrimination and presidential powers raised by the order would not be considered by the nine justices until long after the ban periods have ended  the court begins its summer recess at the end of june and would not give the case a full hearing until its return in the autumn  by which time the ban would have lapsed  the emergency applications filed on thursday night seek to block injunctions issued by judges in maryland and hawaii  the maryland order was upheld on may  by the  u s  circuit court of appeals in richmond  virginia  the government s appeal of the hawaii injunction is being considered by the san francisco based  u s  circuit court of appeals  that court could issue its decision before the supreme court acts on the emergency application  separate from the emergency application  the court also has to decide whether to hear the government s full appeal of the virginia based appeals court ruling   the justices are not required to hear any case  but this one meets important criteria cited by experts  including that it is the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction
