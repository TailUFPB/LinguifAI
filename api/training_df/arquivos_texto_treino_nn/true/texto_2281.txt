washington  reuters    since taking office  u s  president donald trump has shown an affinity  and perhaps even a deference  to the generals he has surrounded himself with in his cabinet and at the white house  save one exception  the war in afghanistan  more than a dozen interviews with current and former u s  officials familiar with the discussions reveal a president deeply frustrated with the lack of options to win the  year old war  described internally as  an eroding stalemate    the debate carries echoes of the same dilemma barack obama faced in   then  as now  odds are that trump will ultimately send more troops  current and former officials say   it s the least worst option   one former u s  official familiar with the discussions said  speaking on condition of anonymity  while acknowledging that with trump  a pullout cannot be completely ruled out  trump s defense secretary  retired marine corps general jim mattis  has had the authority for nearly two months to add thousands more troops to the roughly   there now  down from a peak of more than   in    army general john nicholson  commander of u s  forces in afghanistan  requested the troops back in february  but officials say mattis won t use his authority until he has buy in from trump for a strategic vision for america s longest war  beyond more troops for afghanistan  the strategy would aim to address militant safe havens across the border in pakistan  that too has become a divisive issue  with several members of trump s inner circle split on how hard to press islamabad  sources say that the discussions   which included a high level white house meeting on thursday   could drag out for the rest of the summer  blowing past a mid july deadline to present a war strategy to an increasingly impatient congress  after thursday s meeting  chaired by vice president mike pence  people familiar with the deliberations told reuters that a final decision did not appear imminent  pentagon officials have declined to comment on internal deliberations  the white house has also declined to comment ahead of a decision on the strategy  while u s  backed fighters are rolling back islamic state in iraq and syria  the same cannot be said of the fight against the taliban insurgency in afghanistan  u s  intelligence agencies have assessed that the conditions in afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year  even with a modest increase in military assistance from america and its allies  during a july  meeting in the white house situation room  trump said mattis and marine general joseph dunford  the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  might want to consider firing nicholson  who was picked by obama in  to lead the war effort and has earned the respect of afghan leaders    we aren t winning   trump told them  according to accounts of the conversation  but current and former officials say the frustration had been mounting for months   at least as far back as february  one former u s  official said the internal deliberations about afghanistan were not aimed  at creating a broad set of options for trump  shortly before mcmaster was due to present his plan to trump for approval ahead of the may nato summit  secretary of state rex tillerson declined to endorse it  saying trump was not being presented with options  the former official and another current official said   the lack of options meant that the only recommendation that was originally to be put forward to the president was essentially the status quo   the former official said  discounting the troop increase as any serious shift in strategy  but in the months since  the possibility of a full pull out has been repeatedly presented and refined along with a true  status quo  option in which no new troops are sent to afghanistan  but none are pulled out either  still  u s  defense leaders are not believed to be favoring those options  david sedney  a former pentagon policy advisor under the obama administration  said failure to prioritize afghanistan could replicate the mistakes by previous u s  presidents    we ve been ambivalent about afghanistan for the last  years and when you have an ambivalent policy  it fails   said sedney  now at the center for strategic and international studies think tank in washington  mcmaster  mattis  tillerson  dunford  nicholson and some u s  intelligence officials argue that refusing to commit more u s  forces to train  equip and in some cases support the afghan security forces would eventually result in the taliban retaking most of the country from the u s  backed government in kabul  trump s concerns about afghanistan are shared by some senior officials close to the president  including chief strategist steve bannon  who  officials say  is skeptical about the need for an increase in troops in afghanistan  divisions have also emerged within trump s administration on how much to pressure pakistan  and how quickly  in order to address militant safe havens blamed for helping prolong afghanistan s war  nicholson  mcmaster and lisa curtis  senior director for south and central asia at the national security council  favor taking a strong hand with pakistan to deal with taliban militants using that country as a base from which to plot attacks in afghanistan  current and former officials say  on the other side are state department officials and others at the pentagon  including dunford  who take a broader view of pakistan s strategic importance and are less convinced that harsh actions will secure more cooperation from islamabad  they said  pakistan fiercely denies allowing any militant safe havens on its territory   the trump administration is exploring a new approach toward pakistan  reuters has reported  potential responses under discussion include expanding u s  drone strikes  redirecting aid to pakistan and perhaps eventually downgrading pakistan s status as a major non nato ally
