washington havana  reuters    the u s  government made it tougher on wednesday for americans to visit cuba and do business in the country  making good on a pledge by president donald trump to roll back his democratic predecessor s move toward warmer ties with havana  the restrictions  which take effect on thursday  are aimed at preventing the military  intelligence and security arms of cuba s communist government from benefiting from american tourists and trade  the white house said  they fill in the regulatory detail on a trump policy speech in june  in which the republican president called for a tightening of restrictions  he said then that the cuban government continued to oppress its people and former president barack obama had made too many concessions in his  diplomatic breakthrough with washington s former cold war foe  the regulations include a ban on americans doing business with some  cuban government entities  holding companies  and tourism companies  the list includes  state owned hotels  including famous hotels in old havana such as ernest hemingway s erstwhile favorite haunt the hotel ambos mundos  as well as the city s new luxury shopping mall   all these measures hurt the cuban people   said cuba s foreign ministry chief for u s  affairs josefina vidal  she said that government revenue funds cuba s free education and healthcare systems  speaking to reporters in havana  she called the list  arbitrary  and the regulations a further  setback  in u s  cuban relations  the new rules were criticized as too lax by republican leaders who favor a hard line  but as counterproductive by those who agreed with obama s rationale for the detente  that washington s many decades of isolating the caribbean island failed to force change  the cuban hotels listed included those run by military linked chains gaviota and habaguanex  republican senator marco rubio of florida  a cuban american  said the list failed to go far enough because it omitted companies like gran caribe hotel group and cubanacan that have ties to the cuban government  democratic senator patrick leahy said the regulations were unfair to cuba  coming as trump was being  feted in beijing  by a communist government  in a country to which americans can travel freely    the hypocrisy of the white house ideologues is glaring   leahy said in a statement   while u s  travelers will still be able to make authorized trips to cuba with a u s  based organization and accompanied by a u s  representative of the group  it will be harder for them to travel individually  according to the new regulations  before obama s opening  travel by many americans was similarly restricted to such organized trips  travelers need to be able to show a  full time schedule  with activities that support cuban people and show  meaningful interaction   going beyond merely staying in rooms in private homes  eating in private restaurants  or shopping in private stores  a u s  official told reporters on a conference call  the administration says it is keen to support such small private enterprises that have sprung up around the country under president raul castro s reforms to the largely state controlled economy   staying or eating or shopping in some of those privately owned places is something that we wanted to encourage  but what we wanted to say is  that alone is not enough   the official said  however  cubans in the fledgling private sector say the trump administration s more hostile stance toward havana has already hurt their business   he is putting us in serious danger by frightening away american visitors looking to rent our properties   said norma hernandez  who rents out rooms on airbnb and who said her  business flourished over the last year thanks to a surge in u s  visitors  trump s rollback of obama s opening has not affected a  centerpiece of the detente  the restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in havana and washington  business contracts and travel arrangements already in place will be allowed to go ahead and will not be subject to the restrictions  officials told reporters  the list of entities that americans cannot do business with includes a special development zone at cuba s mariel port  which cuba hopes to develop into a major caribbean industrial and shipping hub with tax and customs breaks  the national foreign trade council  a business lobby group in washington  called the mariel restriction  counterproductive  because it would hurt a cuban government initiative that could potentially benefit cuban workers  the head of an educational travel company said there were still many legal avenues   as well as commercial flights  cruise ships  u s  owned hotels  and tour providers   to enable americans to visit cuba  but he said the new restrictions would hurt cuba s private sector  at a time when the economy is already struggling   u s  backtracking on cuba could not come at a worse time   said collin laverty  president of cuba educational travel
