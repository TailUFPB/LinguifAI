san francisco  reuters    when gokul gunasekaran was offered a full scholarship for a graduate program in electrical engineering at stanford university  he saw it as the chance of a lifetime  he had grown up in chennai  india  and had a solid job offer with a large oil company after getting his undergraduate degree  he came to america instead  got the stanford degree and now works as an engineer at a data science startup in silicon valley  but for the past five years  he has been waiting for a green card that would give him full legal rights as a permanent resident  in the meantime  he is in a holding pattern on an  b visa  which permits him to live and work in the united states but does not allow him easily to switch jobs or start his own company   it was a no brainer when i came to this country  but now i m kind of regretting taking that scholarship   said gunasekaran    who is also vice president with a non profit group called immigration voice that represents immigrants waiting for green cards   immigration voice estimates there are some   million  b visa holders in the country waiting for green cards  many of whom are from india and have been waiting for more than a decade  many of these immigrants welcomed president donald trump s executive order this week to the federal departments overseeing the program to review it  a move that may lead to  b visas being awarded to the highest paying  highest skilled jobs rather than through a random lottery  their hope is that merit based  bs might then lead to merit based green cards   i think less random is great   said guru hariharan  the ceo and founder of boomerang commerce  an e commerce startup  hariharan  who was previously an executive at amazon com inc and ebay inc  spent  years waiting for his green card and started his own company as soon as he got it  green cards can be a path to naturalization and hariharan expects to become a u s  citizen soon   b visas are aimed at foreign nationals in occupations that generally require specialized knowledge  such as science  engineering or computer programming  the u s  government uses a lottery to award   such visas yearly and randomly distributes another   to graduate student workers  the  b and the green card system are technically separate  but many immigrants from india see them as intimately connected  the number of green cards that can go to people born in each country is capped at a few percent of the total  without regard to how large or small the country s population is  there is a big backlog of indian born people in the line  given the size of india s population     billion   and the number of its natives in the united states waiting for green cards  that leaves many of those immigrants stuck on  b visas while they wait  which they say makes them almost like  indentured servants   said gaurav mehta  an  b holder who works in the financial industry   mehta has a u s  born son  but he could be forced to take his family back to india at any time if he loses his job and cannot find another quickly   he s never been to my country   mehta said of his son   but we ll have no choice if we have to go  nobody likes to live in constant fear    the  b visa is tied to a specific employer  who must apply for the visa and sponsor the employee for a specific job laid out in the visa application  to switch employers  the visa holder must secure their paperwork from their current employer and find another employer willing to take over their visa  some  b holders suspect that employers purposely seek out indian immigrants because they know they will end up waiting for green cards and will be afraid to leave their employers  but changing the green card system away from country caps to a merit based system would require an act of congress  some  executives also worry that allocating  bs and green cards based on salary   while it would be done to counter the argument that immigrants undercut american workers   would hurt startups that cannot afford high wages  in the meantime   b holders like nitin pachisia  founding partner of a venture capital firm called unshackled ventures  are taking more practical measures  his firm specializes in taking care of the legal paperwork so that  b holders can start their own companies  a process that is possible but tricky  pachisia is hopeful that changes to the  b visa program could revive interest in making the entire system  from  b visas to green cards and eventual citizenship  more merit based and focused on immigrants who are likely to start companies and create jobs   if the purpose of our high skilled immigration program is to bring in the most talented people  let s use that as a lens  from that perspective  it s a good thing we can focus on the most talented  and i d say most entrepreneurial  people   he said   this version of the story has been refiled to add missing word  startup  in paragraph two
