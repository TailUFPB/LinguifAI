mcallen  texas  reuters    standing on the bluffs of roma  texas on a may afternoon two border patrol agents look out over the meandering rio grande river that separates mexico from the united states and recall a time when the scene was far less tranquil       last fall  during the waning months of the obama administration  hundreds of immigrants crossed the river on rafts at this point each day  many willingly handing themselves over to immigration authorities in hopes of being released into the united states to await court proceedings that would decide their fate      now  the agents look out on an empty landscape  foot paths up from the water have started to disappear under growing brush  with only the stray baby shoe or toothbrush serving as reminders of that migrant flood      the reason for the change  the agents say  is a perception in mexico and central america that president donald trump has ended the practice known as  catch and release   in which immigrants caught in the united states without proper documents were released to live free  often for years  as their cases ran through the court system  now  would be border violators know  they ll be detained and then turned right back around   said one of the two agents  marlene castro   it s not worth it anymore   she said   castro was simply echoing her boss  homeland security secretary john kelly  who said on a visit to el paso  texas in april   we have ended dangerous catch and release enforcement policies   but immigration attorneys  government statistics and even some officials from u s  immigration and customs enforcement  which falls under kelly  suggest that despite the dhs chief s statement  there has been no clear change to the catch and release policy  that s in large part because there are legal constraints on who can be detained and for how long  due to a shortage of beds and a court ruling limiting the stay of women and children in custody to  days       a separate court ruling limits detention time for immigrants whose countries refuse to repatriate them  and kelly noted in a february memorandum that asylum seekers that have proven they have a  credible fear  of returning home could be candidates for release if they present  neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding   daniel bible  ice field office director for southern texas  told reuters he and his colleagues have not been issued new directions  and so continue to release illegal immigrants deemed to be low security risks  usually with notices to appear in court   we look at each case the same way we always have   bible said   dhs spokeswoman jenny burke confirmed to reuters that the agency has not issued new guidance for releasing migrants caught at the border   asked to explain why there had been no new guidance  given kelly s statement in april  burke said   ice officers make custody determinations on a case by case basis  prioritizing detention resources   in a memo made public in february  kelly defined catch and release as any policy that allows immigrants to be released from detention while they await their court hearings  making it easy to abscond  ending catch and release was one of trump s central promises during the  presidential campaign  some advocates who work with migrants say they have seen little change since trump came into office   sure  people are still being released   said kevin appleby  senior director of international migration policy at the center for migration studies   not because they believe in releasing them  but because there are not enough beds at the moment    ice declined to provide data on the number of migrants being released into the united states  but other ice data not previously published and reviewed by reuters shows the pool of people not in custody and awaiting court appearances is growing   since trump took office in late january  the number of immigrants awaiting court proceedings while living freely in the united states has grown by nearly    rising by an average of about   per month  according to the ice data  during the last seven months of president barack obama s presidency  the rolls of those awaiting legal proceedings outside of custody grew more rapidly  at an average of about   people per month  part of the slower rate under trump can be traced to a  percent drop in apprehensions of people crossing the border  still  the numbers suggest the trump administration is a long way from ending catch and release   numbersusa  a washington based organization that supports limited immigration  praised the trump administration s tough talk and its chilling effect on illegal immigration   that impact will be temporary  though  unless the administration follows through by ending  catch and release  for good   it said  the trump administration though has come up against the reality that there simply is not enough space in detention centers   congress has funded about   beds to detain immigration violators  and the average daily population of detainees has been near or above capacity since before trump took office        one way the administration hopes to free up detention space is to decrease the time it takes to resolve cases   the justice department has requested funding to hire an additional  immigration judges over the next two years  an increase of  percent   in the meantime  some border officials hope would be migrants remain nervous  when told that ice detention centers are still releasing many immigrants to live in the united states  castro and her border agent colleague  who declined to be named  exchanged a look and then shrugged   don t tell them that   her colleague said   see a related photo essay here reut rs
