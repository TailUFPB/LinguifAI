washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court on friday added a second case to its docket on a contentious issue that could have major consequences for american elections  agreeing to decide whether democratic lawmakers in maryland unlawfully drew a congressional district in a way that would prevent a republican candidate from winning  the court s agreement to take up an appeal by republican voters in maryland regarding the u s  house of representatives district came two months after the justices heard arguments in a high profile challenge by democratic voters to republican drawn state legislative districts in wisconsin  both cases target a practice known as partisan gerrymandering that aims to entrench one party in power and that critics have called a distortion of the democratic process  the justices have not yet issued a ruling in the wisconsin case  each case presents a different legal theory as to why limits should be placed on partisan gerrymandering  and the court s decision to take up a second case on the issue hints that at least some of the nine justices are seriously considering cracking down on it   gerrymandering  a practice dating back two centuries in american politics  involves manipulating boundaries of legislative districts to benefit one party and diminish another  legislative districts around the united states are redrawn every decade after the national census to reflect population changes  the  redistricting  in most states is done by the party in power though some states assign the task to independent commissions  the supreme court for decades has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination but never those drawn simply for partisan advantage  in the maryland case  the republican voters targeting the democratic drawn electoral map appealed a   ruling in august by a panel of three federal judges sitting in baltimore rejecting their challenge  maryland s sixth congressional district  the focus of the case  was previously held by a republican and now is held by democrat john delaney  when the supreme court heard arguments in the wisconsin case on oct    the justices appeared closely divided  with conservative justice anthony kennedy likely to cast the deciding vote  the republican challengers in maryland take aim at a single electoral district  not the whole state as in the wisconsin case  they argue that the district should be struck down because it was drawn by democrats as a form of retaliation on the basis of past party affiliation based on the constitution s guaranteed rights of free association and free speech  the challengers in the wisconsin case argued that the republican electoral map violated democratic voters  rights to equal protection under the law as well as free speech and association  in the wisconsin case  the legal argument advanced by the democratic challengers was that an electoral map would be unlawful if the intent was to discriminate against minority party voters  the map had a sizable effect in accomplishing that goal and that there was no other justification for the map  the theory was based in part on measuring the number of  wasted  votes in each district cast for a losing candidate and comparing each party s total wasted votes on a statewide basis  the results  plaintiffs said  show whether one party s votes are more likely to be wasted than the other party s  which would show evidence of unconstitutional extreme partisan gerrymandering
