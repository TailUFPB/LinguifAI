seattle  reuters    a u s  tax overhaul proposed by republican leaders in congress would deepen divisions between big manufacturers like boeing co and the thousands of smaller companies that supply them  according to suppliers and tax and trade experts  u s  automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals  which would tax imports at a  percent rate  and could split these sectors into winners and losers  the revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry  where boeing s aggressive cost cutting driven by fierce competition with european rival airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad  aerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching boeing s factories in washington and south carolina  u s  based suppliers to boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts  boeing  the top exporter among u s  manufacturers  would export its jetliners tax free  boeing and some of its largest suppliers  such as united technologies corp  general electric co and honeywell international inc  which also have substantial exports  favor the republican tax package   the plans  laid out in a blueprint last year and which president donald trump has spoken about favorably  aim to boost u s  manufacturing  and include cutting the corporate tax rate to  percent from  percent and making capital investments immediately deductible  lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer  but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected  according to congressional staff  if the proposed  percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year  norfil complex machining  a  employee company in pacific  washington  likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from russia  the metal goes into parts norfil makes for boeing landing gear that get assembled in japan     a lot of russian titanium goes into planes   said doren spinner  norfil s ceo  his purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up  so the tax  would end up affecting what the plane would cost   he says  other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on  and some might move production to low cost locations abroad   if the taxes are ridiculous  we d just have to think of something creative   said paul doran  a sales manager at mifa  a subsidiary of netherlands based aalberts industries nv that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace  autos and other industries   i think most companies would be in the same boat    colin frost  chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier carr lane manufacturing co in st  louis  missouri  said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed   we d end up splitting up the company and i don t think that s necessarily good for the u s  economy   he said   boeing said it was too soon to judge the plan s effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain   these assessments will vary by company  and it s premature to speculate or generalize   boeing spokeswoman kate bernard said   boeing was among about  companies  including many suppliers  that signed a letter this month from the aerospace industries association urging congress to overhaul the u s  tax system  boeing also is part of the american made coalition  an industry group that backs republican tax proposals  proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar  offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers  and  would encourage companies to invest in the united states  the tax overhaul could have cut boeing s taxable income by an estimated    billion last year  according to tax experts and a reuters analysis of boeing s  deliveries  two thirds of boeing s jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt  worth about   billion at list prices  they were likely sold at discounts of about  percent typical in the industry  boeing declined to comment on the estimate  boeing would face import taxes  too  its  dreamliner  for example  uses major parts from japan s mitsubishi heavy industries ltd  fuji heavy industries ltd  kawasaki heavy industries ltd and italy s leonardo spa   boeing also would still pay tax on sales to u s  airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses  which source and sell globally  yet suppliers say boeing s vigorous cost saving has pressed many to outsource production to low cost countries  which now exposes them to a potential border tax  u s  aerospace imports have doubled the past decade  with mexico the fastest growing source  up  percent since    graphic  tmsnrt rs   supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime  said david wireman  managing director and co head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm alixpartners    the tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers  and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships
