dunwoody  ga   reuters    democrat jon ossoff no longer talks about making president donald trump furious  but he may be on the verge of doing just that  ossoff  a political newcomer who launched his congressional campaign in the republican leaning northern suburbs of atlanta by urging supporters to  make trump furious   now speaks in the measured tones of a moderate consensus builder and rarely mentions the president by name  local economic development and cutting wasteful government spending are ossoff s talking points in a race against republican karen handel that has shattered records as the most expensive congressional contest in u s  history  polls show it is headed for a tight finish in tuesday s special election  an ossoff victory would rattle republicans already nervous about next year s congressional midterm elections  and offer democrats a template on how to campaign in suburban swing districts as they try to erase the  seat republican majority in the house of representatives   it would send a very strong message across the country that we can win these kinds of seats   said representative dan kildee  a michigan democrat who campaigned with ossoff in georgia this week  democrats have much riding on the outcome  on the surface  conditions seem ripe for a nationwide democratic renaissance  with a historically unpopular republican president entangled in an investigation for possible obstruction of justice and the republican agenda largely stalled in congress  but democrats lost two special house elections earlier this year in conservative kansas and montana districts that trump won by double digits last november  a failure in a more competitive district in georgia  which trump carried by just  percentage point  would be a morale killer for a party that has struggled to develop a coherent message beyond  we re not the party of trump   democrats have steadily lost ground in recent years in state and local races  republicans not only control the white house and both chambers of congress  but also hold  governor s offices  the most in nearly a century  infighting between grass roots progressives and the party s more mainstream wing has plagued democrats  who have appeared increasingly vulnerable to republican attacks portraying them as coastal elites out of touch with working class americans  ossoff s  make trump furious  slogan quickly endeared him to national anti trump activists and pushed him well ahead of  rivals in polls in april s non partisan primary in a district represented by republicans for decades  it wasn t enough  the  year old former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker fell just short of a majority  and outright victory  forcing a closely watched run off against handel for the house seat vacated by tom price  the new secretary of health and human services who was first elected to the house in    but the grassroots enthusiasm has made ossoff a fundraising machine  he raised a stunning   million by the end of may  five times the amount raised by handel  a former georgia secretary of state  republican outside groups have helped her make up some of the difference  spending nearly   million on her behalf  according to fundraising reports  total spending has approached   million  obliterating the previous record of   million for a florida congressional race in   while he benefits from the grassroots anti trump fervor  ossoff has deliberately avoided making the race a referendum on trump  on the campaign trail and in ads  he promises to work with republicans and focuses on his plans to bolster local economic development  protect access to healthcare  particularly for women  and cut wasteful spending to pay for new priorities  ossoff said voters in the district are not demanding that he lead an anti trump resistance   i think voters are more concerned with accountability and results than they are with political drama   he said in an interview after a meeting with millennial supporters  while voters  concerns about the administration have grown  he said   fundamentally what folks are looking for is representation that will work across the aisle to deliver a higher quality of life   handel  who also rarely mentions trump and has argued that the race should be about who has the values and experience to best serve the district  says ossoff is misrepresenting himself   he s trying to portray himself as something that he is not  he is nancy pelosi s hand picked candidate   handel told reporters this week after greeting diners at a local hamburger restaurant  repeating a line about house democratic leader pelosi that has featured prominently in attack ads against ossoff by outside groups   he is an ultra liberal  his values do not align with this district   she said  some of her supporters agree  terry anderson    a retired it worker from cobb county  said he did not believe ossoff was sincere   he sounds more like a moderate republican all the time   he said  but brenda carswell    a retired american express employee from the city of tucker who said she typically has switched back and forth between republicans and democrats    i ve voted for some bushes and i ve voted for some clintons    said she is backing ossoff   he s been mostly discussing issues that people care about  the problems in our area are more important than most of what they talk about in washington   she said  trump  who visited georgia to raise money for handel in late april  is watching closely  on twitter  he criticized ossoff  and after ossoff was forced into a runoff he crowed that democrats  failed in kansas and are now failing in georgia   trump called the race  hollywood vs  georgia   several recent polls have given ossoff a slight edge heading into tuesday  while showing that there are few voters who are still undecided  democrats say the increasingly diverse area exemplifies the sort of educated and affluent suburban district that democrats will need to win to recapture the house  georgia based democratic strategist tharon johnson said ossoff s non ideological messaging should be a model for a party that needs moderates  independents and disaffected republicans next year   he s done a good job of positioning himself as a sensible democrat   he said   he doesn t need to tell voters what is wrong with trump   people see the drama and the problems every day
