washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump and members of his administration on sunday goaded republican senators to stick with trying to pass a healthcare bill  after the lawmakers failed spectacularly last week to muster the votes to end obamacare  for the second day running  the republican president tweeted his impatience with congress  inability to deliver on his party s seven year promise to replace the affordable care act  president barack obama s signature healthcare bill commonly known as obamacare  members of his administration took to the airwaves to try to compel lawmakers to take action  but it was unclear whether the white house admonishments would have any impact on capitol hill  where republicans who control both houses signaled last week that it was time to move on to other issues  republicans  zeal to repeal and replace obamacare was met with both intra party divisions between moderates and conservatives and also the increasing approval of a law that raised the number of insured americans by  million    polling indicates a majority of americans are ready to move on from healthcare at this point  according to a reuters ipsos poll released on saturday   percent of   people surveyed on friday and saturday said they wanted to keep obamacare  either  entirely as is  or after fixing  problem areas   that is up from  percent in january    with the u s  legislative branch spinning its wheels  the executive branch pledged to look at rewriting obamacare regulations  health and human services secretary tom price told abc s  this week  that he would change those regulations that drive up costs or  hurt  patients  price sidestepped questions about whether there were administration plans to waive obamacare s mandate that individuals have health insurance  saying  all things are on the table to try to help patients   but price also told nbc he would implement obamacare because it is the  law of the land   that obamacare was still law clearly angered trump  who has no major legislative accomplishments to show for his first half year in office   don t give up republican senators  the world is watching  repeal   replace      the president said in a tweet on sunday morning  on friday  senate republicans failed to collect enough votes to repeal even a few parts of obamacare  that capped a week of failed senate votes on whether to simply repeal  or repeal and replace  the  law  while trump repeatedly berated lawmakers in a late attempt to influence the legislation    the president will not accept those who said  quote   it s time to move on    kellyanne conway  a senior counselor to trump  said on fox news sunday  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a republican  had made exactly that comment before dawn on friday morning after the failed healthcare vote       the white house budget director  mick mulvaney  said on sunday lawmakers should stay in session to get something done on healthcare   even if this means postponing votes on other issues such as raising the debt ceiling   so yes  they need to stay  they need to work  they need to pass something   mulvaney said on cnn  the house of representatives has already gone home for its august break and the senate is expected to do the same by mid august  mulvaney also said trump was seriously considering carrying out threats he tweeted about on saturday  when the president said that  if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly  bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon    that tweet appeared to be referring to the approximately   billion in cost sharing reduction subsidies the federal government pays to insurers to lower the price of health coverage for low income americans   the saturday tweet also appeared to be a threat to end the  employer contribution for members of congress and their staffs  who were moved from the normal federal employee healthcare benefits program onto the obamacare insurance exchanges as part of the  healthcare law   what he s saying is  look  if obamacare is hurting the american people   and it is   then why shouldn t it hurt insurance companies and more importantly  perhaps for this discussion  members of congress   mulvaney said on sunday on cnn  some republicans have said they are trying to find a way forward on healthcare  senate republican susan collins  one of three republicans who voted against repealing parts of obamacare on friday  told nbc that congress should produce a series of bills with bipartisan input on healthcare  including appropriating the cost sharing subsidies   the senate has one vote scheduled when it reconvenes on monday afternoon  whether to confirm a u s  circuit court judge  senate aides said they had no guidance for the agenda beyond that vote
