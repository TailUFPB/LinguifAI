washington  reuters    president donald trump signed a temporary order on thursday to keep the u s  embassy in israel in tel aviv instead of relocating it to jerusalem  despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial move  after months of fierce debate within his administration  trump chose to continue his predecessors  policy of signing a six month waiver overriding a  law requiring that the embassy be transferred to jerusalem  an action that would have complicated his efforts to restart israeli palestinian peace talks  the white house insisted  however  that the decision  which is sure to disappoint israel s u s  supporters  did not mean trump was abandoning the goal of eventually shifting the embassy to jerusalem  but a u s  official said no timetable has been set   the question is not if that move happens  but only when   the white house said in a statement  with a deadline looming  trump made the decision to defer action on the embassy  to maximize the chances of successfully negotiating a deal between israel and the palestinians  fulfilling his solemn obligation to defend america s national security interests   the white house said  palestinian leaders  arab governments and western allies had urged trump not to proceed with the embassy relocation  which would have upended decades of u s  policy by granting what would have been seen as de facto u s  recognition of israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital   though israel is disappointed that the embassy will not move at this time  we appreciate today s expression of president trump s friendship to israel and his commitment to moving the embassy in the future   israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s office said in a statement  taking a harder stance  israeli education minister naftali bennett  a far right member of netanyahu s coalition  said delaying the move would  damage the prospect of a lasting peace by nurturing false expectations among the palestinians regarding the division of jerusalem  which will never happen   nabil abu rdainah  a close aide to palestinian president mahmoud abbas  said trump s decision  reaffirms the seriousness of the united states in its efforts to achieve peace   trump avoided any public mention of a potential embassy move during his visit to israel and the west bank in may  despite that  most experts are skeptical of trump s chances for achieving a peace deal that had eluded other u s  presidents  the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks  israel captured arab east jerusalem during the  middle east war and later annexed it  a move not recognized internationally  israel considers all of the city its indivisible capital  the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state  jerusalem is home to sites considered holy by the jewish  muslim and christian religions  successive u s  administrations have insisted that jerusalem s status must be decided in negotiations  on the campaign trail  trump s pro israel rhetoric raised expectations that he would act quickly to move the embassy  but after he took office in january  the issue lost momentum as he met arab leaders who warned it would be hard to rejuvenate long stalled peace efforts unless he acted as a fair mediator  some of trump s top aides pushed for him to keep his campaign promise to satisfy the pro israel  right wing base that helped him win the presidency  the state department  however recommended against an embassy move  one u s  official said   no one should consider this step to be in any way a retreat from the president s strong support for israel   according to the white house statement on the signing of the waiver
