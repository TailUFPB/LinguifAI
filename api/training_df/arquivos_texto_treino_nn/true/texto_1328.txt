 reuters    u s  food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb  considered a potential successor to recently departed health and human services secretary tom price  said on tuesday he believed he could best serve the trump administration in his current role       i feel like i want to continue to follow through on the policies we ve put out and it s where i think i can be most effective   gottlieb told reuters in an interview in new york  he declined to say whether he had been approached about the job by the white house   i m not going to get into private discussions i might have had around that   he said  gottlieb is one of several potential candidates for the top job at hhs  a post vacated by price last month following an uproar over his use of private jets for government business  other names mentioned by health policy experts include seema verma  administrator of the centers for medicare   medicaid services  cms  and louisiana governor bobby jindal  gottlieb has won mostly positive reviews since taking over as fda commissioner in may  he has introduced policies tackling some of the country s biggest health challenges  including opioid and tobacco addiction and rising prescription drug prices   the top post at the fda has always been difficult to fill  gottlieb noted  and there have been long stretches where the agency has operated under an acting commissioner  gottlieb once served as senior adviser to fda commissioner mark mcclellan  who left the agency in  after just two years to run cms  a move that gottlieb said was detrimental to the agency   it s always challenging to move an fda commissioner   he said   continuity of leadership there is important   in a wide ranging interview  gottlieb said the situation on the ground in puerto rico  where  percent of drugs prescribed in the united states are made  was  very bad  and that shortages of some drugs could emerge within as little as two to three weeks  he also said the agency is going to more clearly define regulations around cell therapies  the law currently states that if a cell is extracted from a patient s body and more than minimally manipulated it is a drug subject to fda regulation   historically the fda hasn t vigorously enforced around that line because it didn t have the implementing guidelines to do that   he said  at the same time  the agency plans novel measures to make it easier for small academic centers to apply for fda product approval by pooling data generated from similar work   if academicians working at different academic sites are doing a similar procedure with stem cells  if they are all following the same protocol  then they re going to be able to pool their data to submit it for regulatory approval   he said
