washington  reuters    the u s  supreme court agreed on monday to decide whether the u s  constitution limits how far lawmakers can go to redraw voting districts to favor one political party over another in a case that could have huge consequences for american elections  the high court has been willing to invalidate state electoral maps on the grounds of racial discrimination  as it did on may  when it found that republican legislators in north carolina had drawn two electoral districts to diminish the statewide political clout of black voters  but the justices have not thrown out state electoral maps drawn simply to give one party an advantage over another  the justices will take up wisconsin s appeal of a lower court ruling last november that state republican lawmakers violated the constitution when they created state legislative districts with the partisan aim of hobbling democrats in legislative races  the case will be one of the biggest heard by the supreme court during its term that begins in october  the case involves a long standing practice known as gerrymandering  a term meaning manipulating electoral boundaries for an unfair political advantage  the lower court ruled that the republican led legislature s redrawing of state legislative districts in  amounted to  an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander   a panel of three federal judges in madison ruled   that the way the republicans redrew the districts violated the u s  constitution s guarantees of equal protection under the law and free speech by undercutting the ability of democratic voters to turn their votes into seats in wisconsin s legislature  in a possible sign of deep ideological divisions among the nine justices over the issue  the court s conservative majority granted wisconsin s request  despite opposition from the four liberal justices  to put on hold the lower court s order requiring the state to redraw its electoral maps by nov    that means wisconsin will not need to put in place a new electoral map while the justices consider the matter  a supreme court ruling faulting the wisconsin redistricting plan could have far reaching consequences for the redrawing of electoral districts due after the  u s  census  state and federal legislative district boundaries are reconfigured every decade after the census so that each one holds about same number of people  but are sometimes draw in a way that packs voters who tend to favor a particular party into certain districts so as to diminish their statewide voting power  wisconsin republican attorney general brad schimel welcomed the justices  decision to hear the state s appeal and called the state s redistricting process  entirely lawful and constitutional   the case in the short term could affect congressional maps in about half a dozen states and legislative maps in about  states  before having major implications for the post  redistricting  according to the new york university school of law s brennan center for justice   wisconsin s gerrymander was one of the most aggressive of the decade  locking in a large and implausibly stable majority for republicans in what is otherwise a battleground state   said brennan center redistricting expert thomas wolf   it s a symptom of politics going haywire and something that we increasingly see when one party has sole control of the redistricting process   justice anthony kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the court s liberals in major cases  could cast the decisive vote  kennedy  writing in a  case  indicated he may be open to the idea that racial gerrymanders could violate the constitution  though a  workable standard  defining it did not exist  he suggested one might emerge in a future case  democrats have accused republicans of taking improper actions at the state level to suppress the turnout of minority voters and others who tend to support democrats and maximize the number of party members in state legislatures and the u s  house of representatives  republicans call their actions lawful  republicans control the u s  congress  they also have majorities in an all time high of  of  state legislative chambers  according to the republican state leadership committee  after winning control of the state legislature in   wisconsin republicans redrew the statewide electoral map  they were able to amplify republican voting power  gaining more seats than their percentage of the statewide vote would suggest  in   republicans received about  percent of the vote but won  of the  state assembly seats  in   the party garnered  percent of the vote and  assembly seats  a dozen wisconsin democratic party voters in  sued state election officials  saying the redistricting divided democratic voters in some areas and packed them in others to dilute their electoral clout and benefit republican candidates   the lower court found that redistricting efforts are unlawful partisan gerrymandering when they seek to entrench the party in power  and have no other legitimate justification   the state argues recent election results favoring republicans were  a reflection of wisconsin s natural political geography   with democrats concentrated in urban areas like milwaukee and madison
