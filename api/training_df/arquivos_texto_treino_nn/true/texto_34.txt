 king of prussia  pennsylvania washington  reuters    in the fox   hound sports bar  next to a shopping mall in suburban philadelphia  four democrats are giving speeches to potential voters as they begin their journey to try to unseat republican congressman pat meehan in next year s elections  winning this congressional district   pennsylvania s    is key to democrats  hopes of gaining the  seats they need to retake the u s  house of representatives next november  the stakes are high   control of the house would allow them to block president donald trump s legislative agenda  on the surface  democrats face a significant hurdle  in nearly two thirds of  republican held districts that are top of the party s target list  household income or job growth  and often both  have risen faster than state and national averages over the past two years  according to a reuters analysis of census data   graphic  tmsnrt rs   that is potentially vote winning news for republican incumbents  who in speeches and television ads can trumpet a strengthening economy as a product of republican control of washington  even though incomes and job growth began improving under former democratic president barack obama   the good economy is really the only positive keeping republicans afloat   said david wasserman  a congressional analyst with the non partisan cook political report  still  trumpeting the good economy may have limited impact among voters in competitive districts like this mostly white southeast region of pennsylvania bordering delaware and new jersey  which has switched between both parties twice in the past  years  many of the two dozen voters that reuters interviewed in the  and  districts agreed the economy was strong  that jobs were returning and wages were growing  a handful were committed republicans and democrats who always vote the party line  about half voted for meehan last year  but most of those said they were unsure whether they would vote for him again in   some said they were disappointed with the republican party s handling of healthcare and tax reform as well as trump s erratic performance  about half also felt that despite an improving economy  living costs are squeezing the middle class  drew mcginty  one of the democratic hopefuls at the fox   hound bar hoping to unseat meehan  said the good economic numbers were misleading   when i talk to people across the district  i hear about stagnant wages  i hear about massive debt young people are getting when they finish college  there s a lot out there not being told by the numbers   he said  still  meehan  who won by  points in last november s general election  is confident the strong economy will help him next year  he plans to run as a job creator and a champion of the middle class   the first thing people look at is whether they have got a job and income   meehan said in a telephone interview  democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton carried the district by more than two points in the white house race  giving democrats some hope that they can peel it away from republicans next november  kyle kondik  a political analyst at the university of virginia center for politics  said the election will essentially be a referendum on trump  the economy might help republicans  he said  but other issues will likely be uppermost in voters  minds  like the republican tax overhaul   which is seen by some as favoring the rich over the middle class   and trump s dismantling of president barack obama s initiative to expand healthcare to millions of americans  popularly known as obamacare  indeed  healthcare is americans  top concern  according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted earlier this month  next is terrorism and then the economy   healthcare will be the no   issue   in the election  predicted molly sheehan  another democrat running to unseat meehan  democrats have warned that dismantling obamacare will leave millions of americans without health coverage  and political analysts say republicans in vulnerable districts could be punished by angry voters  republicans argue that obamacare drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions  in broomall  a hamlet in the  district  local builder greg dulgerian    said he voted for trump and meehan  he still likes trump because of his image as a political outsider  but he is less certain about meehan   i m busy  which is good   dulgerian said   but i actually make less than i did  years ago  because my living costs and costs of materials have gone up   dulgerian said he was not sure what meehan was doing to address this  and he was open to a democratic candidate with a plan to help the middle class  ida mccausland    is a registered republican but said she is disappointed with the party  she views the overhaul of the tax system as a giveaway to the rich that will hit the middle class   i will probably just go democrat   she said  still  others interviewed said the good economy was the most important issue for them and would vote for meehan      mike allard    a stocks day trader  voted for clinton last year but did not cast a ballot in the congressional vote  he thinks the economy will help meehan next year and is leaning toward voting for him   local businesses like the way the economy is going right now   he said  in the  district median household income jumped more than  percent from  to   from    to around     above the national average increase of   percent  while job growth held steady  the analysis of the census data shows  overall  the u s  economy has grown  percent in recent quarters  and some forecasters now think the stimulus from the republican tax cuts will sustain that rate of growth through next year  unemployment has dropped to   percent  a  year low  in midterm congressional elections  history shows that voters often focus on issues other than the economy  in  the economy was thriving  but president lyndon b  johnson s democrats suffered a net loss of  seats  partly because of growing unhappiness with the vietnam war  in   again the economy was humming  but republicans lost a net  seats in the house  as voters focused on the iraq war and the unpopularity of republican president george w  bush  in   despite pulling the economy out of a major recession  democrats lost control of the house to republicans  mainly because of the passage of obamacare  which at the time was highly unpopular with many voters   when times are bad  the election is almost always about the economy  when the economy is good  people have the freedom and the ability to worry about other issues   said stu rothenberg  a veteran political analyst
