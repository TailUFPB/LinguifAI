washington  reuters    the powerful u s  gun lobby  the national rifle association  said on sunday it would oppose an outright ban on bump stock devices that the killer in the las vegas massacre of  people used to turn rifles into automatic weapons and strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained gunfire  the nra  which has seldom embraced new firearms control measures  stunned gun control advocates last week when it issued a statement voicing willingness to support a restriction on bump stocks  on sunday  the organization said it was open to regulation but opposed any legislation banning the devices   we don t believe that bans have ever worked on anything  what we have said has been very clear   that if something transfers a semiautomatic to function like a fully automatic  then it ought to be regulated differently   chris cox  the nra s chief lobbyist  said on  fox news sunday   police said the gunman  stephen paddock    fitted  of his weapons with  bump stock devices that allow semi automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns  which are otherwise outlawed in the united states  cox and wayne lapierre  the nra s chief executive  accused the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives under democratic former president barack obama of paving the way for the use of bump stocks and creating legal confusion about their usage   republican president donald trump  whose party controls both chambers of the u s  congress  was an outspoken advocate of gun rights during his  campaign for the white house  the nra spent more than   million in support of his candidacy  several republican lawmakers suggested last week that they were receptive to legislation to curb the use of bump stocks  including kevin mccarthy  the no   republican in the house of representatives  who said such controls were an area where congress may be able to act  but house majority whip steve scalise  a republican who himself was nearly killed by a gunman earlier this year while at a baseball practice  was cautious on sunday about potential new legislation   i do think it s a little bit early for people to say they know what to do to fix this problem   he said on nbc s  meet the press     a week ago most people didn t know what a bump stock was so to think that we re now all experts and know how to write some panacea law  it s fallacy   scalise added  lapierre lashed out at u s  senator dianne feinstein  a democrat who has pushed for gun control legislation on capitol hill   i think you want to tell atf to do its job  it s an interpretive issue and they need to get the job done  but not let dianne feinstein  which is what she wants to do   turn this all of this into some christmas tree on the hill where she brings all of her anti gun circus she has been trying to do for years into this   lapierre said on cbs s  face the nation   feinstein said she has garnered some republican interest  but no support  for the measure   i have nobody lined up   she told the cbs program  some gun control advocates praised the nra for showing some flexibility   this is the first time that the gun lobby has shown willingness to come to the table and i think that s in part because americans just simply do not accept mass shooting after mass shooting happening and congress doing absolutely nothing   democratic senator chris murphy said on cnn s  state of the union    but sunday s comments from the nra representatives suggested nothing may have changed as they castigated calls for gun control measures in the emotional aftermath of a mass shooting    there used to be a common decency in this country where people paused talking about policy  unfortunately with dianne feinstein and michael bloomberg  they want to exploit a tragedy from day one  it s shameful  but apparently that s the new normal   cox said on the  fox news sunday  program  bloomberg  a billionaire and former mayor of new york  has been an outspoken critic of the national rifle association through the group everytown for gun safety  investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove paddock  a retired real estate investor and high stakes gambler  on oct   to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s  history
