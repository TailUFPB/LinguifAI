washington  reuters    u s  senator jeff flake said on wednesday he expects more  republican colleagues to speak out against donald trump s behavior and policies  one day after denouncing the republican president in a fiery speech  flake had accused trump of  reckless  outrageous and undignified  behavior and said his  instinct to scapegoat and belittle threatens to turn us into a fearful  backward looking people   his condemnation in a speech on the senate floor came just hours after senator bob corker  another republican  lashed out at trump as  an utterly untruthful president  who was debasing the united states  flake  who is not seeking re election in arizona next year  said on wednesday he thinks other republican lawmakers will join him in standing up to trump   privately a number of my colleagues have expressed concern about the direction of our politics and the behavior of the president   flake told cnn   there comes a tipping point where you realize we just can t continue to normalize this kind of behavior so i do think we ll have more people stand up in the coming months   trump responded by saying flake s feud with him probably would have cost him with voters and that he would have lost if he had sought re election   he was against me before he ever knew me   trump told reporters on wednesday   he would have never won  he did the smart thing for himself  this way he can get out somewhat gracefully   despite control of the white house  the senate and the house of representatives  republicans have yet to deliver any major legislative victories this year on priorities such as tax reform  healthcare and immigration  republican senator john mccain  who is fighting brain cancer  also has spoken out sharply against trump   but most republicans in congress have either remained silent or tried to play down divisions inside their party as trump has attacked lawmakers  the media and others he sees as opposing or trying to undermine his presidency   i think people should settle their differences personally   republican house speaker paul ryan told reuters in an interview on wednesday   i think it s better that way  i think it s in our interest to have party unity so that we can continue to work forward on an agenda   so far  the fierce criticism from flake and corker has drawn more praise from democrats than from fellow republicans   history will judge senator flake and senator corker as two men of the greatest conscience to have graced this chamber on either side of the aisle in a long time   senate democratic leader chuck schumer said
