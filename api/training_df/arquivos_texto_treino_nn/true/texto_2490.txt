washington  reuters    republican u s  senate leaders  struggling to keep a seven year promise to end obamacare  turned their focus on wednesday to passing a slimmed down  skinny  repeal measure that would throw the issue into negotiations with the house of representatives  the last ditch effort came after senators voted   against a straight repeal of obamacare  which would have provided for a two year delay in implementation to give congress time to work out a replacement  seven republicans opposed the measure  it was the senate s second failure in  hours to repeal the  affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  which expanded health insurance to about  million people  many of them low income  on tuesday  senators rejected the repeal and replace plan republicans had worked on since may  the failures underscored the party s deep divisions on the role of government in helping provide access to healthcare as the senate conducted its second day of a freewheeling debate that could stretch through the week  republicans said they were still working out what would be in a skinny repeal  which could simply eliminate mandates requiring individuals and employers to obtain or provide health insurance  and abolish a tax on medical device manufacturers  senator john thune  the no   senate republican  said the party was trying to  figure out what the traffic will bear  in terms of getting  of our members to vote for things that will repeal as much of obamacare as possible   republicans hold a   majority in the senate  any senate legislation would be enough to kick the issue to a special negotiating committee with the house  which passed its own version in may  if that panel can agree on a new bill  the full house and senate  both controlled by republicans  would again have to approve the legislation   a process that could last months   i think people would look at it not necessarily based on its content  but as a forcing mechanism to cause the two sides of the building to try to solve it together   republican senator bob corker said   that s going to be the last chance   senator john cornyn  the no   senate republican  told reporters there was growing support for a slimmed down approach that would kick the can to negotiators   i think there is plenty of agreement   he said  president donald trump has come down hard on his fellow republicans for failing to act on obamacare  something he promised repeatedly to repeal and replace in his election campaign last year  some senate republicans were growing uncomfortable with the chaotic debate   we ve got to have a more organized process   republican senator ron johnson said  noting the skinny repeal would simply delay acting on the core issue   we just don t have the courage and really the intestinal fortitude to suck it up and     do this right   late on wednesday  only  senators voted for a largely symbolic amendment stating lawmakers  commitment to preserve a part of obamacare that helped states expand the government s medicaid insurance program for the poor to cover a wider net of people   democrats refused to approve any amendment to a bill they dislike and the vote primarily highlighted deep divisions among republicans  the amendment was introduced by senator dean heller  who faces a tough re election fight in nevada next year  and supported by senators susan collins  john mccain and other party moderates who have expressed skepticism about the repeal and replace process  trump attacked one of those senators  lisa murkowski of alaska  by name in an early morning tweet on wednesday  murkowski  one of two party members who voted on tuesday against opening debate on a bill to end obamacare  told msnbc she was not worried about the political fallout   every day shouldn t be about winning elections  how about just doing a little bit of governing around here   she said  healthcare industry organizations are similarly troubled and have urged a more bipartisan effort  the blue cross blue shield association  which represents health insurers across the country  said that if the individual mandate is repealed  it must be replaced with incentives for people to buy health insurance and keep it year round  the mandate is considered critical to helping hold down the cost of premiums  because it means that healthy people as well as the sick  who incur high medical costs  buy insurance  the group also said the government needed to fund subsidies for medical expenses and provide funds to cover high cost patients  anthem inc  antm n   a health insurer with more than  million customers in obamacare individual insurance plans  threatened to further shrink its  market participation because of uncertainty about the government paying for the subsidies that make the plans affordable for millions of americans
