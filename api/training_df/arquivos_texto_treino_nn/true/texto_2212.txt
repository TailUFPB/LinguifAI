moscow  reuters    russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on friday the risks of a military conflict over north korea s nuclear program are very high  and moscow is deeply worried by the mutual threats being traded by washington and pyongyang   unfortunately  the rhetoric in washington and pyongyang is now starting to go over the top   lavrov said   we still hope and believe that common sense will prevail   asked at a forum for russian students about the risks of the stand off escalating into armed conflict  he said   the risks are very high  especially taking into account the rhetoric    direct threats of using force are heard    the talk  in washington  is that there must be a preventive strike made on north korea  while pyongyang is threatening to carry out a missile strike on the u s  base in guam  these  threats  continue non stop  and they worry us a lot    i won t get into guessing what happens  if   we will do whatever we can to prevent this  if     my personal opinion is that when you get close to the point of a fight breaking out  the side that is stronger and cleverer should take the first step away from the threshold of danger   said lavrov  in remarks broadcast on state television  he encouraged pyongyang and washington to sign up to a joint russian chinese plan  under which north korea would freeze its missile tests and the united states and south korea would impose a moratorium on large scale military exercises   if this double freezing finally takes place  then we can sit down and start from the very beginning   to sign a paper which will stress respect for the sovereignty of all those parties involved  including north korea   lavrov said
