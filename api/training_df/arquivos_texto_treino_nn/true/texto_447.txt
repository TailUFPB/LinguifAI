right anti islam videos    as british politicians lined up to condemn trump for sharing videos originally posted by a leader of a british far right fringe group  trump  in an unprecedented attack on one of america s closest allies  replied with an unrepentant message   theresa  theresamay  don t focus on me  focus on the destructive radical islamic terrorism that is taking place within the united kingdom  we are doing just fine   he tweeted  his truculent response caused anger in britain  where there have been several major islamist militant attacks this year  with one minister describing trump s tweets as  alarming and despairing   london s muslim mayor called for the withdrawal of an offer to him to make a state visit to britain   may  on a visit to jordan  repeated her view  expressed earlier by her spokesman  that the u s  leader was wrong for sharing anti muslim videos posted by jayda fransen  deputy leader of britain first  but she did not directly respond to trump s rebuke    i m very clear that retweeting from britain first was the wrong thing to do   may told reporters in jordan  she said the group was a  hateful organization  that sought to spread division and mistrust   the fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the united states has got it wrong  and be very clear with them   may said  she added that britain had a long term  enduring relationship with the united states  the british ambassador to the united states  kim darroch  said he had raised concerns with white house officials   british people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right  which seek to divide communities   erode decency  tolerance   respect   he wrote on twitter  fransen  who was convicted this month of abusing a muslim woman and whose group wants to ban islam  is facing further criminal charges of racially aggravated harassment  trump and may once hand in hand islamist militants have carried out several major attacks in britain this year that have killed a total of  people  including a bombing in manchester and two attacks on bridges in london in which victims were rammed with vehicles and stabbed  trump initially addressed his rebuke to a twitter handle that was not may s  though he later retweeted to the british leader s correct account  always a pillar of britain s foreign policy  the so called  special relationship  with washington has taken on added importance as britain prepares to leave the european union in  and seeks new major trade deals   since trump became president  may has gone out of her way to cultivate a good relationship with him  she was the first foreign leader to visit him after his inauguration in january  and they were filmed emerging from the white house holding hands  she later said trump took her hand in a gentlemanly gesture as they walked down a ramp   but she angered his many critics in britain then by extending an invitation to make a state visit to britain with all the pomp and pageantry it brings including a formal banquet with queen elizabeth  london s mayor  sadiq khan  said may should withdraw the offer of a state visit   after this latest incident  it is increasingly clear that any official visit at all from president trump to britain would not be welcomed   khan  who has clashed on twitter with trump  said  british lawmakers held an urgent session to discuss trump s tweets  with parliamentarians from across the political divide united in condemnation   by sharing it  the videos   he is either a racist  incompetent or unthinking  or all three   opposition labour lawmaker stephen doughty said  britain s middle east minister alistair burt tweeted   the white house tweets are both alarming and despairing tonight  this is so not where the world needs to go   despite repeated calls from opposition lawmakers to cancel the state visit  home secretary  interior  minister  amber rudd said the invitation still stood although a timing had not been agreed   outside parliament  there was more harsh criticism from the likes of brendan cox  the husband of lawmaker jo cox who was murdered in  by a far right extremist and justin welby  the spiritual head of the anglican church    the u s  ambassador to london woody johnson wrote on twitter he had relayed concerns to washington   the u s    uk have a long history of speaking frankly with each other  as all close friends do   he said  the videos shared by trump purported to show a group of people who were muslims beating a teenage boy to death  battering a boy on crutches and destroying a christian statue  reuters was unable to verify the videos  the dutch embassy in washington issued a twitter comment on one of them  which fransen had described as showing a  muslim migrant  beating up a boy     realdonald trump facts do matter  the perpetrator of the violent act in this video was born and raised in the netherlands   the embassy said   he received and completed his sentence under dutch law   britain first  a little known party on the periphery of uk politics  welcomed trump s retweeting of the videos to his  million followers  regarding it as an endorsement of their message    i m delighted   said fransen  whose own twitter following increase by  percent in the wake of the furor to    she told reuters trump s retweets showed the president shared her aim of raising awareness of  issues such as islam   the white house defended the retweets by the republican president  who during the  u s  election campaign called for  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   saying that he was raising security issues  it repeatedly refused to be drawn into the content of the videos or whether trump was aware of the source of the tweets   it s about ensuring that individuals who come into the united states don t pose a public safety or terrorism threat   white house spokesman raj shah told reporters
