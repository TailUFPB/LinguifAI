washington  reuters    after u s  president donald trump fired fbi director james comey on tuesday  democratic members of congress denounced the move and renewed calls for an independent investigation of alleged russian meddling in the  u s  presidential campaign  democrats likened the dismissal to president richard nixon s firing of an independent special prosecutor during the watergate investigation and discounted trump s contention that the move was related to the federal bureau of investigation probe of the emails of hillary clinton  trump s rival for the presidency  some republicans defended the firing  saying new leadership was needed at the law enforcement agency  here are reactions from democrats and republicans to comey s firing   no one should accept president trump s absurd justification that he is now concerned that fbi director comey treated secretary clinton unfairly      this is nothing less than nixonian     democratic senator patrick leahy   today s action by president trump completely obliterates any semblance of an independent investigation into russian efforts to influence our election and places our nation on the verge of a constitutional crisis     democratic representative john conyers   given the recent controversies surrounding the director  i believe a fresh start will serve the fbi and the nation well     republican senator lindsey graham   this is nixonian  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein must immediately appoint a special counsel to continue the trump russia investigation    democratic senator bob casey   i am troubled by the timing and reasoning of director comey s termination     his dismissal  i believe  is a loss for the bureau and the nation     republican senator richard burr  head of the senate committee investigating russia role in the election  the decision     raises profound questions about whether the white house is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter     the same president who has called the investigation into the russian hacking of our democracy and the potential complicity of his campaign a  fake   cannot pretend to have made such a decision uninfluenced by his concerns over comey s continued involvement in the investigation     representative adam schiff  the top democrat on the house committee looking into possible russian connections  any suggestion that today s announcement is somehow an effort to stop the fbi s investigation of russia s attempt to influence the election last fall is misplaced  the president did not fire the entire fbi  he fired the director     republican senator susan collins  earlier this afternoon  president trump called me and informed me he was firing director comey  i told the president   mr  president  with all due respect  you are making a big mistake      given the way the president has fired director comey  any person who he appoints to lead the russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as director comey if they run afoul of the administration     democratic senator chuck schumer in remarks to reporters  there is now a crisis of confidence at the justice department and president trump is not being held accountable because house republicans refuse to work with us to do our job     democratic representative elijah cummings  who called for immediate emergency hearings  many  including myself  have questioned his actions more than once over the past year  i believe new leadership at the fbi will restore confidence in the organization and among the people who do the hard work to carry out its mission     republican senator roy blunt in a statement  the president s actions today are shocking      the only way this administration can begin to demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law     is to cooperate fully with the ongoing congressional investigations and to support the appointment of an independent special counsel     democratic senator mark warner   this fbi director has sought for years to jail me on account of my political activities  if i can oppose his firing  so can you     fugitive former national security agency contractor edward snowden  who leaked intelligence documents and is now living in russia  on twitter  over the course of the last several months  director comey s decisions on controversial matters have prompted concern from across the political spectrum and from career law enforcement experts     republican senator charles grassley   there can be no question that a fully independent special counsel must be appointed to lead this  russia  investigation  at this point  no one in trump s chain of command can be trusted to carry out an impartial investigation     democratic senator ron wyden on twitter  i find it deeply troubling that this decision comes a day after damning testimony by former acting attorney general sally yates on russia s ties to the trump campaign and just days before comey was scheduled to appear before the senate intelligence committee     independent senator bernie sanders   it is essential that ongoing investigations are fulsome and free of political interference until their completion  and it is imperative that president trump nominate a well respected and qualified individual to lead the bureau at this critical time     republican senator bob corker   james comey is a man of honor and integrity     i have long called for a special congressional committee to investigate russia s interference in the  election  the president s decision to remove the fbi director only confirms the need and the urgency of such a committee      republican senator john mccain   the need for a special prosecutor is now crystal clear  president trump has catastrophically compromised the fbi s ongoing investigation of his own white house s ties to russia  not since watergate have our legal systems been so threatened     democratic senator richard blumenthal   mr  comey did not seem to understand some of the laws he was asked to investigate and unfortunately politicized his sensitive position as the fbi director     conservative watchdog group judicial watch  fun fact  president nixon never fired the director of the fbi  fbidirector  notnixonian    official twitter account of the richard nixon presidential library and museum
