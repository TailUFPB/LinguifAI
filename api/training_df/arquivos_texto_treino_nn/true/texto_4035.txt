new york san francisco  reuters    even if president donald trump wins an appeal of a court ruling blocking his executive order on sanctuary cities  arguments made by the government in the case could permanently harm its  efforts to cut off wide swaths of federal funding to targeted cities  some legal experts say  trump s original order  issued on jan    stated that cities and counties shielding illegal immigrants and refusing to cooperate with immigration officials would lose federal funding except for that  deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes    u s  justice department attorneys defending the order in a san francisco court presented a far narrower view of its reach  however  arguing before u s  district judge william orrick iii earlier this month that the only funds the government intended to withhold were certain grants tied to law enforcement programs    commentary  why trump should mend ties with russia reut rs    commentary  russia investigation teeters  but trump s strategy of stonewalling does not reut rs      that argument did not convince the judge on tuesday  who noted in issuing a preliminary injunction that the text of the executive order threatened withdrawal of a much wider range of federal funds than the government attorneys asserted in court        disavowing the plain language of the executive order itself  was a potentially dangerous course for the justice department  said edward waters  a washington lawyer who specializes in federal grants   the government s strategy could restrict its ability to cut off funds going forward  some legal experts said  since the justice department now has said the order applies to a narrow range of funding   trump has promised to broadly  defund  sanctuary cities  saying they  breed crime   the government could appeal the preliminary injunction to the  circuit court of appeals and the losing side at the appellate level could then appeal to the supreme court  one procedural case the federal government could make on appeal involves the timing of the challenge  some legal scholars suggested  but such an argument would have limitations  since no federal funds actually have been withheld to date  the government could say there has been no harm and therefore the case is not yet  ripe  for litigation  said brian galle  an expert on government finance at georgetown law  to have standing to bring a case  san francisco and santa clara county would have to have suffered actual harm  which could be difficult to establish in this case since they have so far lost no federal funding       the two municipalities successfully argued in the district court hearing that they had already been harmed by uncertainty and chaos in their budget planning but that might not convince an appellate court       in the very short run it s quite possible that the administration could win a reversal of this ruling  on appeal because of these procedural reasons  galle said  he predicted  however  the administration would be unable to successfully defend itself if it then began withholding funds without congress authorizing such action   the justice department declined to discuss its appeals strategy      tuesday s ruling left leeway for the administration to deny some kinds of funding to sanctuary cities  noting the government can  use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants   a small amount of federal law enforcement money is tied to a statute requiring local jurisdictions to share information with federal immigration officials      programs making such grants include the edward byrne memorial justice assistance grant program  community oriented policing services  and the state criminal alien assistance program  in san francisco  such funding is a small fraction of federal monies that go to the city  said city attorney dennis herrera  tuesday s ruling was the latest legal blow to the trump administration  which has had two previous executive orders stayed by the courts  in february  a washington court blocked a trump order temporarily banning all refugees and travelers from seven mostly muslim nations  a subsequent order replaced that one  removing iraq from the ban and creating more exemptions  parts of that ban were also blocked  this time by judges in maryland and hawaii  those cases are pending appeal  after tuesday s district court ruling  a spokesman for the department of justice said that it  will follow the law with respect to regulation of sanctuary jurisdictions    but the president made clear on twitter wednesday that he doesn t consider the battle over   see you in the supreme court   he tweeted
