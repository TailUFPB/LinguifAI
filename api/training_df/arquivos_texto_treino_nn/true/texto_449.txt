washington  reuters    a quest by republicans to open alaska s arctic national wildlife reserve was slowed after a nonpartisan senate official ruled late on wednesday that the exploration was subject to environmental assessments by the interior department  senator lisa murkowski  a republican from alaska and the head of the senate energy panel  has been pushing a measure in the u s  tax bill that would open a portion of the refuge on the coastal plain to two lease sales in  years for drilling  but the nonpartisan senate official took issue with the energy committee measure as it did not fully consider requirements under a national environmental law  the official ruled that oil exploration in the refuge is not exempt to an environmental law requiring the interior department to commission an assessment  a democratic aide said  such environmental assessments can take months or years to complete     this is good news for us because it could slow down or prevent drilling   the democratic aide said    republicans offered new language to the bill after the move and said that the drilling would still advance if the tax bill passes    there was a little hiccup  but they fixed it in the amendment they just filed tonight  so full steam ahead   a republican senate aide said     murkowski said she was not concerned about procedural questions and that the issues would be fully resolved    the arctic reserve  protected by the federal government since   is home to wildlife populations including caribou  polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the seven continents  the u s  geological survey estimates the area republicans want to drill in has up to  billion barrels of recoverable crude
