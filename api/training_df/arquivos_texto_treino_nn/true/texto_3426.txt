st petersburg  russia  reuters    president vladimir putin said on friday that donald trump had run a better presidential campaign than hillary clinton and that u s  intelligence agencies could have easily faked what he said was false evidence that russia had hacked the democratic party  u s  intelligence officials have said russia tried to interfere in the u s  election by hacking trump s opponents  a charge that has deepened a political scandal which has focused on whether trump had improper ties with moscow  something he flatly denies   putin  addressing the st petersburg international economic forum  said on friday that the hacking accusations were nothing more than  harmful gossip  which he complained was damaging international relations and the global economy   he said he had personally reviewed the u s  intelligence reports which made the hacking allegations against russia  and that they contained no meaningful evidence   i have read these reports   said putin   even in these reports there is nothing specific but only assumptions and conclusions based on assumptions   the idea that the hacking had reportedly been carried out from russian ip addresses which constituted meaningful evidence of anything was absurd  he said    where are the finger prints  ip addresses can be faked  do you know how many specialists there are who can make it look as if your children sent something from your home ip address  they can fake anything and then accuse anyone  it s not evidence   putin  who is keen to repair battered u s  russia relations and is expected to meet trump for the first time at the  in hamburg in july  said trump had simply run a better campaign and better connected with voters than clinton  he said her supporters were now trying to blame russia for their failure   but the problem is not with us  the problem is inside american politics   said putin   the other  clinton  team miscalculated  they don t want to admit their mistake  it s easier for them to say that they are not guilty  that the russians are the guilty ones for interfering in our election  it reminds me of anti semitism   visibly irritated by having to discuss the matter  putin was equally forthright about denying separate accusations that there had been some kind of secret deal between moscow and the trump team before his inauguration   there was nothing concrete  zero  it s just hysteria  should i give you a pill   putin said to a moderator who asked him about the matter
