washington  reuters    republican lawmakers must deliver tax legislation to president donald trump s desk before december or lose their chance to enact bold reforms capable of driving the u s  economy  a leading republican conservative said on wednesday  representative mark meadows  chairman of the house freedom caucus  told conservative activists that the prospects for significant tax reform would diminish as lawmakers approach the start of the  congressional election campaign in january   he said lawmakers needed to introduce tax legislation in september  pass the measure through the house of representatives and senate and send it to trump s desk by the nov   u s  thanksgiving holiday   if it doesn t get there by thanksgiving  guys  it isn t going to happen   meadows said   the white house has said it expects the house to vote on a tax bill in october and the senate in november  trump s fellow republicans control both chambers  analysts say the schedule could be too optimistic  because congress is due to spend much of september and possibly october on spending bills to keep the government open and a debt ceiling increase to avoid default on sovereign u s  debt  lawmakers could be more likely to approve tax legislation in early   the analysts say  but meadows rejected that possibility   the minute we go past january  everybody starts saying   we can t do anything too bold    he said   republicans plan to move tax legislation forward through a procedure known as reconciliation  which would allow the senate to pass a bill with a simple majority  republicans control the chamber by a   margin and would otherwise need  votes  the failure of senate republicans to find a simple majority for healthcare legislation last week has led to calls for bipartisan tax reform    white house budget director mick mulvaney shot down that idea earlier on wednesday    a tax bill looks a lot weaker  a lot less likely to get us to  percent economic growth  if we ve got eight       democrats on it   he told fox news  senate republican leader mitch mcconnell rejected a democratic overture for broad bipartisanship on tuesday  on wednesday  he still hoped some democrats would back republican tax legislation   there is a great deal of bipartisan consensus about what ails our tax code  and my hope is that our friends on the other side of the aisle will join with us in a serious way   mcconnell said on the senate floor
