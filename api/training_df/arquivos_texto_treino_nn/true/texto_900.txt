washington  reuters    republicans in the u s  house of representatives were expected on thursday to release a tax bill offering plenty of flexibility  as they grapple with stubborn internal disagreements on paying for the tax cuts they propose  after an embarrassing one day postponement of the bill s unveiling on wednesday  lawmakers have made plans for a measure that will seek up to   trillion in tax cuts over  years but likely not spell out completely how to offset them  asked if the bill would contain a permanent corporate tax rate cut to  percent from  percent  u s  house of representatives tax panel chairman kevin brady told reporters   that s our goal and i think it s going to take several steps     to achieve that   lobbyists said republicans were having trouble reaching consensus on where to find revenue to pay for tax cuts and would likely have to make the corporate cut temporary as a result   after a white house meeting with advisers  president donald trump told reporters   sometime tomorrow  we ll be announcing massive tax cuts and reform   house republican leaders and tax panel members were slated to meet with trump in the white house on thursday afternoon  from mortgage interest and  k  retirement plans to the federal deficit and state and local taxes  numerous unanswered questions swirled around the tax cut plan as lawmakers met into the evening on capitol hill  representative tom macarthur  asked if fellow republicans could meet their ambitious deadline of approving a tax bill by the nov   thanksgiving holiday  told reporters   i ve been called a lot of things but  prophet  is not one of them   since taking over congress and the white house in january  the republicans and trump have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment  that will change  they say  when they overhaul the tax code for the first time in  years  but they are fast discovering why every attempt to do that has failed since former republican president ronald reagan s historic tax reform in   unlike the nearly three year reagan effort involving public hearings and bipartisan cooperation  the trump tax plan was developed in secret over a few months by six senior lawmakers and white house advisers who took little input from rank and file republicans and largely ignored the democrats  house democratic leader nancy pelosi said in a statement that the  chaotic delay  of the tax bill s release showed republicans were  pushing a half baked tax bill with ruinous consequences for workers and middle class americans   macarthur said the plan s biggest challenge was a proposed elimination of a deduction for state and local tax  salt  payments  which is among several revenue raising changes meant to offset proposed tax cuts  other lawmakers and lobbyists cited different concerns with the bill   republicans from high tax states where upper middle class voters would be hardest hit by the salt deduction repeal were unsure if the bill on thursday would address their concerns  representative lee zeldin from new york said he wanted  major changes  to preserve state and local tax deductibility   i was encouraged when i heard chairman brady refer to the draft that s about to get released as not being the final text   said zeldin  macarthur  from new jersey  said a compromise proposal being worked on to maintain and cap the deductibility of property tax payments was a good start but the cap would need to be raised to earn his support  trump  largely playing cheerleader in the debate  tweeted advice on paying for the cuts   wouldn t it be great to repeal the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate in obamacare and use those savings for further tax cuts   he said in a twitter post  afterward  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters that the administration still wanted to repeal and replace obamacare  but  we still think it s probably more likely to do something like that in the spring   an attempt to dismantle former democratic president barack obama s affordable care act  popularly known as obamacare  failed dramatically in the republican controlled senate in july   k  in play another contentious revenue raising proposal in the plan is to limit how much money americans can put into their  k  retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts  iras  on a pre tax basis  there was also a proposal to limit the deductibility of interest payments by businesses  restrictions are opposed by businesses with little access to equity financing  including farmers  ranchers and small businesses  a rough framework of the tax plan was unveiled in late september  but its basic components were changing  it originally called for reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven  with the current top tax rate of   percent reduced to  percent  a win for high income taxpayers  partly in response to democrats who dismissed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy  lawmakers are expected to restore a fourth   percent tax bracket but increase the income level where it applies  perhaps to   million  more than double the current level  questions remained about the original framework s proposal to repeal the estate tax on inheritances  another policy change that would favor wealthy americans  discussion was ongoing about possibly phasing it out     lawmakers also have not resolved a challenge posed by trump s plan to lower the tax rate on pass through enterprises  such as partnerships and sole proprietorships  to  percent from as high as   percent  they said
