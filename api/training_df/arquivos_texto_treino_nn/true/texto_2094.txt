washington bridgewater  n j   reuters    president donald trump s ouster of chief strategist steve bannon is unlikely to mark the abandonment of the administration s  america first  agenda that has unnerved investors and trade partners and split the white house into nationalist and globalist camps  within hours of leaving trump s administration on friday  bannon was back at the helm of breitbart news  the hard right news site he ran before becoming the main architect of trump s  presidential campaign  bannon can now do more to further conservative causes because  he can speak his mind  without the constraints of working in the white house  rick weatherly    a maintenance technician from the denver suburb of lakewood  said on saturday  trump appeared to agree  tweeting   steve bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at  breitbartnews     maybe even better than ever before  fake news needs the competition   bannon    was instrumental in some of trump s most contentious policies including the travel ban on people from several muslim majority nations  departure from the paris climate accord and rejection of the trans pacific partnership trade deal  he was no friend to the republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals  but became a darling of some of the president s hard line conservative supporters    trump will now have a great external ally   a source close to bannon said on condition of anonymity   he will use his big hammer against the congressional leadership in support of the president s agenda   trump supporters in south florida  chicago and colorado told reuters that they were not concerned that bannon s departure meant the president was distancing himself from policies he supported during last year s campaign   i think trump will be fine   said bob janda  a  year old small business owner in chicago              nor is bannon likely to be distanced from trump s ear  a white house official said on condition of anonymity  bannon joined a string of senior officials who have left the trump administration in the past five weeks  leading to the appointment of retired marine general john kelly as the new white house chief of staff  kelly has succeeded in imposing some order on what had been a haphazard operation  but bannon will still have  a direct pipeline into the oval office with breitbart  twitter and the tv   the same white house official added       my guess is he ll  bannon  probably be more effective goading the president from outside  especially if the president feels boxed in by john kelly s clean lines of authority and  national security adviser h r   mcmaster s orderly processes   said kori schake  a research fellow at stanford university s hoover institution who previously served in the white house   seems to me that bannon was symptom not cause  the president seems to share his dark vision  revel in the support of people bannon represents   schake added  prior to joining the trump campaign  bannon had spearheaded breitbart s shift into a forum for the  alt right   a loose online confederation of neo nazis  white supremacists and anti semites  his departure capped a tumultuous week in which trump was widely criticized for saying both sides were responsible for last weekend s violence at a charlottesville  virginia rally organized by neo nazis and white supremacists  bannon told the conservative weekly standard on friday that he would use breitbart to attack opponents of the populist and nationalist agenda he championed  including establishment republicans   at the same time he appeared to suggest that his departure signaled a major shift for the trump agenda   the trump presidency that we fought for  and won  is over   bannon said  defense policy is one area where bannon could play a role from the outside    while many of trump s national security aides favor sending several thousand more troops to afghanistan  where the taliban insurgents have been regaining ground  bannon argued for withdrawing the   u s  personnel still there  he also had advocated restraint in dealing with north korea  rejecting the use of military force to solve the recent crisis   there is a danger that if he continues to bang away on issues that appeal to breitbart s audience but aren t going anywhere  bannon risks splitting the administration s loose coalition of hard right ideologues  traditional conservatives  and middle of the road voters who didn t like hillary clinton   another trump administration official said  also on condition of anonymity
