assets and only indicated they were worth more than   million  cohn had income ranging from   million to nearly   million in the year preceding his engagement in the white house  though it could be much higher  jared kushner s  page report   which included most of the assets and income of his wife ivanka trump   included scores of assets worth six  and seven figures  the new york times reported that the couple s real estate and investment empire was worth as much as   million  kushner held executive positions with  llcs  corporations  groups and non profits  which he has resigned from since
