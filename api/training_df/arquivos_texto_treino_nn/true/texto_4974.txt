  in march  item  corrects paragraph  to show uninsured rising  by david lawder washington  reuters    fourteen million americans would lose medical insurance by next year under a republican plan to dismantle obamacare that would also reduce the budget deficit  a nonpartisan congressional research office said on monday  throwing president donald trump and republicans on the defensive as they press forward with replacement legislation  the u s  congressional budget office forecast that  million more people would be uninsured in  if the plan being considered by the house of representatives to replace the  affordable care act were adopted  obamacare  as president barack obama s signature piece of domestic policy is commonly called  expanded insurance to about  million americans   bit ly   hours after the cbo report was released  the house budget committee postponed its consideration of the republican bill to thursday from wednesday  prior to the report  republicans had been planning to vote soon on the bill in the house  where it is likely to pass  and send it to the senate  where its outlook is uncertain   the cbo projected that  million people would be uninsured by  if the bill became law  compared with  million who would not have coverage that year if the law remained unchanged  two house of representatives committees have approved the legislation to dismantle obamacare that was unveiled by republican leaders a week ago  but it faces opposition from not only democrats but also medical providers including doctors and hospitals and many conservatives  the cbo report s findings could make the republican plan a harder sell for lawmakers  particularly in the u s  senate  the cbo  however  said federal deficits would fall by   billion between  and  under the republican bill  some health policy experts and wall street analysts said the report was more draconian than expected  with the uninsured rate rising more quickly than foreseen  doctors groups and patient advocates said the bill must be abandoned  the aarp  a nonprofit advocacy group for aging americans  said monday that the cbo analysis showed the financial burden of the republican plan would fall  disproportionately  on americans  to  years old  in a five page letter to house members last week  the aarp has also criticized a tax cut it said would threaten the solvency of medicare  the government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled  cuts to medicaid and said the bill does nothing to lower drug costs  some republicans worry a misfire on the republican healthcare legislation could hobble trump s presidency and set the stage for losses for the party in the  congressional elections   the trump administration defended the healthcare plan  which they say will have a second and third phase that will entice consumers  health and human services secretary tom price said at the white house that trump s plan would cover more individuals at a lower cost and it was  virtually impossible  to envision that  million people would lose insurance coverage by next year  democratic leaders in congress said the bill could result in elderly people being kicked out of nursing homes as it simultaneously gives tax cuts for the richest americans   how can they look their constituents in the eye when they say  million of you no longer have coverage and those of you who do have it  will have less coverage at more cost to you   house democratic leader nancy pelosi said  trump himself made no comment on the report  the affordable care act aimed to help restrain u s  healthcare spending  which is about  percent of the nation s economy  but it has continued to grow faster than inflation   the proposal would end the obamacare expansion of the medicaid insurance program for the poor and would replace obamacare s income based subsidies with fixed tax credits for the purchase of private insurance  the nonpartisan tax policy center on monday said the republican plan would benefit the wealthiest u s  households far more than middle income families  a family making    to    a year  including fringe benefits like employer provided health insurance  would get a tax cut averaging    the top   percent of earners with incomes of at least    million would get a tax cut of about     the study said  the cbo estimated that insurance premiums would rise  percent to  percent in both  and  because fewer healthy people would sign up after the repeal of the obamacare penalty for declining to obtain insurance  but it said the hikes would be offset after  by a   billion fund allocated to states in the bill and deregulation in the insurance market   by   average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly  percent lower than the estimates under current law  in part because insurers will be able to offer plans that cover a lower share of healthcare costs  while the federal government would lose revenues through the repeal of obamacare s individual and employer mandates  tax penalties  cbo said the loss would be surpassed by savings on insurance subsidies and medicaid payments that washington would no longer have to provide for people who lost coverage   at the same time  cbo said the repeal of the individual mandate s tax penalties would mean higher health insurance premiums for those who retained coverage  because insurers would still have to cover any applicant without being free to raise premiums for older  sicker people  despite lower numbers of younger  healthier customers who are cheaper to insure  craig garthwaite  director of the healthcare program at northwestern university s kellogg school of management  said the cbo estimates made it harder for republicans to sell their proposal    overall  this is a really bad number for the ahca  far more people are predicted to lose coverage than many estimated   and these losses are going to happen more quickly than we would have thought   he said  house of representatives speaker paul ryan  a key backer of the plan called the american health care act  said the cbo estimates showed it would ultimately lower premiums    our plan is not about forcing people to buy expensive  one size fits all coverage  it is about giving people more choices and better access to a plan they want and can afford  when people have more choices  costs go down   ryan said  vishnu lekraj  an equity analyst at morningstar  said the bill is a net negative for insurers  who would be helped by the elimination of a tax  but hurt by the shrinking individual insurance business   the headline number will be viewed as a shock to the system tomorrow   brian tanquilut  a stock analyst at jefferies said of the  million losing insurance next year   the reality of this is that the number being big makes it harder for the bill to pass in its current form
