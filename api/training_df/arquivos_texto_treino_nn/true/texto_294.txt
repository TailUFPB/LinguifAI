birmingham  ala   reuters    name calling is not unusual in u s  politics  but  child abuser  is not usually one of the names  in the final stretch of a bruising u s  senate race in alabama  democrat doug jones has cranked up his attacks on republican roy moore over allegations of sexual misconduct and made those charges central to his argument that moore is an unsuitable choice  jones  who avoided directly addressing the sexual allegations when they surfaced in early november  has begun to cite them to attack moore s character  on tuesday  one week before the dec   special election and a day after republican president donald trump endorsed moore  jones said women who allege that moore assaulted or pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his  deserved to be believed   i believe these women and so should you  this is about rising above political party to do what s right for alabama  and for the country   jones told voters during a speech in birmingham  moore  a  year old christian conservative  has denied the misconduct allegations and said they were a result of  dirty politics   he said last week he had never met any of the women involved  reuters has not independently verified any of the accusations  moore  who was twice removed from the state supreme court  for refusing to abide by federal law  was a  source of embarrassment  for the people of alabama  jones said  the raw tone has become typical of a race transformed by the moore allegations  opening the door for a possible democratic upset in the conservative southern state that would deal a blow to trump s agenda and dramatically improve democratic chances of regaining senate control in next year s congressional elections  jones has cranked up his attacks as the initial wave of voter outrage over the allegations has shown signs of fading  enabling moore to regain a slight lead in several recent opinion polls in a state that went for trump by  percentage points last year  alabama has not elected a democrat to the senate since   jones  who holds a fundraising advantage on moore and has accumulated four times as much cash on hand for the stretch drive  has launched an advertising blitz focusing on the misconduct allegations   they were girls when roy moore immorally pursued them  now they are women   the narrator says in one ad as pictures of the accusers flash by   will we make their abuser a u s  senator   on the campaign trail  jones  a former u s  attorney who prosecuted the ku klux klan members convicted of a  church bombing in birmingham that killed four young girls  has cited his own background to draw a contrast with moore   i damn sure believe and have done my part to ensure that men who hurt little girls should go to jail   not the u s  senate   jones said in birmingham  moore s rebound in the polls highlights the challenge for jones as he tries to boost turnout among the state s african american voters while peeling away support from moderate republicans alienated by moore in a state where many voters are resistant to the democratic label   he is the republican candidate and i am a republican  i stand in support of what he supports   jenny mann    said of moore  mann  a self described stay at home mom in ider  alabama  said the allegations against moore  would concern anybody  but i also believe you are innocent until proven guilty   jones  making his first run for public office  has cast himself as a problem solver who would work across the aisle to help alabamans on  kitchen table  issues like healthcare and jobs  while moore has portrayed him as a liberal democrat straight out of washington  jones supports abortion rights and opposes repealing former president barack obama s healthcare law  unpopular stances in alabama  but he said he never considered moderating his views to improve his chances   the key to any campaign and any public official is being true to what you believe  and that s what we re putting out there   jones said in an interview last month  trump s endorsement freed the republican national committee to open its wallet for moore  who had been cut off by the national party when the misconduct allegations became public  not every republican is falling in line  senator jeff flake of arizona  who has frequently tangled with trump  tweeted a photo of his   donation to jones   country over party   flake captioned it  some of alabama s black leaders worry about the risk of lackluster turnout among african americans  who make up about a quarter of the state electorate and vote strongly democratic   there is not a high level of energy in the black community about this race   said democratic state senator hank sanders  sanders might have been talking about freddy haley    a black retired military veteran from fayette who said he was a democrat but had not kept up with politics   with the holidays and everything  i haven t had time to check it out   haley said while christmas shopping in a birmingham suburb with his family   when is the election
