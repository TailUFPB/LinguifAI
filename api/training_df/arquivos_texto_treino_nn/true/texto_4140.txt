washington  reuters    a russian government think tank controlled by vladimir putin developed a plan to swing the  u s  presidential election to donald trump and undermine voters  faith in the american electoral system  three current and four former u s  officials told reuters  they described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what u s  intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by russia to interfere with the nov   election  u s  intelligence officials acquired the documents  which were prepared by the moscow based russian institute for strategic studies   after the election  the institute is run by retired senior russian foreign intelligence officials appointed by putin s office   the first russian institute document was a strategy paper written last june that circulated at the highest levels of the russian government but was not addressed to any specific individuals  it recommended the kremlin launch a propaganda campaign on social media and russian state backed global news outlets to encourage u s  voters to elect a president who would take a softer line toward russia than the administration of then president barack obama  the seven officials said   a second institute document  drafted in october and distributed in the same way  warned that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was likely to win the election  for that reason  it argued  it was better for russia to end its pro trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the u s  electoral system s legitimacy and damage clinton s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency  the seven officials said  the current and former u s  officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the russian documents  classified status  they declined to discuss how the united states obtained them  u s  intelligence agencies also declined to comment on them  putin has denied interfering in the u s  election  putin s spokesman and the russian institute did not respond to requests for comment   the documents were central to the obama administration s conclusion that russia mounted a  fake news  campaign and launched cyber attacks against democratic party groups and clinton s campaign  the current and former officials said   putin had the objective in mind all along  and he asked the institute to draw him a road map   said one of the sources  a former senior u s  intelligence official   trump has said russia s activities had no impact on the outcome of the race  ongoing congressional and fbi investigations into russian interference have so far produced no public evidence that trump associates colluded with the russian effort to change the outcome of the election  four of the officials said the approach outlined in the june strategy paper was a broadening of an effort the putin administration launched in march   that month the kremlin instructed state backed media outlets  including international platforms russia today and sputnik news agency  to start producing positive reports on trump s quest for the u s  presidency  the officials said   russia today did not respond to a request for comment  a spokesperson for sputnik dismissed the assertions by the u s  officials that it participated in a kremlin campaign as an  absolute pack of lies    and by the way  it s not the first pack of lies we re hearing from  sources in u s  official circles    the spokesperson said in an email  pro kremlin bloggers russia today and sputnik published anti clinton stories while pro kremlin bloggers prepared a twitter campaign calling into question the fairness of an anticipated clinton victory  according to a report by u s  intelligence agencies on russian interference in the election made public in january   russia today s most popular clinton video    how   of the  clintons   charity  went to     themselves    accumulated  millions views on social media  according to the january report   the report said russia today and sputnik  consistently cast president elect trump as the target of unfair coverage from traditional media outlets    the report said the agencies did not assess whether moscow s effort had swung the outcome of the race in trump s favor  because american intelligence agencies do not  analyze u s  political processes or u s  public opinion    neither of the russian institute documents mentioned the release of hacked democratic party emails to interfere with the u s  election  according to four of the officials  the officials said the hacking was a covert intelligence operation run separately out of the kremlin  the overt propaganda and covert hacking efforts reinforced each other  according to the officials  both russia today and sputnik heavily promoted the release of the hacked democratic party emails  which often contained embarrassing details  five of the u s  officials described the institute as the kremlin s in house foreign policy think tank   the institute s director when the documents were written  leonid reshetnikov  rose to the rank of lieutenant general during a  year career in russia s foreign intelligence service  according to the institute s website   after reshetnikov retired from the institute in january  putin named as his replacement mikhail fradkov  the institute says he served as the director of russia s foreign intelligence service from  to    reuters was unable to determine if either man was directly involved in the drafting of the documents  reshetnikov s office referred questions to the russian institute   on its website  the russian institute describes itself as providing  expert appraisals    recommendations   and  analytical materials  to the russian president s office  cabinet  national security council  ministries and parliament    on jan    the websites of putin s office  and the institute  posted a picture and transcript of reshetnikov and his successor fradkov meeting with putin in the kremlin  putin thanked reshetnikov for his service and told fradkov he wanted the institute to provide objective information and analysis   we did our best for nearly eight years to implement your foreign policy concept   reshetnikov told putin   the policy of russia and the policy of the president of russia have been the cornerstone of our operation
