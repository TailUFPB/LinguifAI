washington  reuters    twenty two million americans would lose insurance over the next decade under the u s  senate republican healthcare bill  a nonpartisan congressional office said on monday  complicating the path forward for the already fraught legislation  after the congressional budget office  cbo  score  senator susan collins  a moderate republican  said she could not support moving forward on the bill as written  collins  opposition highlights the delicate balance that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell must strike as he tries to deliver a legislative win to president donald trump by reconciling the republican party s moderate and conservative wings  moderate senators are concerned about millions of people losing insurance  key conservative senators have said the senate bill does not do enough to repeal obamacare  the cbo assessment that an additional  million people would be uninsured in  under the bill and its prediction that insurance premiums would skyrocket over the first two years prompted concern from both sides   mcconnell s goal was to have a vote on the bill before the july  recess that starts at the end of this week  but several republicans  including collins  have said they would not approve a procedural motion that would clear the way for a vote  mcconnell can afford to lose just two republican senators from their  seat majority in the  seat senate  which would allow passage of the bill with vice president mike pence casting the tie breaking vote     if you are on the fence     this cbo score didn t help you  so i think it s going to be harder to get to   not easier   republican senator lindsey graham said of the bill s prospects  the cbo score is also likely to amplify criticism from industry groups such as the american medical association  which said earlier on monday that the senate s bill violated the doctors  precept of  first  do no harm   the cbo is only able to assess the impact of legislation within a  year window  but it said that insurance losses are expected to grow beyond  million due to deep cuts to the medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled that are not scheduled to go into effect until    trump and republicans in congress made repealing and replacing obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature domestic legislation  a central campaign promise  the pressure is on for them to deliver now that they control the white house  house of representatives and senate  republicans view obamacare as costly government intrusion and say that individual insurance markets are collapsing  obamacare expanded health coverage to some  million americans by expanding medicaid and mandating that individuals obtain health insurance  the cbo score was released just hours after republicans revised the bill  adding a measure that would penalize people who let their insurance coverage lapse for an extended period  the move followed criticism that the original bill would result in a sicker   and more expensive   insurance pool   at least four conservative republicans   senators ted cruz  rand paul  ron johnson and mike lee   have expressed opposition to the senate legislation     moderate republicans have warned against replacing obamacare with legislation that is too similar to the version passed by the house  saying it would cause too many people  especially those with low incomes  to lose health coverage  the cbo estimated that the house bill would cause  million people to lose insurance  trump had called the house bill  mean  and asked senate republicans to come up with  more generous  legislation  democrats uniformly oppose both the house and senate versions of the bill   cbo s report today makes clear that this bill is every bit as  mean as the house bill   senator chuck schumer  the democratic leader  told reporters  the white house in a statement on monday criticized the cbo for issuing a  flawed report  and said its assessments should not be  trusted blindly   trump and mcconnell have been working to shore up support  the president called key conservative senators over the weekend  white house spokesman sean spicer said   both cruz and johnson said they were concerned about cbo estimates that insurance premiums would initially rise as much as  percent over the first two years before declining   doesn t help the people whose premiums skyrocket next year   cruz told reporters   kind of a problem  isn t it   johnson said of the short term premium increase  johnson and paul have said they will oppose the procedural motion that would allow the senate to move forward to a vote  cruz is drafting suggested fixes  paul remains opposed to the bill      the first moderate republican to oppose the bill  senator dean heller  is already facing political fallout  america first policies  a political group run by former trump campaign staffers  said it would air healthcare related attack ads against heller  who faces a competitive re election race in nevada next year  senator rob portman  of ohio  who has not said whether he supports the bill  was  dressed down  by mcconnell during a monday leadership meeting  a senior republican aide told reuters   ohio participates in obamacare s medicaid expansion  and republican governor john kasich has criticized the senate bill  portman s office did not respond to a request to comment  senator marco rubio of florida said his governor  fellow republican rick scott  would be on capitol hill this week to discuss the bill s impact on the state  constituent and industry groups have been critical of the senate bill s proposal to reduce the medicaid healthcare program for the poor and point to the cbo analysis that it would disproportionately affect older adults  under senate rules  the bill must replicate savings projected in the house version that passed last month  it cleared that critical hurdle  with the cbo estimating it would decrease the budget deficit by   billion over    a revision to the bill that imposes a penalty for prolonged lapses in insurance coverage addresses the original bill s provision to drop the obamacare penalty on those who do not have insurance  experts had warned that canceling the fine could lead to a sicker insurance pool because young and healthy people would not face consequences for failing to purchase insurance   the bill would impose a six month waiting period for anyone who lets their health insurance lapse for over  days and then wants to re enroll in a plan in the individual market  the  million people the cbo estimates would be uninsured in  is largely due to the repeal of the penalty associated with being uninsured  the cbo did not evaluate the revised version that included the new waiting period  insurer blue cross and blue shield said it was encouraged by the inclusion of incentives for continuous coverage  molina healthcare said it preferred the obamacare mandate  said that and the senate bill  even after revised  would simply delay care  if the senate passes a bill  it will either have to be approved by the house  the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee  or the house could pass a new version and bounce it back to the senate
