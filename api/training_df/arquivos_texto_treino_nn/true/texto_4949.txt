new york  reuters    u s  environmental group the sierra club has asked the environmental protection agency s inspector general to investigate whether the agency s head  scott pruitt  violated internal policies when he said he did not believe carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change  according to a letter seen by reuters on wednesday  lawyers for the sierra club wrote to the epa s office of inspector general on tuesday asking the independent watchdog to check whether pruitt violated the epa s  scientific integrity policy when he told a cnbc interviewer on march    i would not agree that it s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see   the request ramps up tension between the u s  environmental movement and the administration of president donald trump  who has called global warming a hoax meant to weaken the u s  economy and has packed his cabinet with people who question the science of climate change  an overwhelming majority of scientists think that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change  triggering sea level rise  droughts and more frequent violent storms   it s pretty unprecedented to have the head of the epa contradicting basic scientific facts   sierra club senior attorney elena saxonhouse told reuters on wednesday  in the letter  the sierra club s lawyers said pruitt s comments contradicted a  comprehensive review  of scientific research on climate change and appeared to be politically motivated  the epa website says its policy is meant to maintain  a culture of scientific integrity for all its employees   and requires epa officials and staff to ensure the agency s work respects the findings of the broader scientific community   administrator pruitt s comments are perfectly in keeping with the scientific integrity policy   epa spokesman john konkus said in an email   there is an ongoing scientific debate on climate change  its causes and its effect  that debate should be encouraged as the administrator has done  not discouraged as sierra club is attempting to do    a spokeswoman for the epa s inspector general said in an email the ig s office could neither confirm nor deny investigation requests     as oklahoma s attorney general  pruitt sued the epa more than a dozen times while accepting campaign donations from the energy industry  emails released on feb   by an oklahoma court showed pruitt also used language provided by an energy company in one of his challenges of the epa over methane emissions regulations  sierra club s saxonhouse said the group believed that the epa s scientific integrity policy applied to political appointees as well as career epa staff  but said it was unclear how the agency could enforce it   it shouldn t just be a piece of paper or some words on a website  it s intended to protect the public from bad decision making that s not based on real facts   she said
