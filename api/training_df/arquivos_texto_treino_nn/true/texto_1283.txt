 reuters    president donald trump s plan to make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy stripped down health insurance plans could violate a federal law governing employee benefit plans and will almost certainly be challenged in court  legal experts said  trump signed an executive order on thursday aimed at letting small businesses join nationwide associations for the purpose of buying large group health plans that are not subject to coverage requirements of the affordable care act  commonly known as obamacare  industry experts said trump s order could ultimately enable such associations to purchase insurance from states with the fewest regulations  that would undermine obamacare  former democratic president barack obama s signature healthcare law  which republicans have failed to repeal  several healthcare and employment law experts said if trump s plan moves forward  states could argue the federal government had overstepped its authority in violation of the u s  employee retirement income security act  erisa   a law that governs large group plans  in thursday s order  trump asked the department of labor to propose rules that would allow more employers to participate in association health plans  legal experts said lawsuits might not be brought until such regulations are issued  dania palanker  an assistant research professor at georgetown university s center on health insurance reforms  said erisa granted states the right to regulate association health plans   attorneys general could argue the federal government had overreached if the trump administration winds up allowing associations to buy health coverage across borders that only complies with a single state s regulations    any attempt to allow the sale of association plans to small groups across state lines will be open to legal scrutiny as to whether it is violating erisa and undermining state authority   said palanker  a white house official said that  departments will be drafting rules in a way that minimizes litigation risk   the department of labor  will be reviewing erisa in the course of following the president s direction  in the order  the official said  a number of state attorneys general from democratic leaning states said on thursday they would fight any efforts to weaken obamacare  which extended health insurance to  million americans  but which republicans call intrusive and ineffective   it should come as no surprise that california is prepared to fight in court to protect affordable healthcare for its people   said xavier becerra  the state s democratic attorney general  legal experts said states may argue the associations formed for the purpose of buying insurance are not employers under erisa  although erisa allows associations to qualify as employers and manage large group plans  federal regulators have generally required that members of such associations have a high degree of common interest beyond buying insurance  said allison hoffman  a professor at the university of pennsylvania school of law  trump s order asks the secretary of labor  who enforces erisa  to consider expanding the common interest requirements to permit broader participation in association health plans  short term plans the idea of expanding association health plans across state lines has long been championed by republican u s  senator rand paul  who made it a key plank of his own proposal to repeal and replace obamacare  the kentucky republican was at trump s side when the president signed the executive order  paul s proposal said erisa was too restrictive in its definition of associations and that the law needed to be amended   thursday s order also asked the labor  treasury and health and human services departments to look into expanding participation in cheaper  bare bones  short term limited duration insurance plans  which are not subject to the aca  timothy jost  a professor at the washington and lee university school of law  said such a move would face fewer legal hurdles than the expansion of association health plans  the current three month limitation on the use of such plans was a rule adopted by the obama administration last year  so the trump administration could roll it back through the normal rulemaking process  such plans are typically marketed to individuals who are between jobs or have a gap in coverage  they are much cheaper than aca plans  but cover less and can exclude those with pre existing conditions
