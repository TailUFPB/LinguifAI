 washington  reuters    the trump administration is nearing completion of new  buy american  rules to make it easier to sell u s  made military drones overseas and compete against fast growing chinese and israeli rivals  senior u s  officials said   while president donald trump s aides work on relaxing domestic regulations on drone sales to select allies  washington will also seek to renegotiate a  missile control pact with the aim of loosening international restrictions on u s  exports of unmanned aircraft  according to government and industry sources   at home  the u s  administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under heavy pressure from american manufacturers and in defiance of human rights advocates who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the middle east and south asia   the changes  part of a broader effort to overhaul u s  arms export protocols  could be rolled out by the end of the year under a presidential policy decree  the administration officials told reuters on condition of anonymity   the aim is to help u s  drone makers  pioneers in remote controlled aircraft that have become a centerpiece of counterterrorism strategy  reassert themselves in the overseas market where china  israel and others often sell under less cumbersome restrictions   simplified export rules could easily generate thousands of jobs  but it s too early to be more specific  said remy nathan  a lobbyist with the aerospace industry association  the main beneficiaries would be top u s  drone makers general atomics  boeing  ba n   northrop grumman  noc n   textron  txt n  and lockheed martin  lmt n     this will allow us to get in the game in a way that we ve never been before   said one senior u s  official   regulations are expected to be loosened especially on the sale of unarmed intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance drones  the most sophisticated of which carry high resolution cameras and laser guided targeting systems to aid missiles fired from warplanes  naval vessels or ground launchers   deliberations have been more complicated  however  on how to alter export rules for missile equipped drones like the predator and reaper  hunter killer drones  which have essentially changed the face of modern warfare  are increasingly in demand and u s  models considered the most advanced   the push is not only part of trump s  buy american  agenda to boost u s  business abroad but also reflects a more export friendly approach to weapons sales that the administration sees as a way to wield influence with foreign partners  the senior official said   under a draft of the new rules  a classified list of countries numbering in double digits would be given more of a fast track treatment for military drone purchases  a second senior official said  the favored group would include some of washington s closest nato allies and partners in the  five eyes  intelligence alliance  britain  australia  canada and new zealand  according to the industry source   rachel stohl  director of the conventional defense program at the stimson center in washington  said if u s  drone export rules become too lenient  they could give more governments with poor human rights records the means to  target their own civilians    trump s predecessor  president barack obama  revised the policy for military drone exports in   but u s  manufacturers complained it was still too restrictive compared with main competitors china and israel   u s  drone makers are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market  even before the coming changes  the teal group  a market research firm  has forecast sales will rise from    billion in  to    billion in    linden blue  ceo of privately held general atomics  the u s  leader in military drones  visited the white house recently to lobby for his industry  a person familiar with the discussions said   among the u s  changes will be a formal reinterpretation of the  presumption of denial   a longstanding obstacle to most military drones sales  that would make it easier and faster to secure approval  the officials said   britain  and only recently italy  are the only countries that had been allowed to buy armed u s  drones   a long delayed   billion sale to india of general atomics  guardian surveillance drones finally secured u s  approval in june  but new delhi s request for armed drones has stalled   a major hurdle to expanded sales of the most powerful u s  drones is the missile technology control regime  or mtcr  a  accord signed by the united states and  other countries  which set rules for the sale and purchase of missiles   it categorizes drones with a range greater than of  miles   km  and a payload above   pounds   kg  as cruise missiles  requiring extremely tight import export controls  to gain an international stamp of approval for the relaxed u s  export rules  u s  officials want the mtcr renegotiated   state department officials attending an annual meeting of the missile control group in dublin next week will present a  discussion paper  proposing that sales of drones   which did not exist when the agreement was created   be treated more leniently than the missile technology that the mtcr was designed to regulate  according to a u s  official and industry sources   there is no guarantee of a consensus  russia  which has nato members along its borders  could resist such changes  the u s  official said   china  which is not an mtcr signatory  has pushed ahead with drone sales to some countries with close ties to washington  such as iraq  saudi arabia and nigeria  but which have failed to pass u s  regulatory muster   chinese models such as the ch  and  ch  have been compared to the reaper but are much cheaper  u s  officials said beijing sells them with few strings attached   the chinese foreign ministry insists it takes a  cautious and responsible attitude  to military drone exports   israel  which is outside the mtcr but has pledged to abide by it  competes with u s  manufacturers on the basis of high tech standards  but it will not sell to neighbors in the volatile middle east  israel sold   million worth of drones overseas in   according defense ministry data   u s  drone makers and their supporters within the administration contend that other countries are going to proliferate drones  so they should not be left behind
