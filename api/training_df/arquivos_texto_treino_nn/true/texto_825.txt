 reuters    when the lawyer for the former campaign manager of president donald trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy  some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by u s  special counsel robert mueller  paul manafort and his associate rick gates both pleaded not guilty on monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro russia former ukrainian president viktor yanukovich between  and  and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies  partnerships and bank accounts  in a court filing on thursday  manafort defense lawyer kevin downing said the money laundering count  the most serious facing his client with a  year maximum sentence  was based on a  tenuous legal theory  tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former ukrainian leader   downing did not respond to a request for comment  mueller spokesman peter carr declined to comment  the language of the filing and defiant statements downing made outside the courthouse following manafort s arraignment on monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges  the first to be made public from mueller s probe into russian interference in the  presidential election  the kremlin has denied meddling and trump has said there was no collusion  neither trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on monday  downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant  according to an additional filing on friday  manafort s virginia home was raided by federal bureau of investigation agents over the summer  the money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of  specified unlawful activity   according to the manafort indictment  the unlawful activity was his violation of the u s  foreign agent registration act  fara   though the money laundering statute includes fara violations  seattle tax lawyer john colvin said the charge against manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases   it doesn t fit the normal paradigm  of money laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking  colvin said   it seems like a stretch to me    downing said in his thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating fara in the last  years  producing only one conviction  by pointing out the lack of previous fara prosecutions  former federal prosecutor mark lee  now a white collar defense lawyer in philadelphia  said downing was likely trying to suggest manafort may not even have known he was violating the law  the section cited by mueller requires the fara violation to be  knowing and willful   successfully casting doubt on whether manafort intentionally violated fara could knock out the money laundering charge  lee said   if you don t have a  specific unlawful activity   you can t by definition have a laundering   said lee  former federal prosecutor michael padula  now a miami defense lawyer  said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to  promote  an ongoing criminal enterprise  that may be hard to show in the manafort case  where the proceeds went to purchase real estate  expensive suits and range rovers for the conspirator s personal use  but other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding fara would gain much traction   the idea that somebody of mr  manafort s background and sophistication would not understand that  if he did what he is alleged to have done  he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government  is  i think  laughable   said chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor patrick cotter  several lawyers noted that  even without the money laundering counts  mueller had strong charges based on the failure of manafort and gates to report their overseas accounts to the internal revenue service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence  they also pointed out that mueller could add more charges at a later date   it s an argument  not a get out of jail free card   said padula of downing s money laundering defense   he s still got a tough road ahead of him
