washington  reuters    former fbi director james comey accused president donald trump on thursday of firing him to try to undermine the agency s investigation of possible collusion by trump s campaign with russia s alleged efforts to influence the  presidential election  in the most eagerly anticipated u s  congressional hearing in years  comey told lawmakers the trump administration had lied and defamed him and the federal bureau of investigation after the president dismissed him on may    during more than two hours of testimony  comey told the senate intelligence committee he believed trump had directed him in february to drop an fbi probe into the republican president s former national security adviser  michael flynn  as part of the broader russia investigation  comey would not say whether he thought the president sought to obstruct justice  but added it would be up to special counsel robert mueller  who is now investigating the russia allegations   to sort that out    i don t think it s for me to say whether the conversation i had with the president was an effort to obstruct  i took it as a very disturbing thing  very concerning   comey testified  sitting alone at a small table facing a bank of senators who fired question after question  comey gave short  deliberative answers  he painted a picture of an overbearing president he did not trust and who pressured him to stop the fbi probe of flynn  trump critics say any efforts by the president to hinder an fbi probe could amount to obstruction of justice  such an offense potentially could lead to trump being impeached  although his fellow republicans who control congress have shown little appetite for such a move  in a speech to supporters across town  trump vowed to fight on   we re under siege     but we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever   he said  comey did not make any major disclosures about any links between trump or his associates and russia  an issue that has dogged the president s first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the u s  healthcare system and making tax cuts  russia has denied such interference  the white house has denied any collusion with moscow  nevertheless  the russia matter likely will continue to overshadow trump s presidency  especially as the fbi probe has ensnared not only flynn but trump s son in law and adviser  jared kushner  attorney general jeff sessions has had to recuse himself from the investigation  comey s testimony drew renewed attention to sessions and his relationship with russia s ambassador to the united states  sergei kislyak   after trump fired comey  the administration gave differing reasons for his dismissal  trump later contradicted his own staff and acknowledged on may  he fired comey because of the russia matter  asked why he thought trump fired him  comey said he did not know for sure  he added   again  i take the president s words  i know i was fired because of something about the way i was conducting the russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him  in some way irritating him  and he decided to fire me because of that   comey said repeatedly there were details he could not discuss in a public session  making clear he had sensitive information he could disclose only in a closed session with the senators  comey said trump s administration had defamed him in comments made after his firing by saying the fbi was in disarray and that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader   those were lies  plain and simple   comey said  his accusations could further mire trump s administration in legal difficulties  mueller and several congressional committees are investigating what u s  intelligence agencies have concluded was an effort by russia to help trump win the election   the russian investigation is going to go on and it s not going to stop and the president should have known that   committee member democratic senator dianne feinstein told msnbc  trump s personal lawyer  marc kasowitz  said comey s testimony proved the president was not under any investigation and there was no evidence a single vote was changed as a result of russian interference in last year s election  kasowitz denied trump ever told comey he needed and expected his loyalty  as comey said  nbc news reported on thursday that kushner was expected to meet with staff members of the senate intelligence committee in mid june    comey said he felt he needed to get his account of his conversations with trump in the public sphere in the hope it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel  which later occurred  comey said he gave copies of his memo memorializing his talks with trump to people outside the justice department and asked a friend to share its contents with a journalist  columbia law school professor daniel richman confirmed to reuters he was the friend to whom comey was referring  kasowitz said that  we will leave it to the appropriate authorities  to determine whether comey s leak  should be investigated   legal experts questioned kasowitz s contention that trump s private encounters with comey should be considered privileged communications      comey said he did not know if there were tapes of his conversations with trump  but that if so  they should be released   lordy  i hope there are tapes   comey said  republicans on the committee questioned comey intently but did not attack his integrity or try to treat him roughly  as a witness making accusations against a sitting republican president might expect  comey testified he kept notes after meeting with trump because  i was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting  and so i thought it really important to document   from capitol hill to san francisco s castro district  comey s appearance attracted television  watch parties  beckoning politics buffs to taverns  restaurants and living rooms to view an event some likened to the  super bowl of washington   u s  stocks closed slightly higher as the market reacted little to comey s testimony  viewing his testimony alone as unlikely to mark the end of trump s presidency   comey said trump did not attempt to get him to drop the overall russia investigation  just the part of if that related to flynn  whom the president fired in february for misleading vice president mike pence about the extent of his conversations last year with kislyak  republican senator marco rubio asked comey whether he perceived the president s request to let the flynn matter go as an order given trump s position as president  the setting and the circumstances surrounding the conversation       yes   comey replied      laura donohue  a georgetown university law center professor  said if trump fired comey to change the course of the russia investigation  that would constitute obstruction of justice  both the conversation between trump and comey about flynn and the firing itself were obstructive acts  she said   he wanted to scuttle the investigation   it is hard to see it any other way   she said   regarding sessions  comey said he did not discuss trump s pressure to drop the probe into flynn with the attorney general because the fbi leadership team believed sessions would later recuse himself from the russia probe   we were also aware of facts that i can t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a russia related investigation problematic   comey said  without giving more details  the justice department later issued a statement saying that sessions recused himself from the russia probe only because he had been part of trump s campaign  republican senator lindsey graham said he did not believe trump had committed a crime even if his personal style was often brash  adding   i ll just say it  if being crude  rude and a bull in a china shop was a crime  trump would get the death penalty
