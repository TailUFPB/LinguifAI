washington  reuters    democrats on a congressional panel say members of its republican majority are trying to sabotage an investigation into suspected russian meddling in the  u s  election  raising concerns the two parties will reach contradictory conclusions  republicans on the u s  house of representatives intelligence committee have coached witnesses  scheduled interviews without first requesting important documents  and many fail to attend witness interviews  four sources close to the investigation said  on one occasion  three sources said  republican representative trey gowdy told jared kushner  president donald trump s son in law and white house aide  that he was testifying voluntarily and could leave whenever he liked  after about two and a half hours  one of the sources said  kushner took the cue and left before democrats had finished questioning him  kushner s lawyer and gowdy did not immediately respond to requests for comment   the panel has heard from about  witnesses  the sources said  but given the lack of preparation and the absence of many republican members  hearings amount to  going through the motions  rather than a serious investigation  one source said      two republican committee staffers  speaking on the condition of anonymity  also criticized what they called a partisan effort to discredit rather than investigate allegations that some aides or advisers to republican trump s election campaign may have colluded with russia  which has been under u s  sanctions for several years  the conduct of the probe so far  those staffers and other sources said  threatens to undermine the committee s reputation for bipartisanship under former republican chairman mike rogers  who led the committee from  to   representative jackie speier  a california democrat  said that while she would like to believe the panel  will come together unified in its conclusions and submit a joint report  i m not overly optimistic that this will be the case   another committee democrat  representative eric swalwell  said   that is our north star  unity and consensus on what happened  now along the way we ve seen disruptive behavior that has i think impeded our investigation  and despite that we still are doggedly trying to find out what happened   asked for comment  jack langer  a spokesman for republican committee chairman  representative devin nunes  said in a statement   with this article  reuters is acting as a loyal  obedient stenographer of the democrats  utterly baseless complaints   langer did not respond to reuters  request to address  specific complaints made by the democrats  democratic members and staffers on the committee have said nothing publicly about the republicans  possible motives for fear of destroying any chance to produce a bipartisan report  four sources said  democrats said that the republicans appear to want to undermine the credibility of fusion gps  a political research firm that commissioned former british spy christopher steele to produce a dossier on trump while he was running for president  investigators are attempting to confirm or dismiss the contents of steele s dossier  which outlined russian financial and personal links to trump s campaign and associates  u s  intelligence agencies concluded in january that russian president vladimir putin ordered a campaign of hacking and propaganda to undermine faith in the u s  election  denigrate democratic nominee hillary clinton  and help trump  the kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations  trump disputes he and his associates colluded with moscow  calling probes by congress and a special counsel a  witch hunt   panel chairman nunes  a trump ally  was forced to step aside  from leading the probe in april after the house ethics committee said it was investigating allegations that he disclosed classified information without authorization  democrats on the committee praise representative mike conaway  the republican who took nunes  place leading the investigation  nevertheless  nunes is investigating fusion gps and steele on his own  on oct    nunes subpoenaed the firm s partners  a source familiar with the matter said  sources familiar with the origins of the dossier said steele received no money for his work on it from any russian entity or person or from the fbi  it has been widely reported that supporters of republican jeb bush  one of trump s opponents for the party s  presidential nomination  initially paid for research that was later picked up by clinton supporters      the house and senate intelligence committees  created in the aftermath of u s  spy scandals exposed in the   have long traditions of avoiding partisan feuds  three sources familiar with the house committee s workings said democrats had requested a meeting of all members to resolve  differences  but the republicans rejected the idea  if the rift cannot be healed  the sources said  the democrats could write their own report and seek to associate it with what is expected to be a bipartisan senate intelligence committee report  representative adam schiff  the house committee s top democrat  wrote in the washington post last weekend that he still hoped members could arrive at a common conclusion   this remains my hope   not consistency for the sake of consistency  or at the cost of incomplete work  but in the service of a public that has too often been forced to choose between competing narratives of the same events   schiff wrote
