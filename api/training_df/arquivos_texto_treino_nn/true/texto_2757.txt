 reuters    president donald trump s temporary ban on travelers from six muslim majority countries cannot stop grandparents and other relatives of united states citizens from entering the country  a u s  judge said on thursday  the ruling by u s  district judge derrick watson in honolulu also opens the door for more refugees and deals trump a fresh courtroom defeat in a long back and forth over an executive order that has gone all the way up to the u s  supreme court  the state of hawaii had asked watson to narrowly interpret a supreme court ruling that revived parts of trump s march  executive order banning travelers from iran  libya  somalia  sudan  syria and yemen for  days  as well as refugees for  days  the supreme court last month said the ban could take effect  but that anyone from the six countries with a  bona fide relationship  to a u s  person or entity could not be barred  the trump administration then interpreted that opinion to allow spouses  parents  children  fianc√©s and siblings into the country  but barred grandparents and other family members  in a measure trump called necessary to prevent attacks   watson harshly criticized the government s definition of close family relations as  the antithesis of common sense  in a  ruling that changes the way the ban can now be implemented   common sense  for instance  dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents  indeed  grandparents are the epitome of close family members   he wrote  a justice department spokeswoman declined to comment  trump s order is a pretext for illegal discrimination  hawaii attorney general douglas chin said in a statement   family members have been separated and real people have suffered enough   chin said  chin had asked watson for an injunction allowing grandparents and other family members to travel to the united states  hawaii and refugee groups also had argued that resettlement agencies have a  bona fide  relationship with the refugees they help  sometimes over the course of years  the justice department said its rules were properly grounded in immigration law  watson said the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the u s  because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation     bona fide  does not get any more  bona fide  than that   watson said   melanie nezer  vice president of global refugee advocacy group hias  said the ruling should mean that refugees can continue to be resettled in the united states  beyond a cap of    set by the executive order  that limit was reached this week    we are thrilled that thousands of people will be reunited with their family members   said becca heller  director of the international refugee assistance project  more than   additional refugees should be allowed to travel to the u s  under watson s order  she estimated   watson did not grant everything the state of hawaii sought  however  he rejected a request to categorically exempt all iraqis refugee applicants who believe they are at risk due to their work for the u s  government since march    as interpreters and translators  for instance  watson also refused a blanket exemption for those eligible to apply to a refugee program aimed at protecting certain children at risk in el salvador  honduras  and guatemala  the roll out of the narrowed version of the ban was more subdued than in january  when trump first signed a more expansive version of his order  that sparked protests and chaos at airports around the country and the world
