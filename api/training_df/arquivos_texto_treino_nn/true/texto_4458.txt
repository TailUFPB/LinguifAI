washington  reuters    if confirmed as expected this week by the u s  senate  president donald trump s supreme court nominee would join his new fellow justices in time to act on divisive cases concerning religion  guns and big business  underscoring neil gorsuch s importance  as the fifth conservative on a nine justice court  the senate s republican leaders have pledged to confirm the colorado based appeals court judge on friday  his first official task after being sworn in would come at an april  private meeting among the justices to discuss taking various appeals from lower courts  there are appeals pending on expanding gun rights to include carrying concealed firearms in public  state voting restrictions critics say are aimed at reducing minority turnout  and allowing business owners to object on religious grounds to serving gay couples  all three could lead to landmark rulings if taken up  on april   the justices will begin hearing a new round of oral arguments  including a closely watched case on the separation of church and state focusing on whether a missouri church was improperly denied state funds  the court is nearing the end of its current term  which runs from october to june  gorsuch also would play a key role in important cases the justices already have agreed to hear in their next term  including a bid by employers to prevent workers from bringing class action claims  a goal of big business  the court has been divided between four conservatives and four liberals since the february  death of conservative justice antonin scalia  major issues before the court highlight the significance of gorsuch filling scalia s seat and restoring the court s   conservative majority  senate republicans paved the way for trump to replace scalia by refusing last year to consider democratic former president barack obama s nomination of appellate judge merrick garland to fill the vacancy  that would have given the court a liberal majority for the first time in decades  legal experts suspect a conservative majority on the court could motivate conservative lawyers to bring cases in a hope that five justices will back abortion restrictions  oppose political spending limits  and favor wider gun and religious rights  justice anthony kennedy  a conservative who sometimes sides with the four liberals  will remain the court s swing vote  most experts expect gorsuch to be more aligned with the court s two most stalwart conservatives  samuel alito and clarence thomas   there s no reason to think he will be anything other than extremely conservative   said chicago kent college of law professor carolyn shapiro  with four votes needed to take up a case at the private meetings  each justice is important  among pending appeals the court is likely to act on in the coming weeks is a case in which activists have asked the justices to rule for the first time that the u s  constitution s second amendment  which protects the right to bear arms  extends to carrying firearms outside the home   in another case  the court could decide whether to revive voter identification and other restrictions in north carolina blocked by a lower court  the justices also could hear a christian baker s religious claim that he should not be forced to sell a cake to a gay couple  conservative justices generally take expansive views of gun and religious rights and may back state laws whose republican backers say are intended to prevent voter fraud  on april   the court will hear a religious rights case in which a church contends missouri violated the constitution s guarantee of religious freedom by denying it funds for a playground project due to a state ban on aid to religious organizations  gorsuch has ruled several times in favor of expansive religious rights during his decade as a judge   given gorsuch s solicitude for religious liberty  his joining the court can only help the church   said ilya shapiro  a lawyer with the libertarian cato institute think tank  there are several cases the court has already heard but has not yet decided in which gorsuch could play a role  the court has the option of hearing fresh arguments  with gorsuch in a position to cast a potential deciding vote   one such case is a bid by miami to revive lawsuits accusing major banks of predatory mortgage lending to black and hispanic home buyers  another concerns whether the family of a mexican teenager can sue a u s  border patrol agent who fatally shot the  year old from across the border in texas  longer term  an issue likely to return to the court is a conservative backed challenge that could weaken organized labor  the court was expected to deny unions a vital source of cash last year  but after scalia died  it issued a   ruling leaving in place a lower court s decision favoring unions   the court is also likely to weigh in on whether transgender students are protected under a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education  the court took up that question last fall but in march sent the case back to a lower court without resolving the main legal question
