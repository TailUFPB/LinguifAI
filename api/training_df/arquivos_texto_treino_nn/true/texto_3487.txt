order in the united states   and we appreciate that   for many billions of dollars  which means jobs for the united states and great  great equipment for vietnam   trump told reporters at the white house  the commerce department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the   billion figure given by phuc during a speech at the heritage foundation  adding that most of the total involved the import of u s  equipment  communist vietnam has gone from being a cold war enemy to an important partner for the united states in the asia pacific  where both countries share concerns about china s rising power  phuc told trump the relationship had undergone  significant upheavals in history  but that the two countries were now  comprehensive partners   phuc s meeting with trump makes him the first southeast asian leader to visit the white house under the new administration  however  while hanoi and washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years  trade has become a potential irritant  with a deficit widening steadily in vietnam s favor  reaching   billion last year  compared with   billion a decade earlier  commerce secretary wilbur ross said it was important to shrink the u s  trade deficit with vietnam but noted that the southeast asian country of  million people was the fastest growing market for u s  exports  rising  percent since  to    billion   the growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long term trade and investment relationship   ross said  trump  who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the united states  said he would be discussing trade with phuc  as well as north korea   washington has been seeking support to pressure north korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs  which have become an increasing threat to the united states  hanoi has said it shares concerns about north korea  in his heritage speech  phuc welcomed trump s plans to attend the november apec summit in hanoi  he called it a sign of u s  commitment to the region and  an important occasion for the united states to assert its positive role   in a reference to somewhat warmer ties between washington and beijing under trump  who has been courting china s support on north korea  phuc said vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers  but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too  he urged washington and beijing  to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations   vietnam s government said on its website trump and phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of u s  vessels  including aircraft carriers  visiting vietnamese ports  it said they had expressed concern about the south china sea  where vietnam  malaysia  the philippines and brunei are involved in maritime disputes with china  which claims nearly all the strategic waterway  taiwan also stakes a claim   they emphasized that parties must not take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of disputed structures   it said  an apparent reference to china s construction work  murray hiebert  a southeast asia expert at washington s  center for strategic and international studies  said that while the trump administration welcomed new business deals with vietnam  its view was they were  nice  but not enough    they want vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis   he said    on tuesday  u s  trade representative robert lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with vietnam  he said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to phuc to help address it  the deficit is washington s sixth largest and reflects growing imports of vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear  apparel and furniture  on tuesday vietnam s trade minister  tran tuan anh  presented lighthizer with suggestions to address some u s  concerns  such as advertising on u s  social media  electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products  vietnam s trade ministry said  vietnam was disappointed when trump ditched the  nation trans pacific partnership trade pact  of which hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries  and focused u s  trade policy on reducing deficits
