chicago  reuters    illinois  first budget after two years is filled with partial outlines to address its debt ridden pension system and unpaid bill backlog   signs that political fighting and the fiscal mess in the nation s fifth largest state are far from over  at least  house and senate republicans broke with first term republican governor bruce rauner on thursday and joined with democrats to override rauner s vetoes of the state s first budget package in more than two years   the   billion spending plan relies on a   billion tax increase that permanently hikes the flat personal income tax rate to   percent  up  percent from its prior   percent rate  to address the state s nearly   billion in unpaid bills  illinois depends heavily on borrowing  lawmakers approved   billion of  year bonds to raise money for repayments  but state representative greg harris  the house democrats  point person on the budget  has acknowledged there is only enough revenue to support half of that borrowing amount   illinois will also borrow up to    billion from various state accounts that have accumulated cash for specific purposes  while  sweeping  cash from other accounts  a government version of looking under couch cushions that is expected to yield   million   illinois    billion pension liability is one of the largest in the nation  and the new budget takes only small steps to address the structural underfunding of illinois  five retirement systems   the new law gives the state five years to phase in changes retroactive to fiscal  in actuarial or investment return assumptions made by the pension systems for an estimated savings of    million   seemingly small changes in projected investment results can have significant impact on a pension fund s actuarial calculations  last year  when the illinois teachers  retirement system reduced its earnings assumption to  percent from   percent  the change caused a   million spike in the state s fiscal  contribution  the new budget attributes   million in savings to the creation of a new tier of pension beneficiaries  but that tier applies largely to newly hired employees  raising questions about how the state expects to book that savings in the current fiscal year  that estimate was lifted straight from the proposed budget presented by rauner earlier this year  the projection has not been independently verified by legislative leaders  and rauner s office has not responded to requests for an explanation of how the estimate was calculated   the illinois education association  one of the state s largest unions  said it has no evidence that its pensioners would be harmed by the new budget s pension provisions  but the union questioned why lawmakers approved structural changes to pensions without an independent financial analysis    it s a little bit of a shot in the dark  for something this major  you d think the legislators who are voting on this would want to know this information   said jim reed  the union s government relations director  a budget was welcomed as a positive step for illinois  which still faces fiscal and pension crises   the pension pressures will continue  and illinois  financial challenges will continue  but at least there will be a framework to recognize there s a limit to the liability growth to this state   said laurence msall  president of the civic federation  a budget watchdog group  steve malanga  a senior fellow at the manhattan institute think tank  said the fixes in the new budget do not match up to the challenges faced by illinois   this is the kind of budget you would pass if you were a state that hit a bump in the road and had a deficit you needed to get rid of over the next two or three years   he said   it s not the kind of budget you d pass if you have   billion in unpaid bills and a   billion unfunded  pension  liability   the democrats and republicans who voted for the budget did so at least in part to prevent illinois from becoming the first u s  state in history to see its credit rating fall to  junk  status  moody s on wednesday put illinois on review for a possible downgrade  but some of the state s bonds traded higher on friday  an apparent sign of optimism about the budget
