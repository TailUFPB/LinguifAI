washington  reuters    like the deal maker he says he is  u s  president donald trump appears to be keeping his options open as his republican party threatens to erupt into full scale war   on monday  almost immediately after saying he empathized with the effort by his former strategist steve bannon to back challenges against republican senators in next year s congressional elections  trump stood with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  pledging party unity and saying they were  fighting for the same thing   for months  mcconnell had been the object of trump s wrath for the failure of the republican led congress to repeal and replace the affordable care act  known as obamacare   a longtime republican goal and a key promise of trump s  campaign  in the white house rose garden  trump played down any conflict  saying the two were  closer than ever before   but trump would not disavow bannon s pledge to take down republicans who are not fully behind trump s agenda and to drive mcconnell from the senate s leadership  bannon  who helped mastermind trump s election campaign but left the white house in august  appeared at a gathering of conservative activists on saturday and declared   right now  it s a season of war against a gop establishment   in comments directed at mcconnell  bannon told the gathering   up on capitol hill  it s like the ides of march  they re just looking to find out who is going to be brutus to your julius caesar   brutus  once an ally of caesar  was among the assassins of the roman leader on the ides of march in  b c  working with well funded outside political groups  bannon is encouraging anti establishment candidates to challenge republican incumbents in the party s nominating races for the  elections in which all the seats in the house of representatives and a third of the senate are up for election  republican leaders  such as mcconnell  worry that the anti establishment candidates might be less palatable to general election voters and cause republicans to lose their majority in the senate and possibly also the house  asked about bannon before a meeting of his cabinet on monday  trump said he could  understand where steve bannon s coming from  and took a jab at the republican led congress in the process    we re not getting the job done   trump said   and i m not going to blame myself  i ll be honest  they are not getting the job done   at the later news conference with mcconnell  trump said  however  he may try to persuade bannon not to back primary challengers in several upcoming congressional races   steve is doing what steve thinks is the right thing   trump said   some of the people that he may be looking at  challenging   i m going to see if we talk him out of that  because frankly  they re great people   still  when mcconnell went further  criticizing bannon for favoring fringe candidates who cannot  appeal to a broader electorate   trump was noticeably silent  trump is still stinging from his decision to support the republican incumbent in the recent alabama senate primary  luther strange  at mcconnell s behest  strange was beaten handily by arch conservative roy moore  the challenger backed by bannon   while it has been unusual for a president to support a primary challenger in his own party  trump has signaled he may be willing to do so in states such as arizona  where senator jeff flake  up for re election next year  has been critical of the white house
