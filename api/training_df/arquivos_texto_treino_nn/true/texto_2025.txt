washington  reuters    u s  interior secretary ryan zinke said on thursday he has sent recommendations from his review of more than two dozen national monuments to president donald trump  indicating that some could be scaled back to allow for more hunting and fishing and economic development  the recommendations follow a  day study of  national monuments across the country  created by presidents since   that trump ordered in april as part of his broader effort to increase development on federal lands  the review has cheered energy  mining  ranching and timber advocates but has drawn widespread criticism and threats of lawsuits from conservation groups and the outdoor recreation industry  there were fears that zinke would recommend the outright elimination of some of the monuments on the list  but on thursday  speaking to the associated press in billings  montana  he said he will not recommend eliminating any  zinke said in a statement that the recommendations would  provide a much needed change for the local communities who border and rely on these lands for hunting and fishing  economic development  traditional uses  and recreation   he did not specify which monuments he plans to recommend be scaled back  the associated press reported that zinke said he would recommend changing the boundaries for a  handful  of sites  zinke has already announced a recommendation to shrink the size of one site under review  the   million acre bears ears national monument in utah created by former president barack obama late last year  in the last few weeks  zinke has said that six monuments  including the upper missouri river breaks in his home state of montana  would be left intact   the report is a draft  so we are continuing to work with interior on getting the best information on which to base recommendations  for trump  a white house official said   once we have a final report  in the coming weeks  we will make it public    timing for the public release of the recommendations has not been set  trump has argued that previous administrations abused their right to create monuments under the antiquities act of  by putting huge areas  mainly in western states  off limits to drilling  mining  logging  ranching and other activities without adequate input from locals   the law enables a president to declare certain areas of historic or scientific interest a national monument if  confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected     graphic on review of monuments   tmsnrt rs   a designation as a national monument is permanent  and prohibits mining and sets stringent protections for ecosystems on the site  the designation offers more permanent protection than other federal designations like national wilderness or conservation areas  no president has ever revoked a previous designation but a few have reduced the size of some monuments  conservation groups and the growing outdoor retail industry launched public campaigns over the last few weeks to urge zinke to leave the monuments intact  and they vowed to challenge him in court    any recommendation from secretary zinke to shrink national monuments is hypocritical at best and ruinous at worst   said michael brune  director of the sierra club  one republican congressman from utah  rob bishop  chairman of the house of representatives natural resources committee  said he had not yet seen the full report but was briefed on some aspects of it by zinke  he said his committee would eventually take up legislation to carry out some of zinke s recommendations and may attempt to reform the antiquities act   if we don t do reform of the antiquities act  we will have failures in the future   he said
