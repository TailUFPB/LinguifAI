washington  reuters    the solidly republican south suddenly looks a little less solid  tuesday s upset win by democrat doug jones in alabama  coupled with last month s democratic sweep in virginia  has given the party new optimism about its  prospects in the south and other conservative  heavily rural regions where republicans have dominated for decades  jones  a former federal prosecutor  took advantage of the controversy over sexual misconduct allegations against his republican opponent roy moore to become the first democrat elected to the u s  senate in alabama in a quarter century  the jones campaign also offered a template for how democrats can win in the south  strategists said  field a strong candidate  crank up turnout among the region s sizable bloc of african american voters  keep the liberal national party brand at arm s length and compete hard in every county and region  add in the grass roots energy of the liberal resistance to president donald trump  the disaffection of moderate suburbanites turned off by trump and a conservative wing sapped of enthusiasm by republican infighting  and democrats see an opportunity for a brighter future in the south starting in next year s midterm elections   you can hear that republican wall in the south cracking  doug jones and virginia are just the beginning   said phil noble  a democratic business and technology consultant who is running for governor in south carolina  republicans are not convinced  citing years of still unrealized democratic predictions that demographic changes would turn republican dominated conservative states like georgia and texas into toss ups   democrats still have issues with their brand in large swaths of the country  they are the party of nancy pelosi  and that image is cemented in many voters  minds   said brian walsh  a former strategist for the republican party s senate campaign committee  referring to the house of representatives democratic leader  a liberal from san francisco  in the fight for control of congress next year  wins on once hostile southern turf could be crucial to the democratic cause   in the senate  where republicans  already narrow majority will be shaved to   once jones is seated  democrats will have to defend  seats  including  in states won by trump  they would need to pick up two more republican held states to reclaim control  nevada and arizona had been viewed as the only republican held seats vulnerable to a takeover next year  but democrats now see possibilities in tennessee  where popular former democratic governor phil bredesen has jumped into the race for the seat of retiring republican bob corker  and mississippi  where incumbent republican roger wicker could face a bruising primary challenge  in the house of representatives  democrats need to gain  seats to win a majority  their target list of  districts includes one each in alabama  arkansas and kentucky  two in georgia and four in north carolina   if the election were held today  i do think you could see democrats winning in some areas of the country where democrats haven t won in the last decade   said zac mccrary  a democratic pollster based in alabama  in addition to the congressional races  governors  contests in georgia and south carolina and state legislative races across the region will give democrats a shot to compete in areas where they once dominated local politics but are now a minority party defined by liberal views on cultural issues such as abortion and gay rights  mccrary said jones and democrat john bel edwards  who won the louisiana governor s office in   have shown it is possible to build a winning coalition in the south by energizing  african american voters while also appealing to white swing voters  soft republicans and independents  in alabama  jones made inroads with voters in shelby county  the republican suburbs of the state s biggest city  birmingham  outpolling the results of hillary clinton there in last year s presidential election by about  percentage points  that should be a warning sign to republicans after trump s weak performance in wealthier  more educated suburban districts in  and democrat jon ossoff s strong  though ultimately losing bid in a special election earlier this year for a congressional seat in a suburban atlanta district that has been long held by republicans  said david hughes  a professor at auburn university montgomery in alabama   if democrats want to get out of the ditch they are in in alabama and the south  they will do it in the suburbs   said hughes  an expert on southern politics and judicial elections  in the nine states that form the political backbone of the republican dominated south   alabama  arkansas  georgia  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  tennessee  and south and north carolina   republicans will hold  of the  senate seats once jones takes office as well as  of the  house seats  democratic party chairman tom perez acknowledged on wednesday that the national party kept a low profile in alabama even as it pumped money into turnout efforts targeting blacks and young voters because it knew that publicity about its involvement would not help jones  but perez said the victory showed that the party  which has launched a  state organizing effort aimed at electing candidates at the local and state levels  can compete in the south and elsewhere   we can win in every zip code in america   perez told reporters  democrats in alabama said the party can start by learning lessons from jones  who campaigned in every corner of the state and portrayed himself as a bridge builder who would listen to voters  concerns and work across the aisle to help alabama   this is what we need to be doing more of  and not just at election time   thomas jackson  a black alabama state representative  said at a fish fry attended by jones in rural alabama last month   we can get a lot accomplished if we just sit down and talk with people more
