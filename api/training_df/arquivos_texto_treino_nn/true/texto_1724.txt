washington  reuters    as president donald trump bowed his head in the oval office earlier this month  texas southern baptist pastor robert jeffress and other u s  religious leaders laid their hands on trump s back and prayed for hurricane harvey s victims  with tv cameras and reporters watching  the scene was a powerful reminder of one of trump s most reliable and improbable political assets   his close ties with conservative christians  a new reuters ipsos poll shows  however  that trump s popularity among white evangelicals has weakened  suggesting his grassroots support may not be as unconditional as religious leaders  public displays of allegiance would suggest   that may pose a problem for trump and his allies as the  midterm congressional election season nears  trump s strong links to conservative christians played a key part in his stunning victory in the  presidential election  though disenchanted evangelicals were unlikely to switch their votes to democrats  they could stay home next year when u s  voters elect senators and representatives      when your base is starting to even slowly move away from you  that should be a sign of concern   said justin vaughn  director of the center for idaho history and politics at boise state university in idaho  a state trump won handily last year  in a country that is more religious than most other western democracies and where a president s spiritual life is closely examined  the twice divorced new york billionaire socialite  who has attended church just twice since his jan   inauguration  is an unlikely torchbearer for conservative christians   he has labored to build and preserve this unlikely alliance  embracing social issues  such as commitment to anti abortion and religious liberty policies  and picking staunch conservative neil gorsuch  for the supreme court  trump also mentions god far more often in public remarks than his two predecessors  a reuters review showed  graphic  tmsnrt rs   but data from the nationwide online reuters ipsos poll conducted from jan   to aug   suggest trump has been unable to prevent his evangelical support from sliding in line with his overall ratings  the majority of those polled last month who described themselves as both  white  and a  born again or evangelical christian  said they approved of trump  but considerably fewer than when he took office almost eight months ago  the white house did not respond to requests for comment on the poll  during a four week period in august   percent of white evangelicals said they approved of trump  while  percent disapproved of the president and  percent said they had  mixed feelings   that is a drop from the first four weeks of trump s presidency  from late january to mid february  when  percent of white evangelicals said they approved of his performance while  percent disapproved and  percent had mixed feelings  the poll was divided into eight four week periods  with each including about   people and a credibility interval  a measure of accuracy  of about  percentage points     the declines are broadly in line with those recorded among all adult americans  in interviews   of the surveyed conservative christians said they were not concerned about trump s religion  rather  they questioned whether he was doing enough to help average americans and the frequent chaos in the white house   we can t go a week without someone leaving his administration  there is no stability in our government   said  robert waldram  a  year old baptist churchgoer from williamsburg  virginia  in a telephone interview  he said he voted for trump as a better option than democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  but waldram said he was tired of trump s  childlike tantrums on twitter   in his first  days in office  trump mentioned god about  times in public remarks  excluding the standard  god bless america  that presidents routinely end speeches with  something his ardent supporters welcome as readiness to eschew political correctness   by this point in their presidencies  democrat barack obama had mentioned god  times  while republican george w  bush had referred to god in  instances  jeffress  one of the first prominent evangelical pastors to back trump for president  said his god talk was apolitical   i understand that cynical people would say this is just for political expediency  but     i believe this comes out of some deep beliefs that he has personally   jeffress said  trump  who describes himself as presbyterian  was not known to be an avid churchgoer before becoming president and critics have said his blunders on basic biblical knowledge  harsh attacks on political adversaries  and his demeaning comments about women clash with christian principles   he  himself  doesn t have the most sterling track record in terms of either church attendance or professed or displayed knowledge of scripture   gary scott smith  a historian and author of  religion in the oval office  the religious lives of american presidents   said of trump  the pastors involved with trump s evangelical advisory board describe him  though  as very inquisitive about faith and more thoughtful on religion than he might appear in public and conservative pastors have continued to support him through various firestorms   evangelicals have had  unprecedented  white house access in this administration  said richard land  a board member and president of the southern evangelical seminary  a christian college  after trump s response to violence between white nationalists and left wing protesters in charlottesville  virginia  led to two of his business advisory councils disbanding  there were questions about the evangelical board s future   brooklyn  new york  megachurch pastor a r  bernard resigned  but others remained  saying it was their job to provide advice and counsel to trump  even when they disagree with him  and to press the president on christian issues  johnnie moore  a board member and former official at liberty university  a religious school  said   we have a deep personal relationship with him     he has prioritized issues that are important to us and we appreciate that
