washington  reuters    adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  said on sunday that it was premature to try to remove u s  president donald trump by claiming he is physically or mentally impaired  schiff told jake tapper on cnn s  state of the union  program that it did not make sense for trump s opponents to focus on the  amendment to the u s  constitution  which two democratic lawmakers invoked against the president after his controversial comments about a white nationalist rally in virginia  under the  amendment  the vice president takes over as acting president if he and a majority of either cabinet officials or  such other body as congress may by law provide  declare in writing that the president  is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office    i think we re still far from concluding that that s the case   schiff said   even though we find  many of us  his conduct anathema and there to be a serious problem here    the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment  california representative zoe lofgren on friday introduced a resolution urging vice president mike pence and trump s cabinet to have medical and psychiatric professionals examine the president to help determine whether he can do his job   many americans  including many republicans  have observed the president s increasingly disturbing pattern of actions and public statements that suggest he may be mentally unfit to execute the duties required of him   lofgren said in a statement  representative jackie speier  also of california  said in a twitter post on tuesday that trump was  showing signs of erratic behavior and mental instability that place the country in grave danger  time to invoke the  amendment    speier wrote the post after trump s explosive news conference on tuesday  when he blamed violence in charlottesville  virginia  not just on white nationalist rally organizers but also on counter protesters  trump said there were  very fine people  in both groups  those comments also provoked criticism from republican senator bob corker  who told reporters on thursday that trump  has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful   according to a tennessee local news website  corker did not refer to the  amendment in his remarks
