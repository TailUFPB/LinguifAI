 reuters    nine u s  senators from states that have oil refineries sent a letter to president donald trump on thursday urging changes to the country s biofuels policy and asking for a meeting to discuss the issue  the letter reflects growing tensions between refiners that oppose the u s  renewable fuel standard   a law requiring them to blend increasing amounts of ethanol into the nation s fuel each year   and the midwest corn lobby that supports it  the trump administration bowed to rising pressure from midwest lawmakers last week  assuring them in letters and phone calls that it would ditch proposals  supported by the refining industry  to overhaul the biofuels policy  the senators said that decision could cost jobs   if your administration does not make adjustments or reforms on matters related to the renewable fuel standard  it will result in a loss of jobs around the country  particularly in our states   according to the letter  which was signed by texas senator ted cruz  oklahoma senator jim inhofe  pennsylvania senator pat toomey and six others  in the letter  the senators asked trump for a meeting within the next three weeks that would include them  a number of midwest lawmakers and relevant administration officials  to discuss a pathway forward toward a mutually agreeable solution   a white house official did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting request  the renewable fuel standard was implemented by former president george w  bush in  as a way to support farmers  reduce imports and combat climate change  the oil industry has opposed the regulation  mainly because the increasing biofuels volume mandates cut into their petroleum based fuel market share   a number of independent refiners  like valero energy corp  cvr energy and pbf energy are also vocally opposed to the regulation s requirement that refiners blend the biofuels or purchase credits from rivals that do   which they say costs them hundreds of millions of dollars each year  cvr s majority owner  billionaire carl icahn  served for months as a top adviser to donald trump on regulation and during that time pushed to shift the responsibility for blending away from refiners to supply terminals or distributors  he resigned from his post this summer over concerns about his dual role as an investor and adviser   the environmental protection agency said last week that it did not believe shifting the blending requirement off refiners was appropriate  the epa also jettisoned a proposal to cut biofuels volumes mandates  and another to count ethanol exports against those mandates
