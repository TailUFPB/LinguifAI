washington  reuters    president donald trump on wednesday again raised the possibility of a u s  government shutdown   blaming democrats for that possible outcome   one day before he is due to host republican and democratic congressional leaders for talks on spending bills  trump and congress are facing a deadline of friday at midnight to pass fresh spending legislation  if they cannot agree on the terms  parts of the federal government could shut down  late on wednesday  a bill advanced in the house of representatives to extend current federal funding through dec    with the chamber expected to take up the bill on thursday  if that measure clears the house and senate  as expected  major fights are in the offing over the next funding bill  which could fund the government until sometime in january  trump s warning about a shutdown came as conservative house members pushed for increases in military spending along with either a freeze or reduction in domestic programs  their bid is likely to be rejected by democrats  who make up a minority in congress  and could further complicate months of behind the scenes negotiations by congressional leaders aimed at figuring out government spending through the end of this fiscal year on sept      while the house potentially could pass upcoming spending bills without any democratic support  that tactic would not work in the senate where procedural rules give democrats bargaining power  as a condition of backing new spending  many democrats have demanded legislative protections for the nearly   undocumented immigrants who were brought into the united states as children  trump pushed back  saying it could set the stage for impasse   the democrats are really looking at something that is very dangerous for our country   trump told reporters at the white house   they are looking at shutting down   house democratic leader nancy pelosi countered in a tweet   president trump is the only person talking about a government shutdown  democrats are hopeful the president will be open to an agreement to address the urgent needs of the american people and keep government open   the infighting came as republican congressional leaders labored to demonstrate that they can govern and spare the country the chaos of a government shutdown at christmas time that likely would not sit well with voters  a partial government shutdown would leave  essential  services operating  but could disrupt programs ranging from the operation of national parks to educational programs and scientific research  a politico morning consult opinion poll found that  percent of voters want congress to avoid any shutdown  with  percent in favor if it helps lawmakers achieve policy goals  in october   conservative republicans used the need to pass a funding bill to try to force repeal of the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  they failed but in the process forced a  day disruption of many federal agency activities  the end of year fight over appropriations  which should have been settled nine weeks ago  is attracting a series of controversial add ons from both republicans and democrats  republicans want to add as much as tens of billions of dollars to military spending this year and impose new work requirements for some recipients of medicaid benefits  the healthcare program for the poor and disabled  democrats want to attach the immigration measure and a restoration of obamacare subsidy payments for low income people that trump terminated  both parties seek additional disaster aid for puerto rico  texas  florida and other states  republican representatives mark meadows  who heads the house freedom caucus  and representative mark walker  chairman of the conservative republican study committee  are touting the effort to pump up pentagon spending without any increases to non defense programs  but democrats have argued that inaction on the non defense side of the ledger would usher in a new round of automatic spending cuts for those programs next month  short changing programs that fight opioid addiction  fund medical research  veterans programs and an array of other activities
