washington  reuters    members of the u s  house of representatives intelligence committee are close to an agreement on how to overhaul a controversial national security agency surveillance program and hope to complete legislation soon  the top democrat on the panel said on wednesday  representative adam schiff said he had proposed a compromise that would let intelligence agencies query a database of information on americans in national security cases without a warrant  but would require a warrant to use the information in other cases  such as those involving serious violent crime   this would prevent law enforcement from simply using the database as a vehicle to go fishing  but at the same time it would preserve the operational capabilities of the program   schiff told reporters  at issue is section  of the foreign intelligence surveillance act  which allows the nsa to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the united states  u s  intelligence officials consider section  among the most vital of tools at their disposal to thwart national security threats  but the program  classified details of which were exposed in  by former nsa contractor edward snowden  incidentally gathers communications of americans  such as when they compete with foreigners  currently  those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant  congress must renew section  in some form by dec   or the program will expire  schiff said he believed the compromise would be acceptable to many lawmakers  as well as the intelligence community and the federal bureau of investigation  it is similar to legislation backed by the house judiciary committee  however  there are still deep divides in both the senate and the house over what to do about section   as lawmakers balance demands for more privacy protections with spy agencies  desire to preserve what they see as a valuable tool  there are different renewal proposals in the house and senate  one senate bill would not require any warrants  which schiff said he did not think could pass the house  it was not clear whether lawmakers will vote on a standalone  bill or whether it would be part of a broader must pass bill  such as a spending measure congress must pass next month to keep the government open  another possibility would be a short term extension to keep the current surveillance system in place and give congress more time to come up with a solution that could become law
