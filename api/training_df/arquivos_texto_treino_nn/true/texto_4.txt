seattle washington  reuters    president donald trump called on the u s  postal service on friday to charge  much more  to ship packages for amazon  amzn o   picking another fight with an online retail giant he has criticized in the past       why is the united states post office  which is losing many billions of dollars a year  while charging amazon and others so little to deliver their packages  making amazon richer and the post office dumber and poorer  should be charging much more   trump wrote on twitter   the president s tweet drew fresh attention to the fragile finances of the postal service at a time when tens of millions of parcels have just been shipped all over the country for the holiday season   the u s  postal service  which runs at a big loss  is an independent agency within the federal government and does not receive tax dollars for operating expenses  according to its website   package delivery has become an increasingly important part of its business as the internet has led to a sharp decline in the amount of first class letters  the president does not determine postal rates  they are set by the postal regulatory commission  an independent government agency with commissioners selected by the president from both political parties  that panel raised prices on packages by almost  percent in november   amazon was founded by jeff bezos  who remains the chief executive officer of the retail company and is the richest person in the world  according to bloomberg news  bezos also owns the washington post  a newspaper trump has repeatedly railed against in his criticisms of the news media  in tweets over the past year  trump has said the  amazon washington post  fabricated stories  he has said amazon does not pay sales tax  which is not true  and so hurts other retailers  part of a pattern by the former businessman and reality television host of periodically turning his ire on big american companies since he took office in january  daniel ives  a research analyst at gbh insights  said trump s comment could be taken as a warning to the retail giant  however  he said he was not concerned for amazon   we do not see any price hikes in the future  however  that is a risk that amazon is clearly aware of and  it  is building out its distribution  system  aggressively   he said  amazon has shown interest in the past in shifting into its own delivery service  including testing drones for deliveries  in   the company spent    billion on shipping   percent of its total operating expenses that year   amazon shares were down   percent to     by early afternoon  overall  u s  stock prices were down slightly on friday   satish jindel  president of shipmatrix inc  which analyzes shipping data  disputed the idea that the postal service charges less than united parcel service inc  ups n  and fedex corp  fdx n   the other biggest players in the parcel delivery business in the united states  many customers get lower rates from ups and fedex than they would get from the post office for comparable services  he said  the postal service delivers about  percent of amazon packages  for about   to  million a day during the current peak year end holiday shipping season  jindel said  the seattle based company and the post office have an agreement in which mail carriers take amazon packages on the last leg of their journeys  from post offices to customers  doorsteps  amazon s no   carrier is ups  at  percent  and fedex is third  with  percent or so  according to jindel  trump s comment tapped into a debate over whether postal service pricing has kept pace with the rise of e commerce  which has flooded the mail with small packages private companies like ups have long claimed the current system unfairly undercuts their business  steve gaut  a spokesman for ups  noted that the company values its  productive relationship  with the postal service  but that it has filed with the postal regulatory commission its concerns about the postal service s methods for covering costs  representatives for amazon  the white house  the u s  postal service and fedex declined comment or were not immediately available for comment on trump s tweet  according to its annual report  the postal service lost    billion this year  and its deficit has ballooned to    billion   while the postal service s revenue for first class mail  marketing mail and periodicals is flat or declining  revenue from package delivery is up  percent since  to    billion in the fiscal year ended sept      but it also lost about   billion in revenue when a temporary surcharge expired in april   according to a government accountability office report in february  the service is facing growing personnel expenses  particularly    billion in unfunded pension and benefits liabilities  the postal service has not announced any plans to cut costs  by law  the postal service has to set prices for package delivery to cover the costs attributable to that service  but the postal service allocates only   percent of its total costs to its business of shipping packages even though that line of business is  percent of its total revenue
