washington  reuters    donald trump s supreme court nominee could help decide the fate of his moves to undo climate related u s  regulations  but legal experts said neil gorsuch s judicial record makes it hard to predict whether as a justice he would back a sweeping rollback  if confirmed to the lifetime job by the senate  the colorado based federal appeals court judge would restore the court s   conservative majority  the senate is planning an april  confirmation vote although many democrats are fighting to block gorsuch  on the court  gorsuch could become a pivotal vote on the republican president s deregulation agenda  along with fellow conservative anthony kennedy  who sometimes joins the court s four liberals in close cases  that agenda includes trump s effort to kill democratic former president barack obama s so called clean power plan  blocked by the high court last year  aimed at reducing climate warming carbon emissions from mainly coal fired power plants  trump on tuesday signed an executive order kicking off a lengthy review process that environmental groups and democratic governed u s  states have promised to challenge in court  gorsuch s views on issues related to climate change are unclear  his mother headed the u s  environmental protection agency under republican former president ronald reagan for two years in the   gorsuch was not asked about climate issues during his senate judiciary committee confirmation hearing last week  in his  years as a judge  the only major ruling touching upon climate policy came in  when he was on a three judge panel that upheld a colorado measure requiring power generators to ensure a fifth of their electricity came from renewable sources  a  case on federal agency power is potentially more instructive on how he might approach broad moves to slash current regulation  according to experts  in that case  gorsuch questioned a  supreme court precedent giving federal agencies broad deference to interpret laws  gorsuch called the doctrine  enshrined in the chevron v  natural resource defense council ruling  an  elephant in the room  that concentrates federal power  in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the constitution   questions remain over how that approach would manifest itself if applied to efforts by trump s epa to weaken or rescind existing agency regulations on fighting climate change  some environmental lawyers say it could mean gorsuch would be skeptical of any big changes at the agency level  the epa under obama compiled detailed scientific data to support its efforts to curb carbon emissions   that could hamper the trump administration   said jonathan adler  a conservative law professor at case western reserve university school of law in cleveland  sean donahue  a lawyer who represents environmental groups  agreed  saying if the epa were to  advance fancy interpretive footwork to try to make greenhouse gases not a clean air act pollutant   the administration may not get the deference it wants  the extent to which the u s  clean air act  the law that tackles air pollution  applies to carbon emissions is heavily contested in the courts  the supreme court  in the landmark  decision massachusetts v  epa  held that carbon is a pollutant that could be subject to regulation under the law  in a  case  the court largely upheld the obama administration s first batch of greenhouse gas regulations  environmental groups including the sierra club have said they are ready to pounce if they see signs that trump s epa  headed by fossil fuels industry ally scott pruitt  is ignoring science in making climate related regulatory changes   i think the bottom line is that we hope any anti regulatory rule making should be so unscientific     almost any federal judge should see through the trump administration maneuvering   said pat gallagher  a sierra club lawyer
