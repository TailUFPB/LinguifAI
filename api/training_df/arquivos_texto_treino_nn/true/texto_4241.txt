 reuters    the trump administration on friday dropped a lawsuit accusing north carolina of discriminating against lgbt residents after the state replaced its  bathroom bill   although a key civil liberties group vowed to keep fighting the new law in court  in a two sentence court filing the justice department said it had dropped its lawsuit  filed last year by the obama administration  because the north carolina legislature had replaced it with a new law called house bill   the filing marks the first significant move in a complicated legal battle challenging the state s nondiscrimination laws since the replacement of the original law  known as house bill  or more commonly as the  bathroom bill   house bill  s most controversial provision was the requirement that in state run buildings transgender people use the bathrooms  changing rooms and showers that corresponded to the sex on their birth certificates rather than their gender identity  a number of businesses and sports leagues boycotted north carolina because they saw the year old law as discriminatory against the lesbian  gay  bisexual  and transgender  lgbt  community  civil liberties groups also protested the move  the american civil liberties union  the aclu of north carolina  and lambda legal filed a lawsuit challenging the law in march of last year  that was followed in may by the justice department s own suit against house bill   james esseks  the aclu s lgbt project director said the new law is flawed because it keeps a ban on cities and counties from creating their own nondiscriminatory ordinaces until  and relegates to the state legislature the power to regulate bathroom access  the legislature has purposefully not taken any action to define access  he said  house bill   leaves transgender people in limbo and that s intentional   esseks said   this does not fix the problem  it creates confusion   esseks said his group planned to amend their lawsuit soon to challenge the new bill
