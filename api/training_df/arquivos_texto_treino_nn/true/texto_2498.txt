boston  reuters    a ruling by massachusetts  top court could influence other state courts to rule that police cannot detain illegal immigrants solely to give federal authorities time to take them into custody  state attorney general maura healey said on wednesday  healey  a democrat who has been part of a loose coalition of state officials mounting court challenges to president donald trump s administration  said the monday ruling on civil immigration detainer requests  the first to cover a full state  showed the power of state level challenges   we may see in other courts efforts to draw from that   healey said in a interview in her office   in this age of some really adverse actions and a lot of fear mongering  frankly  by donald trump and  u s  attorney general  jeff sessions and others  it is important to make clear what the law here is and that no one is above the law   the trump administration has stepped up immigration enforcement  threatening to deport the estimated  million people who have entered the country illegally  contending they raise crime rates and drain government resources  the federal immigration and customs enforcement agency has asked local police and courts to hold illegal immigrants who enter the justice system for up to  hours after their cases conclude to allow them to be taken into custody  massachusetts  supreme judicial court ruled that because the detainer requests are civil  rather than criminal  the detentions amount to unconstitutional arrests  ice said it was determining what next steps it might take after the ruling  saying it  weakens local law enforcement agencies  ability to protect their communities   healey said her office is preparing instructions for court officials and local law enforcement on responding to the detainer requests  she dismissed the idea that the decision endangered public safety  saying the state continues to hold illegal immigrants who are wanted for criminal proceedings  keeping up federal focus on the issue  sessions said on tuesday the justice department would block federal grants to sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with immigration agents  including detainer requests  healey said the move would not change state policy   it s wrong  it s unlawful and we ll see them in court if they intend to proceed on this front   she said   this reflects a callous disregard for the rule of law and for governance and for what it takes to run our cities our states and indeed our country
