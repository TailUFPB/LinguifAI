trump s son in law and a top white house adviser  in december   a u s  senate committee investigating suspected russian interference in the election wants to interview trump associates  including kushner    who is married to trump s daughter ivanka trump and has agreed to testify   kushner previously acknowledged meeting the russian ambassador to washington last december and only on monday did it emerge that executives of russian state development bank vnesheconombank  veb  had talks with kushner during a bank roadshow last year   the bank said in an emailed statement that as part of its preparing a new strategy  its executives met representatives of financial institutes in europe  asia and america   it said roadshow meetings took place  with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the united states  including jared kushner  the head of kushner companies   veb declined to say where the meetings took place or the dates   there was no immediate comment from kushner   allegations by u s  intelligence agencies that russian actors were behind hacking of senior democratic party operatives and spreading disinformation linger over trump s young presidency  democrats charge the russians wanted to tilt the election toward the republican  a claim dismissed by trump  russia denies the allegations   more from reuters    breakingviews tv  kushner s business    poll shows macron win in french election     u s  shale enlists genetics to boost output but there has been no doubt that the russian ambassador to the united states  sergei kislyak  developed contacts among the trump team  trump s first national security adviser  michael flynn  was forced to resign on feb   after revelations that he had discussed u s  sanctions on russia with kislyak and misled vice president mike pence about the conversations   u s  officials said that after meeting with russian kislyak at trump tower last december  a meeting also attended by flynn  kushner met later in december with sergei gorkov  chairman of vnesheconombank   white house spokeswoman hope hicks confirmed the meetings  saying nothing of consequence was discussed   gorkov was appointed head of veb in early  by russian president vladimir putin  he graduated from the federal security service  or fsb  russia s internal security agency  he was awarded the medal of the order of merit for services to the fatherland  according to the bank s website   according to two congressional staffers  some senate investigators want to question kushner and flynn about whether they discussed with gorkov or other russian officials or financial executives the possibility of investing in  fifth avenue in new york or other kushner co or trump properties if the new administration lifted the sanctions   veb  aside from being under sanctions  has been grappling with bad debt after financing politically expedient projects such as construction for the sochi winter olympics   it received  billion rubles     billion  in support from the russian budget in   when its senior management was sacked and replaced by a team of executives from russia s biggest lender sberbank   in an article posted on dec    forbes estimated that jared kushner  his brother josh and his parents  charles and seryl  have a fortune of at least    billion  more than half of which forbes estimates is held in real estate   forbes did not provide a specific estimate for jared kushner s net worth on his own   on monday  white house spokesman sean spicer told reporters that kushner is willing to testify to the senate intelligence committee chaired by u s  senator richard burr  a north carolina republican    throughout the campaign and the transition  jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials     and so  given this role  he volunteered to speak with chairman burr s committee   spicer told reporters at his daily briefing   the republican and democratic leaders of the senate panel also said kushner had agreed to be interviewed but no date had yet been scheduled   simply meeting with representatives of a u s  sanctioned entity is not a violation of sanctions or against the law   evgeny buryakov    a russian citizen who worked at vnesheconombank and whom u s  authorities accused of posing as a banker while participating in a new york spy ring  pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge in march   buryakov admitted in federal court in manhattan to acting as an agent for the russian government without notifying u s  authorities   he was prosecuted by the office of the u s  attorney in manhattan under preet bharara  who was among several chief prosecutors fired or asked to resign earlier this month by the new administration   also on monday  a mystery rooted in trump s claim that he was wiretapped by then president barack obama during the election campaign deepened with the disclosure that a top congressional republican reviewed classified information on the white house grounds about potential surveillance of some trump campaign associates   u s  representative devin nunes  chairman of the house of representatives intelligence committee  visited the white house the night before he announced on wednesday that he had information that indicated some trump associates may have been subjected to some level of intelligence activity before trump took office on jan     democrats have said nunes  who was a member of trump s transition team  can no longer run a credible investigation of russian hacking  the u s  election and any potential involvement by trump associates   house democratic leader nancy pelosi and adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  have urged nunes to recuse himself from the russia probe   nunes told cnn on monday that he went to the white house grounds because the intelligence information was not available to congress  he said he did not meet with trump or his aides at that time and did not coordinate the release of information with the trump administration   nunes spokesman jack langer said in a statement that nunes  met with his source at the white house grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source    white house spokesman spicer did not shed any light on who at the white house helped nunes gain access to a secure location   it was the latest twist in a saga that began on march  when trump said on twitter without providing evidence that he  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory    fbi director james comey told congress last monday he had seen no evidence to support the claim    this version of the story corrects paragraph  to show that meeting was in december  not during  presidential campaign  paragraph  has also been corrected to show buryakov pleaded guilty in march   not friday
