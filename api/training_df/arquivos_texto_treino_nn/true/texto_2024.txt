washington  reuters    president donald trump picked a new fight on thursday with his fellow republicans  saying congressional leaders could have avoided a  mess  over raising the u s  debt ceiling if they had taken his advice  in the latest in a stream of criticisms that could undermine his aims to cut taxes  pass a budget and rebuild infrastructure  trump sought to blame party leaders if congress fails to agree to raise the cap on how much the federal government may borrow  the treasury department has said the ceiling must be raised by sept    if not  the government would be unable to borrow more money or pay its bills  including its debt payments  that could hurt the united states  credit rating  cause financial turmoil  harm the u s  economy and possibly trigger a recession  trump said he had advised republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house of representatives speaker paul ryan to link passage of legislation raising the debt ceiling to a bill on veterans affairs that he signed into law on aug      they     didn t do it so now we have a big deal with dems holding them up  as usual  on debt ceiling approval  could have been so easy now a mess   trump said in twitter posts  recent media reports suggest that trump s relationship with mcconnell has deteriorated amid repeated attacks by trump on the republican senate majority leader for  among other things  failing to get a healthcare bill passed  the new york times reported on tuesday that mcconnell and trump were locked in a political  cold war   especially after an aug   phone call that it said devolved into a shouting match  on the  and the  trump assailed mcconnell via twitter  angered by a speech in which mcconnell said trump had  excessive expectations  of congress  trump s salvo ran counter to efforts this week by the white house and mcconnell s office to play down reports of discord  a spokesman for mcconnell noted the senate majority leader had said earlier this week  in an appearance with treasury secretary steven mnuchin  that the debt ceiling would be raised   mcconnell was  unequivocal  about it  said spokesman don stewart  he said mcconnell mentioned it again on wednesday in a statement the senate leader issued about his  shared goals  with trump  ryan  speaking at a town hall meeting on tax reform at a boeing plant in washington state  also said congress would pass legislation to raise the ceiling in time to ensure debt payment  white house spokeswoman sarah sanders denied there was any need to repair ties between trump and top republican lawmakers   i think the relationships are fine   she told reporters   certainly there are going to be some policy differences  but there are also a lot of shared goals and that s what we re focused on   raising the debt ceiling is one of the must pass measures congress will take up when it returns on sept    congress will have about  working days from its return to approve spending measures to keep the government open  while the budget and debt cap are separate  they are likely to become entangled  with republican opponents of a debt ceiling increase expected to demand federal spending cuts  trump threatened on tuesday to shut down the government if congress failed to secure funding for his long promised wall along the u s  mexican border  his threat added a new wrinkle to the republicans  months long struggle to reach a budget deal  rattling markets and drawing rebukes from some republicans  democrats  solidly opposed to funding the wall  have slammed trump over his comments  both the spending and debt ceiling bills could pass the republican led house by a simple majority vote  but will need  votes to pass the senate  where republicans hold  of  seats  meaning they will need some democratic support  a respected think tank said in a report on thursday the  government might not have enough money to pay all its bills on oct   if washington does not raise the debt cap  the treasury  might not have enough money on that day to make a roughly   billion payment that will be due to a military retirement fund  according to the bipartisan policy center  moody s investors service said it would consider stripping the united states of its top notch rating in the event of a default but not over late or skipped payments on non debt obligations if the government ran short of funds  the warning about a possible u s  downgrade seemed less dire and narrower in scope than one issued on wednesday by fitch ratings  trump has often expressed frustration that congress has not passed significant legislation since he took office in january  particularly its failure to pass a bill to replace democratic former president barack obama s healthcare law   something that trump had promised to accomplish   the only problem i have with mitch mcconnell is that  after hearing repeal   replace for  years  he failed  that should never have happened   trump said in a tweet on thursday  echoing criticisms he made earlier this month  mcconnell offered muted criticism of trump on thursday  saying he was  a little concerned about some of the trade rhetoric  by the president  who has repeatedly condemned trade deals he believes are bad for the united states  and by others   trade is a winner for america   mcconnell told kentucky farmers and lawmakers   the assumption that every free trade agreement is a loser for america is largely untrue
