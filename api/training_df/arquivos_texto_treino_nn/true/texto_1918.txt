washington  reuters    u s  treasury secretary steven mnuchin on sunday put pressure on congress to increase the government s debt limit by arguing that relief funding for hurricane ravaged areas of texas might be delayed if lawmakers do not act quickly    without raising the debt limit  i am not comfortable that we will get money to texas this month to rebuild   mnuchin said on fox news sunday  u s  president donald trump has requested nearly   billion for initial relief for areas hit by hurricane harvey   the united states is on track to hit its mandated debt limit by the end of the month unless congress moves to increase it   senator roy blunt  a junior member of the senate s republican leadership  said it was possible lawmakers could tie legislation raising the u s  debt ceiling   an unpopular step among some republican conservatives   to legislation providing financial aid for recovery from harvey   that s one way to do it   blunt said on nbc s  meet the press   congressional leaders would have to look at whether the votes are there  he said  congress returns this week from a month long vacation  and one of the first measures it is expected to consider is the     billion trump has requested so far for harvey aid  texas governor greg abbott on sunday estimated damage from hurricane harvey at   billion to   billion  calling it more costly than epic storms katrina or sandy and fueling the debate over how to pay for the disaster    the u s  government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from washington spending more than it collects in taxes  only congress can raise that limit  and financial firms have been worried that congress may fail to reach a deal to do so  some conservatives want to link spending reforms to a debt ceiling hike  democrats said there should be bipartisan talks on how to handle the debt ceiling and government spending bills   providing aid in the wake of harvey and raising the debt ceiling are both important issues  and democrats want to work to do both  given the interplay between all the issues congress must tackle in september  democrats and republicans must discuss all the issues together and come up with a bipartisan consensus   house democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer said in a joint statement  blunt  on nbc  said hurricane harvey has created  another reason as to why you d want to keep the government open  by passing legislation to fund the government this month
