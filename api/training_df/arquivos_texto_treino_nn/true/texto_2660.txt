washington  reuters    the republican led u s  house of representatives took a new step toward tax reform legislation on wednesday by approving a fiscal  budget resolution that would allow the senate to pass a sweeping tax code overhaul without democratic support  the house budget committee voted   along party lines to send the measure to the floor of the house for consideration by the full chamber  a day after the   trillion spending blueprint was unveiled   but it was not clear how the measure would fare in the full house  where it could become embroiled in republican infighting between conservatives and moderates similar to the political tug of war that caused healthcare legislation to disintegrate in the senate this week   both the house and senate must approve a budget agreement to unlock a legislative tool called reconciliation  which would allow republicans to pass tax legislation with a simple majority in the senate  republicans control the chamber by only a   margin  democrats oppose the republican budget and republican plans for a tax reform bill that is likely to offer steep tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy  the house budget resolution would combine tax cuts in the same legislation as   billion in spending cuts to mandatory programs including food assistance for the poor  enough republican conservatives to prevent its passage already oppose the plan  because they believe it does not go far enough to cut spending  but republican moderates are against larger cuts  some house conservatives also want to see a republican tax reform plan before supporting a budget that would facilitate its passage  the trump administration and republican leaders in congress are not expected to unveil a tax plan until september      the budget resolution would also bundle a partial repeal of the  dodd frank wall street reform law into the same legislation as taxes and spending cuts
