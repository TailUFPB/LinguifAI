berlin  reuters    iran s foreign minister criticized on tuesday a decision by the u s  supreme court to revive part of president donald trump s travel ban imposed on citizens from six majority muslim countries  saying it would boost militants in the middle east  the justices narrowed the scope of lower court rulings that had completely blocked key parts of a march  executive order that trump had said was needed to prevent terrorism attacks  allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the united states    we always believed that the muslim ban that president trump imposed soon after assuming office had no basis in facts and would not help fight terrorism   iran s mohammad javad zarif told a joint news conference in berlin with his german counterpart  zarif called the u s  decision the  greatest gift  for militant groups seeking new recruits  separately  zarif tweeted   a bigoted ban on muslims will not keep us safer  instead of policies empowering extremists  us should join the real fight against them   zarif said the travel ban punished people who had never been convicted of a terrorist act  while people from other countries involved in past attacks would not be affected   for some terrorism and support for terrorism is measured by the amount of arms they buy from the u s  and not by actually being involved in acts of terrorism   he said  in an apparent reference to recent u s  approval of   billion in arms sales to saudi arabia  saudi citizens are not affected by the travel ban  zarif did not mention saudi arabia by name but the ultra conservative sunni muslim kingdom is the arch foe of shi ite iran in the region
