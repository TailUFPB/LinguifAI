brussels  reuters    he still has a chance for missteps  but so far on his maiden international trip  donald trump has managed to avoid major stumbles and has stuck to the script in a way his advisers have wanted him to do for months      the u s  president s rare display of discipline is in part a result of a desperate need for some smooth sailing  he began the trip in scandal mode  accused of impeding justice by firing former federal bureau of investigation director james comey for not stopping a federal probe into his campaign s russia ties       whether it will hold is unclear  he is in a portion of his nine day trip  in brussels for a nato summit and later in sicily for a group of seven conclave  where he will meet with european leaders who are at sharp odds with him on many issues      trump s change comes after increasingly loud alarm bells sounded from republican congressional leaders  who say he must tamp down the tirades and tantrums that have contributed to a dismal public approval rating of about  percent   just in the past month alone  trump used twitter to issue a veiled threat to comey  warning that he  better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   and when he fired comey  white house aides said the move was based on a justice department recommendation that said comey had mishandled the investigation into democrat hillary clinton s handling of classified information last year  trump blew up that reason the next day  saying he had already decided to fire comey when the justice recommendation came in because the fbi man was a  showboat   trump s advisers planned the overseas journey trip in such a way as to keep the president busy with back to back meetings and appearances  this has given him little time for tweet storms and cable news watching  it sometimes has left him fatigued  as manifested when he canceled an evening forum with young people in riyadh      as they normally do when he travels  staff members have managed to provide him with some creature comforts  like keeping bags of potato chips at easy reach      the president has limited his interactions with reporters  taking few questions  as a result  the russia issue came up only once   during a meeting with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu       initial plans for an end of the trip news conference in sicily have been set aside  meaning there are fewer chances for him to veer off script  but less opportunity to promote his achievements  when trump has talked to the news media  his responses to questions have been fairly brief and non substantive  asked about his meeting with pope francis on wednesday at the vatican  trump kept it simple despite the differences between him and francis on issues like climate change       great   we had a fantastic meeting   we are liking italy very much  and it was an honor to meet with the pope   trump said     he has also reined in some of his hyperbole  after boasting earlier this year that finding a peace agreement between the israelis and palestinians should not be all that hard  trump acknowledged that maybe it would be hard after all        i ve heard it s one of the toughest deals of all   he said   but i have a feeling we re going to get there eventually  i hope       aides said most every word spoken was written carefully with some thought of the message that would be sent  most speeches were performed with a teleprompter to keep trump from drifting off into his own ad libs       he understands that even the slightest phrasing can have big implications   said a senior white house official   he s worked really hard on being directly involved in the preparation       secretary of state rex tillerson told reporters that behind the scenes  trump has been calibrating his style to fit the leader who he is meeting and the urgency of the issue he is discussing       he tends to dial the urgency up and therefore the style dials up   tillerson  noting that when talking to israeli and palestinian leaders   he was very energized because he does feel there s a certain sense of urgency for these parties to finally get on with it   trump has been on script before only to lapse  privately  aides realize this could happen again       he is who he is   one aide said   he s definitely someone who speaks his mind       trump has found himself on this trip increasingly reliant on a core group of his inner circle  son in law jared kushner  a top white house adviser  daughter ivanka  who is kushner s wife  secretary of state rex tillerson  economic adviser gary cohn  national security adviser h r  mcmaster and deputy national security adviser for strategy  dina powell      the more disciplined trump was a victory for kushner  who organized the trip around some specific objectives  such as a   billion arms deal for saudi arabia and trump s visit to holy sites in israel  including his visit to the western wall  a first for a u s  president        we re very focused on the substance of the actions and then ultimately on delivering results   said a senior administration official
