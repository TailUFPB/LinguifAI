 reuters    a group of states renewed their effort on monday to block president donald trump s revised temporary ban on refugees and travelers from several muslim majority countries  arguing that his executive order is the same as the first one that was halted by federal courts  court papers filed by the state of washington and joined by california  maryland  massachusetts  new york and oregon asked a judge to stop the march  order from taking effect on thursday  an amended complaint said the order was similar to the original jan   directive because it  will cause severe and immediate harms to the states  including our residents  our colleges and universities  our healthcare providers  and our businesses   a department of justice spokeswoman said it was reviewing the complaint and would respond to the court   a more sweeping ban implemented hastily in january caused chaos and protests at airports  the march order by contrast gave  days  notice to travelers and immigration officials  last month  u s  district judge james robart in seattle halted the first travel ban after washington state sued  claiming the order was discriminatory and violated the u s  constitution  robart s order was upheld by the  u s  circuit court of appeals  trump revised his order to overcome some of the legal hurdles by including exemptions for legal permanent residents and existing visa holders and taking iraq off the list of countries covered  the new order still halts citizens of iran  libya  syria  somalia  sudan and yemen from entering the united states for  days but has explicit waivers for various categories of immigrants with ties to the country  refugees are still barred for  days  but the new order removed an indefinite ban on all refugees from syria  washington state has now gone back to robart to ask him to apply his emergency halt to the new ban    robart said in a court order monday that the government has until tuesday to respond to the states  motions  he said he would not hold a hearing before wednesday and did not commit to a specific date to hear arguments from both sides    separately  hawaii has also sued over the new ban  the island state  which is heavily dependent on tourism  said the executive order has had a  chilling effect  on travel revenues  in response to hawaii s lawsuit  the department of justice in court papers filed on monday said the president has broad authority to  restrict or suspend entry of any class of aliens when in the national interest   the department said the temporary suspensions will allow a review of the current screening process in an effort to protect against terrorist attacks  there is a hearing in the hawaii case set for wednesday  the day before the new ban is set to go into effect   the first hurdle for the lawsuits will be proving  standing   which means finding someone who has been harmed by the policy  with so many exemptions  legal experts have said it might be hard to find individuals who would have a right to sue  in the eyes of a court  to overcome this challenge  the states filed more than  declarations of people affected by the order including tech businesses amazon and expedia  which said that restricting travel hurts their revenues and their ability to recruit employees   universities and medical centers that rely on foreign doctors also weighed in  as did religious organizations and individual residents  including u s  citizens  with stories about separated families  but the trump administration in its filings in the hawaii case on monday said the carve outs in the new order undercut the state s standing claims   the order applies only to individuals outside the country who do not have a current visa  and even as to them  it sets forth robust waiver provisions   the department of justice s motion said   the government cited supreme court precedent in arguing that people outside the united states and seeking admission for the first time have  no constitutional rights  regarding their applications  if the courts do end up ruling the states have standing to sue  the next step will be to argue that both versions of the executive order discriminate against muslims    the trump administration may have changed the text of the now discredited muslim travel ban  but they didn t change its unconstitutional intent and effect   california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement on monday  while the text of the order does not mention islam  the states claim that the motivation behind the policy is trump s campaign promise of  a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   he later toned down that language and said he would implement a policy of  extreme vetting  of foreigners coming to the united states  the government said the courts should only look at the text of the order and not at outside comments by trump or his aides
