beijing washington  reuters    beijing sought to play down tensions with the united states and put on a positive face on friday as the u s  administration slammed china on a range of business issues ahead of president xi jinping s first meeting with president donald trump  trump set the tone for what could be a tense meeting at his mar a lago retreat next week by tweeting on thursday that the united states could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses  trump said the highly anticipated meeting  which is also expected to cover differences over north korea and china s strategic ambitions in the south china sea   will be a very difficult one   ahead of the meeting  trump signed executive orders on friday aimed at identifying abuses that are causing massive u s  trade deficits and clamping down on non payment of anti dumping and anti subsidy duties on imports  his top trade officials said  separately  the u s  trade representative s office  which is controlled by the white house  said beijing s industrial policies and financial support for industries such as steel and aluminum have resulted in over production and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets and undermined competitive companies  seeking to downplay the rift  chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang reiterated a desire for cooperation on trade   with regard to the problems existing between china and the united states in trade relations  both sides should in a mutual respectful and mutual beneficial way find appropriate resolutions  and ensure the stable development of sino u s  trade relations   he told a daily news briefing   the leaders of the world s two largest economies are scheduled to meet next thursday and friday for the first time since trump assumed office on jan    white house spokesman sean spicer said the united states has  serious concerns  on the u s  trade relationship with china   this isn t a sit around and play patty cake kind of conversation   he told reporters   they re big issues   trump  wants to have a very good and respectful and healthy relationship  but he also wants to make sure that he tackles the challenges and the problems that are facing american workers   spicer said  speaking earlier at a briefing on the xi trump meeting  chinese vice foreign minister zheng zeguang acknowledged the trade imbalance  but said it was mostly due to differences in their two economic structures and noted that china had a trade deficit in services   china does not deliberately seek a trade surplus  we also have no intention of carrying out competitive currency devaluation to stimulate exports  this is not our policy   zheng said  state news agency xinhua also struck a conciliatory tone   of course  it would be naive to believe that the two sides can bridge their differences in a single diplomatic meeting   it said in an english language commentary on friday    yet as long as the two nations can maintain their good faith  which they have shown recently  to talk and to make concessions based on mutual respect  then no difference would be too difficult to iron out   trump has frequently accused china of keeping its yuan currency artificially low against the dollar to make chinese exports cheaper  and  stealing  american manufacturing jobs  the yuan fell   percent last year in its biggest annual loss against the dollar since   knocked by pressure from sluggish economic growth and a broadly strong u s  currency  trump has resisted acting on a campaign promise to declare china a currency manipulator on his first day in office  but tensions have persisted over how his administration s china policy would evolve  while apprehensive about a trade war  the american business community in china has grown more vocal  fear of retaliation had once made business lobbies eschew more forceful u s  trade policies toward china  but such groups have increasingly urged the trump administration to take targeted action to address market access imbalances  zheng said domestic consumption in china will increase as it pursues economic reforms  helping to raise demand for foreign goods and services  including those from the united states   this also helps ameliorate the trade imbalance between china and the united states   he said  the trade imbalance could be resolved by improved  cooperation  zheng said  urging washington to lift restrictions on civilian technology exports to china and create better conditions for chinese investment in the united states   the ustr report  however  accused china of using a range of measures to engineer the transfer of foreign technology to local firms  it said these include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign owned intellectual property or that do not conduct research or make products in china  the report also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies  books  music  video games and software in china as well as a ban on u s  beef that has been in place since
