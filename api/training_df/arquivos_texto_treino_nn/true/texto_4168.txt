washington  reuters    the head of the u s  house of representatives  banking panel has unveiled the republicans  most ambitious plan so far to loosen financial regulations  a  page bill to replace the dodd frank financial reform law  representative jeb hensarling  who chairs the house financial services committee  also set an april  hearing to discuss replacing the  law   bit ly    republicans are eager to work with the president to end and replace the dodd frank mistake with the financial choice act because it holds wall street and washington accountable  ends taxpayer funded bank bailouts  and unleashes america s economic potential   the texas republican said in a statement  the blueprint of hensarling s bill has been known for some time  he first introduced a similar measure in   where it passed his committee but was not considered by the full house  representative maxine waters  the top democrat on the committee  has dismissed hensarling s bill   the new version  which is even worse than chairman hensarling s first draft  cannot be allowed to become law  there is too much at stake for consumers and for our economy at large   she said in a statement earlier this month  the  dodd frank law established strict rules on the financial sector to prevent a repeat of the  financial crisis  republicans like hensarling  as well as president donald trump  believe the regulations put an undue burden on businesses and have held back the economy by restricting lending  but hensarling s ambitious approach  which would eliminate huge portions of dodd frank  faces an uncertain political future beyond the house  at least eight democrats would need to support a financial reform bill in the senate for it to pass  and the major changes proposed by hensarling are not expected by industry experts to garner that type of support  instead  the senate is expected to take a slower  piecemeal approach to revisiting financial rules  with a focus on changes that could garner bipartisan support  hensarling s bill would make a host of changes to financial rules in the united states  for example  banks could significantly increase the amount of capital they hold  and in turn no longer have to adhere to a host of existing dodd frank rules  hensarling s bill also severely restricts the power of the consumer financial protection bureau  while bringing it under much stricter oversight by congress  the measure is likely to be met with strict opposition by democrats in congress
