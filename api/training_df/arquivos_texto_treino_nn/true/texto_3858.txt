 washington  reuters    u s  president donald trump ignited a political firestorm on tuesday by firing fbi director james comey  who had been leading an investigation into the trump  presidential campaign s possible collusion with russia to influence the election outcome   read the latest on the comey firingdefending firing of fbi director  trump derides democratic criticssenate republican leader opposed new russia investigationthe republican president said he fired comey  the top u s  law enforcement official  over his handling of an election year email scandal involving then democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton   the move stunned washington and raised suspicions among democrats and others that the white house was trying to blunt the fbi probe involving russia   some democrats compared trump s move to the  saturday night massacre  of   in which president richard nixon fired an independent special prosecutor investigating the watergate scandal   white house officials denied allegations that there was any political motive in the move by trump  who took office on jan     senate democratic leader chuck schumer said he spoke to trump and told him he was  making a very big mistake  in firing comey  adding the president did not  really answer  in response   an independent investigation into moscow s role in the election  is now the only way to go to restore the american people s faith   schumer said   though many democrats have criticized comey s handling of the clinton email probe  they said they were troubled by the timing of trump s firing of him   senator richard burr  the republican chairman of the senate intelligence committee  which is overseeing its own investigation into russian interference during the election  said in a statement he was also troubled by the timing of comey s termination    his dismissal  i believe  is a loss for the bureau and the nation   burr said   u s  intelligence agencies concluded in a january report that russian president vladimir putin had ordered an effort to disrupt the  election  with the aim of helping trump   cnn reported on tuesday night that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury subpoenas to former trump national security adviser michael flynn  seeking business records  as part of the probe into russian interference in the election   trump s firing of comey came a day after former acting attorney general sally yates told a senate panel that she had informed the white house on jan   that flynn was at risk of blackmail by moscow because he had been untruthful about his discussions with the russian ambassador  sergei kislyak  trump fired flynn  days later   russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election and the trump administration denies allegations of collusion with russia   trump  in a letter to comey released by the white house  said   it is essential that we find new leadership for the fbi that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission    the president told comey in the letter that he accepted the recommendation of attorney general jeff sessions that he could no longer provide effective leadership  comey s term was to run through september   he was appointed director by democratic president barack obama in    sessions advised trump s campaign before being picked by the president to lead the justice department  sessions had recused himself from involvement in the russia investigation  after he misstated his own  contacts with russia s ambassador to washington   comey s deputy  andrew mccabe  became acting fbi director  the white house said the search for a new permanent director would begin immediately   pushing back against critics of the move  white house officials said deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  a career prosecutor who took office on april   assessed the situation at the fbi and concluded that comey had lost his confidence   rosenstein sent his recommendation to sessions  who concurred and they forwarded their recommendation to trump  who accepted it on tuesday  they said   the white house released a memo in which rosenstein wrote   i cannot defend the director s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of secretary clinton s emails  and i do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken    rosenstein cited several former justice department officials  comments criticizing comey s handling of the clinton email investigation  including his public statements   but one of those he cited  donald ayer  a former deputy attorney general under president h w  bush  questioned the purported reasons for the firing  reached by reuters  ayer said in an email that the administration s explanation was  a sham    comey was traveling in los angeles when the news broke that he had been fired   in an odd twist  a white house official said the letter firing him was delivered to the fbi by keith schiller  trump s longtime armed personal bodyguard who is now director of oval office operations at the white house   trump  in the letter  said   while i greatly appreciate you informing me  on three separate occasions  that i am not under investigation  i nevertheless concur with the judgment of the department of justice that you are not able to effectively lead the bureau    comey    had been the target of criticism from many quarters for his handling of a probe involving clinton s use of a private email server while she was u s  secretary of state under obama  as recently as tuesday  the fbi clarified remarks that comey made on the matter last week   trump had originally criticized the fbi director for not pursuing criminal charges against clinton last july  but later lavished praise on him   comey had said in july the clinton email case should be closed without prosecution  but then declared    days before the nov   election   that he had reopened the investigation because of a discovery of a new trove of clinton related emails   clinton and other democrats say they believe comey s decision help cost her the election   the firing came as a shock to fbi staff  nearly all of whom had confidence in comey despite the controversy surrounding his handling of the clinton email situation  according to an fbi official who spoke on condition of anonymity   the official said there was concern among agents that the firing was a political act related to the russian investigation   other current and former u s  intelligence and law enforcement officials questioned the white house explanation for comey s firing    trump praised him for the work on the email investigation  so that s not it   said austin berglas  a former fbi supervisory agent on hacking cases   i think he realized the extent of the russia investigation under way and moved him out  to me  that s the only logical explanation right now    trump s dismissal of comey does not mean the fbi s investigation into russia s interference in the u s  presidential election will be disrupted or end   career fbi staffers can continue the probe even as the search for a new fbi director begins  legal experts said   republican representative justin amash wrote on twitter that he and his staff were reviewing the possibility of drafting legislation to create an independent commission to look into the russian campaign meddling   legislation related to the appointment of a special prosecutor or independent counsel has lapsed  but justice department regulations provide for the appointment of a special counsel  which is selected by the attorney general  or acting attorney general in the case of recusal  the experts said
