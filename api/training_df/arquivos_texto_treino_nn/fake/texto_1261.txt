after donald trump pulled the united states out of the paris climate accord  many noted that it was the end of the united states as a superpower now  there s another nail in that coffin  it s increasingly looking like we are also going to pull out of the united nations human rights council  which would mean we would have no influence whatsoever on human rights abusers on tuesday  nikki haley  the u s  ambassador to the united nations  will appear for the first time at the u n  human rights council in geneva  the united states is one of  members of the council   a hard fought privilege   but the trump administration is contemplating pulling out  haley is unlikely to shut the door on the council during her brief visit  but an assessment process underway could lead to that outcome source  foreign policy comthe reason is that the human rights council is supposedly too mean to israel and it s not mean enough to iran  israel does have a pretty atrocious record on human rights abuses and iran has improved since hassan rouhani won the presidency in  still  those two countries are simply cover for trump and his isolationist administration  trump seems to have no issues whatsoever with saudi arabia s human rights abuses  that s because they can help make him richer  we all know trump s allegiance to russia  who according to human rights watch the government in  further tightened control over the already shrinking space for free expression  association  and assembly and intensified persecution of independent critics  parliament adopted laws expanding the power of law enforcement and security agencies  including to control online speech  the parliamentary vote in september resulted in the ruling party  united russia  gaining a constitutional majority in the state duma  the parliament s lower chamber  russia continued to support rebels who commit abuses in eastern ukraine  russia s actions in occupied crimea created a human rights crisis trump and republicans have never been fans of the united nations  neither has putin  last year  coincidentally right before our presidential election   russia lost its seat on the human rights council  mostly because of its support of syrian strongman bashar al assad and his brutal use of chemical weapons on his own people the human rights council is far from perfect  but without being in it  the united states loses its voice and its position as a moral authority  as if trump isn t doing that already   this move would limit our power in the world and it does make one wonder what trump has in mind for our own country s human rights featured image via mark wilson getty images
