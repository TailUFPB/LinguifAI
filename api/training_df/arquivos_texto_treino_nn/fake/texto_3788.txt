the entire nation and world have been worried for months about what the reality of a donald trump presidency might be like  and now that we re finally here it s more terrifying than anything even the most fevered of hellish fantasies could come up with  first  trump insisted during his victory speech that he intended to be the president for all americans  and then he turned right around and appointed a literal white supremacist to be his white house chief strategist  as if that weren t bad enough  it is being reported that anti muslim conspiracy theorist frank gaffney will be named as a national security adviser if you don t know who this guy is  let me clue you in  gaffney believes that president obama is a muslim born in kenya  and regularly peddles this debunked nonsense on his radio show  he also once suggested that the obama administration s missile defense agency logo was proof that the president was trying to usher in sharia law  as if that isn t enough  gaffney also thinks that the muslim brotherhood is somehow roving around in the united states government if there s any indication as to what sort of advice gaffney might give  it s his post election statement to the alt right cesspool that is breitbart news daily  which is that we have to commit to  stopping  designating  rolling up the muslim brotherhood in america as the terrorist organization it is   he went on to say  it s going to be vital to everything else he s trying to do  we ve got to stop taking counsel from them  direction from them  and allowing them to operate in our midst subversively  and that s what s been going on for some fifty years now  the only possibly redeeming quality here is that gaffney worked in the pentagon for a short time when reagan was president  however  that was one hell of a long time ago  and he s been a right wing radio host and leader of the conspiracy minded think tank center for security policy  essentially  he has done nothing but peddle in hate  lies  and nonsense ever since he left the reagan administration  further  the world is a much different and more complex place than it was when reagan was in office  and any advice gaffney might give would be completely obsolete in  in other words  be afraid  america  be very afraid  we have a literal clown car of incompetence about to be running our government  and there s nothing at all we can do about it featured image via scott eisen getty images
