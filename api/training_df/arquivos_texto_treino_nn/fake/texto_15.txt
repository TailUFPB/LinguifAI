donald trump just signed the gop tax scam into law  of course  that meant that he invited all of his craven  cruel gop sycophants down from their perches on capitol hill to celebrate in the rose garden at the white house  now  that part is bad enough   celebrating tax cuts for a bunch of rich hedge fund managers and huge corporations at the expense of everyday americans  of course  trump is beside himself with glee  as this represents his first major legislative win since he started squatting in the white house almost a year ago  thanks to said glee  in true trumpian style  he gave a free wheeling address  and a most curious subject came up as trump was thanking the goons from the hill  somehow  trump veered away from tax cuts  and started talking about the congressional baseball shooting that happened over the summer in that shooting  rep  steve scalise  who is also the house majority whip  was shot and almost lost his life  thanks to this tragic and stunning act of political violence  scalise had a long recovery  in fact he is still in physical therapy  but  of course  vain and looks obsessed trump decided that he would congratulate scalise  not on his survival and on his miraculous recovery  but on the massive amount of weight scalise lost while he was practically dying  and make no mistake   scalise is very lucky to be alive  according to doctors  when he arrived at the hospital  scalise was actually  quote  in  imminent risk of death   here is the quote  via twitter how stunningly tone deaf does one have to be to say something like that  i never thought i d say this about a republican that i  by all reasonable accounts  absolutely loathe  but i feel sorry for him  i am sorry he got shot  and i am even sorrier that he now has to stand there and listen to that orange buffoon talk about him like that i am sure that scalise is a much tougher man than trump  though  i am equally sure that he also knows that trump is an international embarrassment and a crazy man who never should have been allowed anywhere near the white house featured image via alex wong getty images
