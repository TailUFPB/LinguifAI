everybody s gotten used to donald trump contradicting himself  you can almost count on it  really  but with the exception of a few notable misspellings and typos  generally  his tweets that contradict previous tweets don t come on the same day  let alone in the same hour  and a contradictory pair in the span of eleven minutes  maybe he s reprising another guy s role friday morning  trump did just that  he complains all the time  but the two complaints that he tweeted just after   his time just don t go together  first  he says that  democrats  control  the senate because of the filibuster  trump has advocated that the gop use the nuclear option to get rid of the filibuster for some time  but most if not all republicans are hesitant   they know that if they do  the next time voters elect a democratic majority  their opposition will be able to ram through any legislation they like  with nothing to stop them  that s something trump doesn t understand neither party wants if senate republicans don t get rid of the filibuster rule and go to a   majority  few bills will be passed   dems control the senate   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    eleven minutes later  trump came to his senses and realized if he says the gop can t pass bills   and he is the leader of the gop   then he can t keep saying he s passed more bills than a concert promoter on a new york subway  so he went back to that few  if any  administrations have done more in just  months than the trump a  bills passed  regulations killed  border  military  isis  sc   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    d just like to point out the humor in calling his administration  the trump a   we all have the same character limit on twitter  donnie  just leave out  if any  next time  so what could be admin doesn t look like ass but complaining about the democrats in washington keeping him from doing what he wants is quickly becoming one of his favorite topics  there are the hilariously wrong in retrospect messages despite the long delays by the democrats in finally approving dr  tom price  the repeal and replacement of obamacare is moving fast   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    tweets where he can t quite get his cabinet approved as fast as he d like it is so pathetic that the dems have still not approved my full cabinet   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    senate democrats have only confirmed  of  presidential nominees  they can t win so all they do is slow things down   obstruct   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    the ones where everything is the democrats  fault  okay the democrats  without a leader  have become the party of obstruction they are only interested in themselves and not in what s best for u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    obstructionist democrats make security for our country very difficult  they use the courts and associated delay at all times  must stop   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    where are all the superlatives  you know  the best  most amazing  biggest by far in the history of the world tweets about how incredibly  ridiculously huge his successes are  which of course are the most successful of all time well  those are there  too  but i m not going to bore you by re posting a bunch of tweets where trump tries to bannonize the old nine iron  the point is  trump really wants to have it both ways   that he simultaneously is the most bestest at presidenting  and that those dirty demon dog democrats won t let him president properly  he s not even close on the claim that no  a  has done more  he s behind bill clinton in bills passed and signed by about   for this point in his presidency and that s just fine by me featured image via drew angerer getty images
