president elect donald trump is currently trying to drown out all his insecurities after meryl streep absolutely gutted him in her golden globes speech on sunday night  so far  he s spent monday trying to trash steep on twitter  take credit for jobs he didn t create  and now he s trying to hype up his own inauguration  of course  he s failing miserably at all of these   but he just got called out in a major way apparently oblivious to the fact that the whole country knows his inauguration is an embarrassment because no respectable celebrity wants to perform for him  trump told an insane lie about how popular his inauguration was going to be   despite the fact that his parade has been significantly shortened due to its unpopularity  trump actually said that so many people would be attending his inauguration that all the dress shops in washington were sold out  he said in an interview with the new york times  we are going to have an unbelievable  perhaps record setting turnout for the inauguration  and there will be plenty of movie and entertainment stars  all the dress shops are sold out in washington  it s hard to find a great dress for this inauguration  everyone is shocked by this statement   especially the shopkeepers in washington  who actually have tons of evening gowns available  in an amazing fact check by the washington post  vp and manager of friendship heights  neiman marcus store martha slagle was quoted debunking trump s lies  definitely not  you have more than a thousand evening gowns to choose from  slagle also said her store was  stuffed with beautiful gowns  and that other smaller stores  always have dresses  because stores stock up ahead of the inauguration in case there is a high demand  however  there doesn t seem to be   as if this weren t humiliating enough for trump  he s been getting destroyed on twitter for this  and it s absolutely hilarious twittertwittertwittertwittertrump is a pathological liar and psychopath  a lie like this shows that he is truly not fit to be president  featured image via scott olson   getty images
