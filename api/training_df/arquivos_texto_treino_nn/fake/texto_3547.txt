president barack obama knows that president elect donald trump doesn t know what the hell he s doing  and is putting more time in on twitter than actually trying to figure it out and learn the ropes obama has not only agreed to hold trump s little orange hands and remain close to guide him through this transition period  but he s also just made an unprecedented move to save the world from trump and his deadly administration  on monday  our beloved commander in chief released a memo that is basically a  guidebook  on how to use military force   for dummies the document lays out specific details on national security related topics  such as how and when to use military force  this is a major move by obama   and the first time a president has ever had to do this   to prevent a completely unqualified person from destroying everything  the washington post reported  on the eve of a new administration that has promised more aggressive counterterrorism operations  the obama white house has released a lengthy compendium of its own policies governing the use of force the  page document outlines eight years of the administration s legal opinions  executive orders and military directives  in a strong defense of the administration s actions  it lists rules for lethal drones and terrorist detention  and describes the international and domestic law that undergirds them  in the introduction of the guidebook  obama said he d created it to reduce  the risk of an ill considered decision    an obvious observation of trump s lack of emotional stability and impulsive  erratic behavior  and then he wrote something that trump will really hate when he said it was critical to give  as much information as possible to the public so that an informed public can scrutinize our actions and hold us to account  obama is truly amazing for this  it s clear that even though he won t be america s president in a few weeks  he still deeply cares about the future of our country and the world  even on his way out  he s committed to serving the people and minimizing the damage our moronic president elect might do  we re really going to miss him featured image via sean gallup getty images
