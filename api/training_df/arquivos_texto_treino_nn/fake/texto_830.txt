donald trump has been exposed once again  and he s having a full blown meltdown because of it apparently  meeting with russian leader vladimir putin for several hours during the g  summit wasn t enough  because it s just been discovered that trump and putin had another secret meeting  which the trump administration did not disclose to the public once the media reported the secret meeting  which was later confirmed by the white house   trump went into one of his twitter tantrums and cried  fake news   trump claimed that other world leaders had been invited and that the media had been well aware of the meeting trump apparently still doesn t understand that now that he s president of the united states  nothing in his life is private anymore  the president and his administration are expected to be transparent with the american people  and they ve truly incriminated themselves by failing to disclose this meeting  we can all assume that if this news hadn t come out  the trump administration never would have disclosed it trump obviously doesn t think that having  and then hiding  a private meeting with the foreign leader who meddled in his country s election looks shady  it s hilarious that trump referred to these reports as  fake news   only to have his own administration confirm that the meeting took place  even trump himself confirmed it in his tweets by talking about the other people that joined him and putin as trump s meltdown over his russia meeting continues  his focus and attention on negotiating a health care bill with senate republicans will be greatly compromised  this is a great example of why trump hasn t been able to get anything done after several months of being in the white house  it also proves that the more trump denies something  the more it s likely to be true featured image is a screenshot
