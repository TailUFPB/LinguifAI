this morning  president elect made yet another disastrous announcement over twitter  when he send out a tweet that called for the cancellation of the air force one contract  the contract  which was for an update on the presidential plane  was apparently too much money and trump wants to do away with the deal  and as expected  trump s reasoning behind this was riddled with misinformation trump tweeted that he was going to cancel the contract with boeing because of the hefty   billion price tag  however    billion is practically a mysterious  made up number from trump   no one knows where he got that number  according to reports  the air force would only cost    billion for the project  which included several planes  trump is blindly throwing out a number more than twice that amount  for only one plane  trump tweeted  boeing is building a brand new  air force one for future presidents  but costs are out of control  more than   billion  cancel order  twitterof course  trump tweeting falsehoods is hardly a surprise at this point   but he made it worse by addressing the press shortly after his tweet  during his brief moment with the press  one reporter asked trump  sir  you tweeted about canceling the contract about the new air force one  trump gloated and made this ridiculous announcement even worse by saying this  well  the plane is totally out of control  it s going to be over   billion  it s for air force one program  and i think it s ridiculous  then  trump attacked boeing and accused the company of scamming america  obviously  the irony of this is lost on him   he said  i think boeing is doing a little bit of a number  we want boeing to make a lot of money  but not that much money  you can watch the interview below  the insanity of this whole thing is that trump is supposedly cancelling this deal over its large  made up  price tag  but he s thinking nothing of costing tax payers   million per day to pay for the security costs while he stays in the trump tower instead of the white house featured image via maddie mcgarvey   getty images
