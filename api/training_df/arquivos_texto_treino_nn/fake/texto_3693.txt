donald trump is easily the least qualified candidate to run for  and eventually win  the white house  the most dangerous aspect of the fact that he has no government or military experience isn t necessarily the lack of experience itself  but rather his refusal to listen to the people who do have that experience and allow them to guide the ship of state in this dangerous and complicated world until he can be adequately brought up to speed  case in point   his refusal to receive daily national intelligence briefings since his victory according to the hill  trump has been given the green light by the obama administration to receive daily intelligence briefings prior to taking office   the same ones that president obama himself gets  instead  trump has received just two of those briefings since he clinched the electoral victory and thus the presidency  because he is refusing to listen to intelligence officials these briefings include the rapidly changing scope of national security threats on the world stage  something trump is definitely woefully ignorant of  however  being the egotistical scumbag that he is  trump of course seems to believe himself to be above such petty concerns  i never thought i d be saying this  but it seems that trump s vice presidential elect  mike pence  is showing himself to be the reasonable one here  and has taken to receiving the briefings himself  since trump won t  you know we re in deep shit when the likes of the climate and evolution denying  anti woman  anti lgbtq religious nut that is mike pence can be described as the reasonable voice in the room  but here we are of course  the sycophants who regularly make the rounds on all of the political talks shows to excuse away trump s dangerous nonsense are pushing back on the idea that he is out of his element and needs all the help he can get in this area before taking the oath of office  rep  devin nunes  r ca  insisted in an interview with the washington post  which first broke this alarming development  that the security of america and her people is trump s  no   priority   going on to say that he thinks trump is taking it very seriously   ever more defensive  nunes continued  look how many leaders he s met with  how many phone calls he s done  positions he s filled  people who are being critical need to get a life  no  we  the citizens of this great country have every right to push back on bizarre and dangerous irregularities like this  rep  nunes  here we have a man who knows nothing about the world attempting to lead it on the most potentially lethal ego trip the world has ever seen and who refuses to take the advice of those who have the potential to save us all  a top security official has already said that trump  quote   has a lot of catching up to do   in this arena  and yet he is refusing to get the help he needs actions speak louder than words  and trump s actions say that he is more interested in parading candidates for his cabinet for the cameras in some kind of dangerous and bizarre real world reality show  using his new position to wheel and deal in his own business interests  and flying around the country in his jet rather than actually  you know  trying to learn how to run the nation and lead the free world be very afraid  america  be very  very afraid of what we have gotten ourselves into featured image via zach gibson getty images
