at this point  we have to wonder if the pressure of finding himself outside his bubble and confronted with the overwhelming realization that everyone hates him has gotten to donald trump  on wednesday  the donald woke up  ironed his klan robes  gave ivanka a deep  creepy good morning kiss  and sat down on his couch in yellow stained underwear to whine about obama on twitter  at least  this seems how a typical trump morning would go   and tweeted his latest  dumbest attack on the president trump s new daily ritual of childishly attacking president obama on twitter hasn t gone well for him  with his delusion rapidly progressing from  i could have beaten obama  to  i did beat obama  while the world mocked him at levels no normal human being could withstand  but this is trump  he s special  somehow he remains not immune but oblivious to the fact that outside his little fan club  he s just an orange faced bigot with tiny hands who got absolutely trounced in the popular vote  somehow  he is able to find the strength to keep his little thumbs moving faster than his brain to produce award winningly ignorant  misinformed  and utterly idiotic tweets at an astounding rate  doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocks   the donald tweeted   thought it was going to be a smooth transition   not  doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocks thought it was going to be a smooth transition   not   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    obama has done nothing to impede the transition  in fact  he has been downright helpful  even giving the donald advice the many times trump came crawling and begging for it  i must tell you  you know  i never met him before this  i never spoke to him before this  i really   i do like him   trump said after finally meeting the man he had been attacking for years  even questioning his citizenship   i love getting his ideas  and i may differ in many cases  i differ very greatly  but apparently  the donald is done playing nice with the man who had been devoting overtime to ensuring that the president elect doesn t f ck things up too badly  as is becoming almost a daily ritual  the internet came down   hard   on trump for his latest nonsensical attack on the guy who has been going out of his way to ensure a smooth transition  realdonaldtrump fixed that

electoral process  but the ease with which president obama takes up space in trump s head is impressive  obama doesn t need to attack  he just needs to exist and trump goes insane featured image via
