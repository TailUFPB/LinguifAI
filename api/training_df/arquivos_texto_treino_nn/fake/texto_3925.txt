trump seems to think he can easily garner the minimum  electoral votes that he would need to win the presidency  and then some  he s delusional  but he thinks it  however  politico s glenn thrush says that two people in trump s circles say that they re increasingly looking to simply beat the mere  votes romney won in  trump wants to win  but two people in his orbit have told me in last week that decisively beating romney s  evs is increasingly a goal   glenn thrush   glennthrush  november     basically  even members of trump s inner circles are looking at his dim odds and admitting that he probably can t win this  in fact  politico reports that his few remaining paths to the white house are  narrow  defined and unforgiving   he has to sweep north carolina  ohio  and florida  and he has to win utah  arizona  and georgia if he wins all of those and the rest of romney s states  he would either also have to win pennsylvania  eke out wins in maine  new hampshire  nevada and iowa  or he would just have to pull off a shocker in states like michigan  wisconsin  virginia  etc not much of that is bloody likely   each of these paths requires overcoming hillary s leads  and his campaign knows that  so now  all they want is to avoid embarrassment realclearpolitics has hillary leading in most polls  and even though that lead has shrunk  it s still pretty frightening for people close to trump and while fivethirtyeight says that trump is just   percent behind hillary  polls are often off in one direction or the other by roughly two percentage points  even if these polls end up having hillary too far ahead  she still beats trump by   percent  as things stand right now in short  trump s chances are growing ever bleaker for everyone except the delusional trump  who  behind the scenes  doesn t actually seem to care whether or not he wins  and his equally delusional followers  if trump suffers the humiliating defeat that seems imminent  the whole campaign looks as stupid as they are for signing onto this circus featured image via spencer platt getty images
