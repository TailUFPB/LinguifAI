if trump isn t willing to attach his name to something  you know it must really be bad no matter how  wonderful  he says it is on monday  house republicans passed what they dubiously refer to as the  american healthcare act   which repeals the affordable care act the bill would strip healthcare from millions of americans  including the millions who were able to access medicaid coverage  the bill also defunds planned parenthood and sticks senior citizens with higher costs among a litany of other things that screw over the american people on tuesday  donald trump praised the bill on twitter our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation  obamacare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    course  the only reason why the affordable care act is  imploding  is because trump and republicans have been sabotaging it but as  wonderful  as trump says the  make america sick again  bill is  his propaganda minister kellyanne conway is desperate to make sure trump s name is not attached to it after being asked by fox news host bill hemmer if it would be okay to call the bill  trumpcare   conway was quick to reply that trump s name should not be associated with it in such a way  it s the american health care act  and i think it s aptly named that for this reason   conway said   it wants to cover  it wants everyone to have access to coverage  and that is something that didn t happen under obamacare  i ll call it trumpcare if you want to  but i didn t hear president trump say to any of us   i want my name on that   it s not about branding according to someone s name  this is serious business  here s the video via youtube gee  that didn t stop republicans from branding the affordable care act as  obamacare   even though the landmark healthcare law was  aptly named  because it actually made healthcare more accessible and affordable for millions of americans trump s  american healthcare act  only strips millions of americans of their healthcare coverage  it does nothing to give coverage to everyone  if trump wants to cover all americans he would push for universal healthcare  not a bill that takes healthcare away from millions  including people who voted for him the real reason why conway doesn t want trump s name on the bill is because it s a bad bill that will harm a lot of people  in fact  it will likely lead to the deaths of many americans trump and his republican sycophants don t give a shit about all the people they are going to hurt by repealing the affordable care act  ad they certainly do not care about this country and its future  they only care about themselves featured image via screenshot
