last night  fox news reporter steve harrigan was reporting live in charlotte  north carolina to cover  police brutality protests that had erupted after a shooting  perhaps because fox news has typically shamed these kinds of protests and ran footage that depicted protesters as thugs and looters in the past  harrigan got his a   handed to him by a protester that didn t hesitate to confront the notoriously racist network the female african american protester went right up to harrigan and decided to educate him about why she and other protesters had gathered  when harrigan tried to shame her for being outside in an area where someone had just gotten shot  the protester couldn t tolerate his ignorance and white privilege any longer  harrigan made the mistake of asking her  if a man was shot about  yards over there  we don t know by who  why are you here  and that was it  the protester went off  and replied to harrigan  because i serve a purpose  right before giving him a brutal lesson in racism  she forcefully said that no matter where she is  at any given moment she could be shot just because of the color of her skin  she said  i could be at work  at school  in my car  i can still get shot   by the police  pointing out the fact that racism still exists in america  she continued  we are not the same  we are human  but i am black and you are white so don t tell me not to come over here harrigan tried to jump in  but the protester quickly called him out for  using sarcasm as a crowd began to gather  and accused the network of only being at the protests so that they could get video footage and make a f cking fabricated story    which we all know fox news has done in the past you can watch the protester shut down fox news below featured image is a screenshot
