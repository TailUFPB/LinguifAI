in an effort to slash    trillion in government spending over the next  years  donald trump has decided that the first target will be the department of justice s  grants and programs aimed at implementing the federal violence against women act  this means that every grant authorized by the law over the last  years will be eliminated in their entirety to put it in perspective  trump s cuts are double that of the cuts sought by house speaker paul ryan and the republican house caucus the violence against women act  a bipartisan law passed in the early   has been reauthorized twice and is tasked with protecting  aiding  counseling and saving women from abuse  harassment  intimidation and stalking some of the  grants offered from the doj include all of those grants will be gone  rendering the programs  and the act overall  moot the man who  loves women  is about to defund all the services that protect them from abuse and battery let that sink in the republican war on women has taken a dramatic and ugly turn  and it s all thanks to donald trump democrats tried to warn america  it would make sense that a man who routinely calls women bimbos  bitches  and dogs  and brags about sexually groping them  would target the programs that help them when they re most vulnerable there is no skating around this   the incoming administration is vehemently sexist and misogynistic  republicans in the past  including the bush administration  have not leveled the kind of assault on women that the trump administration is preparing to do  again  it should be noted that this is an extreme position to take  one that diverges from even typical gop standards instead of cutting the bloated defense budget and rolling back fat cat kickbacks for corporations  they re going to target abused women and children   even as domestic violence becomes one of the largest public health crises in america hopefully house and senate republicans  including the female members  will stand up to these outrageous cuts more importantly  where s ivanka trump  isn t she supposed to be the new unsung hero of modern day feminism women of all stripes and ideologies   republican and democrat   should be outraged  abuse doesn t pick a political party  vulnerability doesn t pick a political party  and a political party  or administration  should not be making life harder for those in need featured image by spencer platt via getty images
