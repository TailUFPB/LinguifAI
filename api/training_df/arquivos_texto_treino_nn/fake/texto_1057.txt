as donald trump stacks his cabinet with ultra conservative members of congress  that leaves empty seats that need to be filled  this means special elections are held to fill said seats  democrats thought we d be able to scoop up at least a seat or two   especially when it came to jon ossoff of the georgia district  election  however  we fell short by less than four points  tom price  who left to become trump s health and human services secretary  carried that district by more than  points last november  that trend has been consistent throughout all of the special elections  with democrats making major gains point wise  however  moral victories are not victories  and therefore people are pointing fingers  right now  the fingers are being pointed squarely at house minority leader nancy pelosi democrats like rep  tim ryan of ohio are calling for her to step aside for new leadership  ryan said of pelosi and the democratic party at large after the ossoff loss  we d better take a good  long  strong look in the mirror and realize that the problem is us  it s the party  ryan went on to praise jon ossoff as a  great  political candidate who still couldn t carry the national baggage of the democratic party  it is also worth noting that ryan did challenge pelosi for her leadership position last november and lost spectacularly  so there could still be bitterness there  rep  seth moulton  d ma  criticized the idea of keeping leader pelosi as well  we need to have a plan  we need to have a vision  we need to tell americans why democrats will be better  not just why trump is bad  and i don t think we re doing enough of that  and i think that s evident in this  race  this is an empty argument  though  because ossoff did not run against trump  he ran on healthcare and the economy  what largely hurt him was his lack of a resume  the fact that the district had been handily in gop hands for  years  and the fact that republicans stick together when democrats don t  in this election  lots of democrats accused him of not being liberal enough  also  he never sufficiently answered for living outside the district he was running to represent however  in my humble opinion  what they want to do to nancy pelosi would be disastrous  we split the party between the bernie sanders elizabeth warren hard left and the hillary clinton barack obama left of center in   and look where that got us  when the party is in tatters  it is time to come together to beat the common enemy  the republicans who are steadily destroying the united states of america as we speak  while we bicker amongst ourselves  demand ideological purity  and attack those who share our same values  they are rolling back civil rights continuing to gerrymander districts to render democratic votes useless  using non existent voter fraud to block people from exercising their right to vote  planning to kill us by taking our healthcare away  destroying public education  and making sure we won t have a planet to live on if they get their way now  i know all of the arguments  pelosi is the old guard and it s time for her to go  the republicans always yoke our candidate to her  paint her as an out of touch  san francisco liberal  and that means that moderates are afraid to vote for that candidate because they fear a far left agenda  newsflash  no matter who is in leadership  they ll say those things anyway  they think all democrats are just like nancy pelosi  elizabeth warren  and bernie sanders  despite the fact that this party is as diverse as the people of the nation  that diversity can be our greatest strength rather than a weakness if we just stop fighting one another long enough to heal old wounds from  at least it seems that the democratic national committee is speaking out against this dangerous move from inside the house democratic caucus  deputy chairman rep  keith ellison said of what is going on  republicans have held this seat for  years  in a normal year  we wouldn t even have any shot  we have closed the gap dramatically  i mean  they re the ones that better be worried  i never thought i d say this  but i think we should take the advice of former gop congressman and host of msnbc s morning joe  joe scarborough on this one setting pelosi up as scapegoat does democrats no good  get a candidate that matches the district and you will win  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  june    is correct  don t run a new york city liberal democrat in ohio  find some tim ryan replicas and we ll carry the whole state  loathe as i am to say this  in places like south carolina and rural north carolina and georgia  find someone who s a bit more like joe manchin than say  maxine waters  a dino is better than a republican any day  if you can get away with it in those districts  run someone like claire mccaskill  match the candidate to the political environment  adjust their positions to match  and we win  feel out the political landscape in any given area  also   and this is most important   get some candidates that can speak to the working class  such as the democrat from wisconsin  randy bryce  who has launched a moving campaign ad to announce his challenge to current house speaker paul ryan  get a strong  working family economic message  combine it with our overall message of tolerance and acceptance for all and pit it against the open bigotry of the gop  and we re golden throwing one another under the bus  re litigating the  primaries and general election  and continuing this infighting does nothing but tear the party apart further  certainly throwing the best fundraiser the house democrats have   not to mention the first female house speaker of the united states of america   under the bus is not the way remember   we re all democrats  we share the same values  our diversity is what makes us beautiful  now  let s come together  rebuild our party  and kick the gop out of congress in   and out of the white house in  here is some great video commentary to illustrate these points featured image via win mcnamee getty images
