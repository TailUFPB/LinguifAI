donald trump s horrific defense of white supremacy after the charlottesville  va crisis is going to hurt him in ways he never thought it would  not only has his already historically low approval rating taken yet another plunge  even amongst his own fan base   but people are lining up to attack trump personally one of those people is laurel baker  the executive director of the palm beach chamber of commerce  who has decided to hit trump where it will hurt most   his wallet  knowing damn well that trump doesn t actually have a heart or conscience  baker knows that trump would at least be sensitive to his business going down in flames  to get his point across  baker is urging charities to boycott trump s mar a lago club and stop holding events there baker stated that this move against trump was motivated by trump s disgusting  disappointing response to the violence in charlottesville  baker told the palm beach post  if you have a conscience  you re really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there  many say it s the dollars  raised at the events  that count  yes  but the integrity of any or organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship  personally  i do not feel that supporting him  directly or indirectly  speaks well of any organization  people are listening  already  trump s beloved club has suffered the cancellation of events that were scheduled by both the american cancer society and the cleveland clinic  the american cancer society stated  our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community  it has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations  trump s horrific hatred and bigotry is not only ruining his presidency  it is ruining his entire brand  at the end of trump s disastrous presidency  he might not actually have a business to run anymore if he keeps going this route  americans have long complained about trump s presidency being intertwined in his conflicts of interests  but there might be a way we can make it work in our favor  boycotting trump s business is one of the greatest ways americans can protest against trump  as it s one of the only things trump actually cares about featured image via ian macnicol    getty images
