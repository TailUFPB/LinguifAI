after james comey called him a liar five times on thursday  donald trump has been obsessing over the former fbi director s damning testimony  it s driving him insane   so insane that he has deigned it appropriate to cave to pressure to testify  under oath  where lies become crimes  it s like f cking christmas in the aftermath of comey s testimony  the donald attempted to demonize the former director  complaining that he is a  leaker  because he passed on his not the least bit classified thoughts on his meeting with trump despite so many false statements and lies  total and complete vindication and wow  comey is a leaker   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    have been challenging trump to testify lately   and now the orange occupant of the oval office says he s going to do just that  the hill reports  one hundred percent   trump said when asked if he would give a sworn statement to robert mueller  the special counsel leading the investigation into russia s election interference  i would be glad to tell him exactly what i told you   the president said during a press conference in the white house rose garden  yesterday showed no collusion  no obstruction   trump said  ignoring that comey said nothing to dispute collusion or obstruction  he refused to comment in an open setting   but we were very  very happy and  frankly  james comey confirmed a lot of what i said  and some of the things that he said just weren t true  yes  according to the donald  comey   a liar    confirmed  many of the things he has said  even though he s a lying liar whose pants are on fire though he originally threatened to release tapes of his conversations with comey  the donald now says they may not exist  telling reporters that you will be very disappointed when you hear the answer   but  of course  the threat lives on james comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    s response during his testimony was  lordy  i hope there are tapes   so we can safely assume trump s new statement means that he destroyed any recordings he made watch below pres  trump would     be willing to say under oath that he didn t ask comey to let flynn investigation  go   didn t say  i need loyalty   pic twitter com tayobtkchx  abc news politics   abcpolitics  june    image via getty images
