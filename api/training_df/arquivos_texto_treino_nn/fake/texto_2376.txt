donald trump s botched yemen raid left  civilians   including an  year old american girl and other women and children   dead  as well as a navy seal  trump has been largely silent about the death of william  ryan  owens  and with good reason  it was his negligence that caused it an  year old child was the first to be struck by a bullet after he heard a commotion outside  many more children as young as three months old would lose their lives in the bloodbath that was trump s first military operation  trump  in his haste to approve the operation over dinner without adequate  intelligence  ground support or adequate backup preparations  according to military officials  failed to kill his primary target  all that we have to show from the botched mission are a few training videos the trump administration touted as evidence of their success  the videos have been available on youtube for a decade the mission was so poorly executed that yemen withdrew permission for the united states to conduct anti terrorism ground operations within its borders   because trump can not be trusted and for what was effectively an attempt for the donald to boost his fragile ego  owens lost his life since the failed mission  the trump administration has been using the slain seal to silence detractors  indicating that any opposition to the failed operation was somehow an assault on owens himself   and his father has spoken out to tell trump where he can stick that line of rhetoric  don t hide behind my son s death to prevent an investigation  i want an investigation    the government owes my son an investigation  the elder owens says that when he heard trump was coming to  pay respects  to his son   a clear attempt to politicize the death his terrible decision making caused   he was not pleased  the miami herald reports  i told them i didn t want to make a scene about it  but my conscience wouldn t let me talk to him   owens said friday  speaking out for the first time in an interview with the miami herald owens  also a military veteran  was troubled by trump s harsh treatment of a gold star family during his presidential campaign  now owens was a gold star parent  and he said he had deep reservations about the way the decision was made to launch what would be his son s last mission ryan and as many as  civilians were killed jan   in the anti terrorism mission in yemen  what was intended as a lightning raid to grab cellphones  laptops and other information about terrorists turned into a nearly hour long firefight in which  everything went wrong   according to u s  military officials who spoke to the new york times bill owens said he was assured that his son  who was shot  was killed early in the fight  it was the first military counter terrorist operation approved by the new president  who signed the go ahead jan     six days into his term  why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn t even barely a week into his administration  why  for two years prior  there were no boots on the ground in yemen   everything was missiles and drones   because there was not a target worth one american life  now  all of a sudden we had to make this grand display  i d like some answers about all the things that happened in the timeline that led up to it  i know what the timeline is  and it bothers me a lot   owens says  one aspect in particular is that donald trump signed his muslim ban the day before the raid  as yemen was one of the affected countries  he wonders if it may have affected friendly forces who were assisting with the raid  it just doesn t make any sense to do something to antagonize an ally when you re going to conduct a mission in that country  did we alienate some of the people working with them  translators or support people  maybe they decided to release information to jeopardize the mission  owens says he has no political agenda  he just wants the truth   as do the rest of us featured image via screengrab
