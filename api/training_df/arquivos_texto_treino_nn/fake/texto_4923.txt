when thinking about who would be the perfect person to send to a donald trump campaign rally to interview supporters  there really is no one better than drag queen courtney act  previously of rupaul s drag race she left the comforts of provincetown  ma  and went over to fairfield  ct  to talk to trump minions it was there that she met all sorts of interesting folks  islamophobes  racists  misogynists  you know  pretty much everyone you think you d find at a trump rally courtney talked to quite a few people  including a man with  trump that b tch  t shirts  another man with a  made in china  trump hat  as well as a white supremacy group  but one woman really embodied everything trump this lady told courtney  it doesn t matter what your religion is  but i do believe that the muslim is not a religion  i believe it s more of a cult and if people got together and sacrificed a human baby or sacrificed a woman at the stake  i would say that people would probably say that s not a good religion  like satanic cults  for instance  they re not legal in our country and therefore i don t believe sharia law should be legal either  besides all the factual inaccuracies and crazy within all that  it doesn t quite seem to be understandable english either  and she calls herself american one of the best parts of the video was when some protesters at the rally recognized courtney from her time on rupaul s drag race  it was probably a nice relief for her to run into sane people in that crowd of nincompoops all in all  this video is pretty damn hilarious  yet it s still kinda scary knowing there are people in the u s  who think this way  however  these people vote  which is all the more reason to make sure we all get out this november and vote blue watch the video here https   www facebook com junkeedotcom videos  featured image via video screen capture
