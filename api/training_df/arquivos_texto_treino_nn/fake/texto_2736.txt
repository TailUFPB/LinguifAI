you don t have to look beyond washington to prove what we ve known for decades  democrats are simply better people  democratic policies actually help people while republican policies help themselves and corporations beyond washington  though  it s been proven that democrats make better neighbors democrats are more likely to offer assistance to other members of their community  over the course of a year  they are more likely than republicans to talk with someone who is severely depressed  help a friend or neighbor find a job  or help friends  neighbors  or family members with homework  i also noted a series of differences albeit not statistically significant ones showing that democrats more frequently loan dishes or tools to their neighbors  help strangers carry their belongings  offer up their seat on a train or bus  allow strangers to cut ahead of them in line  and give food or money directly to someone in need democrats are also smarter and more rational so for liberals to make a case for an idea or cause  they come armed with data  research studies  and experts  they are convinced of an idea if all the data checks out basically they assign meaning and value to ideas that fit within the scientific method  because that s their primary thinking style  emotion doesn t play as big of a role in validation  not to say that liberals are unfeeling  but just more likely to set emotion aside when judging an idea initially  and factor it in later  checks out scientifically   valuable  liberals can get just as emotionally attached to an idea  but it s usually not the primary trigger for acceptance of an idea conservatives would be less likely to assign value primarily using the scientific method  remember  their thinking style leads primarily with emotion  in order for them to find an idea valuable  it has to be meaningful for them personally  it needs to trigger empathy  meaning  they need some kind of emotional attachment to it  such as family  or a group of individuals they are close to in some way none of that should be terribly surprising  especially if you ve ever encountered conservatives on facebook  and we ve all encountered conservatives on facebook  what is surprising  though  is this study  which says we re better drivers  or at least in blue states  there are a lot fewer traffic fatalities in all  the  states with the highest fatality rates went into the red column  supporting trump  in contrast  the  states with the lowest fatality rates were blues that favored clinton  in these calculations  fatality rates were determined by counting the number of road deaths in  per every   people this isn t as weird as you might think  republicans tend to thumb their noses at constraints to their freedoms  they can t drive   they also tend to live in less populated areas  whereas democrats live in areas that have a lot of traffic  nothing slows people down faster than  of brake lights ahead of them  there s more though another likely factor behind high fatality rates in red rural states is that their residents tend to be poorer  as a result   their cars are probably in worse repair  there can be a missing light in the back  or the clutch goes out   said sociologist arlie russell hochschild  author of the  book  strangers in their own land   which explored views of conservatives in red state louisiana hochschild also said  a kind of cowboy mentality  a kind of deregulatory  anything goes culture  exists in red states might lead to more reckless driving they are also less likely to wear seat belts  that damn gubmint  telling people what to do  really  though  this is just a metaphor republicans in general  republicans are reckless and don t give a crap about the safety of anyone who might get in their way  it s how the republican congress is run and it s how the roads in red states are run featured image via wikimedia
