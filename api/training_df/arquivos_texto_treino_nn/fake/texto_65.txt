over the last few weeks  i ve watched as the last shreds of the republican party s  family values  rotted away as alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in december they have two choices before them they can vote for the democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the senate  or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about in other words  they can either put power over principles or put principles over power they can t do both and while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t  choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice some things go above politics  and sexual assault is  and rightfully should  be one of them voting for moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus  it will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country  a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting democrat for many years if republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come  it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to moore and the people who defend him such as donald trump this starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the gop has lost  perhaps then  they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the nazis  which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the southern strategy ever did and then the republican party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn  which has not been good for the country at all america has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied  letting moore step inside the senate would send a message to the world that america supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women such a message from the republican party smacks of hypocrisy  after all  we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against bill clinton but just like how they constantly bring up abraham lincoln in an attempt to claim that the republican party must still be great  their rhetoric about bill clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today  the gop is far removed from the days of lincoln  and bill clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win  the sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot however  by supporting donald trump  who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the  campaign  republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their bill clinton talking point if moore wins next month  republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return  and the consequences will be severe america is more diverse than ever before  women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show  minorities are also set to become the majority of the population  and once that scale tips  the gop will no longer be able to be the party of white people  it just won t work it s just a matter of time  and time is running out for the republican party and that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige  and that should go beyond the political arena as well  whether the behavior is coming from a corporate ceo or the part owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing that s what republicans did in  when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer  lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest cabinets in our history  bringing together liberal and conservative republicans and even a democrat or two and even though lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult  he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the  amendment  such a move at the time could have cost lincoln a second term  but he did it anyway lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today  it s time for republicans to do the same now seven years ago  my first article for this site
