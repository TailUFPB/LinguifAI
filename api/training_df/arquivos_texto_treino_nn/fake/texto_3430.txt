donald trump s transition effort has already been an embarrassing  chaotic affair  it s been more like a reality show and a quest for public humiliation and revenge than the dignified affair that it has been for presidents past  now  team trump has another problem  the inauguration  you see  usually  presidents elect have pop stars and other a list stars from around the globe scrambling to get a spot at the plum event  for instance  barack obama had the likes of beyonce and aretha franklin celebrating his swearing in  not the case  however  for donald trump  in fact  the opposite seems to be true according to bbc news  the trump team is so desperate for inaugural talent that they are actually offering to pay the stars to come   something that never happens  of course  trump s inaugural committee is denying this  saying via spokesman boris epshteyn  no one with any official position at  or official relationship with  the presidential committee is engaging in the conduct described  of course  this is likely a lie  since another mouthpiece from trump s inaugural clown car lied and said that sir elton john would be showing up  as soon as that news was out of the box  sir elton s publicist released a strongly worded rebuke of team trump that said  incorrect  he will not be performing  there is no truth in this at all  further  a source close to the inaugural efforts said of the team s desperation  they re calling managers  agents  everyone in town to see who they can get and it s been problematic  they are willing to pay anything  other stars weighed in as well  singer john legend says that he is  not surprised at all   and continued  creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate  we tend to be more liberal minded  when we see somebody that s preaching division and hate and bigotry  it s unlikely he ll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him  queen frontman and american idol star adam lambert said of the potential gig  even if there was lots of cash involved  i don t think i would take the money on that one  i don t think i d be endorsing that  they might struggle  less well known singer matt healy  who fronts the   seemed to think the whole thing might be good for a laugh  i ll do it if they give me cash up front  then watch what would happen  it would be a riot  even the comedy isn t enough for healy  though  as he continued  what do i want  well  he s got gold seatbelts in his plane   so at least a million quid  well  this ought to be an interesting affair  it will probably look like the republican national convention did  with people like pastor mark burns and sheriff clarke giving hateful  hellfire and brimstone speeches  with chris christie once again prosecuting hillary clinton from the stage  protesters outside  and with the only musical talent being people like kid rock and ted nugent get ready for another national disgrace courtesy of donald trump  folks  murica featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
