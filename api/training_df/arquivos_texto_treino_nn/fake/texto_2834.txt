this may shock you  this may not  but trump has been delegating the duty of writing his executive orders to some scary people   well  a scary person  that is if you thought executive orders limiting muslim entry into the united states  stripping health international organizations of federal funds if they so much as mention abortion  authorizing the building of literal f cking concentration camps to hold the  illegals  the donald intends to round up  and beginning the process of stripping health care from millions of impoverished americans sounded like breitbart s christmas list come to life  you were exactly right according to white house aides  trump has been delegating the duty of writing the rapid stream of absolutely f cking terrifying executive orders to the same guy who ran breitbart  trump s chief strategist and former executive chair called his publication  a platform for the alt right   for those who are unaware   alt right  means  nazi     and the views that would be associated with one who cultivates that sort of cesspool are definitely making themselves apparent in the nature of trump s orders things are a mess in the white house at the moment  according to politico  no one seems to have any idea what the hell they are doing or  more importantly  what trump is doing with his flawed orders that might be unworkable  unenforceable or even illegal  just a small circle of officials at the department of health and human services knew about the executive action starting to unwind obamacare  and only less than two hours before it was released  key members of congress weren t consulted either  according to several members  and at a conference in philadelphia  gop legislators say they had no idea whether some of the executive orders would contrast with existing laws   because they hadn t reviewed them the breakneck pace of trump s executive actions might please his supporters  but critics are questioning whether the documents are being rushed through without the necessary review from agency experts and lawmakers who will bear the burden of actually carrying them out  for example  there are legal questions on how the country can force companies building pipelines to use materials manufactured domestically  which might not be available or which could violate trade treaty obligations  there s also the question of whether the federal government can take billions from cities who don t comply with immigration enforcement actions  legal experts said it was unclear aides say that it is often difficult to know what order trump intends to sign at any given moment or even what is in some of them because of the secretive nature in which they are being drafted by bannon and the small circle of friends trump has handling them to make matters worse  bannon is in the process of a huge power grab right now  giving two of his former staffers at the white supremacist hate rag seats at the table  the hill reports one of breitbart s biggest stars  julia hahn  is expected to join the white house as an aide to bannon  breitbart s national security editor  sebastian gorka  will also relocate to the white house  likely with a spot on the president s national security council  business insider reported on tuesday the breitbartization of the white house comes as no surprise to people at the conservative news site  i m surprised it took this long   one breitbart reporter told the hill   there are a number of people on staff who clearly have resumes that would lend themselves to the administration  these two are ideologically in line with bannon  they re people he can trust  it makes sense  there is no line of separation between the white house and breitbart   they are one in the same   a former breitbart spokesman who has since disavowed the right wing hate factory  told the hill   they effectively are a state sponsored controlled platform designed to advance the administration s propaganda  and the administration  in turn  is bringing breitbart s propaganda to life featured image via getty images ben jackson
