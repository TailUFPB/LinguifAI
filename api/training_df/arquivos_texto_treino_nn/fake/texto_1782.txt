donald trump is a hypocrite and even conservative outdoor groups know it america s greatest and most enduring treasure is its national parks  conservation of these lands started under republican president theodore roosevelt and has continued to this day as every president has created new national parks to preserve natural wonders for future generations to enjoy and appreciate but donald trump is on a mission to destroy everything that is good in this country and one of his targets are the very national parks that millions of americans visit every year trump s  budget slashes funding for the interior department  which includes the national park service  by   billion and he has signed an executive order making it easier for mining and drilling to occur in and around the parks in short  trump doesn t want to give the national park service the money to protect the parks and he wants to let oil companies pollute them despite these facts  trump had the gall to pretend that he loves our national parks and that he wants to protect them in a proclamation issued on friday  trump declared that protecting america s national parks is important to him and his administration  it is a priority of my administration to protect these magnificent lands  and to ensure all americans have access to our national parks  as well as to other national park service sites  throughout the next century it is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren  again  trump s budget would hurt our national parks and mining and drilling would do lasting damage to lands that are supposed to remain pristine for future generations to come in response to trump s proclamation  conservation organizations trashed his hypocrisy  we re really surprised and disappointed to see the administration come after national parks this way   senior manager for the national park conservation association nicholas lund said   with all that s going on in the world  drilling in our national parks should just not be a priority  even the conservative leaning sierra club had strong words for trump  if he actually cared about protecting our parks  he would have never proposed a budget that slashes their funding to historically low levels at a time when investments are needed to maintain america s best idea   executive director michael brune said   our parks and the people and economies they support need real commitments  not empty gestures  indeed  our national parks directly benefit the communities around them because of tourists  campers  hunters  photographers  and a multitude of people who desire to see america s natural wonders  the same natural wonders that their ancestors saw years earlier that s what is at stake here  the national parks belong to the people and they should be protected for all time  not exploited featured image  mark wilson getty images
