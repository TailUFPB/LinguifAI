i ll admit it  i am not a huge fan of tribute songs  making music is something sacred  and it s so hard to take topical songs seriously  unless it s like  bob dylan  punk music  i m not sure  but contemporaneous talk singing is just not my bag usually  and that s generally what people come up with as  protest  songs  that said  this gospel jam from mykal kilgore  a youtube  and movie  star  is entirely different  it was inspired by a testy exchange last week between the always feisty rep  maxine waters  d ca  and treasury secretary steven mnuchin  from the video description our beloved  auntie  maxine waters laid this sermon down so good that i had to sing about it  whenever anybody tries to distract me or block me  even with praise or platitudes  i m gonna have to let them know that i m  reclaimingmytime it s a common tactic for old white republican assholes either in congress or before it  when they don t want to answer questions from women  democrats  or especially women democrats  they waste the time allotted to their questioner with meaningless compliments or interruptions  if they re creative types  did you know mnuchin was a movie producer    they can usually get away with wasting all of the time they would normally spend answering questions when rep  waters grilled mnuchin on july  during a house financial services committee hearing about why she hadn t heard back on her request for information from the treasury on donald trump s ties to russian banks  that s exactly what mnuchin tried to do  rather than answering her question  the treasury secretary immediately launched into a spiel about  everything you ve done  for the state of california  prompting waters to remind him that he was on her time  not his own   i m reclaiming my time   she said  noting that it was limited like the infamous  nevertheless  she persisted  exchange between mitch mcconnell and elizabeth warren during the confirmation hearing for attorney general jeff sessions  the exchange almost immediately became a meme but rather than inspiring a line of shirts  the thursday snapshot of what it s like for women in congress became lyrics for a surprisingly good song now reclaim a little of your time  and watch the video featured image via chelsea guglielmino getty images
