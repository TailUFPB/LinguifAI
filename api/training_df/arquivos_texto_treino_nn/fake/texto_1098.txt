the question as to whether donald trump is being investigated by special counsel robert mueller or not was answered definitively by trump himself via a tweet he posted on friday morning  that s why jay sekulow  a key member of trump s legal team  confused the world when he insisted that trump is in fact not being investigated by mueller on sunday while making his rounds on the sunday morning political talk show circuit  sekulow told nbc s meet the press host  chuck todd   the president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction   after dropping this nuclear grade contradiction  sekulow was forced to defend his position to multiple members of the press  one interview  which aired on fox news sunday was particularly brutal for sekulow  the show s host  chris wallace  qualified the reality of the situation well when he said   oh boy  this is weird    he takes the action that  recommended and now he s being investigated by the department of justice  he s being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the terminations     you ve now said he is being investigated after saying    wallace observed    no  he s not being investigated   sekulow shouts at wallace    you just said he s being investigated   wallace said   at this point  wallace is not putting up with sekulow s inconsistencies     sir  you just said two times that he s being investigated   the wallace fires back   and he s not just being investigated for firing comey  there s also what he said to comey when comey was still the fbi director   sekulow then claims that wallace is putting words in his mouth  insisting that he has been  crystal clear  about his assertion that trump is not being investigated  sekulow then tries to play of his contradiction as nothing more than him speaking on the  legal theory of how the constitution works   he then accuses wallace of rephrasing what he is saying of course  this is all complete nonsense  that s why wallace responds confidently  saying   i didn t rephrase it  the tape will speak for itself  you said he is being investigated  you can watch the interview below  featured image from video screenshot
