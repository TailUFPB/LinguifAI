sean hannity openly supports donald trump for president and has turned his media platform into the republican nominee s propaganda machine indeed  hannity is trump s chief propagandist and there is no low that he won t sink to in order to attack hillary clinton and defend trump of course  hannity denies that he s a propagandist  but if anyone knows what a propagandist looks like  it s the cia and former cia director michael hayden says hannity is a  true propagandist  after years of bashing wikileaks and the group s founder julian assange  hannity has just recently began praising them because they are releasing private emails from hillary clinton s campaign team wikileaks obtained these emails by illegally hacking servers in the united states  which constitutes foreign espionage against this country  but sean hannity is cheering them on anyway in what amounts to endorsing crimes against the united states and hayden ripped hannity and fox news a new one for doing so in a response to brookings institute senior fellow benjamin wittes  foxnews has almost completely jumped the shark   hayden wrote   they have given up any semblance of conservatism and focused on an almost visceral hatred of all things clinton and obama  hannity has entered the pantheon of a true propagandist  and his behavior reminds me of a conversation i had with a political office in the mid  when i was the air attach  to bulgaria  i asked this officer what truth was to him  he responded without hesitation   truth is what serves the party   and there you have it  former cia and nsa director mike hayden responds to  seanhannity s endorsement of foreign espionage against the us  pic twitter com hwbnjjkmdb  benjamin wittes   benjaminwittes  october    was part of the eastern bloc in the  ruled by the bulgarian communist party and an ally of the soviet union so hannity is following in the footsteps of communist propagandists  which tells you just how dangerous conservatives have become in recent years featured image  screenshot
