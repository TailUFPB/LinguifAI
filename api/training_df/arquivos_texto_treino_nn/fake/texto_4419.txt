donald trump s relationship with his daughter ivanka has definitely raised a few eyebrows  it s bad enough that all of his wives   including his current wife  melania   have been a couple of decades younger than he is  what is more disturbing is the fact that he seems to have the hots for his daughter  well  this troubling notion is even more eyebrow raising when you consider an interview trump did with radio host howard stern in  apparently  trump and stern were discussing the women they like to date  and trump mentioned that he had promised his daughter ivanka  who was seventeen at the time  that he would not date anyone younger than she was  even crazier is the fact that the age of consent in the state of new york is seventeen years of age  so  essentially  all trump  who was  at the time  was promising to do is not to commit rape  one could argue all day long regarding statutory rape laws and their fairness   but no  year old girl is going to want to do anything like that with a  year old man unless she was shamed  guilted  bullied  or forced into it  end of story trump said to stern  i have a deal with her  she s  and doing great   ivanka  she made me promise  swear to her that i would never date a girl younger than her  so as she grows older  the field is getting very limited  stern  who sounded taken aback  made an awkward joke in response  the nerve of her  now you can t go out with  year olds  indeed  needless to say  these comments simply continue the narrative that trump has an unhealthy affinity for girls that are far too young for him  and this conversation seems to suggest that if he could get away with it  he d date and have sex with underage girls  is this the sort of man we really want in the white house listen to the audio below  via the new york daily news featured image via screen capture from twitter
