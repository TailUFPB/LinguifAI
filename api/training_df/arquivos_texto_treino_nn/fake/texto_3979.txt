video quickly went viral of trump supporter george lindell  a resident of phoenix  arizona  lindell could be seen and heard chanting to the media pen  jew s a jew s a    which is clearly an anti semitic slur watch lindell do his chant here however  that s not the end of the story  after lindell was called out on his clear anti semitism  he tried to clear things up and explain what he was actually saying according to the arizona republic  the phoenix man spent monday trying to explain why his chanting what sounded like jew s a  at the saturday rally was not meant as a slur  i want to talk to everybody   lindell said monday  he s a painter for hire and had a job scheduled  but he put it off so he could respond  local television stations were calling  so were national websites  he said cnn was trying to arrange something lindell needed to do the interviews  he said  to counter what people are saying about him   they re calling me racist  calling me all kinds of names  he s now saying that he wasn t going after jewish people or the religion  but rather just saying  usa  in a heavy spanish accent the arizona republican reports  lindell said he has a rational explanation for his chant  what sounded like  jew   was in fact  he said  a chance to show allegiance with spanish speakers who chant the country s initials with a heavy accent  so  really  lindell would like everyone to know that he s not anti semitic  but rather just a good old fashioned racist and while trump campaign manager kellyanne conway says lindell s speech does not reflect the campaign s values  a visit to any trump rally with show you otherwise donald trump has built his entire campaign around racism  islamophobia  misogyny and xenophobic demagoguery  it s not really surprising to hear this sort of speech coming from the crowd  not surprising in the least featured image via video screen capture
