it s no secret republicans are salivating to find something  anything  to take down hillary clinton  the idea of a third term for democrats  at the hands of an accomplished woman  scares the hell out of them  so they do what they do best  lie  cheat  smear and bog down with endless investigations now that the fbi and the department of justice have cleared clinton of any criminal wrongdoing  republicans are once again faced with nowhere to go  they have hit a wall when it comes to pinning criminal charges on clinton  who is increasing her chances of becoming america s next president as part of a usual maneuver of transparency  the fbi handed over to members of congress documents detailing  witness interview reports  including that of secretary clinton s interview  along with other materials from the fbi s now closed investigative file  in regards to her email controversy in the age of the internet  it is almost guaranteed that whenever congress gets their hands on anything potentially incriminating  embarrassing or politically expedient  it s leaked to the public  both sides do it for different reasons  some for nefarious reasons  and others as a public service but this situation is different  republicans are hoping to use evidence in these documents as a  smoking gun  for the court of public opinion since their desire for indictment in a court of law fell flat  but there s one harbinger to this  many of these documents are deemed classified and confidential  and should any republican  at the behest of their staff or them personally  feel compelled to leak the information provided  the fbi released a statement reminding them of what they are messing with consistent with our commitment to transparency with respect to the fbi s investigation to former secretary of state clinton s use of a personal server  the fbi is providing certain relevant materials to appropriate congressional committees assist them in their oversight responsibilities in this matter  the material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without fbi concurrence should someone from capitol hill leak the information  prosecution could be pursued  and should a republican be stupid enough to allow such a leak  their moral high ground argument that clinton was reckless with handling classified information would be completely and utterly decimated while republicans are hoping to be selective in their  discoveries   the clinton campaign has announced that they want all the documents pertaining to the investigation to be released  as to stave off biased selection of information at the hands of a bloodthirsty gop this is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by republicans for the purposes of further second guessing the career professionals at the fbi  we believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the justice department  they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves  rather than allow republicans to mischaracterize them through selective  partisan leaks while trump continues to put off releasing his much anticipated tax returns  the clinton campaign is calling for near total transparency of the facts surrounding what is arguably the dumbest  scandal  she has been linked to be careful republicans  everything you ve worked for could come crashing down should a giddy staffer decide to be a  conservative hero  and leak information featured image via mark mekela getty images
