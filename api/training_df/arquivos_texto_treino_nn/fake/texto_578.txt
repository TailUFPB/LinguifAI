according to a new report saturday from axios  a source very close to donald trump has indicated that trump believes his chief strategist steve bannon is to blame for leaks coming out of the white house regarding other members of trump s staff  it would be easy to say at this point that bannon s position at trump s right hand is in jeopardy  but the fact that trump is simply talking about it instead of firing him already may indicate otherwise this could be an elaborate test to see if the news that trump suspects bannon makes it out of the white house  which of course it has   meaning whoever the president told about his suspicions is  if not the leaker  at least also a leaker  or it could be that bannon is innocent  and the axios source is the leaker  trying to throw everyone off the trail  most likely  however  is that donald trump is a loose lipped dipshit who doesn t care who his audience is  he just wants to look like he knows what he s doing  even having a suspicion means he s thinking about it  right bannon has not commented on the news  nor is he likely to  the notorious white supremacist has more to worry about right now with his movement than whether or not he keeps his job at the white house  after saturday s vehicular murder of one protester and grievous injury to  dozen others following friday s torchlight rally of the alt right and kkk  more attention will surely be paid to nationalist hate groups across the country  regardless of what trump or bannon wants the odds of trump finally getting rid of the breitbart impresario of intolerance are much higher now that his new chief of staff  general john kelly  has already set a precedent with the firing of anthony scaramucci then again  it could be that bannon knows where all the bodies are buried  so to speak  and trump can t risk getting rid of him whether he trusts him or not  all i know is  both donald trump and steve bannon are unhappy  and that makes me smile featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
