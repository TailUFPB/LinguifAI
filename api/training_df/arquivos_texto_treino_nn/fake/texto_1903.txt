this week  donald trump signed a deeply concerning bill that allows internet service providers  isps  to sell the browsing histories of their customers to advertisers  it s a disgusting piece of legislation that has americans around the country concerned for their privacy and has left them feeling vulnerable   and the inventor of the worldwide web himself had some pretty strong feelings toward it as well tim berners lee is the computer scientist responsible for the worldwide web we use today  having seen how much his invention has grown since its creation in   he says he has been  disgusted  by the law trump just signed in  and has slammed both trump and the gop for it in an interview with the guardian according to berners lee  and many americans   user privacy should not be a partisan issue and he was quite shocked that despite facing so much public outcry  the republican party rolled this legislation through anyway  lee said  that bill was a disgusting bill  because when we use the web  we are so vulnerable  privacy  a core american value  is not a partisan thing  democrats fight for it and republicans fight for it  too  maybe even more  so i am very shocked that the republican party has managed to suggest that it should be trashed  if anyone follows up on this direction there will be a massive pushback   and there must be a massive pushback  berners lee s statement came with a warning as well   he predicted that the federal communications commission would face massive protests if the net neutrality regulations that former president barack obama put into place were compromised  he said  if they take away net neutrality  there will have to be a tremendous amount of public debate as well  you can bet there will be public demonstrations if they do try to take it away  featured image via john moore   getty images
