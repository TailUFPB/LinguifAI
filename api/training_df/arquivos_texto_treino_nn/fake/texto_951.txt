one of donald trump s biggest fans  fox news host sean hannity  has just tried to come to his rescue after the potus was condemned for his disgusting attack on morning joe hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski on saturday  as trump himself was having a meltdown on twitter  hannity decided to join the chaos by defending trump and his petty  nasty attacks on the morning joe hosts  in a disgusting attempt to kiss trump s  ss  hannity made an insane threat to the msnbc news couple  hinting that he had some incriminating dirt on the morning joe hosts no one really knows what the hell  going  there   actually means  but he s likely trying to channel trump in his ominous threat   and if he s really trying to emulate trump  we can bet that he s bluffing hannity has a history of going after scarborough  having previously claimed that scarborough has many skeletons  in his  closet    office    when hannity had made those statements  he was referring to an incident in which a dead intern was found in scarborough s district office during his time as a congressman in   while scarborough had nothing to do with the intern s death  he resigned from his position due to the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident  coincidentally  trump also loves conspiracy theories while we re not aware of what other nonsense hannity might want to spread about scarborough and brzezinski  is certainly a shame that he s threatening the couple just because they re speaking out against trump hannity s cryptic tweet proves that fox news and its reporters will do anything to defend trump  no matter how bad it makes them look  just last month  hannity said he would be willing to pay for therapy for the morning joe hosts because he felt they d become  unhinged   clearly  it s the other way around featured image is a screenshot
