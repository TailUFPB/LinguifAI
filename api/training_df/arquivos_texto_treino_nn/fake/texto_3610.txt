a police officer was shot and killed in tacoma  washington on wednesday  which marks the  time that a police officer  or member of law enforcement  has been shot in   according to data compiled by everytownresearch org  more than a quarter of those shootings were fatal   a total of  officers were killed and  were injured in these  shootings the huffington post reported thursday  sixty nine of these shootings have taken place in states with background check laws on all handgun sales  these states employ   full time sworn police officers  in states without these laws  which employ   officers  there have been  shootings of law enforcement officers twenty one of the  states with the highest number of shooting incidents per police officer don t have background checks on all handgun sales  a huffpost analysis shows seventy five percent of the firearms used in this year s police shootings    total guns  were handguns  according to statistics compiled by the national law enforcement memorial fund  the total number of officer related deaths are up from  and have more than doubled from   with texas being the deadliest state for officers  in texas alone   officers have been shot and killed  including those who died tragically in the ambush in dallas on july   day and night  police officers run toward danger to keep the rest of us safe  and this tragic milestone is a sobering reminder of the risks they face   said john feinblatt  everytown s president   we have to reduce those risks  and data shows that we can   by making it harder for criminals to get guns  it s long past time to close the dangerous loophole in our laws that lets criminals buy guns with no background check and no questions asked  licensed gun dealers are required by federal law to perform background checks on buyers  however  unlicensed dealers  such as individuals who sell weapons online or at gun shows  are not bound by the same federal law  thus allowing anyone   regardless of their mental health or criminal history   to purchase firearms  endangering the lives of millions looking at this further  currently  only  states require background checks for handgun purchases and out of those  only  require universal background checks for all firearms  out of those few states that require background checks  everytown data shows that officers in those states are  percent less likely to be killed with handguns  that is astounding the data strongly suggests that expanding background checks and enforcing them in all states would save countless lives  yet the nra strongly opposes this insisting that laws don t stop criminals from getting guns  while there is some logic in this  a large percentage of shootings  not just officer related  were committed by licensed gun owners  a study done of four concealed carry states in  showed that  shooting deaths were committed by licensed owners    in florida   in texas   in ohio and  in washington the nra refused to comment on these studies  stating that they needed  more information  about how the research was conducted  but sarah tofte  everytown s research director  said the group is  confident  in its research methods  the factors that contribute to these shootings are complicated  and no single policy can explain all of the variation   she told huffpost   that said  we know from other research that background checks do save lives  and states owe it to their first responders to do everything in their power to protect them  it s very clear and simple   if more states require universal background checks  the chance of police officer shootings will reduce by more than  percent  gun reform needs to happen featured image via getty stewart f  house stringer
