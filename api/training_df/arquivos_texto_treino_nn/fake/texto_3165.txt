sen  jeff sessions  r al  is trump s pick for attorney general  the u s  attorney general is generally someone who not only knows what s legal and illegal but also knows what s right and what s wrong  sessions doesn t know right from wrong  at least insofar as civil rights goes  he s desperate to change his image as a racist prick  but real civil rights lawyers aren t having any of it he s even cited civil rights cases that he supposedly worked on  but it turns out  all of that is a bald faced lie  several attorneys who have fought long and hard for true civil rights penned an op ed  which appeared in the washington post  denouncing sessions for pretending to be a civil rights champion actually  they didn t just denounce him  they annihilated him for it  right off the bat  they said  attorney general nominee jeff sessions is trying to mislead his senate colleagues  and the country  into believing he is a champion for civil rights  we are former justice department civil rights lawyers who worked on the civil rights cases that sessions cites as evidence for this claim  so we know  the record isn t sessions  to burnish  we won t let the nominee misstate his civil rights history to get the job of the nation s chief law enforcement officer  sessions had to fill out a questionnaire and file it with the senate judiciary committee  in that questionnaire  he listed four cases that he claims he personally litigated as alabama s attorney general in the   after receiving backlash for that lie  he then tried to claim he provided  assistance and guidance on these cases  one of the examples these lawyers give to show sessions is trying exaggerating his record on civil rights  sessions supported reauthorizing the voting rights act ten years ago  and he s promoting that as solid evidence that he s a civil rights champ the truth there is that the reauthorization passed the senate by a vote of    as such  there was no feat of courage involved in supporting that reauthorization  it would mean a lot more if he d supported it with significant opposition from his own party  then he celebrated the supreme court s decision to gut the voting rights act  which led to southern states working their tails off to keep minorities from voting sessions also once lost out on a judgeship because of his racism  in   the state of alabama turned him down for a position as a judge after he called a black lawyer  boy   he supposedly also told another attorney to  be careful what you say to white folks   he also denigrated both the aclu and the naacp as  un american  organizations that were inspired by communists because equality is totally a communist trait the naacp has actually been protesting his nomination as attorney general  and several got arrested for doing so  for as  not racist  as sessions supposedly is  one would think he d yell at anyone who arrested peaceful protesters who were just speaking out about racial inequality instead  these protesters face charges of criminal trespass the civil rights attorneys that actually know what they re talking about say that sessions   involvement  in the cases they themselves litigated is limited to his signing a complaint and maybe a few briefs  he didn t personally litigate anything  and if he had  he probably would have done so with an eye towards   black people bring this on themselves because they re black  in fact  they end their op ed with  sessions has not worked to protect civil rights  he worked against civil rights at every turn  sessions knows that his real record on race and civil rights is harmful to his chances for confirmation  so he has made up a fake one  but many of us who were there   in alabama in the    and beyond   are still around  we lived that story  too  and we are here to testify that sessions has done many things throughout his  year career  protecting civil rights has not been one of them  both sessions and trump probably think that congress will buy their revisionist history  to them  equality doesn t matter   in their view  white people rule and everyone else drools  there s a reason white supremacists are thrilled with trump s election win  and this is it  jeff sessions doesn t give a flying fuck about civil rights  he doesn t know a thing about litigating civil rights cases  he ll make a shitty attorney general  and will only help trump further his agenda of setting this country back  years featured image via kevin hagen getty images
