paul ryan said that the house would implement a completely transparent process for repealing and replacing obamacare  either ryan has no idea what his fellow republicans are up to  or he himself lied about this  he specifically told the  today show  we re not hatching some bill in a backroom and plopping it on the american people s front door  really  there s a problem  considering that rep  chris collins  of new york  said to the washington examiner   be made available thursday morning to republicans in a basement room of an office building that adjoins the capitol  that s what they consider transparent  please  what are they afraid of according to new york magazine  the gop s  replacement  will absolutely rip health insurance away from millions of americans   the same millions who were able to afford insurance under the aca  that s especially true for low income americans  who benefited greatly from the aca s expansion of medicaid  and also the tax subsidies that went towards the cost of premiums for people who made too much for medicaid  but too little to afford insurance any other way in trump s empty speech to a joint session of congress  he reiterated the old gop talking points of expanded health savings accounts and tax credits  the thing with those tax credits  though  is that they re based entirely on age  a  year old wealthy person would get the same tax credit as a  year old poor person  that gives the poor a lot less help than they re getting now  while the rich get a tax credit they don t need but isn t that par for the course for the gop  anything to help their rich buddies  and the poor can go fuck themselves  because they really should have thought of all of this before they decided to be poor  right  right wrong  that would be part of why house republicans only want this plan to be made available to republicans  democrats and everyone else would rightfully blast it for what it is   more help to the rich while leaving the poor in the dust the rest of the problems likely have to do with insurance coverage and the deficit  but according to collins  the house health subcommittee might vote on their bill before the congressional budget office has a chance to release its score  so it s not yet clear who all  besides the poor  will be hurt  that would probably be another reason republicans don t want anyone else seeing this it s disgusting  it s ridiculous  it s manipulative  and it s classic republicanism  they ve sunk to a low we didn t think they were capable of featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
