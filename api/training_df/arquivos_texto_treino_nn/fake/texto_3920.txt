it s hard not to love joss whedon  the director of  the avengers  films  not only is he a great film director capable of seamlessly blending action  drama and comedy  but he can also be rather outspoken on politics  to that end  he created a very short film titled   if congress was your co worker   and it s  well  entirely too perfect for the situation in which we now find ourselves star trek s chris pine stars in the video as leonard  the biggest  most babyish obstructionist in the whole entire history of everything  his co workers responsible people who actually know how to work and want to get things done have to put up with his ridiculous  puerile behavior that s stopping everything they try to do in its tracks leonard starts off opposing the company s new healthcare plan  and when he s asked what they should do instead  he says   not that   and then shuts down the entire company while bragging that he still gets paid later on  the company appoints a consultant named bob to  untangle legal issues   and leonard literally blocks him  he blocks everyone s views of bob while screaming   booooo   and says he doesn t like bob  when the boss asks why  he shouts   because you chose him  if any of that sounds familiar  it s because it s a perfect illustration of why neither congress  nor obama  has been able to get anything done since the tea party wave of   leonard is the tea party  and also the larger republican party that allowed the tea party to come to power and do this to us  that includes ridiculous and draconian views of the lgbtq community  religious and racial minorities  and things like sexual harassment and assault  all of which are also touched on the video ends with the company getting together to do something about leonard  watch what they do below  and remember to go vote on tuesday  nov    if you haven t already done so featured image via screen capture from embedded video
