even from the beginning of his hate fueled  bigoted presidential campaign  it was obvious that donald trump did not give a damn about america and the values the country was built upon  trump has carried this anti american attitude straight into his failing  undeserved presidency   and yet he has the nerve to call the media the  enemy of the american people  because of unfavorable coverage despite how many distractions trump tries to create to hide his failures and f ckups  we shouldn t forget who the real threat to america is   and msnbc host joe scarborough wasn t afraid to point it out  earlier today  scarborough called out trump s attacks on the media  calling it the real enemy because it might encourage violence against the journalists who are reporting the truth about trump on morning joe  scarborough echoed the comments of republican senator john mccain  who said that trump s attack on the media sounded like a dictator and that he had gone too far  scarborough ripped trump  it s one thing to say the press is liberal  it s one thing to say the  circuit  court  is liberal  but when you start saying that somebody is an enemy of the people  then that does incite people to violence   especially if it s coming from the president of the united states  scarborough revealed that thanks to trump  journalists are now getting death threats on a daily basis just for telling the truth about the trump administration  putting their lives in danger  when you receive tweets every day  and somebody s threatening your life and they talk about lynching you and your family after president trump has his way with the media  this happens over and over again  and i don t think there s anybody who s in the media that doesn t hear that every day  so yeah  this is very  very dangerous  scarborough also nailed trump on his  fake news  tantrums  noting the irony that trump and his team are the most dishonest administration we ve ever seen  most recently  trump even made up a completely bogus terrorist attack  scarborough said  as jesus said  don t throw stones if you live in glass houses  this man lives in the biggest glass house there is when it comes to a disconnection from truth  so to attack the media and then say they re enemies of the people is beyond the pale  and if trump thought that attacking the press was going to shut the media down  scarborough gave him a brutal reality check  let s talk about things in a way that donald trump can understand   ratings   and let s just put it all out on the table  everybody s ratings are up  newspaper subscriptions at the new york times are exploding  the washington post doing better than it s ever done before  cnn   from the day that donald trump called them fake news  cnn s numbers have exploded  donald trump has been jeff zucker s   you can tell they ve been great friends for a very long time  because there is nothing donald trump could do to help cnn more  they re enjoying record numbers  you can watch scarborough rip trump below  featured image via screenshot and chip somodevilla   getty images
