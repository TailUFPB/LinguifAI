in an unreal feat  trump managed to have two humiliating interviews come out on the same day  while much of the country  and indeed  the world  was laughing at trump for his insane screed about the civil war  cbs news released their own interview with trump which showed the president descending into sheer madness when pressed to support his  false  claim that president obama wiretapped him  for those worried about the mental stability of the person currently within arm s reach of america s nuclear arsenal  it was perhaps the more disturbing of the two interviews you can almost hear trump s staffers groan when he  out of nowhere  brings up the wiretap claims  sensing a moment to finally press trump on these unsubstantiated smears of his predecessor  cbs s john dickerson asks trump pointblank whether he still stands by the accusations that obama is a  bad and sick  guy who had committed felonies on par with nixon s watergate scandal  since making the claims  trump s arguments have been repeatedly debunked and zero evidence to support him has emerged  has he changed his mind just the opposite  he appears to have become even more delusional  i think our side s been proven very strongly and everybody s talking about it and frankly  it should be discussed  trump added   we should find out what the hell is going on  dickerson   i m asking you because you don t want it to be fake news  i want to hear it from president trump  trump   you don t have to ask me  you don t have to ask me  dickerson   why not  trump   because i have my own opinions  you can have your own opinions  dickerson points out that trump s  own opinions  are kind of important because he s the president of the united states  at this point  trump shuts down completely  ending the interview and running to his desk  the last shot the camera captures is trump visibly fuming  facts  it seems  irritate him featured image via cbs news
