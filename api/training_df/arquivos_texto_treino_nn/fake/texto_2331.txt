recently  the mainstream media  yes  including the  liberals   fawned over president trump s  presidential  address to a joint session of congress  why  because he actually acted like a semi decent human being  instead of going off script on his usual childish tantrums and praise of himself  he stuck to the teleprompter and delivered a pretty forgettable speech there was just one tiny thing that the mainstream media failed to notice  his speech was absolutely riddled with lies  and when we say riddled  we mean a significant chunk of the things he said in his hour speech were either misleading  factually incorrect  or flat out falsehoods the center for american progress found that in the  minutes president trump spoke  he lied  times  that s one lie almost every minute through an incredibly detailed spread sheet  cap was able to identify every false statement and correct it for the record  it s pretty damning to see how often and easily the president of the united states can lie to the american people among president trump s most egregious lies were everyone knows trump lies and lies often  we ve known this since the campaign  we know that everything listed above can be easily disproved  the only reason trump got high marks for his speech was   less people watched than the previous one    more republicans watched than independents and democrats  and   he spoke  normally   besides that  it was typical trump  an ill informed demagogue who stokes fear by racially scapegoating mexicans and blaming everything on president obama the media  and indeed the american electorate  cannot let president trump get away with being a shameful liar simply because he talks in a polite voice and stays on script  america is better than to forgive this fascist after all he s done to this country and our standing in the world  be vigilant featured image chip somodevilla getty images
