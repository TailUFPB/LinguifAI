it s like something out of a dystopian novel  having just abandoned america s leadership position in fighting climate change and realizing the move was deeply unpopular  trump ordered a day of celebration   for himself  the event was titled  pittsburgh  not paris   a reference to a line he used to justify pulling out of the paris climate deal president donald trump s campaign announced a  pittsburgh  not paris  rally across from the white house on saturday to celebrate the united states  withdrawal from a global climate agreement here s the twist  trump is holding it in washington d c  not pittsburgh  why  because he s too scared to actually go to pittsburgh and face the wrath of the people he just screwed over hours after invoking the  pittsburgh  not paris  line  the mayor of pittsburgh made it abundantly clear that the city hates trump and found it disgraceful that they used their city s name as a pretext to destroy the planet the president may carry around a little map of the election results  but he clearly doesn t look at it very closely  pittsburgh residents almost all voted against him  the industrial city is a steadfast democratic stronghold  and in fact  one of the reasons it remains so democratic is that it knows full well what happens when republicans don t hold factories and companies to environmental standards as mayor bill peduto explained  pittsburgh is the example  we were that city that china is like today where the smoke was so  filled the air so much  that the streetlights would stay on  hours  that legacy  and the willingness not to return to it  has led pittsburgh and many other cities to announce that they will adhere to the environmental standards laid out by the paris agreement   even if the president is too dim witted to do so for the country at large  mayor peduto made his contempt for trump s actions abundantly clear on cnn trump  i was elected to represent pittsburgh  not parispittsburgh mayor  we voted for hillary clinton with nearly   of the vote pic twitter com   the situation room   cnnsitroom  june    peduto s comments and the knowledge that pittsburgh hates trump may have led him to schedule his  pittsburgh  rally in a park next to the white house  there he can prevent people who disagree with him from coming and booing  like everything trump does  it was about image  people booing would have been a much more accurate depiction of where the country stands on trump s decision   everyone from policy experts to scientists to politicians to average americans found trump s bankrupting of america s role in fighting climate change to be disgusting and dangerous  instead  like so many of these  campaign style  rallies trump holds  the thing will be one long exercise in vanity for the man who once claimed to be working  for the people  the symbolism of holding his anti climate rally in the  swamp  of washington d c  is a bit on the nose featured image via alex wong getty images
