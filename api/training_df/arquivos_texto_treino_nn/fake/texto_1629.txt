it is no secret that president donald trump likes to call any press coverage that he does not like  fake   this weekend he upped the ante a bit when he did an interview with john dickerson for cbs s face the nation  trump took the opportunity to bash the show to the show s host after dickerson called trump out on some of his policy reversals over the course of the first  days of his presidency  this exchange happened  it s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge  it s very funny when the fake media goes out   which we call the mainstream media  which sometimes  i must say is you   said trump  you mean  me personally   asked dickerson your show  i love your show  i call it  deface the nation   but your show is sometimes not exactly correct   said trump  featured image via cbs
