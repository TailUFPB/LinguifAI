just judging from donald trump s disastrous performance at the first presidential debate last week  it was clear that democratic candidate hillary clinton came out the winner  trump couldn t give solid answers for any of the questions moderator lester holt asked  fact checkers called him out for lying constantly  and his weaknesses on policy were exposed for all to see  still  trump insisted for days that he d won the debate and that he was rising in the polls  all while citing inaccurate or bogus statistics a new national poll has come out to set the record straight  according to the latest nbc news surveymonkey weekly election tracking poll  clinton is ahead of trump    to     and unlike any of trump s polls  it s actually legit  here s how the election is panning out so far now  trump is probably going to claim that this poll  and this election  and the upcoming debate  is  rigged    because he always comes up with an excuse for why he sucks  but the truth is  trump only has himself to blame this poll also discovered that one of the main reasons trump is failing so hard is because he s destroyed his chances of appealing to women  last election  women accounted for   of voters   and you can bet that more women than ever will come out to vote in november to prevent the most misogynistic presidential candidate from getting into the white house  thanks to trump s sexist  degrading and objectifying attacks and comments  trump has pretty much excluded women from his fan base  even gop women hate him this was especially true for women who were not married  trump s standing with minorities is even more horrendous  he has never even been able to leave the single digits when it comes to african american voters good job  trump  you re in the home stretch of the election  and you re destroying your campaign by the day  sad featured image via ralph freso   getty images
