james fallows has been a journalist since  and he covered the watergate scandal so he knows what he s talking about and when fallows says that donald trump s ongoing and ever growing russia scandal is worse than watergate  every american should take notice that s exactly what fallows did in a new article for the atlantic published on friday fallows remembers the watergate scandal clearly despite the fact that it unfolded  years ago the scandal is known as the watergate scandal because some of president richard nixon s goons broke into the democratic national committee offices at the watergate hotel nixon tried to cover up the crime by repeatedly lying and refusing to cooperate with investigations  he went so far as to fire archibald cox  the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation  cox wanted nixon to release white house recordings and nixon refused  nixon wanted cox to back off but cox refused  nixon then fired him  after that  it was all downhill for nixon  the supreme court ordered him to release the tapes and they were so damning that nixon resigned before he could be impeached but trump s russia scandal is worse  based simply on what is known so far  this scandal looks worse than watergate   fallows wrote   worse for and about the president  worse for the overall national interest  worse in what it suggests about the american democratic system s ability to defend itself  fallows points out that watergate was a mere burglary in an effort to find information on nixon s political opponents  trump s scandal  on the other hand  is nothing less than attacks by an authoritarian foreign government on the fundamentals of american democracy  by interfering with an election and doing so as part of a sustained effort that included parallel interference in the united kingdom  france  germany  and elsewhere  at worst  such efforts might actually have changed the election results  at least  they were meant to destroy trust in democracy  not much of this is fully understood or proven  but the potential stakes are incomparably greater than what happened during watergate  crime and cover up alike fallows then compared nixon s firing of cox to trump s firing of fbi director james comey while nixon  paid lip service to the concept of due process and checks and balances  and at least acted like he was  sticking to some recognizable rules   trump s has openly disdained and flouted the rules  nothing donald trump has done  on the campaign trail or in office  has expressed awareness of  or respect for  established rules   fallows continued   nixon s private comments could be vile  but nothing he said in public is comparable to trump s dismissing james comey as a  showboat   or the thuggishly menacing tweet that trump sent out today  the tweet fallows referenced is a clear threat from trump aimed at comey in an effort to keep him from speaking to the press james comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    while nixon was a  dark and complex  person who was  deeply knowledgeable  and  publicly disciplined  and possessed  political and strategic intelligence   trump has repeatedly proven that  he is impulsive  and ignorant  and apparently beyond the reach of any control  even his own  and what s also worse about trump s russia scandal is the way republicans have circled the wagons around trump and have made attempt after attempt to bury any investigations into his misconduct while republicans like jason chaffetz  mitch mcconnell  and devin nunes have all tried to sabotage investigations on trump s behalf  it was republicans like charles wiggins  barry goldwater  and howard baker who put their country before party and sided against nixon the republicans who turned against nixon will be remembered for doing the right thing when their country needed them most  today s republicans will only be remembered for doing nothing while their country burned to the ground  fallows even points out that all it would take is three brave republicans in the senate to join democrats to get a truly independent investigation rolling the question is whether they actually care about their country  the constitution  and the integrity of the office of the presidency enough to do so our country needs heroes now more than ever  republicans could be those heroes if they would just stop being cowards and stop being trump s puppets featured image  olivier douliery pool getty images
