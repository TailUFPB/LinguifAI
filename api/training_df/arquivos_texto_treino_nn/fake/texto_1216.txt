the news of the day is the testimony that former fbi director james comey gave to the senate intelligence committee this morning  along with trump s lawyer s response in which there were all kinds of false allegations leveled at comey  and while we were all swept up in that  the house was busy sucker punching us  they held an important vote today on what to do with the dodd frank financial reform bill that was passed in the wake of the financial crisis of  they re ridiculously calling their new bill the choice act  it basically allows the banks to decide for themselves whether they continue to abide by dodd frank or not  because self regulation  particularly of the financial sector  has always worked so well in the past the choice act has a capital requirement that many banks say is still too high  but in light of what else this bill does  that s a minor complaint  the bill guts the consumer financial protection bureau  which was created specifically as an oversight body to help rein in risky behavior on the part of the big banks paul ryan calls it  a jobs bill for main street   oh  please  mr  speaker  you know we can see right through your baloney  especially on this while ryan and many of his cohorts are cheering the choice act s passage  some of the more sane republicans and most democrats are slamming it for  paving the way back to economic damage of the same scale  or worse   as maxine waters put it furthermore  a story on fortune s website says that this bill would prohibit the cfpb from publishing the data it collects on complaints about banks and other financial services  such as credit reporting  that  in turn  makes it more difficult for consumers to make informed choices  and it also could potentially remove an avenue for filing complaints and actually getting results  individuals can also file complaints to try to right a wrong  such as when a credit bureau refuses to fix an error on a credit score  credit reporting bureaus are notorious for mistakes  with as many as one in five consumers potentially having an error in their credit file yet the three main credit bureaus  equifax  experian  and trans union  lack proper incentives to fix these errors  which is why it should come as no surprise that they are the three most complained about companies in the cfpb database   we know that the gop doesn t care one whit about creating jobs  helping people in general or protecting the economy  they just proved it  again  with this after proving it with their insipid obamacare replacement  fortunately  like the ahca  this has little chance of even making it to the senate floor for a vote featured image via ty wright getty images
