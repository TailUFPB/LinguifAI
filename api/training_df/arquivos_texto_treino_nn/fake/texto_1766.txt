not too long after taking office  trump decided to start asking around about how the government could roll back regulations and make it easier for companies to get their projects approved  but he didn t ask ordinary americans  or small business owners  he didn t ask people in small towns and big cities  he asked big corporations what their opinions were  he sought advice from the same people he blasted as  the swamp  during his campaign  and promised repeatedly to drain it now  given who he s appointed to his cabinet  it was pretty clear that he had zero intention of draining the swamp  trump specifically targeted manufacturers and fossil fuel producers for this  probably because he thinks allowing them to run roughshod will at least help him pretend he s truly bringing manufacturing jobs back  but this is even more egregious because major industry insiders don t care about people  they don t care who they hurt in pursuit of the almighty dollar  of course they want industry regulations cut   these are the industries people fought  and died  against to stop things like child labor and worker exploitation the white house got  comments total  manufacturers went after the epa the hardest  with  of those comments targeting that agency  the epa received  comments total  because of course it did  and companies targeted the clean air and clean water acts with  and  comments respectively  because having to clean up after yourself so everyone around you can breathe clean air and drink clean water is just too difficult trump s decision to halt key provisions of the clean water act has already angered people  particularly those living in communities that are especially vulnerable to poisoned water  the director of the sierra club s  beyond coal  campaign has said  trump s attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury  lead  and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible  after years of peer reviewed studies  extensive input from medical experts and scientists  and thorough review of public comments  the epa made the right call in finalizing strong clean water protections against coal plants dumping toxic heavy metals into our waterways as a mother  i m frankly horrified that the epa would put the safety of drinking water at risk for millions of americans  but that s exactly what they ve done  coming from west virginia  where we ve had enormous challenges with maintaining clean water supplies due to the coal industry s political influence  i m outraged that these common sense protections are under attack from the epa itself  but  well  profit is king here  even though the coal industry is never going to recover no matter what trump tries to do  a full breakdown of the agencies and regulations that these companies would like to see rolled back  if not outright eliminated  is below bp says it wants to make it easier to drill for gas and oil in the very same gulf that was devastated in the deepwater horizon disaster  because why force them be careful when they can lie about being able to self regulate   big corporations can t self regulate   and the associated general contractors of america wants to roll back regulations for paid sick leave for government contractors  they probably want to get rid of overtime rules  too of course  business groups like the u s  chamber of commerce are applauding trump for this  they see this administration as one that is finally interested in relieving businesses  from a regulatory onslaught that occurred  principally  during the prior administration  others are not so sure this is the best way to do things  though  because companies will always  always  always act in their own best interests  and damn the rest of the world  jeffrey zients  who worked on regulatory issues under obama  said  at a time when many ceos are focused on the short term and looking to maximize their profitability each quarter  i believe that a lot of their aversion to these regulations reflects a short term mind set that values reducing costs over anything else that s unfortunate  because well crafted regulations are an important part of creating sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run  a detail  these companies don t want sustainable and fair economic prosperity in the long run  they want unfair and profitable in the short run  it s the nature of the beast  and it s why the business world needs strong regulation  instead  trump is trying to give them back the ability to do what they want  when they want  how they want  without regard to the harm they cause featured image by ron sachs   pool via getty images
