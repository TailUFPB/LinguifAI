it s no secret that donald trump has a hard time with not only attracting minority voters  but also the votes of millenials that have grown up in a less racist  more diverse and accepting country than the america that trump wants to enforce if he wins this election but there are still young voters that are attracted to trump  like  year old jake anantha from charlotte  north carolina  rather than be thankful for anantha s support at a time when trump is basically dying in the polls  the trump campaign decided to kick this young republican out of a rally on thursday because he wasn t white jake was more than excited to attend trump s event and give trump his first primary vote  he was even wearing a trump shirt to the rally  but his joy quickly left him when he was removed by police from the charlotte convention center because the trump campaign had accused him of being a protester  jake s only  offense  was  having dark skin   according to ramesh anantha  jake s father ramesh complained that as a young person of color  his son should have been been treated with respect   especially since trump s rally was about supporting minorities  ramesh  whose parents immigrated from india  said  it s unbelievably ironic  and argues that his son should have been looked at as a perfect trump supporter  he should have been somebody they re putting up on stage  screenshot of jake being removed by securityaccording to the young supporter himself  this incident has changed his mind about supporting trump  now that his campaign s true colors have shown  in an interview on friday  jake said that initially  he didn t mind trump s brash campaign  when i saw him on tv  i personally didn t mind his rhetoric  i defended him  when people called him a racist  i said he s a critic of our flawed immigration system  he s strong on islamic terrorism  jake had gotten to the rally early and was able to get a position near the stage  he was just standing there innocently minding his own business when security tapped him on the shoulder and tried to escort him out  they said  we know who you are  you ve been at many other rallies  jake tried to object and plea that it had been his first trump rally and was not a protester  but police removed him anyway  the event had been private  so trump s staff had full control over who could attend   and jake was apparently not white enough  forced to stay outside the convention center or risk being arrested  jake watched white people enter the rally effortlessly  he said  i thought  trump  was for all people  i don t believe he is for all people anymore  why are all these white people allowed to attend and i m not  the trump campaign has failed to apologize to jake  and the young voter says that this incident has made him change his mind about trump  he is now planning to vote for libertarian gary johnson jake was not the only minority to be ejected from this event  rose hamid  a muslim who was peacefully protesting by handing out flower pens  was also removed when jake was taken out of the rally  you can watch a video of jake and rose being removed below featured image via mark wallheiser   getty images
