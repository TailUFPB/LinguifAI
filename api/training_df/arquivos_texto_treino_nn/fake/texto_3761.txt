if donald trump picked retired general david petraeus as the next secretary of state or secretary of defense  it would be his worst hypocrisy to date for months  trump attacked hillary clinton relentlessly for keeping a private email server as secretary of states  accusing her of exposing classified information even though the fbi cleared her of any such wrongdoing you know who the fbi didn t clear of such wrongdoing  david petraeus and that s why trump would be a hypocrite if he actually offered him either significant government posts  but he is doing exactly that back in   petraeus infamously resigned as director of the cia after it was revealed that he had been engaged in an affair with his biographer paula broadwell  whom he gave access to eight  black books  filled with highly classified information  which included  the identities of covert officers  war strategy  intelligence capabilities and mechanisms  diplomatic discussions   and discussions he had with president obama it was such a terrible breach in national security that the justice department wanted to prosecute him for committing a felony  and would have if petraeus had not agreed to a plea deal in  so while hillary clinton was doing nothing different from what other secretaries of state have done  it s pretty clear that what petraeus did makes him the real threat to national security and it s unclear if he could even get the security clearance necessary for a secretary of state or defense to have in order to do the job  after all  trump said of clinton in september that   if she applied for a low level job at the state department today she couldn t even get a security clearance  obviously  trump could always pull strings and we already know that republicans in congress are hypocrites who can be easily bought  but picking petraeus for either one of these top jobs would demonstrate that he is a hypocrite who doesn t give a damn about national security and that he has a double standard by picking petraeus  trump would also be admitting once again that he lied to his supporters  trump has been stringing them along for months getting them to chant  lock her up  every time he calls hillary clinton a criminal  but if anybody should be locked up  it s petraeus  he literally shared highly classified information that could have put people and the country at risk  but trump is considering him anyway and that is infuriating featured image  wikimedia
