the august    issue of newsweek is one you might want to pick up  in fact  if you happen to own a golf course or two  you might even want to hang some copies up for decoration  because all that s missing from the cover is the golden club he got as a gift from the pm of japan leaning against his easy chair accompanying the cover is a scathing op ed from brendan smialowski that tears apart the legend trump has tried to cultivate  he paints a picture of a successful presidency so far  with lots of accomplishments  admiration   deals  with foreign leaders  and a jet setting lifestyle befitting the king he surely thinks he is  smialowski disagrees the most impressive quality of trump s myth is not just that it strays from reality but how thoroughly  even aggressively  it contravenes easily confirmable fact  when he was king  he was the king of debt  and he may still owe as much as    billion to creditors  his casinos closed  his airline went bust  but even as he accrued failures  lawsuits and debts  trump managed to turn  trump  into a synonym for success  the letters were made of plastic  but they were dipped in gold the article is a must read  but it s the image on the cover  titled  lazy boy  that steals the show image via twitterthe composite image  the caption  the details in this picture   it s almost too good to be true  i don t know if i would have depicted the corpulent commander with a diet soda  but the lazily wiped cheeto dust on his   oxford shirt more than makes up for the forgiving choice of beverage beside the image is a damning round up of his presidency by the numbers   six months in office   days at golf clubs  zero pieces of major legislation  i wouldn t be surprised if all that fast food starts coming back on the president pretty quickly when this issue hits the stands featured image via mario tama getty images
