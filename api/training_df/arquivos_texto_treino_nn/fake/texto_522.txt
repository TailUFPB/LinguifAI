back when conservative politics were actually political  rather than social  there was a guy by the actual real name of grover norquist who summed up the aim of republican politicians i don t want to abolish government  i simply want to reduce it to the size where i can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub yes  back in the days before nazis invaded america  republicans and neo conservatives focused on just three things  they wanted endless war  tax breaks for the rich  and to dismantle government regulations  norquist s quote is from   but it sounds a little like he s been skulking around the white house or something because the actual conservatives surrounding donald trump appear to be pushing back to that agenda oh  and speaking of drowning  that s what happens when you remove safety standards   those mean old nasty gub mint regulations  so why would anyone do that  well  the short answer is money  it s always money  and fewer regulations mean faster  cheaper work  normally  a politician can t come out and just say  we re getting rid of safety so rich people can have more money   but trump can  because his base is made up of equal parts nazis  people too busy making biblical excuses for him to notice  and just plain dumbasses there wasn t really a chance to test this version of the  shoot someone on  avenue  theory  though  trump s announcement that he was revoking rules protecting the environment in order to speed up cheap infrastructure was cloaked by his simultaneous defense of the nazis who murdered heather heyer in charlottesville the rule change that delivers on the promise of this article s headline is one that used to require federal construction to account for rising sea levels when planning and building a project  that s great for constructing a highway that should take three years in less than one  it s not so great for the people living next to it  or the cities it runs through  the change is to an obama rule that mandated construction two feet above future flood levels  which means that without that requirement  those fast  cheap roads could be underwater following even a mild natural disaster fema has a few things to say about flooding   that it s the leading cause of death among natural disasters in america  that   of all emergency declarations are due to floods  that it costs the government billions to recover from major flooding   but why not take it from me  i know from floods  i live in a town that used to flood every single year  until our city hunkered down and made some riverfront construction rules  that is  the first year that i moved to this tiny hamlet in the pacific northwest  i found myself sandbagging a river with my new neighbors by november  my roommates and i ended up at one of their parents  house  miles away  because the water came four feet up the stairs to our apartment why did i live in the floodplain  because i was poor  in fact  people in relative or severe poverty make up the largest percentage of those who live in the path of floods  so it s not only states that will have to pay for flooding damage due to this rule reversal  the hardest hit by this will be those least able to recover from it featured image via michael b  thomas getty images
