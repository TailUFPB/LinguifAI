yesterday  florida voters headed to the polls to cast their votes in the state s primary election  among those who won their primaries were  as expected  democrats patrick murphy  senate  and debbie wassermann schultz  house  who won their perspective primaries as did republican senate incumbent marco rubio however  there was one controversial incumbent who was sent packing  the state attorney in florida s fourth judicial circuit court encompassing jacksonville  angela corey  was trounced by almost unknown corporate attorney melissa nelson   to  percent here s why that s good angela corey is  in the simplest terms  one of the most unethical  cruel  and heartless attorneys in florida  and quite possibly the whole united states  an eye for an eye republican  corey was notorious for charging children as adults in the justice system  according to human rights watch   percent of the young people who were charged as adults under corey s watch ended up going to prison  and the disproportional number of these kids were black or hispanic  these statistics prove to be the highest in the state  contrast these statistics  corey s jurisdiction incarcerated   juveniles in the jacksonville area  compared to  in miami dade  the most populated judicial district with higher rates of youth  during the same time period    corey was also the prosecutor who put marissa alexander in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband  according to the nation corey charged alexander with aggravated assault  which carried a minimum sentence of  years in prison   her prosecution of alexander spurred online petitions and protests from domestic violence groups  who argued that alexander was being overcharged for protecting herself  alexander ultimately served three years in prison  in an interview  corey told me that she didn t understand why her actions were  newsworthy   arguing that alexander had endangered her children  who were in the next room   how am i the bad guy in that situation   she asked one of her cruelest cases involved christian fernandez  a  year old boy of hispanic origin who beat his  year old brother to death  when she charged him as an adult  ignoring his past of extreme abuse  corey went ahead and and pressed for first degree murder charges  which would have put him away for the rest of his life  christian was reported to have shoved his brother into a bookshelf  injuring his head  fernandez s mother  biannela susana  waited too long before seeking medical attention  and the boy slipped into a coma before dying  a little boy who unintentionally killed his brother was charged as an adult by a vengeful  power  hungry prosecutor  luckily  christian fernandez will not spend the rest of his life in prison  pleaded as a juvenile to manslaughter and aggravated battery  and will be sentenced to prison until he is   in a bit of irony  melissa nelson was one of the attorneys who worked on christian s case if corey had her way  this young boy would have never left prison then there was perhaps the most famous case of them all  the george zimmerman trial  corey of course blew it  while representing the state  corey had zimmerman charged with second degree murder  which some felt was an intentional overcharge  and felt that manslaughter would have been better for a  guilty  verdict  corey also came under scrutiny for withholding information in relation to data accessed on trayvon martin s phone  when it came to light that such information was withheld  corey fired the employee responsible for releasing it  attorney alan dershowitz also accused corey of filing a false and or misleading affidavit pertaining to the case  a charge that could have gotten corey disbarred not only all of this  corey couldn t even uphold ethical standards that are beholden to attorneys and those who are in office corey has struggled to rise above several controversies in the run up to the primary  some larger than others  she was accused of forcing her office staff to contribute to her campaign with their time and money  a group of lawyers accused her of voter suppression and criticized by a group of vets for an alleged distorted campaign ad corey also used    of taxpayer money to upgrade her pension plan  and    in bonuses for her office staff  corey was able to maneuver around a florida statute than bans such bonuses for public employees by claiming the disbursements were  one time  pay raises so the state of florida made the right decision in sending a racist  lying  thieving prosecutor packing  it remains to be seen how corey s successor will handle cases regarding people of color and youth  but once crux of this race was ethics  and boy did angela corey lack any featured image via win mcnamee getty images
