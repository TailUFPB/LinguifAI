donald trump once again bullied nbc correspondent katy tur during a rally and put her safety at risk  prompting nicole wallace to blast the republican nominee in response during a florida rally on wednesday  boos and jeers were aimed at katy tur by a crowd of thousands after trump accused her of not showing the size of the audience on camera as some sort of scheme by the media to rig the election here s footage of the rally via youtube  it is a unique experience to have an entire crowd of people  whether it is an open air venue  like we were today  or a stadium with    people booing you   tur told brian williams after the event tur explained that trump knows he is full of shit because he jokes in private to reporters that he knows how television works and that while one camera is trained on the candidate to get his speech on tape  there are plenty of other cameras filming crowd shots  this is a schtick that he does to rile up his base  it s to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor  it s to give them an excuse to berate someone other than donald trump and to blame somebody for something that doesn t look as good as they want it to look   tur said but while tur braved the storm and stood her ground against trump  gop strategist nicole wallace reacted with shock that a presidential candidate would engage in such bullying  it s bullying  it s bullying a woman   wallace began when asked about her thoughts on trump attacking tur   it s bullying a journalist who covers him  it s not only odd in politics  it s odd in public life  it s something that if any of our kids did in school they probably would get kicked out he has normalized cyber bullying  he has normalized the sort of bullying of a woman in a huge chanting crowd  he has normalized behavior that maybe had its seed in standing up to what a lot of republicans think is a biased media  but it has taken on a life of its own that is dangerous and sinister  in the end  it will not help him win   it will be part of the reason that he loses  here s the video via youtube trump s attack on tur is especially dangerous because his deplorable supporters are bloodthirsty right now and have threatened democrats and the media with violence if trump doesn t win the election  tur even had to have secret service protection earlier this year because trump singled her out at a rally and caused his supporters to put her safety in serious jeopardy  such behavior by a presidential candidate  or anyone for that matter  is unacceptable donald trump is a bully and america does not need a bully in the white house  especially since he is a thin skinned bully who would have control of the military and our nuclear arsenal  a dangerous combination since trump is easily provoked by even the smallest of slights featured image  screenshot
