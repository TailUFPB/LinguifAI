as we know  the final united nations general assembly of president obama s presidency is occurring in new york city this week  that gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year s very strange presidential election  many seem rather rattled about the idea of a donald trump presidency  while others merely poked fun at trump s buffoonery one diplomat mocked trump  saying   he s a clown   another said   he s nuts   yet another said that trump is an  untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator  well  it s too bad so many american citizens can t see these traits in trump  an ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in america has  percent of these people saying they would vote for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton if they were citizens  while only  percent would hop on the trump train  that in and of itself is very telling dennis jett  who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for pennsylvania state university school of international affairs  says that trump s behavior has made many diplomats nervous and worried about american leadership  america s role in the world  also curious is the fact that the american people have succumbed to the belief that hillary is untrustworthy  while  percent of those surveyed in the ipsos poll say that they find hillary to be  somewhat  or  very much  in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust  on the other hand  just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust trump  a little  while the rest said they don t trust him as far as they can throw him german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier says that trump is a  hate preacher  and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland  french president fran ois hollande says that the gop nominee s excesses make you want to retch  one lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of trump making it to the white house  speaking anonymously  the lobbyist said  foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election  this is less about democrat versus republican  and more about open versus closed economy  vis   vis the rest of the world  with a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the west  there is a real concern it will take hold in the united states and in what form it might show itself post election whether it s immigration reform or trade policy  it feels as if much of the world is opening while the u s  is teetering on closing  even more alarming  the diplomats say  is trump s  america first  and isolationist demagoguery  stephen walt  who works as a professor at the kennedy school of government at harvard university  says of the situation among diplomats  first and most obviously  most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post november situation  and i think they regard trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark whatever hillary clinton s strengths or weaknesses might be  she has been a very conventional politician  at least when it comes to foreign policy  therefore  people don t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she s elected  of course  another source of more than a little concern is trump s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the united states  as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the north atlantic treaty organization  nato    which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of world war ii in other words  the entire world is afraid of donald trump  why aren t the american people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is  donald trump could single handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency featured image via joe raedle getty images
