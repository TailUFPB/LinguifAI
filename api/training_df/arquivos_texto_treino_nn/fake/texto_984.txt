donald trump just posted a provable lie on twitter that makes him look like a complete hypocrite in retaliation against the washington post for correctly reporting that trump is displaying fake time magazine covers of himself at his golf resorts  trump attacked the post as  fake news  and took aim at amazon  which owns the post  seemingly threatening the internet giant and accusing it of not paying their taxes the  amazonwashingtonpost  sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes  which they should  is fake news   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    only is there no such thing as  internet taxes   newsweek pointed out that if trump is somehow referencing amazon s legal battle to not pay state sales taxes he is spreading fake news because amazon lost in court and has been paying sales taxes in the  states that have a sales tax ever since the president may be referring to amazon s years long fight against paying state sales taxes  but amazon lost that battle  and recently has been adding states where it does pay sales tax amazon now pays sales tax in all  states that have a sales tax  on april   amazon began collecting sales taxes in hawaii  idaho  maine and new mexico  the last four holdouts  alaska  delaware  montana  new hampshire  and oregon do not have a state sales tax if trump was  in fact  referring to sales tax in his tweet  the tweet is fake news trump s tweet also smacks of hypocrisy since he actually does not pay his taxes  trump has refused to release his tax returns and the only tax return we have seen shows that trump may not have had to pay federal income taxes for two decades after he wrote off a   million business loss furthermore  trump is currently suing the town of briarcliff manor  new york in an effort to force the town to cut the property taxes on his   million westchester golf course and resort  trump currently pays just     but he is trying to pay only half that amount by devaluing the worth of his own property despite bragging that it was worth   million on his  financial disclosure forms trump has been disputing the taxes in court for years even though the town already gave him a generous tax break in   childishly  trump sends a check every year marked  paid under protest  donald trump is a hypocrite who lies through his teeth  and by attacking amazon and the washington post  he is attacking jeff bezos  who just so happens to be a member of trump s own american technology council  that will probably change soon featured image  alex wong getty images
