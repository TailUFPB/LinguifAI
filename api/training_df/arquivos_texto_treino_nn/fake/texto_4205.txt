as if donald trump hasn t angered enough people already  he has now added the deaf to that long list according to former staffers who worked on the apprentice in   the republican nominee repeatedly questioned academy award winning actress marlee matlin s mental capacity and referred to her as  retarded  just because she happens to be deaf the staffers came forward to disclose trump s treatment of matlin anonymously due to non disclosure agreements they had to sign the staffers told the daily beast that trump repeatedly insulted matlin to her face and behind her back and  would often equate that she was mentally retarded  during the taping of the show  trump would often scribble down notes while sitting at the table of  the boardroom the show s primary set  a person familiar with the notes who helped clean up after tapings said that on one of the pieces of paper  trump wrote   marlee  is she retarded   apparently  trump didn t care about being on a hot mic because one staffer heard trump  make fun of her voice   too   it actually sounded a lot like what he did  the new york times guy   the staffer described as you may recall  a writer for the new york times named serge f  kovaleski criticized trump in an article  trump then responded by openly mocking kovaleski s disability on the campaign trail here s a video of the disgraceful incident via youtube for the record  being deaf means matlin can t hear sounds  it doesn t mean she is mentally impaired  but trump clearly either doesn t know the difference or does not care but reportedly  matlin didn t let trump get away with insulting her  during a segment filmed in the  boardroom   matlin stood up for herself after trump made insensitive remarks about her and treated her as if she had a mental handicap of course  that footage did not air as part of the episode and none of trump s insults were aired during the season  probably because his behavior towards matlin would have caused national outrage and it should definitely cause national outrage now donald trump has a history of insulting people with mental and physical disabilities  and this is unacceptable trump should publicly apologize to matlin for how he treated her and he should definitely drop his bid for the presidency  america deserves a president who won t look down upon people just because they have a disability  disabled people are not inferior  donald trump deserves nothing more than to be a disgraceful footnote in the dustbin of history donald trump deserves nothing more than to be a disgraceful footnote in the dustbin of history featured image  sara d  davis getty images
