donald trump is a disease  the symptoms have always been with us  we ve always been a nation that s at least   completely bigoted a  holes  but this year  donald trump has given them permission to fester and spread their hate germs all over the nation instead of receiving a tip  a waitress in south carolina received a note  you re right if you re thinking that never ends well  it didn t  in the note  the obvious trump supporter told the waitress that she was a disgrace to womankind and a disgrace to her husband   because she worked thank you for your excellent service today   you re a good waitress here s your tip the woman s place is in the home  your place is in the home  it even says so in the bible  you may think that you re contributing to your household by coming into work  but you re not  while you re in here  working  this is the reason your husband must see another woman on his way home from a long day at his work  because you should be home taking care of the household duties  you may think what you are doing  working  is right  it is really essentially a disgrace to his manhood and to the american family  so instead of coming to your  job  and looking for handouts to feed your family  how s about going home and cleaning your house and cooking a hot meal for your husband and children  the way your husband and god intended  and help make america great again  praying for families and our nation notice  make america great again   obviously  that was a reference to donald trump  and obviously  this person has no idea what christianity is about the waitress did respond that she  felt mortified  embarrassed  humiliated even  i felt hurt and a bit heartbroken   she says she s not even married  but she does have a boyfriend who is supportive most waitresses don t work because they have nothing better to do  most people don t work because they have nothing better to do  people  and waitresses are no exception  work because they need money to survive  most families these days need two incomes  but conservatives don t want to do anything to help them  instead  they destroy unions  drive down wages and take away benefits  i m not a religious person  but something makes me think jesus wouldn t approve h t and featured image  patheos
