president elect donald trump needs his twitter account confiscated as soon as possible  every time he sends out an impulsive  ego driven tweet  he is either embarrassing the country or putting it in grave danger  a need for trump s twitter privileges to be taken away was perfectly displayed earlier this week  when trump started talking about nuclear weapons trump was first inspired by a statement made by russian leader vladimir putin  which resulted in him tweeting that the united states needs to greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability   then  trump tried to clarify his comments and only became more irresponsible  during a phone call  he told msnbc s mika brzezinski  let it be an arms race  we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all   terrifying vermont senator bernie sanders took trump head on friday afternoon  when he criticized the future president of the united states for his idiocy  taking to trump s preferred announcement medium  sanders tweeted  congress must not allow the tweeter in chief to unleash a dangerous and costly nuclear arms race  twitterit should be no surprise that sanders would pummel trump on this   sanders made his feelings about nuclear weapons known last year when he said  we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining   nuclear weapons  i think we need major reform in the military making it more cost effective but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us  sanders is spot on to call trump out on how deadly his lack of experience and decision making skills are   and trump is definitely more of a tweeter in chief than a commander in chief  he hasn t shaped up at all to be a respectable future leader since he won the election the fact that trump is being so reckless with the future of the country  and the world  is reason enough to believe that we ve clearly elected the wrong person   and this is something even trump s supporters can t deny  nuclear weapons are nothing to be messing with on social media  george shultz  former secretary of state under ronald reagan  has called them the world s biggest threat  in his book  shultz wrote  their effect in preventing wars has been overrated and reports of the damage they cause tend to be brushed aside to depend on nuclear deterrence indefinitely into the future  especially when other means of deterrence are available  is foolhardy  it s obviously a book that trump should be reading  but since trump doesn t read books unless they re about adolf hitler  maybe he ll see sanders  tweet featured image is a screenshot
