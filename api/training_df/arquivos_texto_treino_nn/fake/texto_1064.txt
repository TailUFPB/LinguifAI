after already having several massive failures under their belts as a result of donald trump s presidency  it sure doesn t seem like the republican party has much faith in the senate s health care bill so far  the gop s attempt at repealing and replacing obamacare has been one disaster after another  and the latest report from cnn shows that they might be preparing to fail one more time  it turns out  republicans are currently trying to protect trump from the health care bill s backlash if it fails by distancing trump from the legislation  cnn reports but white house top aides also see the distance as a way to inoculate trump from considerable blame if the bill fails  a nod to the president s low approval rating and waning political capital  no one knows the senate better than mcconnell   one white house official said when asked about trump s involvement  an acknowledgment that he is taking the lead  a republican senate aide agreed  this is a leadership bill  sink or swim  all credit and all blame stays in the senate   the aide said  adding this political reality   this gives the president cover  in a sense  if it fails  now  in all fairness  the gop might have chosen to keep trump far away from this health care bill because the more he s involved in something  the worse the outcome is  it s extremely likely that republicans feel that trump will either say or do something to mess everything up  and that s why they don t want him getting his little orange hands in it  however  from the white house s perspective  the trump administration is more than okay with this bill s possible  and likely  failure falling on mitch mcconnell instead of trump  whose approval rating continues to dwindle the separation of trump from the gop health care bill is a telling one  and it s one that the republicans have done on their own  they must be sensing that the bill is in trouble  and are taking precautions to safeguard trump featured image via mark wilson   getty images
