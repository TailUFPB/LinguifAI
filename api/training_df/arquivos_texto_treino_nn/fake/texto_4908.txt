trump s wild lies continue unabated as he continues to say that he s met with people that have never once spoken to him  this time  he s claiming he talked to the chicago police department about the city s violence  and a  top officer  told him that he could solve the problem in just a week  the problem  according to trump  is that they don t have the authority to do so trump appeared on bill o reilly s show  where he was asked about how to solve chicago s violent crime problem  trump spun a whopper of a lie answering that  how  by being very much tougher than they are right now  they re right now not tough  i could tell you this very long and quite boring story  but when i was in chicago  i got to meet a couple of very top police  i said   how do you stop this  how do you stop this  if you were put in charge   to a specific person   do you think you could stop it   he said   mr  trump  i d be able to stop it in one week   and i believed him  percent  har de har har   trump will say anything to convince people that he knows what he s talking about  there is no way to solve any city s violence problems in a single week  of course  to avoid looking like the fool he is  he said that he didn t ask for this mysterious officer s strategy when o reilly asked for it that vagueness is one of the ways that trump maintains credibility despite all his lies cpd refuted his claim that he s spoken to them  and one of their spokespeople said  we ve discredited this claim months ago  no one in the senior command at cpd has ever met with donald trump or a member of his campaign  beyond that  the best way to address crime is through a commitment to community policing and a commitment to stronger laws to keep illegal guns and repeat violent offenders off the street  once all of this became common knowledge  trump s campaign spokeswoman  hope hicks  tried to turn it around on the media by saying that trump had never said he met with top brass  she claims that s what the media said  which is in keeping with the campaign s assertions that the media intentionally twists his words cpd has disputed claims from trump before  back in march  when he canceled a rally due to violence and said that cpd told him to do so  they said that nobody had ever met with him  let alone told him to cancel his rally for safety reasons trump doesn t even know when he s lying because he does it so much  this is another example of that featured image by spencer platt getty images
