in a video that everyone should see  gq special correspondent keith olbermann had strong words for donald trump in response to his refusal to accept defeat if hillary clinton wins on election day during the debate in las vegas last night  moderator chris wallace asked trump point blank if he will accept the results of the election  trump replied by saying that he will have to look at it at the time and that  i will keep you in suspense  in other words  trump is leaving open the possibility that he will reject the results on election day and refuse to concede defeat because he thinks he will be cheated of victory  which gives his rabid supporters the opening to follow through on their threats of bloody violence if the election doesn t go their way trump s insistence that the election is  rigged  and his refusal to say that he will accept the results and bow out with dignity like every other losing presidential candidate has done throughout american history is a threat to our democracy and the public safety and keith olbermann was so outraged by trump s debate answer that he exploded in righteous condemnation olbermann said trump s remarks make him ineligible to run for president and told trump to  burn in hell  for undermining our sacred democratic tradition of peaceful transfer of power  it was the first time in american history  through dozens of venomous painful campaigns and a series of impossibly close elections  the first and only time that a candidate of a major party had violated the fundamental precept of our democracy  it shakes every one of our freedoms  it mocks every dead american soldier  it spits in every sacrifice made under our flag  it has no comparison   olbermann continued  citing al gore  andrew jackson  and samuel tildon as examples of candidates who conceded defeats after close nasty elections  it foments revolution  it was and is the moral equivalent of treason  and this time it slipped passed no one  not the moderator  not fox news  not even breitbart com  no one  it was not a flash of anger from a man who gets angry once an hour  it was not another slab of red meat thrown to his crazed supporters  it was not another outrageous statement to throw up against the wall in this cheap reality game show version of a presidential campaign  he meant it  he means it  olbermann made it clear that trump is a danger to our values and constitution and he only got angrier as he outed trump as the unpatriotic sore loser that he is  donald trump is not invested in democracy  donald trump is not invested in our constitution  donald trump is not invested in america  donald trump is not invested in preventing people from being killed on the streets after an election like this were a third world police state  burn  in  hell  in fact  trump is so dangerous now that olbermann called upon republican leaders to to do everything within legal means to end trump s candidacy because if they do not  they are responsible for whatever happens on election day and after  this is bigger than who is the next president of who is the next rnc chair or who is the next speaker of the house   olbermann declared   this is our democracy imperiled from within by a man you have permitted to speak for you  compel him to withdraw  now  litigate against him  find enough doctors and have him declared psychiatrically incompetent  at minimum  cut off his funding completely and denounce him in the strongest possible terms because this nightmare  this fascist  this trump is now your responsibility he must not be allowed the opportunity to keep us in suspense  here s the video via twitter new  after he again subverts the sanctity of our elections  my message to  realdonaldtrump  burn  in  hell  pic twitter com   keith olbermann   keitholbermann  october    trump is insane and his supporters are insane enough that they may end up committing acts of bloody violence whether trump concedes or not  that s how deranged they are because of trump s rhetoric the republican party needs to be severely punished at the polls for this on election day  they need to lose by a landslide to end this extremism and bloodthirstiness once and for all featured image  screenshot
