rather than take personal responsibility for the losses  ceo john schnatter is making excuses nfl players  both black and white  have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice  conservatives lost their shit and decided to boycott the nfl  however  while viewership is slightly down  it s not enough to affect the corporate profits of businesses who are partnered with the league but schnatter blamed the nfl and the protests anyway after a quarterly report caused investors to dump their papa john s stock  which caused schnatter to lose   million from his personal fortune leadership starts at the top  and this is an example of poor leadership   schnatter whined   we are totally disappointed that the nfl and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago  this should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago  the controversy is polarizing the customer  polarizing the country  in other words  schnatter thinks the nfl should have banned players from kneeling during the national anthem  a move that would have violated their constitutional rights let s not forget that nfl players were not kneeling en masse until donald trump  whom schnatter supports  attacked colin kaepernick and the nfl in the first place  it was trump s attacks that caused players to join the protest so if schnatter should blame anyone  he should blame trump let s also not forget that schnatter repeatedly attacked president obama over the affordable care act  even going so far as to raise the price of pizza and cut his employees  hours so he wouldn t have to provide health insurance to them  papa john s has also been guilty of stealing wages all of this caused americans to boycott papa john s  which could have caused the chain to lose money as well schnatter s claims are also full of shit because pizza hut executives say their sales have not been affected by the protests  we re not seeing impact on any of that on our business   ceo greg creed said of course  schnatter really doesn t have anything to bitch about  after all  he is still worth over   million and owns a sprawling   square foot castle in kentucky  which includes a pool  a golf course  a  car garage  and a drawbridge along with two other homes in florida and utah schnatter is a greedy prick who should really only blame himself for the financial losses his company has suffered  and frankly  the nfl should cut ties with papa john s in retaliation for this unfair attack  then he ll really have something to bitch about featured image  youtube
