donald trump s refusal to believe our nation s top intelligence agencies about russian interference in our election is even causing fox news to turn on him for more than a month  trump has been defending russia and vladimir putin after the cia and  other intelligence agencies concluded that russia hacked into the dnc and spread propaganda to influence voters to benefit trump  who actually encouraged russia to commit espionage against the united states during a senate hearing on thursday  director of national intelligence james clapper testified that russia committed these crimes against our country and fox news host shep smith took trump to the woodshed for continuing to side with russia over the experts in our own intelligence community  there were lots of ways russia tried to sway our vote   smith said    testified that russia used cyber attacks to target the democratic national committee   we know that  he said they also used propaganda and disinformation  including fake news  fake news that the kremlin commissioned and generated  in other words  a pack of lies packaged up as news of the day in an effort to saw the minds of the american electorate  we don t need a dictionary to figure out what he s saying   smith declared   he s saying   putin knew this  putin directed this  this is all about putin  smith pointed out that trump would rather pal aound with julian assange   who if he walked out the door would be arrested  over the   billion a year american intelligence agencies and all their leaders  then smith slammed trumped for hypocritically saying that he respects our intelligence agencies and pondered why he is questioning them  apparently not this intelligence   smith snapped   he s made that clear  because this intelligence says that vladimir putin and the russians tried meddling with the u s  election to help him  donald trump  get elected  but why  does donald trump not trust the intelligence agencies  or is this a thank you to the russians for all their help  we do not know  but it s one of those  the bottom line  smith said  is that there is  no doubt   none   that russia interfered with america s election  and that s precisely why donald trump is unfit to be president  by defending russia  he is defending our enemy and letting them dupe him  this nation cannot afford to have someone in the white house who refuses to acknowledge that russia committed an act of war against this country  it makes us vulnerable to future attacks  attacks that trump clearly has no problem with as long as they benefit him featured image jeff j mitchell getty images
