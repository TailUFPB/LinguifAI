recently tomi lahren   a woman who literally built a career on hate at glenn beck s theblaze tried to make herself seem less horrible than she actually is during an appearance on the view and said that her  limited government  stance included being pro choice  unfortunately for lahren  while she could get away with making racist comment after racist comment  the one thing conservatives will not tolerate is a woman speaking out about having rights to anything   especially her body some are rushing to lahren s defense after glenn beck fired her for expressing the one viewpoint she has  assuming it s legitimate  that isn t completely horrifying  and she is taking that encouragement and running with it  recently  lahren filed a lawsuit against beck alleging wrongful termination   and she stopped by abc news to whine about how unfair it is that she got fired from her position as an extreme right propagandist because she said something that was contrary to conservatives  core  values   that word is used as loosely as possible   my job is my life  this is my life  without that  i feel lost   lahren told abc news   nightline  on friday   when your outlet is taken away from you and you don t understand why and you re so disappointed and you re so blindsided  it hurts  i was getting ready to go in and do my show and i got a phone call saying that show was not on   have been suspended for a week  perhaps longer    lahren whined   i was flabbergasted  lahren s lawsuit  like her persona  is as fake as any randomly selected promise from the mouth of donald trump  she has not been fired and instead remains under contract  most importantly  she is still getting paid  it is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract  and is still being paid  has sued us for being fired  especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her   theblaze told abc in a statement  she will continue to be paid until her contract expires in september but feels that her  first amendment rights   the first amendment only applies to government interference  were violated when beck decided that he didn t want someone walking around talking like women are people nevertheless  lahren complains that she had been  silenced  and  sidelined  just like all those minorities she hates  i don t sit down in my chair and deliver my  final thoughts   i don t have a dressing room  so i m terminated  i m fired  the way i look at things  i m not doing what i was contracted to do  which was produce a television show  a political talk show   lahren sobbed  this is not about politics   she says   this is about someone who had an opposing viewpoint that has been silenced and sidelined and thrown away  but  of course  that s what you do with garbage   you throw it away  and  according to the lawsuit  stretch yellow  caution  tape across the door of its dressing room   i m someone with a thick skin and i can stand up to about anybody   the thin skinned bully said   but when somebody does that that s really hard for me to take in loyalty is everything to me  and you can disagree with me  but to go out and try to humiliate me  very  very disappointed  i m a human being at the end of the day and something has been stripped from me and that s my ability to work  that s my ability to have a voice   lahren told abc without providing any of the much needed evidence that she is  in reality  human   that s been taken from me wrongfully  so i m upset by it  and i m hurt by it and i feel betrayed by it  interestingly  her  pro choice  comments don t exactly mix well with her numerous aspersions cast at women who correctly believe they have a right to make decisions regarding their own bodies  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net engb sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    tomi on abortionit s over  folks  the  flip flop of the year has to go to tomi lahren   by matt binder posted by cafe on saturday   march  the interview below featured image via screengrab
