trump can t pick good people to save his life  he s got a paranoid lunatic for the national security council  he s got a white supremacist as his chief strategist  and the list goes on  one of his picks for an ambassadorship is david friedman for israel  this isn t just someone who supports the worst of israel  he also made a bizarre attack on the new york times over their coverage of trump s  pussy grabbing  comment by invoking the holocaust seriously  he did that  back in october  not too long after the access hollywood tape came out  friedman said  while the revelation of mr  trump s demeaning comments caught on tape some  years ago brought him  as one would expect  widespread negative attention  the new york times ran with the story with all the journalistic integrity of the worst gossip rag  if only the times had reported on the nazi death camps with the same fervor as its failed last minute attempt to conjure up alleged victims of donald trump  imagine how many lives could have been saved  as peter beinart wrote in a column for haaretz  where he published several of friedman s idiotic comments   invoking the murder of six million jews in an effort to discredit women who accuse a powerful man of sexual assault is wrong  flat wrong there really is no way to describe this as anything other than disgusting and absurd  beinart also pointed out that the times coverage of these accusations has nothing whatever to do with how they covered the holocaust  it also has nothing to do with the times that we live in   the holocaust was  years ago  press coverage of anything was very different than it is today  in the age of the internet friedman is probably one of the worst people imaginable to nominate for any high level position in our government  but that s how trump rolls  and if congress decides they like him for whatever reason  then he ll become our new ambassador to israel  despite being a complete moron featured image by brian blanco via getty images
