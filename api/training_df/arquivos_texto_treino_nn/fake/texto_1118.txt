donald trump is definitely protesting too much this would be a good time for trump to keep his mouth shut  but as usual  he s not when top law firms refused to work for him on this case  they did so for precisely this reason  having a client who constantly sets fires with his mouth is not a client any lawyer wants to put up with  they would prefer trump exercise his right to remain silent  after all  we have that right for a reason but trump has been obsessed with whining about the russia investigation and the obstruction of justice investigation led by special investigator robert mueller  trump was recently talked out of firing him by his aides  so he has resorted to attacks on social media on friday morning  trump resumed complaining after  months of investigations   committee

asked russian hackers to go after hillary clinton s emails  furthermore  the economic and jobs numbers are only great because trump is still benefiting from the economic policies of president obama  once his policies fully kick in  those will take a nosedive trump should also be informed that a lot of his followers on twitter are bots and people who loathe him  pretending that everyone supports him is pretty damn pathetic of course  twitter users swiftly handed trump his ass no proof  really  there actually seems to be quite a lot  keegan stephan   keegannyc  june    flynn resigned over his
