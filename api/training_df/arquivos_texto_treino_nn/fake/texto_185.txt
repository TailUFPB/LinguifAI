rep  john lewis  d ga  is a civil rights icon  he took beatings in the infamous bloody sunday massacre in selma  alabama at the height of the civil rights movement  of course  after donald trump was elected  rep  lewis  like all sane people  was horrified  and questioned his legitimacy  this led trump to strike out in his usual petty   and in this case  racist   fashion  and the two have been on the outs ever since  therefore  what john lewis had to say to hillary clinton for her birthday on twitter is sure to reignite the feud  rep  lewis simply tweeted happy birthday  madame president  hillaryclinton  john lewis   repjohnlewis  october    course  the russians helped elect trump  and hillary won the popular vote by more than three million people  further  trump is clearly unfit for the office he is currently squatting in  and he is destroying our democracy as we speak  the electors should have refused to certify his election  and the electoral college should have functioned as the founders intended  further  the american public elected hillary clinton  a quirk that allowed a few counties in a few states to flip the electoral votes   along with the russians   elected trump  he is illegitimate  so  to that end  hats off  rep  lewis  and to our beloved hillary clinton   happy birthday  madame president featured image via ethan miller getty images
