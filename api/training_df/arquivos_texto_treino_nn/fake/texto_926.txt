donald trump s obsession with twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff trump is about to embark on a high stakes  crucial sitdown with russian president vladimir putin at the  summit in europe  unfortunately for america  he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes  trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings  or read anything  really   but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days his frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with putin  what follows is one of  perhaps  the most pathetic things you ll ever read here s what sources told the la times about how trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the  presidential election just months ago the profile  according to two u s  officials  who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations  is part of a thick binder prepared for trump  the president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in person briefings  the officials said  so aides also have written a list of tweet length sentences that summarize the main points trump could bring up with putin having thoroughly killed the reputation of the white house in a variety of ways  trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet  and his republican allies in congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that there is a growing sense  both in washington and around the country  that the executive branch no longer functionally exists  trump watches an estimated  hours of television a day  he tweets at his enemies  sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious  disturbing ways  he visits his properties and golfs  the rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness  his staff is now encouraged to bring up trump and his election win as often as possible  they are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue  sometimes he ll leave fox news running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business even that was too much work  apparently  now he needs  characters or less or his mind will wander to right wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies  and he appears to be getting worse featured image via mark wilson getty images
