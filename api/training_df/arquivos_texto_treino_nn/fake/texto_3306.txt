over the years  when we americans have gotten ourselves into trouble  there have been many jokes made by the british people that essentially say that they should never have given americans our freedom  this was all good natured ribbing  after all  britain is one of our closest allies  however  thanks to the election of one donald j  trump  no one is laughing now prince charles decided to   without mentioning his name  of course   take a shot at donald trump during a recent speech to the british public  he warned of the dangers of going after certain segments of people based upon their religious beliefs and reminded people that this is exactly what happened in the   namely with the rise of hitler and the eventual execution of the jewish people  the prince said  in part  we are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive to those who adhere to a minority faith  all of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the   of course  we all know of the deeply disturbing proposals trump has made with regards to american muslims  with the suggestions of a muslim ban and a registry of muslims seemingly still on the table  and many seemed to see this as the prince s way of warning against those dangerous and bigoted ideas  this sort of thing is right out of adolf hitler s playbook  and anyone who cannot see that definitely needs to wake up  prince charles continued  the story of the nativity unfolds with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution    and to have similar compassion for people fleeing persecution in their homelands today  of course  the bigots in trump s brainwashed camp will never understand the historical parallels  after all  many of his supporters are incredibly ignorant and bigoted   or even outright white supremacists who sincerely believe that anyone who is not straight  white  and christian should face discrimination and persecution  sad  but true  this is   somehow   the america we live in watch the video below via bbc featured image via chris jackson getty images
