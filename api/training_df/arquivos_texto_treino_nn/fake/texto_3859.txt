donald trump actually won  despite the popular vote  it s pretty hard to believe  and no one really expected this  not even the campaign team itself  as in  they don t have a national security team  in fact  they are having trouble even getting recruits to be on the team according to the daily beast one of the senior members of trump s team said  she wasn t even sure that she was going to be able to fill a transition team   much less find people to serve in government positions  this person said  in theory   people are supposed to parachute into the department of homeland security   and i don t think they have anybody to do it  it s funny to see the trump campaign struggle to fill these much needed positions  scrambling at the last minute  reaching out to any possible candidate they can to no avail  in fact a handful of u s  officials already said they re considering leaving their jobs this says quite a bit about our new commander in chief  trump is not experienced in office at all  not to mention he is just simply unfit to run a country  especially the u s a   he promised to do quite a few things during his first  days in office  but it looks like he s going to be busy staffing his administration before he can begin undoing all of obama s work  good thing too  because this country already is great  and nothing trump has said he s going to do will make it any better  as a country  we ve come pretty far over the last several years  but with trump promising to  ban all muslims  and build a giant wall on the mexican border it looks like it s been in vain  hopefully  things continue to make it impossible for trump to get anything done and we can elect another progressive come  featured image by mark wilson getty images
