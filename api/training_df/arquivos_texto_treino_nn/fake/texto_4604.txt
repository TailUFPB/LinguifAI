donald trump might try to tell american voters that he  cherishes  women  but his long  ongoing history of misogyny and oppressive policies prove that the exact opposite is true   and one of his latest moves has just verified this fact even more the republican nominee recently made anti abortion marjorie dannenfelser  the president of the susan b  anthony list  one of his top domestic policy advisors  dannenfelser is going to champion trump s new  pro life coalition   which trump just announced while also making several statements about all the misogynistic things he s going to do as president of the united states while introducing his coalition  trump also promised that he would get anti abortion justices into the u s  supreme court  nix funding to planned parenthood  promote the pain capable unborn child protection act and make sure that federal funds couldn t go toward abortion it should be noted that dannenfelser was absolutely against trump at first  and in the beginning of the year had begged iowa voters to vote for anyone but the business mogul  however  once the donald was nominated and demonstrated how extreme his views were  dannenfelser was more than happy to make the pro life case for trump   without a doubt  she was probably tickled pink when trump said that women should be  punished  for having abortions a few months ago dannenfelser s involvement in trump s campaign should terrify women and anyone who cares about them   she not only holds some of the most extreme views on abortion and women s health  but opposes women getting abortions in case of rape and incest  as well as cases in which a woman s health is at risk in carrying out a pregnancy  really  you can t get more anti woman than forcing a woman to die or be constantly reminded of a traumatic  horrifying experience in order to carry out a pregnancy dannenfelser is also massively against planned parenthood  an organization that provides safe  accessible and affordable healthcare to millions of women  she even believes that the organization is  sexist  because it primarily focuses on women s health  in an interview  she said  i love men  what about men s health  i mean  do we have anything to say about men s health and the particular health problems that men have  do we ever talk about the  men s gap  when we re moving into an election  she s an absolutely nutcase and should not be allowed to have any effect on policies  to show just how dangerous dannenfelser is  here are some recordings of her talking about planned parenthood and abortion  via right wing watch featured image via wpa pool and spencer platt   getty images
