house republicans have long since made clear their dislike and disdain of the united nations  some of them seem to buy into conspiracy theories that the u n  is trying to take our sovereignty away from us  others are just idiots  and the house gop proved that when they passed a resolution that would allow congress to yank our funding from the u n  over just one issue that issue is the apartheid state of israel  which is also home to an awful lot of human rights violations  the u n  recently approved a resolution declaring israel s settlements in palestine illegal  and the u s  abstained from that vote  so it passed    in retaliation  the gop wants the option of yanking our financial contributions unless the u n  does what they want the zionists we ve got in congress called this resolution  anti israel   sen  ted cruz said  i believe congress should end u s  taxpayer funding for the united nations unless and until the u n  reverses this anti israel resolution  and i believe there will be considerable support in congress  i hope in both parties  to do exactly that  the house freedom caucus  made up of tea partiers who are uber religious  will meet next week to discuss two options  decreasing ending funding entirely  or making our funding voluntary   something congress has to decide on every two years and senator lindsey graham  r sc  put in his two cents with  the united nations will regret this vote and i hope the obama administration will realize the massive mistake they made on their way out of the door  seriously  yes  seriously  worse  though  sen  tom  tehran  cotton  the architect of that ridiculous letter threatening iran  said  any american with any common sense knows that senegal and malaysia don t set the agenda for the security council  the united states does  and this resolution would not have gone forward if the united states did not want it to go forward  so the whole world should bow to us  including the peacekeeping united nations  we are completely and utterly beyond reproach  at all times  in all situations  yeah  we re that awesome  nobody should condemn israel for anything  ever  period  end  because they are  apparently  god oh  please never mind all the good the u n  has done  protecting israel  and sending taxpayer dollars there  is so important that it s worth killing  percent of their budget to make a point  israel called the vote a betrayal  and since we apparently dance to their tune  despite all conservative cries that we re a sovereign nation   we ve decided the u n  betrayed israel  too israel s settlements in palestine are illegal  make no mistake  republicans like to paint the u s  as this bastion of freedom and democracy  but they like to practice that selectively  otherwise they d condemn israel  as the rest of the u n  did  and that would be that featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
