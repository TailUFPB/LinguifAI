donald trump s white house is in more turmoil than ever  as it turns out that donald trump jr  just provided the entire world with email evidence that he was more than willing to collude with a russian national to try and fix an election by collecting dirt on  democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton ever since the fact that trump jr  met with a shady russian lawyer came out  everyone in trump world has been spinning madly in order to try and make all of this potentially criminal activity seem like it means nothing  more than anything  they have lied through their teeth to do so  well  there is one person who is willing to call them out for being lying liars  democratic senator sheldon whitehouse of rhode island senator whitehouse appeared on msnbc s all in with chris hayes on wednesday evening  and ripped the folks in trump world a new one on this issue  he also said that the trump jr  emails take on a new legal meaning   and that it means people need to stop talking to the press and start talking under oath  of course  for pathological liars  this is a huge deal  because lying under oath is a crime senator whitehouse said to host chris hayes  if there s been a legal violation here   and this very strong indications that there has   then you re dealing with things like indictments  and the house potentially beginning impeachment proceedings  and people having to start talking under oath  instead of you know  talking out on the airwaves  where they lie as easily as they breathe  boom  that is exactly what we need to hear  these people are covering something up  and that becomes more evident by the hour  donald trump himself might be protected from criminal indictments   the idea of indicting a sitting president is definitely an open question   but whether or not the people around him can be indicted certainly is not thank you  senator whitehouse for speaking truth to power  keep it up  and we might just get rid of this criminal excuse for an administration yet watch the video below whitehouse  ppl may have to start talking under oath instead of in media where they  lie as easily as they breathe  https   t co   all in w chris hayes   allinwithchris  july    image via chip somodevilla getty images
