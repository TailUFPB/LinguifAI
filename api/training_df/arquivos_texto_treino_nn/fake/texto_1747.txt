last week  trump was bellowing up one side and down the other about a possible nuclear test that north korea was set to conduct over the weekend  he claimed we might launch a pre emptive strike against them  and that we had two ships in the region already from an nbc news story dated april   the intelligence officials told nbc news that the u s  has positioned two destroyers capable of shooting tomahawk cruise missiles in the region  one just  miles from the north korean nuclear test site and earlier this week  the pentagon announced that the uss carl vinson aircraft carrier strike group was being diverted to the area   turns out  that wasn t true the  armada  trump was speaking of was  at the time  headed the opposite way toward australia  and had not been turned around  it wasn t until the navy posted a photo of the carl vinson and its strike group in the sea between the indonesian islands of java and sumatra that the story came out  the photo was taken on saturday  apr    a few days after we heard that the carl vinson had been diverted and was heading toward the sea of japan now it s headed that way and should arrive sometime next week  two weeks after we told the world it was already heading there so what happened the white house says they were going off of what the defense department said  the defense department said there was a  glitch ridden sequence of events   including a premature announcement courtesy of the pacific command  and a false explanation from defense secretary james mattis all of that  they say  contributed to the false narrative that we had an armada speeding towards north korea in a grandiose show of force really  that makes all the sense in the world truthfully  officials don t understand why the defense department didn t issue a correction on its timeline of events regarding the movements of those ships  with spicer and others actually answering questions about it  and the extreme tension of the situation  one would think they d be as careful as possible about this instead  it sounds like the white house is putting all the blame for this clusterfuck onto the pentagon  which is par for the course when they re either caught in a lie or something goes massively wrong of course  some trumpkins will believe that trump was deliberately misleading all of asia  sending them into a panic   as well as russia and us  to trick north korea into trying something or to surprise them later on  no doubt someone will say that s brilliant and anyone who does say that s brilliant  up to and including trump himself  which isn t far fetched at all  has no idea what the consequences of that kind of a bluff could be  regardless  we caused a panic both here and among our allies that didn t need to happen  and risked a war over something very false the trump administration had better get its act together where hostile foreign powers are concerned featured image by ron sachs   pool via getty images
