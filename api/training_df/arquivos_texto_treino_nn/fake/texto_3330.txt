every single time donald trump makes an absurd statement  his supporters rush in to explain what the president elect really meant  this country will be led by a man who doesn t know how to communicate  according to a member of the transition team  trump should be taken symbolically  not literally  well  that s just great msnbc host stephanie ruhle pressed aide anthony scaramucci on why trump hasn t held a news conference since july  and the president elect canceled one scheduled for december  scaramucci suggested that trump canceled the news conference because  he s a very precise  very detail oriented guy  who wants to have  all of the answers to all of the types of questions that s he s gonna get thrown   according to politico  hold on  if he s a detail oriented guy  then how does this statement that we ve been hearing for months   don t take him literally  take him seriously   make sense   ruhle asked   because that s sort of the opposite  then scaramucci blamed the media  you should definitely take him seriously because he s a man of his word  but i do think that some of the things that happens with the media is when he s sending out tweets or he s speaking in a certain way that sets the hair on fire of the nation s media   particularly the left leaning media   i think his supporters see that more as symbolism and a rejection of sort of that egg and tomato throwing that he s experienced from june of  when he announced his campaign   he said scaramucci said  some people out there that do get a little crazy with the president elect   well  if he d stop putting terrifying creatures in that swamp  maybe people would calm down a little  just a suggestion ruhle shot back saying that trump puts information out there but doesn t answer questions trump is  the most scrutinized person in the world   scaramucci said   and so  a result of which  when that press conference comes  my guess is he s gonna have nine and  derivative like questions  and he just wants to be ready for it  and that s why he delayed it  which i think is a sign of his great temperament and very good judgment  watch  if that were true  trump would be able to refrain from attacking people on twitter  that does not display a  great temperament  or  good judgement   his own aide is suggesting that trump isn t prepared for the job  and if we take trump  symbolically   that kind of sucks  too  he s the hero of every white supremacist group across the board image via screen capture
