donald trump s administration and white house is the leakiest in living memory  this is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent  intemperate  childish  narcissistic  and completely unfit for the office he holds  despite the fact that they all know this  the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking  these leaks seem to be worrying deputy attorney general rod rosenstein   or rather  likely trump s open rage with regards to them has forced rosenstein s hand instead of defending the integrity of special counsel robert mueller as trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant  rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late thursday night that shows that he  too  is now shilling for trump  the statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources  saying americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials   particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated  americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations  the department of justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations fired u s  attorney preet bharara pointed out that rosenstein should be defending special counsel mueller instead of shilling for trump where is rod rosenstein s overdue statement responding to the president s repeated attacks on his appointment of robert mueller  pic twitter com   preet bharara   preetbharara  june    is beyond strange  the department of justice is not supposed to be politicized  but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president  more than likely  trump ordered rosenstein to do this  since so many damning stories about the russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis  trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the russia story  and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of special counsel robert mueller  in fact  the only reason mueller is still there is because white house aides talked trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing conservative commentator bill kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with rosenstein s behavior  and it s terrible for the nation the rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  bill kristol   billkristol  june    the age of trump  the independence of the department of justice is definitely shot  and this proves it  while it was clear that attorney general jeff sessions  who was a part of trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a trump shill  we had all hoped that sessions  recusal from the russia investigation and rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility  but no all i can say is thank goodness for robert mueller  hopefully  firing him would be a bridge too far   even for congressional republicans featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
