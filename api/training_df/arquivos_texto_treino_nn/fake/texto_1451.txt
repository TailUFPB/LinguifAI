already demonstrating her inability to keep her mouth shut  fox news host kimberly guilfoyle seemingly leaked the fact that trump has made up his mind to fire sean spicer as press secretary  she told mercury news that trump s staff have already contacted her and she s in talks to take over once the deed is done this is news to  everybody  because the trump white house has so far refused to confirm rumors that spicer is on his way out  guilfoyle seems pretty convinced  she spoke with the self assured tone of a person who has already committed to the job in her head  i m a patriot  and it would be an honor to serve the country   guilfoyle said   i think it d be a fascinating job  it s a challenging job  and you need someone really determined and focused  a great communicator in there with deep knowledge to be able to handle that position  leaving nothing to chance  she also took pains to bash sean spicer with some ruthless concern trolling  if you want to be successful and do communications with president trump  you have to be someone who he actually wants to spend a little bit of time with   she said on the air   you ve got to insist on getting in front of potus  talk to him  and have like five  six minutes with him before you go out there and take the podium  and otherwise you re driving blind  it has to be somebody with a very close relationship  where there s trust there  there s inherent loyalty  someone who s been there from the beginning   she added  loyalty  has become a major sticking point for trump  whose paranoia and sense of alienation has left him with very few friends even among the white house adding more fuel to the fire  guilfoyle  mockingly   wished sean spicer  the best  going forward spicer was noticeably absent from tuesday s press briefing  the last time reporters saw him  he was engaged in a screaming match with steve bannon and sarah huckabee sanders wh comms staffers just put the tvs on super loud after we could hear yelling coming from room w  bannon  spicer  sanders  adrian carrasquillo   carrasquillo  may    having nothing to do with either decision  trump reportedly blames spicer for both the james comey and russia classified intel leaks  shortly after the comey scandal erupted  axios reporter jonathan swan was hearing that trump was finished with spicer i can independently confirm reporting that president trump has been sounding people out about removing sean spicer as press secretary     jonathan swan   jonathanvswan  may     however  may have screwed up her chances by blowing the story open before trump was ready  as the new york times  maggie habermann points out  one way to lose an opportunity is to confirm it s happening  trump  who hates anyone stealing his limelight  has previously torpedoed done deals after they were leaked to the press out of sheer spite this is quickest way to end a negotiation with trumpland  to talk about it https   t co   maggie haberman   maggienyt  may    s likely guilfoyle decided to risk a high stakes gamble  the best way to make your case to trump is through the media and with massive doses of flattery  the risk is getting too much attention and angering trump  her bet was that trump would like the nice things she said about him more than he hated that she undermined his decision   if all of this seems a bit  high school drama   that s because it is  now it is left to be seen whether her gamble will pay off featured image via allison shelley getty images
