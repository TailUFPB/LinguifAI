it took trump s family and friends under an hour after a mass shooting at a congressional republican baseball practice to win the awards for  worst reaction to a mass shooting   and sadly  many trump voters appear to be eating it up both kellyanne conway and donald trump jr  managed to promote unsubstantiated and largely debunked information coming out to push a narrative that the shooter had targeted republicans and not democrats  the reality is  nobody knows why the shooter did it  not yet don and kellyanne both used a single source  rep  jeff duncan  whose narrative began coming to pieces shortly after he had made the comment the man duncan and other republicans described as having asked whether the people playing baseball were republicans or democrats looked nothing like the man who later shot at them  as numerous reporters began noting the description of the guy who asked lawmakers if gop or dems was practicing and the actual shooter appear to be different people   kyle feldscher   kylefeldscher  june     repdesantis says the guy who asked him if it was gop or dems was in running clothes  jeffflake said shooter was wearing jeans   kyle feldscher   kylefeldscher  june    since desantis said the guy wasn t carrying anything at the time  ar  not the easiest to hide   emily crockett   emilycrockett  june    fact  as andrea mitchell reported  the fbi is now saying it does not appear to  at first glance  have a political motivation fbi takes over investigation discounts reports of political motive alexandria police say  people transported to hospital community is safe https   t co   andrea mitchell   mitchellreports  june    that lack of confirmation  right wing media ran with the unsubstantiated reports like they were official statements by investigators  drudge  in one egregious example  even misquoted one of the republicans at the scene to make it seem like the shooter said he wanted to kill as many republicans as possible  breitbart and infowars both quickly joined in  no such words were said the white house released a statement saying the president had been  briefed  on the situation  but it s unclear what his briefing looked like  trump gets much of his news from drudge  breitbart and fox news  it s entirely possible that the president of the united states believes the lies being spread by right wing media and his advisors at this time no one knows the true motives of the shooter  police have him in custody and  unlike trump s son  are conducting a thorough investigation before blasting out unsubstantiated reports into the public  rather than waiting  the right wing media and trump s own white house decided to exploit the tragedy in order to further their agenda of smearing liberals  it s beyond maddening to watch the group who once called president obama  divisive  for expressing sorrow for trayvon martin now openly and gleefully delight in spreading vitriol and lies about their political opponents update  fbi investigators identified the shooter as james hodgkinson  there is evidence to suggest he supported bernie sanders during the democratic primary  police have again dismissed the idea that he had asked people at the baseball game what political affiliation they were what still isn t known is why he decided to go on a shooting spree breaking  gov t official  suspect in shooting of congressman in virginia identified as illinois man named james t  hodgkinson   the associated press   ap  june      rep  duncan says he still believes the man who approached him earlier in the morning was the shooter  adds that it isn t uncommon for people to drop by and ask questions rep  duncan says he had the conversation with person he believes was shooter  who asked if team practicing was gop or democrat  caitlin huey burns   chueyburns  june    image via drew angerer getty images
