speaking at a press conference with visiting italian prime minister paolo gentiloni in sochi  russia  vladimir putin has claimed that he has a transcript of donald trump s meeting with russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  furthermore  putin said he would be willing to provide a copy to the u s  congress  the only catch is that the request would have to come from trump himself the trump administration came under fire for holding a meeting with lavrov and russian ambassador sergey kislyak in the oval office last week  a meeting that russian media were able to attend  yet from which u s  media were banned  the situation came to a head when it became clear that trump had disclosed confidential details pertaining to isis during the session  initially  the white house denied the scandal  only to later claim that it was  wholly appropriate  for the president to discuss such information with the russians  at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the president did not disclose any military operations that weren t already publicly known   trump s national security adviser h r  mcmaster said at a press conference on monday   the premise of that article is false that in any way the president had a conversation that was inappropriate or that resulted in any kind of lapse in national security  the kremlin still denies that trump shared any u s  intelligence during the meeting  with russian president vladimir putin downplaying reports as  political schizophrenia   however  trump s comments still have not been made public  now it seems putin is willing to go a step further to help out  if the administration of the united states deems this possible  we will be ready to provide a transcript of the lavrov trump meeting to the u s  senate and congress   putin told reporters during the press conference in sochi  adding  it will happen if the u s  administration wishes so  not everyone sees putin s offer as particularly beneficial to trump  who the fbi has now confirmed is under investigation over links to the russians  especially u s  rep  adam schiff  the top democrat on the house intelligence committee  probably the last person the person  needs to vouch for him right now is vladimir putin   schiff told cbs s this morning   sure  send it  our way  but its credibility would be less than zero  featured image via lintao zhang pool getty images
