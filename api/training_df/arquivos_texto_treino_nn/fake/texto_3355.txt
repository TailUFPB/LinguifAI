donald trump is a snake oil salesman  anyone who paid attention during the election knows that  and increasingly  the people who took trump at face value are beginning to realize it  radio host michael savage was one of trump s most rabid supporters  but on his show last week  he admitted to having an awakening  of sorts  and he s waking up in a nightmare of trump s broken promises it s not as if savage  who s famous for quotes like this  barack obama is elected for another four year term  he ll be president for life  he ll be the new hugo chavez  he ll do away with the two term limit and win the  election with  percent of the vote  we have less than six months to make sure this doesn t happen  before lyndon johnson intervened to make sure blacks would become dependent on the government for just about everything they needed to live  black participation in the labor market was equal to or greater than that of whites  today the  official  african american unemployment rate which doesn t take into account the enormous number of blacks who aren t even trying to find jobs is around  percent  in fact  when you count those who don t even try to find a job  it s nearly  percent  when the numbers are added up  under this administration more than  percent of young black people are no longer even part of the labor force  it s the lowest ever recorded in our history  end affirmative action  we ve had a black president  black cabinet members from both parties  a black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff  as much as the left fashions themselves as being progressive  they re not  in reality  today s leftist movement is made in much the same way as a sausage it s a blend of fascist  communist  and socialist ideologies from twentieth century europe  with a pinch of nazism  all ground together  yet retaining the flavor of its various parts  has suddenly grown empathy and has become aware of all the people a trump presidency can hurt  nope  savage is disillusioned because trump seems to be buddying up to some black guys savage  who has been credited with enabling trump and his legion of racist white men  has been called trump s  ideological spirit animal   he shares trump s hatred for people of color  and despite being jewish  savage supports israel but has a complicated relationship with jewish people  it s no wonder  then  that savage experienced some existential angst when trump was seen cozying up to kanye west  who savage called a  psycho rapper   then  a caller had this so say  i think as badly of it as i think of a lot of the things he s doing   the caller said  referring to obama   talking about  you know  obama and how he agrees with obama on so many things  when he was running for president  he didn t agree with obama on nothing  neither did i  neither did you  neither did any of the people voting for him  and now he talks about how he has great respect for him and he s calling him for his opinion   and to invite this rapper up to trump tower  had he told us he was gonna do these things  do you think this movement would have been as big as it was  i don t think so  savage agreed with the caller  and said   i don t think you re alone   he then complained about trump s appointments of establishment republicans  no complaints about billionaires  though  and the fact that trump is no longer talking about building a wall  i m waking up and it seems to be a nightmare   savage said   one day after another  they seem to be tilting so far away from what they promised that it s hard to even remember what it is that he promised  here s the audio featured image via mark wallheiser getty images
