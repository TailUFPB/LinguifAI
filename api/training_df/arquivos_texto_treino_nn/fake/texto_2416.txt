a letter to the editor appeared in the new york times yesterday about how devastating trump s immigration policy is  it s not only going to destroy immigrant families and further harm our deteriorating relationship with mexico  it s also going to rip apart military families  the families that keep our soldiers grounded when they re overseas in combat zones  and trump doesn t care david kubat  a member of the minnesota national guard and also an immigration lawyer  wrote the short letter  where he said  i have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones  and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time  this week  this administration rescinded the parole in place program  harming thousands of military families across the country  this is another example of the careless excess of the administration s immigration policy  parole in place protects military spouses  parents and children from deportation and was put in place by president obama  it gives servicemembers peace of mind that their families will still be here when they get home  now they don t have that because to trump  it seems that soldiers should have to suffer if they were dumb enough to be involved with someone who could be subject to deportation the gop is supposed to be the family values party  and they love claiming that they re the only party that cares about the military  it s not bad enough that they say that and then turn around and cut funding for the va and other helpful programs  now their standard bearer  their leader  is actively working to destroy the very thing that keeps our military grounded kubat went on to say  it is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans  that the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness  or worse  a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military  nice job  republicans  for allowing this shitshow to make it all the way to the white house  when we start seeing a spike in severe mental problems in our fighting men and women  we ll know exactly where to point the finger kubat s full letter is below now  trump can deport spouses   families of us military personnel  letter  https   t co  h t   pic twitter com   david beard   dabeard  february    image by olivier douliery via getty images
