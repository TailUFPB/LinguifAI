last week was the week it became official that donald trump isn t even trying to be president of the united states  his horrible responses to the neo nazi kkk white supremacist hate rally in charlottesville  virginia proves that he s only concerned with a tiny portion of the united states  and that s his frightening and adoring base while trump s approval ratings continue to fall among most americans  his base is lapping up trump s attempts at spurring on racial division a gop strategist working campaigns in red and purple states said that while support for trump generally declined slightly since charlottesville  support rose among his base  after a decline last month because of the failure on health care and revelations about the russia investigation  this strategist said many trump supporters applaud the president s continuing desire to shake up washington  favor his economic priorities and admire his willingness to speak his mind source  washington postpolitically  this is stupid but he said trump has nonetheless created a longer term risk   what he s doing that s harmful is he s removing people from the persuadable audience  and that s dangerous   he said   he s taken an event where he could have added  percent of people to the persuadable universe and  he s dumped out  percent of them  trump doesn t care  though  the sycophantic worship is far more important to trump than any sort of reelection strategy and it s certainly more important to him than the future of the republican party   a party that s only in office because of gerrymandering  voter suppression and really undemocratic  both small and big  d   campaign finance laws for trump  appealing to the worst in humanity is that only strategy that works and there is absolutely no sign he ll be letting up on it anytime soon  in fact  the now ousted steve bannon  back at the helm of the white supremacist site breitbart  is vowing to use his platform to keep trump focused on his nationalist agenda featured image via win mcnamee getty images
