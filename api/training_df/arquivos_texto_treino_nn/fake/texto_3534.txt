donald trump shocked the world with a  minute phone call with taiwan s leadership   a move that could greatly damage diplomatic relationships with china  this move  which was suspiciously preceded by the trump organization inquiring about building a hotel in taiwan  led to an official complaint from china and made it clear to the world that donald trump is either too stupid to be president or worse   that he knows exactly what he is doing and has an agenda that is in line with anyone else who wants to harm our country apparently  chinese state run media has decided the former is the case hammering the donald for his repeated attacks on the country since the phone call  the global times speculates that the donald is just an idiot who will eventually learn to employ diplomacy trump s reckless remarks against a major power show his lack of experience in diplomacy  he may have overestimated the power of the us  he may have already been obsessed with the power he is about to have a grip on  and wishes the whole world should follow his lead  he may also believe that if china  the biggest power after the us  is awed by washington  it will solve all other problems no matter what trump thinks  china must be determined to upset his unreasonable requests at his early time in office  and fight back if his moves harm china s interests  regardless of the consequences to the dynamics of the sino us relationship  if china behaves soft heartedly for the greater good of the bilateral ties  it will only embolden trump to be more aggressive trump s china bashing tweet is just a cover for his real intent  which is to treat china as a fat lamb and cut a piece of meat off it  trump wants to revive us economy  but he knows that his country is not as competitive as it used to be  he is trying to pillage other countries for the prosperity of the us  trump sems to be wanting to make the us a new economic empire in the  century under his leadership  which is about to smash current world economic order  however  he doesn t know that the us is the biggest beneficiary from the current world order  and he wants to reshape the world order into a winner takes all one china daily chided trump for his  lame  excuses about the phone call  noting that no matter the reason he  broke a decades old bilateral diplomatic consensus and touched an ultra sensitive diplomatic nerve   the publication goes on to say that the incoming potus must familiarize himself with the way the world works outside his bubble because shit s about to get real when he is president and they can t roll their eyes at him any longer trump may dislike  distrust the diplomatic establishment in washington d c   and aspire to rework us foreign policies  but he should first come to terms with the real  not imagined  reality of international relations before wielding the scalpel  because a misstep as president will be far more damaging than one as president elect as president elect  trump can expect some forgiveness even when he is shooting from the hip  but things will be different when he becomes president to stop acting like the diplomatic rookie he is  the next us president needs help in adapting to his forthcoming role change  otherwise  he will make costly troubles for his country  and find himself trying to bluster his way through constant diplomatic conflagrations donald trump hasn t stepped foot in the oval office yet and he s already an international embarrassment   and he needs to get his shit straight before he can do even more damage featured image via getty images chip somodevilla
