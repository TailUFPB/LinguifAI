the chorus of voices saying   show us your taxes   has been growing steadily as trump continues to hide behind the flimsy excuse of an audit for keeping them hidden  now  documents obtained by the new york times may easily explain why he doesn t want the public to see them  while we all have been diligently paying our taxes each year  he very well may not have paid any income taxes at all for the last  years  years  that s astounding  that s disgusting  particularly for someone with a really fat bank account that s running for president  trump has likely has paid so much less than his fair share that he helped to bilk the american people out of much needed services what did the times find  in   trump declared a   million loss on his taxes  that s a big enough loss to wipe out his federal income tax for the    to    he made on each and every episode of  the apprentice   and the   million he earned serving as chairman of the company that owned his failing casinos in atlantic city from  to  joel rosenfeld  an assistant professor at new york university s schack institute of real estate  and also a tax expert  told the times  he has a vast benefit from his destruction  yes he does  atlantic city and new jersey were left picking up the pieces of his failed ventures there  but what s more damning is what rosenfeld would say if a client came to him with a   million loss like trump s  do you realize you can create   million in income without paying a nickel in taxes  wow  yes  trump was taking advantage of a tax system that s very heavily weighted in favor of real estate investors  and many would say that s just good business  however  just because something is legal doesn t make it right  furthermore  when the issue of his taxes came up in the debate  and hillary brought up his bragging that he pays as little as possible in taxes  he said  that makes me smart  oh please  smart  many would say yes  however  that s anything but patriotic or presidential  it s selfish  it s shockingly selfish  it harms the veterans he claims to want to help  and the infrastructure he claims to want to fix  and everything else he claims he can turn around in his quest to enrich himself turn america into a shining golden city on a hill and yet  this is the biggest example yet of his sheer hypocrisy  so is his campaign s statement on the matter  mr  trump is a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business  his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required  that being said  mr  trump has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes  sales and excise taxes  real estate taxes  city taxes  state taxes  employee taxes and federal taxes mr  trump knows the tax code far better than anyone who has ever run for president and he is the only one that knows how to fix it  no  he wants to tilt it even further towards people like himself  trump himself hasn t said anything about this on twitter yet  but expect him to soon  perhaps at  a m   when he s writhing in fury on his bed that the times has unmasked him yet again featured image by spencer platt getty images
