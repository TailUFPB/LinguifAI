president donald trump has overturned another obama era legislation  this time the  ban on trophy hunting permits  particularly those of elephants killed in zimbabwe and zambia  a us fish and wildlife service official has confirmed  trump s sons  don jr   and eric  love being trophy hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it don jr   has hunted elephants before  and elephants are listed as endangered under the endangered species act  that exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species  it s unlikely the trump sons care about conservation  and only about their own glory and bragging rights nevertheless  a spokesman for fish and wildlife said   legal  well regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much needed revenue back into conservation  despite large scale conservation efforts  the wild elephant population in africa plummeted   overall between  and  and by as much as   in some areas as a result of ivory poaching  but that is just the tip of the iceberg  prior to european colonization in the early  century  it is estimated that the wild elephant population in africa was approximately  million  but dropped to   million by   that number looks even more bleak when at last count in  there were only just over   of the animals remaining on africa s savanna in a survey where namibia did not release any figures and surveys in south sudan and the central african republic were postponed due to armed conflict last year   countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets  however  zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of president trump  this new change would only apply to zimbabwe and zambia  but with robert mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of zimbabwe  they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment it makes you wonder why president trump would be so interested in elephant poaching  is it another distraction  this time from the possibility of zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis  could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in trump tower or is it simply because trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it figures  pic twitter com   snarkar ni       snarkaroni  november    and his brother eric slaughter wildlife  for fun   pic twitter com   snarkar ni       snarkaroni  november    image via phillip chin getty images for trump international
