house republicans managed to pass their healthcare bill on thursday  just barely  and it is truly a despicable piece of legislation  the right wing nutjobs who have taken over the republican party  aka the freedom caucus  refused to vote in favor of the bill as long as obamacare s protections for pre existing conditions remained intact  so  the gop said the hell with it and gutted protections for the sick in order to gain their votes think it can t get any worse  wrong  as if taking health care from  million people and removing protections for pre existing conditions isn t bad enough  what qualifies as a pre existing condition is even worse among possible pre existing conditions that could result in outrageous premiums are rape and sexual assault  seriously  rape nymag reports the new macarthur meadows amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history  reportedly without addressing the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of americans in addition to rape  postpartum depression  cesarean sections  and surviving domestic violence are all considered preexisting conditions  companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms the amendment also says that nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting health insurance issuers to discriminate in rates for health insurance coverage by gender   but  ummm  did you look at what qualifies as a pre existing condition  insurance companies don t have to cover  gynecological services and mammograms  that screen for cancer  how many men are gonna need a c section  how many men have postpartum depression  how many men need a pap smear to check for cervical cancer  seems pretty damn obvious that being a woman is a pre existing condition itself paul ryan and donald trump have tried to claim that pre existing conditions are covered  but that isn t exactly the truth  the macarthur meadows amendment  would allow states to opt out of federal regulations and allow insurance companies to charge higher premiums for people who have pre existing conditions  since this was the law of the land before the affordable care act  we know what happens when you give insurance companies this option  they set premiums so high that sick people are priced out of insurance coverage altogether so now  besides the shame  fear  and trauma that have traditionally kept women from seeking medical care after they are sexually assaulted  rape victims now get to worry that they will lose their health insurance if they get help  what the actual f ck is wrong with these people  this is as disgusting as it gets featured image via win mcnamee getty images
