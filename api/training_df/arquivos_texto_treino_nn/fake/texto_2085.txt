stephen hawking might be one of the most brilliant and highly respected scientists in the world  but that means nothing in donald trump s america  in fact  that sort of thing is a liability  and that s why hawking has no plans on visiting for the next few years after receiving the us franklin medal for science and receiving the presidential medal of freedom from president obama in   hawking fears the country s  definite swing to a right wing more authoritarian approach   he also fears that he wouldn t be welcome here anymore  i would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists  but i fear that i may not be welcome   he said in an interview with good morning britain on monday source  the guardiannaturally  trump s denial and inaction toward the biggest crisis to hit our planet  manmade climate change  is at the forefront of hawking s mind  he should replace scott pruitt at the environment protection agency   he said   climate change is one of the great dangers we face  and it s one we can prevent  it affects america badly  so tackling it should win votes for his second term  god forbid  as a citizen of the u k   which recently voted to leave the european union for reasons very similar to the impetus behind trump s election  he understands the feeling of being left behind and the fear of globalism  but he doesn t respect it  trump was elected by people who felt disenfranchised by the governing elite in a revolt against globalisation   he told  s breakfast programme   his priority will be to satisfy his electorate  who are neither liberal nor that well informed  here s the video  hawking has reasons to be afraid  trump s cabinet picks and budget are about as hostile to the scientific community as they can be  but we desperately need people like hawking to stand up to trump and to the ignorant masses who elected him  universities  smart cities and smart rich people  please invite hawking  the majority of the country doesn t agree with trump  he will have a warm embrace  although not from our government featured image via bryan bedder
