with trump in the white house  former cbs evening news anchor dan rather has an awful lot to say  probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times  and trump is a dangerous buffoon  the likes of which we ve never seen  he doesn t comment on everything  and he apparently didn t want to comment on trump s idea that andrew jackson was angry about the civil war  but he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out according to his facebook post on the topic  the  sheer craziness of this obsession by donald trump with andrew jackson and the civil war is a carnival act unlike anything i have ever seen at the white house  these are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing  should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history  trump  at the very least  has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history  he recently told reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard  he also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated sure  trump  the only people who did know are  well  pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation that isn t all rather blasted trump about  he also dropped this truth bomb  with hell of a burn at the end  on trump  to be president of the united states is to part of the great american story  to not understand that story is to not understand the presidency  maybe frederick douglass can give mr  trump some advice  apparently  he s  an example of somebody who s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more  this post was shared nearly   times in five hours  and garnered   reactions in that same time  read it below featured image by kirk irwin via getty images for siriusxm
