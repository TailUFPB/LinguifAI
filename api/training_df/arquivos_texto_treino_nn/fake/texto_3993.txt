can we all finally agree that donald trump s campaign is just ridiculous at this point  on monday  kellyanne conway showed up on cnbc to do what she does best  embarrass the human race with her stupidity apparently satisfied with trump s ability to latch on to the next to no information referenced by fbi director comey s unethical  unprecedented  and likely illegal letter to republicans  comey hasn t reviewed the emails discovered on a computer owned by renowned pervert and husband to unfortunate clinton aide huma abedin   anthony weiner  who is currently being  investigated for allegedly sexting a  year old girl the emails likely contain nothing new and have likely already been disclosed  but the right is in the midst of a feeding frenzy over the non information contained in the letter  declaring that the investigation into clinton s emails had been reopened and ramping up the  criminal  rhetoric conway condemned clinton s suggestion that all the emails be released to the public   in other words  an effort to fully inform the public   as she called the clinton campaign  sneaky  for demanding the facts be released  just ask huma what s on there  just ask anthony weiner what s on there   she said during the interview   they are now trying to politicize the fbi   conway accused clinton of  encouraging  supporters to boo comey  who has such a reaction coming for his unethical behavior in the eyes of pretty much anyone who doesn t consider red trucker hats fashionable  it s a very dangerous precedent to have somebody that was secretary of state  first lady  u s  senator  wants to be president of the united states and be commander in chief encouraging people to boo   she said  apparently forgetting a time not so long ago when trump and his illiterate  inbred fans also booed the fbi  and comey specifically   and where are we now   conway said after host andrew ross sorkin pointed out that trump has called for clinton s imprisonment multiple times   she is going to be in her second fbi investigation  one fbi investigation  let alone two  do we think this is normal  i think people have been asking the right questions about the wrong candidate  who s really unqualified  who s unfit to be president  who has shown what they would do with their national security information  who has shown it s always about her and her petty peevish political self  then sorkin struck a nerve by stating facts   namely that trump has been named in a rather damning child rape lawsuit that is due to start in december  the girl in question is    just one year older than paris hilton when trump says she was hot and two years younger than the models he used to creep on in their dressing rooms  my understanding is that no matter who wins  we re going to be dealing with the email issue after this if she s the president   sorkin told conway   if donald trump is the president  he s got the child rape case that s going to happen that was just given a date  naturally  conway snorted and attempted to deflect  calling any question about the child rape case exactly as legitimate as questions about trump s taxes  which he has not released  oh  come on  that you would analogize the two  give me a break   she seethed  next you are going to ask me where his taxes are  that s a whole separate issue  but we re going to have legal cases for each candidate   sorkin countered  but to conway  a little child rape is unimportant when hillary sent some emails and anthony weiner is a bit pervy  too  that s such a ridiculous conflation  to just throw the rape word in there when we ve got   emails based on an active investigation of huma abedin s pedophilia husband because he s sexting pictures of himself to some  year old girl in north carolina  i think that s just ridiculous  don t worry though   conway s pervert is going to make america great again by building a wall to keep brown people out  banning and rounding up members of religions he doesn t like  and attempting to resist banging his daughter like he has said he wants to do for all these years   starting at around the time he said paris hilton was hot when she was  watch the segment below featured image via screengrab
