the judicial branch of our government is getting sick and tired of donald trump s tirades after trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning travelers from seven countries from entering the united states  worldwide chaos ensued thousands of people were detained and denied their rights as attorneys raced to their rescue  a federal judge then blocked the order and trump has been attacking u s  district court judge james robart ever since the opinion of this so called judge  which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country  is ridiculous and will be overturned   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone  even with bad intentions  can come into u s    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    the ban was lifted by a judge  many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country  a terrible decision  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart  bad people are very happy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril  if something happens blame him and court system  people pouring in  bad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    the u s  does not win this case as it so obviously should  we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled  politics   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    has literally been whining about judge robarts  decision for over a week and acts like judges aren t allowed to act as a check and balance against the executive branch and his behavior toward robarts has angered one federal judge so much that he is calling trump s legitimacy into a question  which is a yuuuge deal federal district judge dan polster explained to the cleveland anti defamation league on wednesday and explained that checks and balances exist because the founding fathers  were fearful of a president who might want to be a king or dictator   which is exactly how trump is acting polster continued by telling the audience that he doesn t think any federal judge will be intimidated by trump because they  took an oath to support and defend the constitution and it means a lot and i think that oath means even more today  with that said  polster believes trump undermined his legitimacy by attacking the judicial branch for halting the executive order  this is serious business  because you start calling into question the legitimacy of someone  that undermines the whole system  all right  i think to say it publicly  that s his right  but it calls into question  and some might even say forfeits  his or her own legitimacy  so i ll leave it at that  it s an important question  but that s how i feel  when you call into question the legitimacy of a federal district court judge  that s a line that shouldn t be crossed  and there you have it  trump s attacks on our judicial branch are literally starting to backfire on him as judges start to speak out publicly against him  while trump has the right to disagree with judges  personally attacking them disgraces the office he holds and diminishes the power of the executive branch  it makes trump s position look weak and desperate  and it could affect the decisions judges make in the future on executive orders and laws trump signs  in short  trying to bully judges is not a good idea read more featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
