donald trump has been tweeting all day   and his latest is triggering a needless fight with one of america s largest trade partners  naturally  it s based on complete lies for reasons known only to trump and his staff  the president has avoided doing any actual work today and has instead opted to rant about various things that come into his head  on twitter  trump has bashed democrats  admitted he never had  tapes  of his conversations with james comey  and finally turned to mexico  the country has been suffering horrific violence due to a on going drug war  like his behavior towards london  trump decided to exploit the tragedy to cynically push for his bigoted policies in america  and like london  he did so by lying with no source  trump announced that mexico s homicide rate was second only to syria  his information appears to come from a shoddy study released in may and promoted by cnn  which trump claims not to watch  that claimed  mexico was second deadliest country in    mexico s violent drug war had indeed been horrific  and the number of dead is staggering  but is it truly the second most violent place in the world  almost immediately  the details of the study started to unravel in may  the washington post took a hard look at the information and concluded it didn t hold up to scrutiny  for one thing  in terms of both population and raw numbers  many countries are more deadly than mexico the study appears to arrive at its findings by labeling mexico a  conflict area  and counts the number of killed in that  conflict  as compared to other nations  obviously  most nations aren t currently facing civil wars or strife so they aren t counted  even when they actually have more homicides  but mexico isn t undergoing a civil war and in fact large sections of the country have very little contact with the drug war happening in specific hot spots  it is only when mexico is placed in this ill fitted category that it emerges as a particularly deadly place  trump  who seems incapable of reading or understanding detailed information  failed to comprehend this nuance when he decided to impulsively smear the country on twitter it s boring at this point  but must be repeated again and again  what trump is saying and doing towards america s allies  seemingly on a whim  is unprecedented  mexico  for all its troubles  is one of america s closest allies and trading partners  the economies of both countries are dependent on one another and cooperation between the neighbors has been a longstanding tradition  trump  in order to build his fantasy wall  is threatening to destroy that relationship mexico has already been furious with trump for his attacks on its country and citizens  they  naturally  told trump to shove it when he came up with his insane premise to get them to pay for his wall  his popularity in mexico is lower than dirt  the leadership openly mocks him  but still he smears the country  it has pretty clearly reached a breaking point   and trump only has himself to blame featured image via spencer platt getty images
