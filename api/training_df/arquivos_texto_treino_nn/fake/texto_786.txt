if donald trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes  he should think again as it turns out  special prosecutor robert mueller has the power to indict trump if he has enough evidence proving that trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with russia in an effort to win the  election  donald trump s son trump jr  has already demonstrated that trump s campaign met with a kremlin linked russian lawyer and a former soviet intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against hillary clinton  which is  indeed  the very definition of collusion mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a  page legal memo written by ronald rotunda  a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics  who was hired as part of special prosecutor kenneth starr s team during the bill clinton presidency according to the  memo  which was obtained by the new york times it is proper  constitutional  and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of  and are contrary to  the president s official duties  in this country  no one  even president clinton  is above the law that means no sitting president is above the law  including trump watergate special counsel  leon jaworski  came to the same conclusion in  the only reason why jaworski and starr declined to indict president nixon and president clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead well  republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect trump from being impeached  so it appears mueller may not have a choice but to indict trump if republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty even the supreme court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in  that a lawsuit against clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward  and since trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with russia  that makes his misconduct open to indictment  along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office  that means if mueller digs through trump s finances and finds other crimes  trump could face an indictment for those as well  if there is no recourse against the president  if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws  he will be above the law   rotunda further wrote  if public policy and the constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties  and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties   and that is what clinton v  jones squarely held  then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater  in short  trump is in deep shit and he can t blame hillary clinton to get out of it  not even republicans can dispute the starr memo  republicans not only supported starr s investigation  it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo so unless republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all  robert mueller must indict trump  because it is clear that republicans won t punish trump for breaking the law and violating the constitution featured image  addicting info archive
