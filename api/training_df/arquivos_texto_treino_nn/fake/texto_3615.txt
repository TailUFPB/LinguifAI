only supporters of donald trump could say something so stupid that a news anchor smacks their own head in frustration when cnn host alisyn camerota organized a discussion with a bunch of trump supporters  she apparently didn t expect the monumental stupidity she was about to receive the group of trump supporters  which included susan delemus  paula johnson  and others whom camerota has spoken to before throughout the  election  were totally ignorant of trump s picks for his administration and repeatedly spouted falsehoods in order to defend him delemus claimed that trump only picked  top  people to fill his cabinet  people that i m looking at that trump has appointed or nominated have all been top of the class  number one in their field  extremely talented  great leaders on their own   she said of course  any reasonable person with a functioning brain understands that trump has been scraping the bottom of the conservative barrel to fill government positions  after all  no one can say with a straight face that alabama senator jeff sessions is the best attorney in the country and no one can say that sarah palin is even remotely qualified to be secretary of anything  much less secretary of veterans affairs  trump s pick to run the department of education  betsy devos  is staunchly anti public schools and funds a group that wants to dismantle child labor laws because mining would be  exciting  for kids  in other words  she is definitely unqualified to shape the future of education in this country but when the subject of protests against trump came up  camerota was flooded with idiocy spearheaded by johnson  voting is a privilege in this country and you need to be legal  not like california where three million illegals voted   she claimed  where are you getting your information   a confused camerota asked johnson claimed she got the information from the media  including cnn  which means johnson probably took reports on trump s tweet about  million people voting illegally for hillary clinton as the truth because the media reported on it johnson repeatedly insisted that california let  million undocumented immigrants vote and claimed that president obama encouraged them to vote  all of the panelists agreed  with one even daring camerota to  google it  because it s on facebook  well  camerota did and found that fox business deceptively edited a clip of president obama to make it sound like he encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote when  in fact  he did not but that didn t sway johnson from continuing to insist that california allows undocumented immigrants to vote  which caused camerota to smack her own head in frustration because the stupid was clearly strong in this one here s the video via youtube seriously  donald trump claim about  million illegal voters has been thoroughly debunked and has been trashed by members of his own party because it is so absurd  this segment proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that trump supporters are completely ignorant and have been brainwashed to believe anything that trump says  and yet they wonder why they are constantly mocked featured image via screenshot
