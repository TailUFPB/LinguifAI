donald trump has been throwing around the false claim that former director of national intelligence james clapper said that there was  no evidence  of collusion between him and his campaign and russia recently  but a cnn interview just destroyed any hope of trump ever using that again on sunday  clapper told jake tapper that donald trump and his russian friends are attacking our democracy  i think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally   and that s the big news here is the russian interference in our election system   and i think as well our institutions are under assault internally  asked if he meant donald trump  clapper responded with one word   exactly  the founding fathers  in their genius  created a system of three co equal branches of government and a built in system of checks and balances   clapper said  adding   i feel as though that is under assault and is eroding  i think each senator or congressman has got to  i hope  will think in terms of their own conscience   clapper told tapper   i hope they speak up  clapper also said that trump is wrong to use him to exonerate himself  the bottom line is i don t know if there was collusion  political collusion   clapper said   i don t know of any evidence to it  so i can t refute it  and i can t confirm it  watch the interview below
