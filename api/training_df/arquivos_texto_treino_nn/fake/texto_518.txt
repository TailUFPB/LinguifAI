you may remember greg gianforte  the republican who won montana s only congressional seat in may even after assaulting reporter ben jacobs of the guardian  he disputed the charge at first  then audio came out that clearly depicted him body slamming the journalist after jacobs asked a series of uncomfortable questions gianforte pled guilty to the charge back in june  although it had no bearing on the outcome of his post assault election  presumably  the voters of montana thought jacobs had it coming  or perhaps they re so committed to their political party that even an assault charge won t deter them from voting for a gop candidate at the time  the tea party lawmaker protested the judge s order that he be booked and fingerprinted  as well as have his photo taken for a mug shot  his lawyers argued that the judge didn t have the authority to order the proceedings since he was never actually handcuffed and arrested formally   a feat he pulled off by coincidentally being the candidate the local sheriff had made political donations to during his campaign now  despite his legal team s argument that he was exempt because he was only charged with a misdemeanor  a judge has ordered that gianforte turn himself in by september  for booking on the charge  if the congressman doesn t comply  the judge said  he will be held in contempt of court although gianforte has paid his fines  apologized to jacobs  and donated    to the committee to protect journalists  he has yet to complete his community service  there is no word whether he has followed through on the anger management classes he was ordered to attend practically speaking  a mugshot should worry the congressman when it comes time for reelection  campaign ads could use it freely  as they are public record  but the question remains whether gianforte  who raised nearly    in donations after admitting to the assault  has anything to worry about at all with the voters of montana featured image via justin sullivan getty images
