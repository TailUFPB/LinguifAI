mitt romney got a lot of praise and a lot of headlines this past year when he came out and attacked donald trump s presidential campaign  and made himself the de facto head of the  never trump  movement  but now he has completely humiliated himself by sucking up to trump after the election  first appearing to him to beg him for the secretary of state job  then going out to dinner with trump and rnc chairman reince priebus in new york after dining with the man who made fun of him at every turn for months on end  romney appeared without his dignity after the meal to heap more praise on trump watch   mittromney addresses reporters following dinner with president elect  realdonaldtrump   breaking  kellyfile pic twitter com ewakmdtnuu  fox news   foxnews  november    s decision to humiliate himself and his family name  his father gov  george romney marched with martin luther king  is a disgusting moment in american politics  and shows once again that the moral outrage demonstrated by  never trump  was as phony as a three dollar bill and perhaps it shouldn t be surprising  when trump was best known in politics for pushing the racist birther conspiracy  it was mitt romney who first elevated his stature in mainstream republican politics  against advice from his team and against good taste  romney held an event in  where trump endorsed him and the two men stood on stage together  slapping each other s backs later in the campaign  when trump was pushing conspiracy theories about obama s college record  romney also enlisted trump to cut advertising for him in the form of robocalls to help get out the vote so romney going to trump  on bended knee in front of cameras from the international and national press  is just another chapter in the story of once powerful men humiliating themselves in front of a clown  abandoning whatever little shred of principles they had left  just to get a sip of the power  gross featured image via twitter
