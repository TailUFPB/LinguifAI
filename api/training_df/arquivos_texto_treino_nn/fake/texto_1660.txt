remember when bill o reilly took a vacation after his sexual harassment payoffs went public  well  let s hope jesse watters  vacation is permanent  too watters is a product of bill o reilly s former fox news program  the racist and sexist segments known as watters  world often targeted specific groups in a sick and twisted version of right wing  humor  from there  watters was promoted as a guest host and just days after beginning a full time gig on the five  he is already taking time off after making a crude oral sex joke about ivanka trump on the air while discussing trump being jeered and booed in germany for hypocritically talking about empowerment of women  watters complained about liberals attacking ivanka and characterized those attacks as anti women even though what liberals are criticizing for is her blatant hypocrisy  ivanka claims to be a champion for women s rights but stands idly by while her father signs executive orders reducing protections for women  in short  she is complicit by staying silent anyway  watters couldn t control himself and ended up making a sex joke about ivanka only days after bill o reilly was fired for sexual harassment  and his joke came just after whining about how liberals are supposedly  disrespecting  women by booing ivanka  i really like the way she is speaking into that microphone   watters said while gesturing with his hands  implying that he s talking about oral sex here s the video via youtube watters later tried to cover his ass by claiming that he was merely talking about her voice  on air i was referring to ivanka s voice and how it resonates like a smooth jazz radio dj   watters wrote   this was in no way a joke about anything else  viewers of watters  words and actions drew sharp criticism  especially from conservative writer john podheretz  who referred to watters as a  disgusting creep  you are so full of shit it s coming out your ears  you disgusting creep  https   t co   john podhoretz   jpodhoretz  april    now watters is going on a  vacation  for the rest of the week again  watters was only on his third day on the job as a full time host of the five and he couldn t control himself from making a crude sex joke about a woman  he demonstrated perfectly that the sexist environment at fox news has not changed at all  it s merely been taken over by younger frat boys if fox news is serious about changing the culture at their network  they should make sure watters stays on  vacation  featured image  screenshot
