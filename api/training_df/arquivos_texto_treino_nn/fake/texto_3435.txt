the republican party has been nervous as hell ever since the cia released reports that russia had meddled in the u s  election in order to sway it toward donald trump  this tension within the gop couldn t have been more obvious than when republican national committee spokesman sean spicer had a fullblown meltdown over his distrust of the cia while being interviewed by msnbc on monday  host kate snow brought up the recent reports about russia s interference  and spicer was quick to deny the truth  spicer said that any evidence that the kremlin was trying to help trump win is based on the fact that the rnc was hacked  and it was not hacked   he said  that does call into question the intelligence and the conclusions they came to  snow then asked spicer to clarify whether or not he is saying he doesn t believe the cia   and that s when spicer devolved into a toddler  obviously taking hints from trump  and began throwing a temper tantrum  spice yelled  stop doing that  that s not what i said  no  you keep snow jumped in and said   i m just asking a question  are you saying you don t trust the cia  because just a moment ago you said three letter agencies with unnamed sources  that s why i m asking  do you not trust spicer continued on with his angry rant  making it clear that he doubted the validity of the cia s reports  he shouted  no  no  tell me someone in the cia  give me a name  publish a report and we ll deal with it  right now  you guys start saying that you read these reports  you have no name behind it  it should be noted that there are even members within the republican party that wholeheartedly trust the cia and are backing an investigation into this matter  snow responded that the cia has a  high degree of confidence  that the kremlin was behind trump s win  snow asked spicer   i m asking  do you not believe that  spicer continued to snap  growing more angry with each question  he fired back  can i answer the question  they ve now walked that back in the course of the last  hours  so my point to you is this  the facts that we were initially presented with are clearly not accurate and so it does call into question   and i find it interesting that you guys aren t asking them to provide further proof of this  spicer ended his rant by insulting news networks like the one he was on  stating that news organizations were not doing a good job in getting more evidence of russian interference you can watch spicer go insane below featured image via screenshot
