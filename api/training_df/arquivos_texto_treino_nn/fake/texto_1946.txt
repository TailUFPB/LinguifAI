when devin nunes went running to trump with information that trump s transition team was caught up in surveillance  he probably didn t think he d get caught in his lies  he probably didn t think that anybody would look into his claim that  while yes  he visited the white house  he absolutely did not get his info from white house staffers  the new york times did  and now nunes  entire world is cracking around him two of his sources were  in fact  white house staffers with not insignificant positions  one was ezra cohen watnick  the senior director of intelligence for the national security council who was brought on board by the one and only disgraced michael flynn the other was michael ellis  a national security lawyer working in the white house counsel s office  ellis once served as a staffer for the house intelligence committee so it s not like nunes got his info from two low level  no name staffers who may or may not know anything real  he got it from high level security officials within the white house  and now his credibility is shot to hell the sources who spoke to the new york times did so on the condition of anonymity  but they did say that the reports that ellis and cohen watnick were looking at pretty much matched what nunes said they were  nunes has insisted from the beginning of the house s russia investigation that the real problem is who s leaking information  and why he could identify some of the people in the intelligence reports  and not the possibility of high treason but now that we know he lied about where his sources came from  we have to wonder where his loyalties lie and whether he himself is guilty of treason while the house intelligence committee remains stalled due to nunes feeling more obligated to trump than he does to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation  the senate intelligence committee is plugging smoothly on with theirs  at the bare minimum  nunes needs to recuse himself from this investigation  he really ought to resign his post entirely  though featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
