legendary investigative reporter carl bernstein sees right through donald trump s bullshit in response to former fbi director james comey s testimony that outed trump as a liar who fired him just because he wouldn t drop a federal investigation  trump accused comey of perjury and has labeled him a  leaker  because he released his memos to the press  the memos  however  were not classified information and are protected by law and supreme court rulings but trump is still throwing a temper tantrum anyway and that hypocritical as watergate reporter carl bernstein sees it during an appearance on cnn  bernstein took trump to the woodshed for being the top leaker in his own administration  he s trying to discredit comey  he s trying to rouse his base as he did at the faith initiative conference yesterday   bernstein said   he s somebody that s worried about what s down the road later rather than now  so he s gone to the question   comey is a leaker   thinking that is going to discredit him  particularly with his own base  when in fact donald trump is a leaker  he s been a leaker for all of his professional life  he s even leaked by falsely impersonating himself under another name  so this is a big game in which the president and the people around him know that he has been damaged  that these investigations are closing in on him and right now he wants to the weight of his followers behind him and he wants to keep them in place so republicans on the hill don t abandon him  right now what is clear to those of us who have studied this white house is that donald trump is engaged in a scorched earth battle against james comey and he s playing to his base for all its worth  here s the video via youtube indeed  the most damning evidence of trump being the real leaker is when he leaked highly classified intelligence with russian officials during an oval office meeting last month the information was so sensitive that it had not even been shared with our top allies yet the washington post reported the partner had not given the united states permission to share the material with russia  and officials said trump s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the islamic state  after trump s meeting  senior white house officials took steps to contain the damage  placing calls to the cia and the national security agency  this is code word information   said a u s  official familiar with the matter  using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by american spy agencies  trump  revealed more information to the russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies  trump even gave the russians a good idea of who gathered the intelligence for us by naming the city it came from trump willfully endangered our national security and harmed the trust of an ally by leaking this sensitive information to the russians  that makes him a true leaker  and he should be impeached and put in prison for it featured image  screenshot
