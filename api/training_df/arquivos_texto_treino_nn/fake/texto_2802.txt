republican congressman charlie dent represents a district with one of the largest syrian refugee populations in the country  and he is not happy about trump s muslim ban  he spoke to the new york times  jonathan martin  saying  i urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be instated  one of dent s constituents is a family that was detained in philadelphia  despite having all the necessary paperwork  including green cards  to enter the country  this has been the story all over the u s    people held  or even turned around  despite having all of the necessary legal paperwork to enter the u s and there are protests erupting all over the place because of this  people are demanding u s  customs release those they ve detained  even though customs officials have to follow trump s edicts but dent seems to be primarily alone in his party  republicans on capitol hill seem to be keeping their mouths shut on the issue  probably because they thought it was a good idea and now can t admit they might have been wrong about what would happen  or they re still delusional  the new york times  glenn thrush said they haven t been this quiet  since the last positive jobs report under obama  the few that have spoken about it say it s necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the u s   but what they re totally missing is that this is just going to provide more fodder for radical elements like isis to recruit new members  it also splits families up  prevents people from coming home even if they live here perfectly legally  has already sparked backlash from iran  and is an overall mess one immigration expert calls this illegal because of a  law that prohibits discriminating against people based on their race  sex  nationality  place of residence  or place of birth  so where are republicans except for dent  they seem to be hiding featured image by pete marovich via getty images
