trump supporter  anti islam  activist   and vapid  racist fool james stachowiak is furious  now  stachowiak is almost perpetually enraged  but this time shark tank host mark cuban made johnny infidel   as the tea partier calls himself  furious  recently  cuban predicted that a trump presidency would create a dire economic downturn stachowiak complained that he saw cuban make the remarks on fox news  he says that he has no doubt the market will tank if trump wins the presidency   the right wing  activist  whines   well  just like every coin has two sides  i m gonna give the other side of the coin  i have no doubt that if hillary wins  americans will die because americans died  hillary lied  and benghazi still matters   he rambles  adding that a clinton presidency will lead to  more americans brutally sodomized  murdered  their bodies burned and dragged through the streets of more capitols across the globe like what happened in benghazi  boy  what a persuasive argument stachowiak then compares hillary clinton to the soviet spies  the rosenbergs  who were executed for treason because they actually committed treason   unlike clinton  who has not committed a single prosecutable offense  what hillary has done makes the rosenbergs  actions pale in comparison   he explains   hillary s actions have actually caused americans to die  benghazi   then things get crazy ier   it is my opinion  and i m probably one of the first to say it  that hillary clinton should be put on trial   hopefully under a trump presidency   and found guilty of treason for compromising national security  she should be sentenced to death at a federal court  hillary clinton s proper place in our country is in front of a firing squad for committing treason against our country  what should happen to mark cuban   stachowiak asks rhetorically before burning a photograph of the clinton supporter yeah  that s what he thinks should happen to mark cuban  let s hope none of his insane fans act on it featured image via screengrab
