if you thought richard nixon was bad  just wait till donald trump gets in office on a scale of    prominent nixon expert rick perlstein rated trump an    on just how  nixonian  he is during an interview on msnbc trump s obsession with revenge  his pettiness  his constant lying  and his desire to shut down the press paint a picture of a petulant child that goes beyond the personality displayed by the  president in fact  perlstein sees a lot of nixon in trump  but trump is more outlandish and transparently authoritarian  nixon was very shrewd and tactical  sedulous  careful  he wouldn t have been tweeting  he would have been saying   let s take away the washington post s broadcast licenses that they rely on for their revenue   which  you know  trump may be doing soon when he is granted the power of the executive office   perlstein warned indeed  trump is poised to change the relationship between the white house and the press from one of cordiality and mutual benefit to one of antagonism and open hostility trump s refusal to accept facts makes him even more of a threat because he will now have the power to punish news outlets who write the truth about him host christ hayes pointed out that unlike trump  nixon had some self control  nixon would not have taken to the podium and said   i don t like this person  this person and dan rather   he was self controlled enough to channel that  this is different insofar as this is all out there in public  perlstein then explained how trump may attack people who criticize him once he takes control of the full power of the government  including the nsa  which he could use as his personal  spying apparatus  basically once trump can find out anything enemies are up to and find out where their vulnerabilities are  maybe find embarrassing things about them  leak them to breitbart and soon it s  you know  on cnn  god forbid msnbc  then we re talking about a different ballgame  hayes noted that such behavior by a president is ultimately what led to nixon losing the trust of the american people and being forced to resign or face impeachment perlstein then warned that trump could use the irs to attack people and businesses who have slighted him and seek lists of names in departments so he can  cut them off at the knees   which is something his transition team is already doing here s the video via youtube but even if trump commits these impeachable offenses  republicans in congress don t care about the constitution enough to actually do something about it  they see trump as the puppet to pursue their destructive agenda  and they ll look the other way as long as he remains a useful idiot featured image via screenshot
