donald trump  jr  went before congress today to give yet another version of his reasons for meeting with a russian lawyer in june of   while he did actually confirm what he said in the email string he was dumb enough to post to twitter that he met with natalia veselnitskaya because she claimed to have dirt on hillary he gave a ridiculous reason for it  his reason was that he was trying to determine hillary s fitness for office  because that s a totally innocent reason that makes it all okay so that makes it all innocent  especially because he also claimed that he was just so overwhelmed with the campaign due to inexperience  but he did still evidently have the presence of mind to know he should talk to legal counsel about the propriety of the meeting and info  or so his claim goes some  however  on the senate judiciary committee don t believe him  it seems  sen  chris coons  who sits on that committee  sent out a memo to  interested parties  about don the con jr  and his testimony today  complete with the statute regarding giving false testimony to congress  and there s no ambiguity about it   the top of the memo says  below is a statute to keep in mind in regards to donald trump jr  s testimony today  it quotes the full statute  which states that it s illegal to lie to congress  and then coons says  it is important to remember that anyone who testifies in front of a senate committee is under the restrictions of the false statements statute that says material false statements to congress are criminal and punishable with fines or imprisonment or both  read coons  full memo below   after don jr  testimony to senate judiciary cmte  sen  chris coons  office sends out statute on giving false statements to congress pic twitter com oudkxmbfqm  andrew desiderio   desideriodc  september    many contradictions in don jr  s reasons for meeting with veselnitskaya clearly raise doubts that his testimony today was the truth  he first claimed  months ago  that he didn t meet with any russians  and then later claimed that meant he didn t meet with any known russian officials  then he claimed that he did meet with a russian attorney  but it was about adoptions  after that  he said he did meet with her  but it was because he was told she had dirt on hillary  he said the meeting was a fruitless endeavor now he says it s because he wanted to determine her fitness for the presidency  which he seems to think makes it all okay  coons is right to be skeptical  it would be one thing if the junior trump s story had never changed  and contradicting information had never come out  but it s impossible to trust the testimony of someone who s changed their story as many times as he has featured image via john moore getty images
