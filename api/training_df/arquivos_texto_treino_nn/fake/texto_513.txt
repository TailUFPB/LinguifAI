in house speaker paul ryan s ayn randish views  the way to fix the economy is by starving the poor to death  it s also totally going to help the poor   somehow  ryan  a catholic  was challenged by a nun during his first town hall in two years on monday evening  after angry constituents filled the room  sister erica jordan  a dominican nun and retired school principal took ryan s faith and his actions toward the poor to task  i know that you re a catholic  as am i  and it seems to me that most of the republicans in the congress are not willing to stand with the poor and working class  as evidenced in the recent debates about health care and the anticipated tax reform   sister jordan said   so i d like to ask how you see yourself upholding the church s social teaching that has the idea that god is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed  as should we be  in response  ryan said   sister  you may   this may come as a surprise to you  but i completely agree with you  where we may disagree is on how to achieve that goal  as you know  we all exercise prudential judgment in practicing our faith  and for me  the preferential option for the poor  which is something that s a key tenet of the catholic faith  that means upward mobility  that means economic growth  that means equality of opportunity   he continued   that to me means working with this guy over here at gateway tech to make sure that we can close the skills gap  to make sure that every person who wants a career and job can get the benefits  except that ryan is wrong but at least he s consistent  republicans do not want to make higher education affordable so the  skills gap  claim doesn t hold water  the poor are being marginalized and misaligned  in many ways  because a lot of the programs that we have  well intentioned as they may be  are discouraging and disincentivizing work   he continued  i think we need to change our approach on fighting poverty   he said without one bit of irony   instead of measuring success on how much money we spend or how many programs we create or how many people on those programs  let s measure success and poverty on outcomes  watch the budget produced by ryan s house of representatives would cut education and job training programs by  percent math still matters  mr  ryan featured image via screen capture
