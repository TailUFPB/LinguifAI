donald trump has absolutely ravaged the reputation of the republican party  and conservatives know it  their failure to repeal and replace obamacare was a multi failure disaster that made the gop the laughingstock of politics  with trump championing the train wreck  now  republicans are desperate to save the last remaining strands of dignity the party might have  and some are throwing trump under the bus cnn has just reported that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is blaming trump for giving the republican party a horrible reputation and making them look incompetent and incapable of governing  in a whiny rant in which he complained that trump is making him look bad  mcconnell said  our new president  of course  has not been in this line of work before  i think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process  more specifically  mcconnell insisted that the gop is working just fine  in the same breath  he pointed the finger at trump s tendency to give the gop artificial deadlines for legislature  part of the reason i think people think we re under performing is because of too many artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality of the legislature which may have not been understood  it s not surprising that mcconnell is going after trump now   he s become increasingly frustrated with trump s failure to understand how to run a country or how the government actually works  while trump is certainly to blame for being a total imbecile and having ridiculously unrealistic expectations of what he can actually get done  mcconnell s leadership in the senate has been highly flawed of course  mcconnell and trump are not going to take any responsibility for their part and will just keep blaming each other as the gop continues to crash and burn  we re currently witnessing the ugly breakdown of the republican party  and it s a shame that trump is making sure the rest of america goes down with it read more featured image via alex wong  and scott olson   getty images
