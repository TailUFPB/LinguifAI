the man who served as white house counsel to former president richard nixon during watergate  and ended up facing charges for helping to it cover up  is weighing in on donald trump s ongoing scandal with russia  his opinion  trump s administration is  in cover up mode  john dean sat down for an interview with msnbc s chris hayes on monday night and his summation of trump s current situation was clear when hayes asked about trump s shady ties to russia and his bogus wiretapping claims  in fact  is in cover up mode   dean replied on monday  fbi director james comey testified before the house intelligence committee and he confirmed that the bureau is indeed investigating russia s interference in the  election  he also said that the fbi is investigating the possibility that trump and his campaign colluded with russia in addition  comey said during the hearing that the justice department has absolutely no evidence to support trump s claim that former president obama had the phones at trump tower tapped according to dean  trump s desperate attempts to distance himself from comey s testimony is highly suggestive of a  cover  up  there s just never been any question in my mind about that  i ve been inside a cover up  i know how they look and feel  and every signal they re sending is   we re covering this thing up    dean said  experienced investigators know this  they know how people react when they re being pursued  and this white house is not showing their innocence  they re showing how damn guilty they are  is what we re seeing  during the watergate scandal  dean ended up charged with obstruction of justice  trump  he said  is well on his way to committing the same crime  there s also the question of whether this white house will obstruct  essentially  an investigation  you now have the head of the fbi with a target painted on its back  the front line investigators with targets painted on their backs  you have a u s  attorney the president said he was going to retain who has been summarily fired in preet bharara  and it strikes me that there is in some ways a kind of obstruction land mine   that the entirety of the white house now has to tip toe through   dean said trump had personally promised bharara that he would be keeping his job  then last week he changed his mind and fired him without warning  bharara just happened to be investigating trump s health and human services secretary tom price  among other things   but of course  this had absolutely nothing to do with trump suddenly deciding to give him the boot   insert sarcasm here  trump s russia problem isn t going away anytime soon  like with watergate  it is just a matter of time until the truth comes out and trump s dirty deeds blow up in his face featured image via win mcnamee getty images
