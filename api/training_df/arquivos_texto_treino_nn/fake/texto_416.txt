now that seahawks star defensive end michael bennett s harrowing story of police brutality has gone viral  the cops who arrested him are trying to cover their own asses in a pr fueled letter to the nfl commissioner  roger goodell  in the letter  detective steve grammas  the president of the las vegas metro police protective association  asks goodell to open an investigation into bennett s allegations  and requests that the commissioner  take appropriate action  the irony is rich in seeing a letter asserting that the lvpd isn t racist  even as the first paragraph of it calls out the nfl for  condoning  bennett s protest during the national anthem  a stance that only racists take bennett s protest  along with that of many players around the league  is specifically against police brutality when dealing with unarmed  innocent black  suspects   to continue to insist that it is somehow disrespecting to  everything the flag symbolizes  is to ignore that the flag symbolizes justice as well but the truly disgusting part of grammas  letter is the reason he and the las vegas police attempt to use as justification for having unlawfully detained bennett in the first place  grammas actually asserts that hiding behind a slot machine  then running outside during an episode in which shots are being fired is considered probable cause to arrest bennett for  suspicious behavior  guess what  geniuses  if mike bennett was running from the cops  you all just proved him right to have done so  he clearly has no gun  obviously isn t the only person in the entire casino hiding from the gunfire  and wasn t even remotely the only person running out the doors   bennett himself said that  hundreds  of people were staging an exodus from the scene one would think that maybe the guy with the super bowl ring on who kind of looks like michael bennett and can leap over a four foot barrier might not be their suspect it is my most sincere hope that bennett and his lawyers not only sue the department  but detective grammas personally  for being the kind of dumbass who would send a self contradictory letter like this in a case where he s clearly just trying to fire back at bennett s allegations featured image via mat hayward getty images
