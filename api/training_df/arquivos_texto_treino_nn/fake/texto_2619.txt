donald trump s white house mouthpiece just desecrated an american civil rights icon to defend a racist back in   coretta scott king wrote a letter in opposition to ronald reagan s nomination of jeff sessions to a federal judgeship  the widow of martin luther king jr  condemned sessions for his track record on voting rights and implored republicans to reject him  they did mrs  king died in  but her words against sessions continue to haunt him to this day as he has been nominated by trump to be attorney general  which would give him the power to cripple civil rights and voting rights across this country king wrote that sessions  lacks the temperament  fairness  and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens  his attempt to prosecute three civil right activists who were helping black people vote in alabama  raises serious questions about his commitment to the protections of the voting rights of all american citizens and consequently his fair and unbiased judgement regarding this fundamental right  based on his record  i believe his confirmation would have a devastating effect on not only the judicial system in alabama  but also on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my husband s dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago  sean spicer  however  seems to think that if king were alive today  she would just  come around  to supporting sessions and would change her mind about him during the daily press briefing  spicer said  i would respectfully disagree with her assessment of senator sessions then and now  his record on civil voting rights  i think  is outstanding  i can only hope that if she were still with us today that after getting to know him that she would share the same view  spicer went on to lie his ass off about sessions  painting him as a civil rights hero when the fact is that sessions is the man who didn t mind the kkk until he found out that they smoked pot  he didn t seem to give a damn about the history of lynching and racism the kkk is responsible for here s the video via twitter ugh  spicer desecrates coretta scott king  tells string of lies about sessions pic twitter com   tommy christopher   tommyxtopher  february    has been fierce opposition to sessions ever since trump nominated him  the kkk endorsed trump and cheered his decision when he announced sessions as his pick to head the justice department  clearly  racists see sessions as their chance to roll back critical civil and voting rights protections for minorities if coretta scott king were alive today  it is unlikely she would join the kkk by endorsing sessions  she would still oppose jeff sessions and so should every american who believes in liberty and justice for all  because if jeff sessions is confirmed  he will take the justice out of the justice department and all the progress made by real civil rights heroes will be erased read more featured image  alex wong getty images
