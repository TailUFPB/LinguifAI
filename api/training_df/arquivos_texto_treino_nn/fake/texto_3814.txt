while donald trump is back peddling on several of his campaign promises  like the wall  repealing obamacare  prosecuting hillary clinton and his muslim ban  in an interview on  minutes  trump vowed that he would immediately institute one of his worst promises  he claimed he ll start deporting undocumented residents right away  but it s  okay  because it s only the criminals  what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records  gang members  drug dealers  where a lot of these people  probably  million  it could be even  million  we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate   trump told   minutes  correspondent lesley stahl  according to a preview of the interview released by cbs   but we re getting them out of our country  they re here illegally  as for the rest of the undocumented immigrants  after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized  we re going to make a determination on the people that they re talking about   who are terrific people  they re terrific people  but we are gonna make a determination at that   trump said   but before we make that determination it s very important  we are going to secure our border  the washington post notes that the department of homeland security  in   said there were about   million  removable criminal aliens   that number is not just about people who are here illegally  many are here lawfully  but have broken the law regardless  there are some major civil rights and logistical problems  including how do we figure out exactly who has committed crimes  it s not like they re just sitting in jail robert reich asks this out of an estimated population of  million undocumented immigrants  how exactly will the government identify these people  will there be wholesale roundups and interrogations  anyone who looks latino stopped and identity checked  anonymous accusations to government agents of gang membership or drug dealing  and what is the responsibility of the rest of us   including those of us living in  sanctuary cities    to stop such abuses despite trump s assertions that immigrants are criminals and rapists  they  by and large  aren t  undocumented immigrants  for pretty obvious reasons  they don t want to attract the attention of the law  stay out of trouble  in several studies quoted by the conservative wall street journal  immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and less likely to be locked up for crimes  it s not just well educated immigrants working in silicon valley who stay out of trouble  it s immigrants from latin american countries as well despite the fact that immigrants as criminals is just a red herring  and the real immigration problem is the fact that employers hire undocumented workers  this will put a lot of people s lives in danger  trump has given his tacit permission for his voters to become vigilante warriors  hate crimes are already up and trump has done nothing to denounce them  let alone quell them featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
