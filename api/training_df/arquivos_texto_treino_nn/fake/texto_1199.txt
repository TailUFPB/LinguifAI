donald trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it when former fbi director james comey testified under oath in the senate on thursday  he recalled that trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of michael flynn and trump s ties to russia  the president said   i need loyalty  i expect loyalty   comey testified but when asked by abc reporter jon karl if he had demanded comey s loyalty  trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life  so he said those things under oath   karl began   would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events  one hundred percent   trump replied   i didn t say under oath   i hardly know the man  i m not going to say  i want you to pledge allegiance  who would do that  who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath  i mean  think of it  i hardly know the man  it doesn t make sense  no  i didn t say that  and i didn t say the other  if trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury  and cnn proved it by playing video of trump on the campaign trail in florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him  keep in mind that trump had never met anyone in that audience  but he had several discussions and meetings with comey  in other words  comey was not a complete stranger to him  if he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him  he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from comey here s the damning video via youtube this is yet more proof that trump is a liar who has zero credibility  he will say anything to save his own ass featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
