whenever the white house puts out a statement regarding donald trump  you can be sure of one thing  it s just a matter of time until trump himself contradicts that statement  over and over  trump has thrown his spokespeople under the bus as he publicly says the opposite of what his surrogates have told the public  and he just did it again according to the white house  trump s second meeting with russian president vladimir putin was merely  a brief conversation at the end of a dinner  nothing more than a perfectly innocent exchange of  pleasantries and small talk   true to form  trump blew this cover to smithereens shortly after the statement was made and revealed that the private meeting  which officials say lasted  more than an hour   was actually a discussion about policy here is what trump had to say to the new york times about his second meeting with putin she  was sitting next to putin and somebody else  and that s the way it is  so the meal was going  and toward dessert i went down just to say hello to melania  and while i was there i said hello to putin  really  pleasantries more than anything else  it was not a long conversation  but it was  you know  could be  minutes  just talked about   things  actually  it was very interesting  we talked about adoption we talked about russian adoption  yeah  i always found that interesting  because  you know  he ended that years ago  and i actually talked about russian adoption with him  which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that don  had in that meeting and here s the problem with what he said  the whole topic of russian adoption is far from just being casual small talk  putin got mad when president obama implemented the magnitsky act in   which was meant to punish russia for their blatant human rights violations  in retaliation  putin banned the adoption of russian children by u s  citizens so  by stating that he and putin discussed russian adoptions  trump just inadvertently admitted that he discussed official policy in a private meeting with a foreign adversary  whoops  this puts the u s  government at a significant disadvantage because we have no record of what transpired conversationally between the president and putin  former nato commander james stavridis explained yet again  trump has chosen russia and putin over the american people  sad featured image via michael reynolds   pool getty images
