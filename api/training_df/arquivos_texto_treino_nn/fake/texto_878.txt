for someone who is as vocal and outspoken as donald trump on social media  he has shockingly thin skin  trump has been known to hide and run away from protesters both on and offline  unable to take the much needed criticism that americans are trying to offer  because of trump s fragile ego  it has been quite common for trump to block other twitter users for simply expressing their first amendment rights  this habit  however  has landed trump in deep sh t  he s now being sued for it on tuesday  trump and his top white house officials were sued by the knight first amendment institute for blocking twitter users simply because they were criticizing him  the case  which was filed in manhattan federal court  states that this violates the constitution and calls for trump to stop blocking dissenting americans immediately trump had been warned that this would happen  in june  the knight first amendment institute sent a letter to trump  his counsel  press secretary  and social media director  stating that they were representing two twitter users that had been blocked after criticizing trump  trump failed to listen  and now the institute is representing five more twitter users who have been treated this way by the president the complaint states that trump s twitter account is  a public forum under the first amendment  because he and his staff are using it to make presidential announcements and constantly use it to communicate with the american people  press secretary sean spicer has also called trump s tweets  official statements  in the past the complaint also states that trump s blocking  imposes an unconstitutional restriction on their right to access statements that defendants are otherwise making available to the public at large  it also imposes an unconstitutional restriction on their right to petition the government for redress of grievances  jameel jaffer  the knight institute s executive director  said  president trump s twitter account has become an important source of news and information about the government  and an important forum for speech by  to  or about the president  the first amendment applies to this digital forum in the same way it applies to town halls and open school board meetings  the white house acts unlawfully when it excludes people from this forum simply because they ve disagreed with the president  the knight institute is calling on the court to declare trump s viewpoint based blocking  unconstitutional  force trump to unblock the plaintiffs and have trump pay for their legal fees it s about time something like this caught up with trump  he s conducted himself as the least transparent  and less interested potus when it comes to listening to the american people  he tries to silence and drown out all of the dissenting voices around him  instead of actually considering that there might be a reason behind his historically low approval rating  trump is not a dictator  and he cannot take away americans  first amendment rights  not even when their free speech opposes him  it s about time he learned featured image via alex wong   getty images
