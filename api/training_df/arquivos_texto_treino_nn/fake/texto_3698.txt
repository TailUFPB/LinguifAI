if donald trump thought he d be seeing elton john sing his praises on inauguration day he was sorely mistaken during an interview with bbc  trump transition team member anthony scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer elton john will be performing at trump s inauguration on january   elton john is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration   scaramucci said  adding that john s appearance  shows our commitment to gay rights  this will be the first american president in us history that enters the white house with a pro gay rights stance   scaramucci continued there s just one problem  apparently  trump and his team failed to ask elton john first because after hearing about this claim  elton john told trump to go f ck himself first a representative for john made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near trump s inauguration   elton will not be performing at trump s inauguration   the rep said then john s publicist fran curtis rejected the claim more emphatically   incorrect  he will not be performing  donald trump may be a fan of elton john  but the feeling is far from mutual  john supported hillary clinton for president and said of trump just last month that   we need a humanitarian in the white house  not a barbarian  just because donald trump said on  minutes that same sex marriage is settled law  it doesn t mean that the lgbt community believes him  after all  trump s running mate is mike pence  a man who is vehemently anti gay  plus  conservatives expect trump to nominate anti gay judges to the supreme court  which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy so while trump is claiming that he s pro gay rights  his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the lgbt community to stand behind him  because elton john is not going to be used as a propaganda tool featured image  wikimedia
