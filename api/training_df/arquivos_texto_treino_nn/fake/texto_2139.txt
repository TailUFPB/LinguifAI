less than  hours after trump s press secretary sean spicer said the president was  extremely confident  that his accusations against obama for wiretapping trump tower would be proven correct  the house intelligence committee scheduled a press conference to say they found zero evidence that this happened  absolutely zero house intel chair devin nunes has been a strong trump supporter and has repeatedly flirted with launching a full fledged investigation into trump s claims that obama spied on him  instead  after a week of complete nonsense  nunes said he and his committee are confident there was not  an actual tap of trump tower   this directly contradicts trump s unfounded accusation how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    repeated calls to provide evidence  trump has not done so  nunes said in light of the lack of evidence  he isn t buying it gop house intel chair on trump s claim   we don t have any evidence that took place   i don t think there was an actual tap of trump tower  pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  march    has failed to provide any details about the allegations he made against obama  according to a timeline of events and also staffers within the white house  trump got his information   which would implicate obama in a major felony   from a story run on white nationalist website breitbart  which  in turn  had lifted the conspiracy theory almost verbatim from a conservative radio host named mark levin  neither breitbart nor levin bothered to offer any proof for these allegations   in fairness  neither probably expected that their obama hit job pieces would find their way into the president s early morning tweetstorms and their regular readers  eager to hate obama  don t typically require evidence for their outrageous claims  so it s painfully obvious that trump is a unrepentant liar  but being a republican hack meant nunes couldn t let it go at that  he had to try to paint obama as sinister in other ways  rather than admit his president is a liar who made these allegations without a shred of proof  nunes expanded his definition of  spying  to include the  incidental collection of americans that were possibly tied to trump s campaign   he hoped this would mean americans would see that as an intrusion of trump s privacy which is extremely weird because that only goes to show the uncomfortable relationships between trump and the russians during the campaign  the very fact that their were  incidental collections  of information on trump s staffers was because those staffers  think michael flynn  were communicating with russian operatives who were under surveillance  this would be like having a chat with an isis leader then being mad that the cia listened in ironically  that makes trump and his goons look much worse than either obama or the cia so how does nunes sleep at night knowing he s supporting a president who is   at best   a pathological liar  he said he s not sure trump was being  literal  when he accused obama of the worst political crime since watergate house intel chair devin nunes   are you going to take the tweets literally  and if you are  then clearly the president is wrong  via  msnbc pic twitter com   kyle griffin     march    image via twitter
