the benignly named national policy institute held a meeting on saturday  where  white nationalists and neo nazi types gathered to celebrate pushing extreme racism and anti semitism back into the mainstream courtesy of donald trump s elevation  richard spencer  npi s leader  actually greeted them by shouting   hail trump  hail our people  hail victory  and the people cheered while raising their arms in the nazi salute spencer is the person who coined the term  alt right  to make his fascist movement sound more palatable  but it doesn t change who they are  these are people who share spencer s dream of an  ethno state that would be a gathering point for all europeans   meaning all white people who aren t jewish  they re looking to restore purity to the  superior  white race npi s agenda for the conference included topics like   trump and the new white voter    the future of the alt right   and  america and the jewish consciousness   and the meeting was more heavily attended this year than it has been in years past  spencer s opening remarks included  an awakening among everyone has occurred with this trump election  we re not quite the establishment now  but i think we should start acting like it  yes  trump is their hitler  pretty much literally at this point anybody who doesn t find this terrifying ought to  because pushing nazi ideology into the mainstream and into trump s administration brings us way too close to the very thing that republicans feared the most until this year  horrific  fascist dictatorship  this isn t the america we re supposed to be but it s the america that these people want  and  as the holocaust showed us  years ago  people who think this way will do anything to achieve it spencer and his racist and anti semitic followers believe that the u s  originally belonged to white christians only  and they want to push us back there  that means widespread deportation of anyone who isn t  white enough   and possibly worse  given that the administration is actually  really discussing a registry for muslims that could lead to internment  the idea that they can influence trump against other groups  too  isn t all that far fetched anymore and the rise of hate incidents and crimes against anyone who isn t white serves as further evidence that these nazi types feel they ve been vindicated because of trump s election haaretz reporter peter beinart called these  interesting times  on twitter  as he watched spencer spew anti semitic and racist rhetoric while waiting to pick up his son at a jewish school  interesting  hardly  downright frightening is more like it featured image via screen capture
