women should get as far away from oklahoma as soon as possible because christian sharia law is about to make their lives a living hell if oklahoma state gop rep  george faught has his way  rape will be on the path to being legal in the state  at least that s what rapists are hoping for after faught made a frightening statement on the subject during a debate on house bill   which restricts abortion democratic rep  cory williams masterfully cornered faught during the hearing by asking him if he believes rape and incest are the  will of god  since the legislation has no exceptions for either  meaning women would be forced to give birth to their rapist s baby faught s reply is absolutely appalling and demonstrates once again why women should never vote for republicans  especially republicans who want to base our laws on the bible  well  you know  if you read the bible  there s actually a couple circumstances where that happened   faught said   the lord uses all circumstances  i mean  you can go down that path  but it s a reality unfortunately  faught literally just used the bible to justify rape  and then he used it to justify incest  same answer   faught replied  then he argued that williams  questions have nothing to do with the bill  williams vehemently disagreed and explained why  you are proffering a divine intervention as the reason why you won t do that and so i think it is very important   williams said before demanding faught repeat his answer again   this body wants to know   and myself personally   whether you believe rape and incest are actually the will of god  faught obliged and stated that rape and incest are god s will because god is sovereign over all activities that happen  it s a great question to ask  and  obviously if it happens in someone s life  it may not be the best thing that ever happened  but   so you re saying that god is not sovereign with every activity that happens in someone s life and can t use anything and everything in someone s life and i disagree with that  seriously here s the video via youtube this is exactly the same kind of statement that republicans like rick santorum and richard mourdock made during the  election  i believe and i think the right approach is to accept this horribly created   in the sense of rape   but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way  the gift of human life  and accept what god has given to you   santorum said during his run for the presidency   as you know  we have to  in lots of different aspects of our life  we have horrible things happen  i can t think of anything more horrible  but  nevertheless  we have to make the best out of a bad situation  i ve struggled with it myself for a long time  but i came to realize that life is that gift from god   mourdock said during his senate run in indiana  and even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape  that it is something that god intended to happen  both of these assholes think that rape is sanctioned by god and that women should appreciate the  gift  god is giving them by force  it s disgusting and is the reason why both men lost their races and now faught should be ousted from office as well featured image  wikimedia
