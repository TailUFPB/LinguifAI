fox news and the  o reilly factor  are well known for their blatant racism  but they completely outdid themselves when they decided to visit chinatown and create their most racist segment to date correspondent jesse watters took a little trip down to new york city s chinatown to discuss the gop nominee and this year s election  the result was one of the most offensive news segments to ever grace fox news  which is really saying something mother jones reports the segment  which opens with stereotypical chinese music  is spliced with movie clips featuring asian actors speaking in exaggerated accents  watters approaches a number of men and women in the street  some of them elderly residents who do not speak english  he then silently mocks them for their inability to answer his questions many of which wander from the presidential race to lame caricatures of asians masquerading as humor  is food in china just food  do you know karate  things actually manage to go downhill when watters makes it back to the studio for a sit down with the show s host  bill o reilly  yes  things actually managed to get worse o reilly notes that the majority of the people interviewed seemed to have a good understanding of what is going on in american politics  watters seemed stunned  you thought people knew what was going on   he asked with a laugh  they re such a polite people   he said  pulling out yet another stereotype of asian people   they won t walk away or tell me to get out of here  they just sit there and don t say nothing  it isn t hard to see why republicans have been losing support among the asian community  o reilly himself added that he knew there would be backlash for the racist segment and he is fully expecting to be bombarded by angry letters  eventually  though  they came to the conclusion that who gives a f ck because it was all in good fun  watch this ridiculously racist segment  here featured image via video screen capture
