trump s brazen phone calls to various world leaders are upsetting diplomats  and with good reason  he s voicing admiration for some of the worst dictators in the world  such as the leader of kazakhstan  and he wants to visit pakistan  he also ruffled feathers in some circles when he issued a casual  offhand invitation to britain s prime minister  theresa may  following phone calls to nine other world leaders his most recent phone call was to taiwan  a country with which the u s  has had no contact for nearly  years  in doing so  he may have upset the delicate balance that currently exists between us and china  because china thinks of taiwan as a  renegade province  okay  so china isn t a country that we re totally in love with right now  the problem with trump doing this  though  is that china is still a trading partner  and if he wishes to be able to negotiate a better trade deal with them  he d do well to respect them and the delicate nature of our relationship with them right now but all trump has proven thus far is that he s an idiotic  ill prepared  complete dolt when it comes to handling the presidency  and especially foreign relations  there things he doesn t even know to think about before calling absolutely everyone on the planet  white house press secretary josh earnest actually begged trump to go through proper channels  meaning the department of state  when contacting world leaders otherwise  his willy nilly phone calls like this can shake up  or even destroy  relationships that are already on shaky ground like our relationship with china he certainly didn t try to make a friend out of china during his campaign  blasting them repeatedly for stealing our jobs and essentially saying he was going to strongarm them into a trade agreement that was more favorable to us  and now beijing would actually be right if they were pissed at him for this trump needs finesse  he needs discretion  he needs a shit ton of help here  he s going to destroy all of our alliances before he even takes office this way featured image via ty wright getty images
