with the release of the  access hollywood tape revealing republican presidential nominee donald trump saying lewd remarks that revealed him to be a sexual predator  there hasn t been anyone capable of defending him however  now  in an interview with anderson cooper on cnn  melania trump is coming to her husband s defense and seemingly blaming billy bush  the other man on the access hollywood tape according to melania  bush  egged  trump on  although  if you listen to the tapes it was clearly the other way around melania told cooper  i said to my husband that  you know  the language was inappropriate  it s not acceptable  and i was surprised  because that is not the man that i know  she also said  now making excuses for his horrific behavior  and as you can see from the tape  the cameras were not on   it was only a mic  and i wonder if they even knew that the mic was on  then when asked if she s ever heard her husband speak like that  she said  no  no  that s why i was surprised  because i said like i don t know that person that would talk that way  and that he would say that kind of stuff in private  melania seems to either be in complete denial that her husband does  in fact  speak that way  or she s been instructed by her husband and his campaign to shift blame to billy bush and away from donald  either way  it s very  very bizarre in a statement after the tapes were released  melania had said  the words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me  but now she s making excuses for them  who knows what the hell is going on  really  yet  what we do know is that donald trump said those horrific remarks and needs to be kept as far away from the oval office as possible watch the video here melania thinks billy  egged on  trump into saying  dirty and bad stuff   like these two are school boys at recess  https   t co  pic twitter com ufntqrsmad  andrew kirell   andrewkirell  october    image via video screen capture
