the morning joe panel couldn t contain their laughter this morning after joe scarborough made a hilarious observation about donald trump despite the fact that trump is  years old  scarborough couldn t help but compare trump s behavior to that of a toddler as the panel discussed trump s  covfefe  boondoggle  mika brzezinski reminded scarborough about something he said before the program  i think you said something before the show that really kind of summed it up   she began   like a kid pooping their pants and then saying i meant to do that  indeed  trump s imaginary new word has been on top of the news for days now and even sean spicer was forced to defend it by saying that trump meant to say it  even dictionary publishers are having a hard time with it and scarborough s comparison was absolutely perfect  yes  it would be like somebody pooping their pants and people looking at it saying   that s modern art  don t you understand   scarborough said   i am making a statement against russian aggression in crimea  and so this is my statement  and if you don t get it something s wrong with you and not me  the panelists couldn t contain their laughter  but scarborough wasn t done yet  it s not enough that trump is constantly shitting himself  he s also sitting in it and making everyone around him sit in it  too  i m going to make another statement and i m going to sit down in my pants  and it will then be modern art and i will hang it on your wall   scarborough continued   that s what  covfefe   if anybody wants to know  that small group knows what  covfefe  is   poopy pants  he does a verbal version of that every day  but it s not just him  unfortunately now donald trump has people doing that rhetorically in their pants every day  here s the video via vidme donald trump has been shitting himself every day since election day  he couldn t even stop shitting himself when he went abroad to the middle east and europe  he embarrassed america every day during that trip and then he came home and shit himself again  trump is pathetic and he needs to be booted out of office along with anyone who supports him  presidents should not be able to smear the red  white  and blue with shit and get away with it featured image  screenshot
