over the last decade or so  a handful of people have become what you might call economic rock stars  at least for liberals  robert reich  paul krugman and joseph stiglitz grab the attention of liberals when they talk about income inequality  taking corporate influence out of politics and a more equitable tax structure bernie sanders had talked about bringing on stiglitz and reich  if he were to win the presidency  in other words  these are men who have all the credibility in the world when it comes to evaluating political candidates and nobel prize winning economist stiglitz believes that if clinton wins  we are in for an even more liberal agenda than obama has had to be fair  stiglitz is an advisor to clinton s campaign  but he rarely tones down his progressive rhetoric  no matter who he s talking to or about  with clinton  though  he gets quite specific in an interview with slate magazine  stiglitz believes that in the years since bill clinton left office  the country has changed and that we are far more focused on income inequality  something he believes hillary clinton will do something about where do you situate hillary clinton ideologically in terms of economics i think that s a good question  i think the world today is different from where it was  years ago  and the issues are being framed considerably differently  for instance  i think there s a recognition that inequality is a much bigger problem  i think she is much more concerned about more progressive taxes and dealing with tax avoidance of multinational corporations  i think she is very committed to that  i think progressives are not against trade  but they are concerned with trade agreements that are pushed by corporations  for their interests  by and for corporations  that is what we have in the form of tpp  i think it is a good thing that she has come out against that stiglitz also believes that the very fact that clinton is pragmatic   something she s often criticized for on the left   will keep he on the right track one of the progressive concerns about clinton has been that the clintons are enmeshed with this sort of global  financial elite through their foundation  and just through the circles they travel in i understand those concerns  and i guess part of the answer to that is the reality of  is that the senate banking committee has people like sherrod brown  elizabeth warren  and jeff merkel  and you are not going to get through legislation that is a sell out to wall street  knowing that  and knowing that she does not want to fight within her party  i think she is pragmatic enough  the criticism occurs because she s been  you might say  too pragmatic  the fact is she is pragmatic enough to know that these people will not tolerate the kind of sell out that i think many people have seen in previous administrations  i think it is unlikely that we will get policies that stray too far from the progressive agenda stiglitz credits bernie sanders with hillary clinton s more progressive policies  as for clinton compared to obama more conservative than hillary  yes  i think his temperament is basically more conservative and he did not go as far on dodd frank as many people wanted  he opposed some of the key provisions that eventually got in the bill for those who are still worried that hillary clinton will take on the more neoliberal policies of her husband  remember that times have changed and that we are no longer a center right nation  if anything  we are center left  and clinton knows that if she disappoints the growing progressive wing of the democratic party  she is doomed to just one term featured image via jp yim getty images
