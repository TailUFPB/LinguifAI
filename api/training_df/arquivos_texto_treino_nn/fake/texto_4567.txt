when donald trump talks about america  he often talks about how we don t  win anymore   we don t win on manufacturing  we don t win on trade  we don t win on economics  we don t win against isis  it s that last point i wish to address  because trump said at a recent rally  our military can t beat isis  can you imagine the great general douglas macarthur or the great general george patton saying we can t beat isis  patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that  we can t beat   right  can you imagine that though  can you imagine what   they re spinning right now  they re watching  they re spinning in their grave  you  donnie trump  go on  and speak like macarthur and patton talk to you  you sound like you ve assured them you can win here  and you ll do them proud  is that how you see it  donnie you re ignoring an awful lot there  donnie  neither macarthur nor patton behaved the way you do  they were tacticians  not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement  they knew when to steamroll  and when to pull back and regroup  in your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness  you ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against isis is as simple as a football game simply act like we can win  and we ll win i m sure that our dear mr  trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way  after all  nothing he ever does is wrong  period  end of  however  the problem is not how he sees it  the problem is the message he s putting forth  he s treating war  and terrorism  like they re football games  if we just think positively  believe we can win  and stop acting like we can t beat isis  we ll beat them handily that s not true generals patton and macarthur were so successful in part because they were realistic  there were massive failures during wwii  we did not ride in on this white horse to save the day  however  donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative we didn t macarthur was already in the philippines when japan attacked pearl harbor  in the ensuing months  he suffered grievous defeats  he actually ordered a withdrawal to australia to regroup  he was human  his troops were human  japan was a juggernaut at the time  and we couldn t beat them with brute force what do you think of that  donnie  macarthur actually ordered a retreat  isn t that giving up  isn t that what you re railing against  macarthur is remembered as great because of things like this  not in spite of them  and definitely not because they didn t happen then there s patton  he does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head  for instance  he s reported to have said  we shall attack and attack until we are exhausted  and then we shall attack again  yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods  congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue  there were other such incidents  too  but his qualifications are what kept him in the field  he might have stormed through battle zones like bastogne  do you even know which battle that was  donnie    ending them  but he was far from perfect donnie  all you do is talk about winning and losing  and yet  nobody has ever conceded defeat to isis  nobody in u s  leadership has said   we can t beat isis   not our president  not our current commanders  a coach telling his football team  we can t do this   hands the game to the other team  our military doesn t operate like that  however  it never has  it operates with the understanding that there will be defeats  learning from those defeats is key to beating isis   something you would know if you weren t such a conceited bastard on the ground  unit commanders  all the way down to squad leaders  will give pep talks  yes  that is normal  and you and i both know it  however  those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic  or they will end up losing it  and they know it it s not a football game isis is not wwii  and it s definitely not a game  donnie  your treating it as such doesn t just show astonishing arrogance  but it also shows that you re wholly unqualified to be the commander in chief of the u s  military  you will never be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing as though it s a goddamn football game  it s not  featured image by joe raedle getty images
