if donald trump keeps tweeting about the nyc terrorist like this he will prevent justice from being served earlier this week  a terrorist killed eight people using a vehicle  police captured him alive  so now we not only can get information that could be vital  we can try him in a court of law and get justice for the victims and their families but justice won t happen if a fair trial cannot be had and that s why trump needs to stop tweeting about it right now on wednesday night  trump seriously damaged the suspect s ability to get a fair trial by calling for him to receive the death penalty nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room  he killed  people  badly injured   should get death penalty   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    opened his big mouth again on thursday morning  spouting about how he wants to send the suspect to guantanamo bay prison  however  such a move is illegal because the suspect holds a green cardwould love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed  should move fast  death penalty   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     there are no such statistics that trump is referring to  so not only is he making it impossible for the suspect to receive a fair trail  he is demonstrating his complete ignorance of the justice system featured image  alex wong getty images
