the first thing donald trump should have thought about on tuesday morning is all the american soldiers who sacrificed their lives  years ago on the beaches of normandy in france  american troops faced the heaviest fire in what is still the largest amphibious operation ever conducted  many never even made it off the boats that carried them to shore  as depicted in the film saving private ryan  june    was a bloody and terrifying day but instead of thinking about those brave men today on the anniversary of d day  trump chose to only think about himself in yet another early morning rant on twitter  trump attacked the media and listed basically every channel except fox news as fake news and once again bragged about winning the election the fake msm is working so hard trying to get me not to use social media  they hate that i can get the honest and unfiltered message out   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    folks  but if i would have relied on the fake news of cnn  nbc  abc  cbs  washpost or nytimes  i would have had zero chance winning wh  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    then bragged that he is going to end the threat of terrorism just because he visited saudi arabia and then he attacked one of our strategic allies in the middle east during my recent trip to the middle east i stated that there can no longer be funding of radical ideology  leaders pointed to qatar   look   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    should be noted that qatar has been our ally since   but trump wasn t done attacking them so good to see the saudi arabia visit with the king and  countries already paying off  they said they would take a hard line on funding  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    extremism  and all reference was pointing to qatar  perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     trump literally just accused one of our longtime allies of funding terrorism because saudi arabia told him to  qatar officials deny the allegations but trump s attack on qatar is also hypocritical considering saudi arabia has also been repeatedly accused of funding terrorism  the saudis are also significantly tied to the   attacks  but you don t see trump attacking them the tension between qatar and other middle eastern nations has been building for quite some time now  trump s pathetic speech during his embarrassing trip overseas had nothing to do with what s happening at the moment  but trump is trying to take credit anyway as trump continues to cause worldwide chaos and insults our european allies  the anniversary of d day should be even more important than ever before   americans lost their lives that day on the blood soaked sand and water  to put that figure in perspective  that s more killed in one day than the entire eight year war in iraq in which   american troops were killed and if we continue to let trump and his administration remain in power  we could end up fighting another world war that will be even costlier featured image  sean gallup getty images
