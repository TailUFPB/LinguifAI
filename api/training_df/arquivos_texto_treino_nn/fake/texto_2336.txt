there is something going on right now within our government that is very  very concerning  with evidence stacking up against donald trump and his administration regarding connections to russia  the republican party seems to be defending him  part of that defense seems to be a direct threat agains the press for having the audacity to use their first amendment right to hold the  president accountable and tell the whole story during a press conference with house intelligence chair devin nunes  r ca   instead of answering questions about russia  he turned the questions on their head and told the press that if they are found trying to seek answers from the russian embassy that they will be the ones investigated in an effort to deflect  nunes said  i m sure some of you are in contact with the russian embassy  so be careful what you ask for here  because if we start getting transcripts of any of you or other americans talking to the press   do you want us to conduct an investigation on you or other americans because you were talking to the russian embassy  i just think we need to be careful  what the hell is happening  the press will be investigated for trying to report the story  how about investigate donald trump and his administration  how about hold him accountable for his many actions  how about demanding to see his tax returns so we can see his financial ties for the safety and security of the nation  how about instead of threatening reporters  you put party politics aside and work for the american people as you were elected to do wow  just  wow this isn t okay at all watch here featured photo by win mcnamee getty images
