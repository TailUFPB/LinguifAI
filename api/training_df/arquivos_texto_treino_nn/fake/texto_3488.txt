trump cannot handle dissent  he cannot handle people who don t like him and won t kiss his rings and his boots  he cannot handle protests  as he proved during his campaign when he had protesters hauled out of his venues  sometimes forcibly  the women s march on washington had been organized for the lincoln memorial for the day after the inauguration   jan     and they ve been denied the permit to do it  the presidential inauguration committee filed what s being called a  massive omnibus blocking permit  for the area for many days before and after the event it s extremely unusual for the inauguration permit to block other events for several days after the inauguration  before and during  sure  after  though  mara veyrheyden lilliard has filed lawsuits to get protesters access to the lincoln memorial on inauguration day  since the women s march was scheduled for the day afterward  she doesn t understand what s going on  it hasn t come up in any way previously  where you ve had a groundswell of people trying to have access on the saturday  january   and thousands of people want to come  and the government is saying we won t give you a permit  it hasn t come up in any way previously  where you ve had a groundswell of people trying to have access on the saturday  january   and thousands of people want to come  and the government is saying we won t give you a permit  she went on to say  we ve issued the demand to the parks service because this is an illegal abridgment of first amendment rights   we expect they ll conform to the constitution and make permits available  it s true that the presidential inauguration committee filed for their permit ten months before the women s march on washington filed for theirs  and that there are a limited number of permits to go around so it s  first come  first serve   mike litterst  of the national park service  which is the agency that issues these permits  said that the lincoln memorial and the rest of the national mall will be available to the public during all these events   just not for organized events needing a permit  these sites are essentially construction sites  he says  and thus  not suitable for other organized events  the women s march is expected to have well over   attendees and so of course it requires a permit from the national park service come on  though  the inauguration is on the   the women s march is on the   they seriously can t get a permit for that day  now the options for public protests along the national mall are extremely limited  possibly until march   which is when deconstruction of the inauguration venue is supposed to be complete since the lincoln memorial is the site of many historic protests  including the  million man march  it makes sense that the women s march would want to gather there  too  they ve secured another site nearby  but it probably won t have quite the same symbolism as it would at the lincoln memorial featured image by steve pope via getty images
