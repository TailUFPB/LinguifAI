donald trump s visit to a historically black church in detroit  michigan on saturday is being met with fierce condemnation from black leaders  reverend wendell anthony is one of those leaders who is calling out trump  on saturday  anthony  who is the head of the detroit naacp chapter  appeared on cnn where he derided the entire visit as a  scam  this is nothing more than a ruse  this is a scam   anthony said during the segment   mr  trump is seventy years old  i believe  that election now is less than seventy days from now  it s gonna take a whole lot of conjecture and whole lot of programming to undo what has been done  anthony is correct  trump has polling numbers so low with voters of color that it seems almost absurd at this point to try and win them over so close to the election  considering trump s support from white supremacist groups  and his recently solidified multi media brand promotion deal relationship with the reactionary media site breitbart  which has historically upheld white supremacist positions  there isn t a snowball s chance in hell those numbers will go up  in fact  since trump began his new strategy of begging voters of color to take a chance on him  his polling numbers with the voting bloc have plummeted even further then there s also this long list of reasons that anthony lists off  before you talk about the can do  let s talk about the undo   he continued   let s undo what mr  trump has done  part of what he said is that we need to unite the country  well his policies  or lack thereof  his commentary  his rhetoric  is doing no more than dividing this nation  when you talk about  i don t want black people counting my money   or rather have  short folk with yarmulkes counting my money    that s divisive  it s rather amusing to see someone whose entire political career thus far has been made possible by the far right s racism and xenophobia try and pander to voters of color  there s also something sad about it  very sad you can watch the video below featured image from video screenshot
