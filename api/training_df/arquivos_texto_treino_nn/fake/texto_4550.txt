donald trump has a reputation in the media for being open and accessible to interview requests  he is known for a willingness to spout off to whoever sticks a microphone in front of his face  and it has helped him get this far as a political candidate but lately  as trump has hired new handlers and other assorted campaign personnel  he has also been in something of a retreat  that is  trump is only talking to fox news right now trump is saying  yes  to fox news almost every day but saying  no  to most other major networks and news organizations   a highly unusual strategy for a presidential nominee he called into  fox   friends  on monday morning  he is booked on  the o reilly factor  monday night  and he has another town hall with sean hannity coming up on wednesday rousing the base instead of reaching out to undecided voters may ultimately pay off for trump  if nothing else  it limits the candidate s exposure to hard hitting questions   while fueling frustration among journalists at fox news  trump can avoid pesky follow up questions about his support for the racist birther conspiracy  long after he claims to have dropped it  fox news hosts won t ask him why he reacts to possible terrorism by screaming about how he was right  rather than express condolences for the victims and support for law enforcement  at fox news  trump isn t challenged   and that s the way he wants it the problem is  wrapping up in the fox news cocoon may feel good for the time being  but the way to win an election is to appeal to audiences outside of your base of comfort  trump isn t reaching out it is a strategy that shows up elsewhere in his campaign  where instead of following the model of successful politicians like george w  bush and president obama by holding campaign rallies in  swing  districts hoping to persuade voters  trump has rallies with the converted on election day in   fox news viewers were shocked to find the romney  landslide  the network had kept promoting was a harsh reality  they may be setting themselves up for a major failure featured image via flickr
