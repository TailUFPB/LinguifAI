six million poles lost their lives during world war ii  but to donald trump  that s just  tough  perhaps no nation suffered as much devastation as poland did during the war  the nation was invaded and terrorized by the nazis and then invaded and terrorized by the soviet union  poland was caught in the middle as two brutal military powers clashed poland experienced war first hand  as well as poverty  homelessness  starvation  disease  and the holocaust  in fact  poland lost the highest percentage of citizens during the war and its population did not recover until the  on top of that  poland went from suffering under nazi rule to suffering under soviet rule  the soviets sent poles to gulags throughout the soviet union  communism would dominate poland until the free elections of   and after that  communism in eastern europe and the soviet union itself collapsed the utter devastation suffered by poland demands proper recognition  and trump proved that he is incapable of expressing true sadness about such a human tragedy during his speech to the people of poland  trump spoke of poland s tragic history as if it was simply an everyday hardship like having one s car stolen or breaking a leg and having no health insurance  in  you were invaded yet again  by nazi germany from the west  and the soviet union from the east  that s trouble  that s tough  here s the video via vidme  tough  is not the appropriate word to describe what the polish people went through during world war ii hitler literally planned to wipe out the entire polish people from existence and tried to do exactly that  the soviets took away their nationality and treated them like non citizens as well as taking away their lands and killing those who protested  and all trump can say about it is that it was  tough  so trump waltzed into warsaw  a city that was nearly bombed out of existence  and insulted the polish people to their faces  once again embarrassing our country  and the polish crowds were forced to cheer for him  seriously trump gets more pathetic every day featured image via screenshot
