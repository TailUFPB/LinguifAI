democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine spent his thursday evening with late show host stephen colbert  and of course eventually the conversation turned to the absolutely destructive force that is the republican presidential nominee donald trump  the first element of trump s many outrageous statements to be discussed was his absurd description of trump calling kaine s running mate hillary clinton a bigot  kaine reminded the audience the difference between the two candidates  records regarding america s race troubles  when hillary clinton got out of law school  she was working to help advance racial justice in the juvenile justice system in south carolina and fight school segregation in alabama  and i about that time got out of law school and was battling housing discrimination in the south and in virginia  at his early career  donald trump was a real estate guy who got sued by the justice department for discriminating against people in housing  by  writing the letter c on applications if they were minority   kaine continued   hillary clinton has got a track record all the way back to being a middle schooler in a methodist youth group of trying to advance priorities for others   and donald trump s for himself  kaine is right  of course  the contrast couldn t be more stark  and history speaks for itself  if anyone is the bigot in this scenario  it s donald trump  not hillary clinton briefly  stephen colbert turned to his and kaine s shared faith  and asked kaine to recite a new testament verse he is fond of  kaine responded with philippians    do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit  but with humility of mind consider one another as more important than yourself  colbert then cited  his own favorite verse in latin  a backstage interview yielded more criticism of trump from kaine  when he said  this is fundamentally about the nation s promise of equality  if we are supposed to do a u turn or not  so you got to take that seriously  and i m really glad she just reminded everybody that is what is at stake in november  kaine says that if he ever gets to confront trump  he d ask one simple question  how can you say the things you re saying  kaine then continued  his final blistering blow  he is going around saying that the american military is a disaster  ridicules a gold star family  makes fun of john mccain because he was a pow   that kind of personality shouldn t be within  time zones of being commander in chief  so right  senator kaine  so right  hopefully  people listen to you watch a clip below  via raw story featured image via video screen capture
