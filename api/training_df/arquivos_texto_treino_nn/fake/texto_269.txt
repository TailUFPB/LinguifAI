like increasing numbers of heartless people on the right  bill o reilly has weighed in on the las vegas massacre with one of the worst things you can say about any mass shooting  the former fox news host is an avid  amendment  fan   meaning he believes that guns are more important than people s lives  and he reminded us that he feels that way in an absolutely disgusting blog post today  the nra and its supporters want easy access to weapons  while the left wants them banned   he says  sorry  but  easy access to weapons  is a big part of the problem  stephen paddock had multiple firearms and clips  and over  rounds of ammunition  in videos of the shooting you can hear the rapid fire of assault weapons  guns are already too easy to get the fact that paddock managed to kill over  people and wound more than  more from the  floor of mandalay bay  which has no balconies or patios  is proof positive that more guns is not the answer  all the  good guys with guns  in the world would not have stopped that  but the above isn t what makes billo the clown so repugnant right now  it s what he said afterward  about the price of freedom  that s so vile  this is the price of freedom  violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage  no matter how threatening they are the second amendment is clear that americans have a right to arm themselves for protection  even the loons  three words come to mind  fuck  off  asshole  the  amendment makes clear no such thing  all we can conclude from this is that nra types like him no longer value american lives  if they did  they d be calling up all their congresspeople  like we all should be doing right now  and demanding a thorough review of current federal laws regarding gun ownership to determine how best to prevent things like this in the future  they d be calling their state lawmakers  again  like we all should be doing  and demanding their states do the same thing the house is supposed to vote on a law that loosens regulations on silencers today  how bad would it have been if paddock had managed to silence his weapon  it would have taken longer for people to figure out what was happening and even more would have died  but conservatives  both republican and democrat  are saying   oh  we have to protect the hearing of hunters and sport shooters   really  this target shooter knows there are squillions of other ways to do that   protecting people s hearing   is a ridiculous and tone deaf rationalization for what they re about to do  lives lost in senseless massacres like this should never be the price of freedom  any freedom the time to debate gun laws is after gun violence the time to debate climate change is after hurricanes the time is now  resist  alt sarah h  sanders   altuspresssec  october    bill o reilly can go rot featured image via ilya s  savenok getty images
