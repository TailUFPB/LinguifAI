donald trump has repeatedly accused democrats of rigging the election against him  but it turns out his own supporters are doing everything they can to rig it in his favor and that includes voting twice  something republicans continually claim that democratic voters always get away with doing the des moines register reports terri lynn rote    was booked into the polk county jail about   p m  thursday on a first degree election misconduct charge  which is a class d felony rote  a registered republican  reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the polk county election office   second ave   and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in des moines  according to a des moines police report so just to recap  rote literally committed voter fraud in a desperate attempt to get trump and the republican party an extra vote in this election that s the precise definition of election rigging  but you won t hear trump say anything about this because he thinks that democrats are the ones committing voter fraud  which is why he has called for his supporters to intimidate minority voters at polling places but this incident is far from the only time during this election that a republican has been caught trying to rig the election a wisconsin city clerk was recently busted for trying to deny an extra polling place near the university of wisconsin green bay because she argued in an email that students lean democratic  i was reading the statutes and read  no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party   kris teske wrote  uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole  i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat  i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen  i would like to know your thoughts on this  do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats  imagine if a democratic clerk denied letting a church be a polling place on the premise that most religious people are republicans  the outrage and whining would last for days and a right wing group is literally creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on election day  keep in mind that republicans often accuse democratic voters of using fake ids to vote multiple times  but here s a right wing group making fake ids so they can use voter suppression tactics to swing the vote in favor of trump thus far  it appears that only donald trump s supporters are trying to rig the election  not democrats as he so often claims  and just think  there are still ten days left until election day  still plenty of time for even more hypocritical trump supporters to be caught trying to rig the election for the small handed man who whines about how unfair our democratic system is featured image  joe raedle getty images
