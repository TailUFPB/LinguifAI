it s no secret that donald trump s second in command  mike pence  is a bigot  he first rose to national prominence amid a sea of scandal over a sweeping law that he signed as governor of indiana that was clearly designed to discriminate against lgbtq people  in fact  the law was so terrible that the state s largest newspaper  the indianapolis star  devoted an entire front page to a message to pence   fix this now  after that  pence s approval ratings plummeted  and it became clear that there was no way he could get re elected  even after soliciting the help of the koch brothers  and therefore became trump s running mate instead now  since pence s bigotry is so well known  he is generally not well received at events where people have objections to overt discrimination against marginalized groups of people  to that end  it should come as no surprise that the graduates at notre dame walked out when pence spoke at their commencement  of course  pence s fellow bigoted republican senator  tom cotton  is fuming that the students had the gall to stand up for what they believe in  cotton told nbc news via a statement  it is especially unfortunate that students walked out of the vice president s speech on sunday   because if any young people needed to hear how important freedom of speech is to our country  it would be them  i think the vice president deserves credit for speaking out on the spread of intolerance at college campuses   and i know he deserved better treatment than what he received this weekend  no  senator cotton  pence deserved exactly what he got  and then some  it s really pretty simple  if pence wants people to stop treating him like a bigot  he needs to stop acting like one  this is a man who regularly and openly expresses hatred against any group of americans who aren t just like him   and makes the laws to match  tell me  sir  if this were an overt racist or anti semite speaking at commencement  would you be defending that person as well didn t think so  bigotry is bigotry  and mike pence exudes it in spades  hopefully  he is humiliated like this everywhere he goes until he simply refuses to appear in public again featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
