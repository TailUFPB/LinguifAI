the donald trump administration is desperate and like a cornered wild animal  trump is lashing out at everyone  hoping he ll land a bite that will stick  over the weekend  the target of trump s delusional twitter rant was president obama  who trump accused of wiretapping him  there s zero evidence and even conservatives are beginning to question trump s sanity now  i won t go so far as to say trump is crazy like a fox   no  he s just plain crazy   but he also uses his twitter account in an almost clever way  he uses it to distract from the real damage and flat out destruction he and his republican cohorts are doing to this country will bunch of the philadelphia inquirer outlined three ways in which trump is giving the country a legislative middle finger and because of trump s ridiculous tweets  the media is ignoring almost all of them donald trump put as the head of the environmental protection agency  a man who has sued the agency a total of  times  trump wants to all but gut the agency  leaving us with filthy air  water and ultimately  food  but hey  those polluting industries will see hefty profits no  the administration doesn t want to stop global warming  they just don t want us to study it or hear about it  in fact  they don t even want us to know about the weather  the administration wants to cut the funding of the national oceanic and atmospheric agency by more than half a billion dollars in some ways  the second ban is worse than its predecessor  it signals that the trump administration is determined to pursue its anti muslim  extremist agenda and will not be hindered by courts   nor by the showing of public concern which followed the first ban  that remarkable cultural moment   symbolized by the immediate airport protests and sustained by the solidarity of faith groups  civil rights figures and celebrities who ve spoken out repeatedly over the last month   seems to have gone unheeded by the trump administration source  time comwe have a couple to add this is true of trump s tax proposals  which redirect wealth from the poor to the ultrarich  no one who supports repealing the estate tax can credibly be called a  populist   it s also true about his health care proposals  which slash benefits for low income people while cutting taxes on the well to do  and it looks like this pattern will hold with respect to trump s forthcoming budget proposal  in which the  populist  president will ask for a big hike in defense spending while inflicting painful cuts on social programs source  salondonald trump  jr  told the washington post that he and his brother eric were inspired by many places they visited while with their father on the campaign trail  while trump has not divested from his company  he s turned over management of the trump brand to his sons  the plan now is to build new properties  starting with a more affordable chain of hotels  scion  in a number of cities across the nation  many of which the brothers became acquainted with while on the long road to the white house source  vanity fairtrump hasn t divested himself from his businesses  so if his sons are profiting  so is he the point of this is to not let ourselves become distracted by the latest shiny object  even if it is an absurd series of tweets  donald trump might not last a full term  but he can do a lot of damage before he leaves  he s already started  let s focus on that as well featured image via pool getty images
