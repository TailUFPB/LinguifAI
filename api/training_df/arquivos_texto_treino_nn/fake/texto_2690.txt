one of donald trump s most controversial campaign promises was his  total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states   now that the power of the presidency is his  trump tried to do just that last weekend  however  the executive order that enacted the muslim ban was poorly rolled out  bypassed scrutiny by the agencies charged with enforcing it  and caused protests to erupt nationally and internationally  further  everyone saw it for what it was  the unconstitutional religious test for entering the united states that trump had promised on the campaign trail after a slew of judges struck down parts of the ban  one federal judge  appointed by president george w  bush  james robart of seattle  struck the whole discriminatory policy down  of course  this didn t sit well with trump  and he did as he always done with confronted with any sort of criticism or challenge whatsoever  and went on an absolutely crazy twitter tirade against judge robart early saturday morning  here are trump s latest nutty tweets when a country is no longer able to say who can  and who cannot   come in   out  especially for reasons of safety   security   big trouble   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    that certain middle eastern countries agree with the ban  they know if certain people are allowed in it s death   destruction   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    opinion of this so called judge  which essentially takes law enforcement away from our country  is ridiculous and will be overturned   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    course  trump s claims that other countries agree with his ban are patently false  there are protests around the world regarding his bigoted and un american policies and rhetoric  he has only been in office for two weeks  and has already diminished america s standing in the world greatly by trying to whitewash america and shut out immigrants though entirely predictable  trump s reaction here is highly problematic  he is clearly unraveling at the protests and criticisms against him  and having actual judges rule against him is just too much  what will be really interesting to see is whether or not trump tries to see how he can remove this judge  just as he did with the acting attorney general who said that his muslim ban was indefensible in court this man is a literal fascist  america  and we are witnessing his slow destruction of our democracy as we speak   resist featured image via drew angerer getty images
