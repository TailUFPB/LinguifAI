donald trump wanted the press to tour his brand new hotel in washington d c   so they did and discovered that he is truly a giant hypocrite the republican nominee was hoping to use the press corps as his own personal team of promoters but photographers were the only ones allowed to follow trump inside the building  and that many cameras came in mighty handy as they captured how big of a liar trump is when he claims he will  make america great again  american bridge used their exploration time to find out how trump furnishes the rooms in his hotel and the answer is definitely not with the help of workers in the united states as it turns out  the hotel that is supposed to represent the united states capitol around the world is filled with products made in china and the philippines among multiple other countries here s a bunch of photos via twitter showing how trump relies heavily on cheap foreign labor a very classy gold lamp in the new dc trump hotel  which just happens to have been made in china  not in the usa  pic twitter com wzaloiuneu  american bridge   americanbridge  september    this dresser was made in the philippines  far and away from the usa  pic twitter com   american bridge   americanbridge  september    king sized beds inside the suites at the new dc trump hotel were   you guessed it   not made in the usa  pic twitter com   american bridge   americanbridge  september    even these trump hotel branded umbrellas are made in china  not here in the u s   pic twitter com   american bridge   americanbridge  september    the trump hotel in washington  dc  bedding made in china  not the usa  pic twitter com   american bridge   americanbridge  september    you catch all of that  trump supporters  your hero claims that he is going to  make america great  but he can t even be bothered to support american workers by furnishing his hotels with american made products and if your blood is not boiling from that revelation  just wait until you read about what washington post reporter david fahrenthold discovered while experiencing what it is like to be a guest in trump s hotel even as donald trump vilifies muslims all over the world and describes islam as a violent threat to the united states  he actually offers guests a quran if they want one complete with a prayer rug and a compass directing them towards mecca  according to fahrenthold  it was incredibly easy   minutes after my call to housekeeping  a pleasant woman arrived with a copy of  the glorious qur an  in arabic and english  along with a brown prayer rug and a compass pointing in the  direction of al kabaa  in mecca   he wrote when a presidential candidate is using foreign labor to make his products at will while claiming that he will  make america great  that a problem because it means trump is part of the problem that many of his own supporters are complaining about  the fact that american companies are moving jobs overseas and giving them to foreigners  if trump really cared about american workers  he would employ them to make his products  not the chinese and while americans have freedom of religion in this country and can practice whatever religion they want  trump s hotel offering the quran is also damaging to his own image because he has worked hard to convince his supporters that islam is an evil religion  if islam is so evil  why offer the quran to any hotel guest who requests one clearly  trump s supporters are too blind to see that their candidate is a con artist who is duping them featured image  getty images
