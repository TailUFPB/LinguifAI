by now most of us know that anytime a member of the trump campaign gets confronted about one of their leader s disgusting policies  it does not go well for them  wednesday night s segment of the rachel maddow show was no different   host rachel maddow grilled trump s new campaign manager kellyanne conway for a solid  minutes maddow made sure to take full advantage of the fact that she had a trump operative right in front of her  and she didn t waste a second  for six intense minutes of the interview  maddow confronted conway about the republican nominee s  total and complete  muslim ban  which he d suggested in december  bringing up the fact that trump had partially backtracked and flip flopped on the idea  maddow asked conway if trump still intends to enforce that policy  conway s response was just like all of trump s   indirect and avoidant conway said that trump had  clarified  his proposal recently  but that it had also stayed the same  while many interviewers might have accepted that answer and moved on  maddow let conway know that this wasn t going to be that kind of interview  maddow wouldn t let it go  and pressed her  there s a reason why we keep not moving on from this stuff  december   when he made this statement  it was like every political firework went off at once  because nobody could believe he was saying  if you are from a specific religion  you re not allowed to come here  if that s no longer the case  that s a big deal  maddow also fired off several of trump s previous offenses such as his racist  inappropriate attacks on the khan family and the curiel family  stating that out of both of the responses conway was trying to give her   only one of them can be true   in the same way that his statement of regret  if it s meant to apply to the khan family  the curiel family  we can t give him credit to that  unless he tells us that he s communicated that to them  this is stuff of his own making  if you want the campaign to not be about this stuff anymore  he s the one who has to end those controversies  you re in a position of trying to defend what he said last week  and not refer to what he said in december  but only one of them can be true  conway responded by not answering the question and accusing democratic nominee hillary clinton of flip flopping over  times  conway also threw in an attack about the clinton foundation  accusing the former secretary of state of corruption  maddow once again put conway back on task   but your own campaign is about your own candidate  right conway said  no  there s a choice    yes  this campaign is about two candidates  if i can say one thing about the coverage  it s not that it s biased or slanted  it s incomplete  it s a referendum of donald trump  like you re going to the ballot box and it s going to be a big picture of donald trump with a light  you either put a black x over him  or you say yay  maddow reminded conway that  one candidate is planning on banning people from the united states   when conway accused clinton of  hiding    maddow dropped this truth bomb  not doing press conferences is one thing  but proposing a ban on people coming to the united states over a specific religion conway said that maddow could bring her cameras to interview the donald himself  but it s doubtful that trump would rise to the challenge   especially after watching maddow destroy conway in this interview you can watch this segment below featured image is a screenshot
