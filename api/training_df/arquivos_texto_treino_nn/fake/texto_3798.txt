after last week s election  hillary supporters found a modicum of comfort in a photo  which quickly went viral  the photo was taken the day after the election  a woman named margot gerster  who was hiking through the woods in upstate new york  ran into hillary and bill clinton  gerster snapped a photo of her and the democratic nominee and innocently uploaded it to social media  that s when the sh t hit the fan and she began receiving death threats the photo was simply of the two women and gerster s baby  it in no way questioned or even referenced donald trump s election  instead  it was a reassurance that life goes on  even after a crushing defeat within what seemed like hours  the conservative media attacks began  the chance encounter had to be fake  the argument went  because gerster had met hillary clinton once before  many years ago  as if people don t have chance encounters with people they have previously met gerster admits she met clinton when she was a teenager  but that had nothing to do with last wednesday s chance encounter  it was so long ago i do not remember  all i knew was that i was going to a nice dinner and hillary clinton was there   she said the mom dismissed accusations she s a long time ally of the clintons who secretly planned and engineered the heart warming  post election snap  if i were long time friends of the clintons  i wouldn t be keeping that a secret  i d be bragging about it to everyone i know   gerster said source  new york postgerster insists  and federal election commission records confirm  that she didn t even donate to clinton but  conservatives never let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory and gerster says she s been getting death threats  although there s no record she s reported them to the cops  i don t want to discuss this anymore   said gerster     this story needs to go away  it got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of people  but i don t want this to add on to this  blowback   i don t want to fuel the fire  who can blame her  trump has clearly unleashed an ugly and violent underbelly in america  no one is safe featured image via margot gerster screen capture
