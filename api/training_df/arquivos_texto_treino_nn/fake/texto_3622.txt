trump has a serious lack of impulse control  particularly on social media  we ve known this forever  and it s to the point where some have begun calling for the media to return to real journalism and stop focusing on his damn tweets  part of the reason so many feel we can t ignore them is because they represent a lack of control  and because they re the inner thoughts of a madman who thinks he s still a private citizen and can say what he wants newt gingrich  one of trump s biggest and most shameless fanboys  has a different idea and it s pretty wild  to gingrich  trump is intentionally using social media to manipulate what information gets out  he believes this is trump s amazing creative skill at work   was a remarkably popular show  understands the value of tension  he understands the value of showmanship  and candidly  the news media is going to chase the rabbit  so it s better off for him to give them a rabbit than for them to go find their own rabbit  he s had them fixated on mitt romney now for five or six days  i think from his perspective  that s terrific  it gives everyone something to talk about he does not think of this as chaos  he thinks of this as creativity  gingrich went on to say how trump has used social media to get regular americans to attack the media for going after real issues  in other words  he believes trump has come up with this amazing solution to the media exposing truths he doesn t want exposed  president elect trump s ability to communicate directly to the american people when he wants to through facebook  through twitter  through a variety of mechanisms that aren t traditional gives him an ability to communicate and build on majority unlike any president we have seen up until now and i suspect he will continue to use it he is not going to fall into allowing the elite media to define who he is and allowing them to censor what the american people learned  some think trump is an egotistical nincompoop with onion paper thin skin and no impulse control at all  and they re probably not wrong  entire columns  like this one  have been devoted to his numerous  bizarre and vague statements on foreign policy  on climate change  on pretty much everything  they make trump into a joke gingrich doesn t want people making trump into a joke  so of course he s going to say that his crazy twitter tirades are carefully calculated distractions that he crafted using his reality show expertise  there s probably no way to know for sure what trump is up to  but we can say this  some of his surrogates will spin any wild yarn at all to make him look like the smartest president we ve never had and  largest majority   i do not think that means what you think it means featured image by john sommers ii via getty images
