republicans are spineless cowards if you want to know why many republicans have been avoiding saying anything critical about donald trump  we now have an answer apparently  republicans are scared to say anything because they fear that breitbart and sean hannity will say mean things about them and cause right wing internet trolls to lash out seriously  nobody wants to go first   rep  mark sanford told politico   people are naturally reticent to be the first out of the block for fear of sean hannity  for fear of breitbart  for fear of local folks  indeed  sanford received hate mail  threats  and online harassment from trump supporters because he called out trump for not releasing his tax returns earlier this month  rep  bill flores was treated the same way for simply disagreeing with trump on certain issues  breitbart printed a sensational headline declaring   breaking  rep  bill flores has crafted a plan to block trump s immigration reform  then sean hannity promoted breitbart s fake news on his radio show  which caused right wingers to viciously attack flores in any way they could find they threatened to  burn  his career down and told him to go  hang  himself now republicans are holding back from speaking up because they are too scared of the backlash from right wing media republican hill staffers have wrestled in recent months with how to respond to inquiries from breitbart or other pro trump bloggers  engage them or ignore them  one gop aide told politico members are  damned if you do  damned if you don t   another said it s having a  chilling effect  on gop lawmakers and it will be easy for trump to launch attacks against republican lawmakers because his chief strategist steve bannon has a direct line to breitbart eve breitbart admitted that they intend to viciously attack any republican who doesn t kiss trump s ass  if any politician in either party veers from what the voters clearly voted for in a landslide election   we stand at the ready to call them out on it and hold them accountable   a breitbart editor said but trump did not win in a  landslide   he lost the popular vote by nearly  million votes and his electoral vote win is one of the smallest in the last  years  president obama s victories in  and  were far larger and breitbart didn t care about  what the voters clearly voted for  then breitbart and hannity intend to bully anyone who criticizes trump  even if that criticism is fair and that will make republicans incapable of standing up to trump in the years ahead  they are nothing more than  century brownshirts  which is an appropriate comparison considering bannon s ties to white nationalists featured image  alex wong getty images
