is there some reason that the media feels the need to keep talking to kellyanne conway  one would think her time on the news shows was over when she called lies  alternative facts   but no  it s not  so she s still out there making outrageous claims and talking about things she knows nothing about thursday night  she appeared on msnbc s  hardball with chris matthews   and  in trying to demonize both the press and muslim refugees as strongly as possible  she said that two iraqi refugees were responsible for a massacre here in the u s wait  which massacre did these two iraqi refugees carry out why  the one at bowling green  of course are you still wondering what massacre she s talking about  you re not alone  the reason the press never covered the bowling green massacre is because it never happened  ever  at the hands of muslims or other terrorists or anyone and yet  she said it on national television  while she was talking about president obama s non ban on iraqi refugees coming to the u s   she literally said  president obama had a six month ban on the iraqi refugee program after two iraqis came here to this country  were radicalized  and were the masterminds behind the bowling green massacre  her assertion is that most people don t know about it because the press didn t cover it  seriously  you can t make this up  watch below kellyanne conway lambastes the media for ignoring the  bowling green massacre   which doesn t exist  via  joesonka  pic twitter com   judd legum   juddlegum  february     so  that s a short clip  and it could easily have been taken out of context so  for context  here s what happened  matthews grilled her about executive orders in general  and whether or not it s kosher to be firing government employees who object  he also asked her about federal employees  who swore to uphold and defend the constitution  and whether they signed a petition  conway seems to believe that employees ought to put up and shut up  or walk she said that everyone knew what they were getting with this new administration  but when matthews brought up whether the president has a right to insist that his employees agree with him  she went into extreme vetting  countries that harbor  train and export terrorism at that point  she brought up the non existent bowling green massacre  and then spoke about the attacks in brussels  paris  and elsewhere in europe  then she talks about  looking the other way  with radical islamic terrorism in other words  the context doesn t change the fact that she completely fabricated a massacre to justify trump s muslim ban  you can watch the full video here did she flat out lie about this  or is she really just that stupid  vox might have an answer  in   two iraqi refugees  waad ramadan alwan and mohanad shareef hammadi  were arrested in bowling green  ky  on federal terrorism charges  allegedly  they had been plotting to send money and weapons back home to iraqi insurgents  someone needs to publicly shame her on the air for bullshit like this  there was no massacre at bowling green  there were never any plans for a massacre at bowling green or anywhere else courtesy of these two  and there was never a ban on iraqi refugees because of these two vox s zach beauchamp says it s possible she was referencing a haunted house called bowling green massacre regardless  she made a massive fool of herself last night  along with the administration she works for  we always knew she was ridiculous  but this is just beyond the pale featured image via screen capture from embedded video
