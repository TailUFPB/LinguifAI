billionaire mark cuban had previously been rooting for donald trump  but made the switch over to democratic nominee hillary clinton with a powerful public endorsement several weeks ago after wisely deciding that trump was batsh t crazy  since then  he has fiercely defended the clintons and he continued to do so on monday  when fox news  neil cavuto complained about hillary s email  scandal  and the fees former president bill clinton charges for speaking events cavuto brought up the fact that bill clinton had gotten    for a speech and cuban wasted no time in dismantling his criticism  cuban completely ripped cavuto apart as he educated the fox business news host about what ex presidents actually make for speaking  and threw in some conservative shame when he mentioned reagan  look  you have to ask yourself what s the market for a former president giving a speech  right  so first of all  ronald reagan was paid more than a million dollars for speeches in   he went to japan and gave two speeches  second of all  bill clinton made  i think it was   give or take  for a lot of speeches  i ve made   for a bunch of speeches  for the most part  he gets paid a little more than i do  but the point is he was right inside the market  he wasn t getting paid more or less than the market  but cavuto wasn t ready to give up slamming the clintons that quickly  he made the foolish decision to continue bashing clinton  whining that the money had gone to the clinton foundation in a  pay for play  scheme  cuban was ready to handle those accusations as well  he shut it down  in order to determine if there is any quid pro quo  there s got to be some money destined for the trade off  cavuto tried to say it looked suspicious  but cuban countered   they ve been investigated more than anybody  you can watch cuban viciously defend the clintons below  with the bit about bill clinton starting at   featured image via paul zimmerman   getty images
