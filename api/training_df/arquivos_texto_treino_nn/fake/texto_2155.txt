at a town hall in frost  texas last week a voter expressed concerns about violence against women   but rep  joe barton was not interested in hearing them the constituent asked barton to work with rep  jackie speier  a democrat  to sponsor legislation that could combat violence against women   a topic that has not much interested the congressman in the past  given your voting record opposing legislation protecting women from violence  will you make a commitment to us today  make a promise that you will reach out to congresswoman jackie speier and work with her to see this bill successfully through congress  barton says he voted against the bill because he believes violence targeting women   which happens literally everywhere   is a  state issue  not a federal issue  his audience was not pleased  the crowd responded with a chrous of boos  violence against women  that s a national issue   one person yelled in response   that s an issue that impacts everyone everywhere  not only in this country  but everywhere  but barton wasn t done  pointing his finger at the man who had the audacity to suggest that he take a moment to care about women  he demanded  you  sir  shut up  you don t tell anybody to shut up   the man shouted back   you work for us  close to   people attended the town hall  it s safe to say that most of them left knowing for whom they are not voting in the next election  watch it below featured image via screengrab
