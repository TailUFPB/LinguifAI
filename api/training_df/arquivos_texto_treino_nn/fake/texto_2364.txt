people have figured out a way to troll a right wing pastor who incessantly rails against transgender americans  planned parenthood  and pretty much anything else that doesn t fit into his pathetic  bigoted world view and help the women s health organization at the same time and it s driving him bananas  recently  far right hate pastor greg locke posted an allcaps message on his facebook timeline planned parenthood sent me a personal  thank you  and it has me lit and boy is he  lit   locke explains that he received the  thank you  letter from his favorite  baby parts  boogeyman after an an undisclosed amount was donated in his honor by a woman named krista ginsberg in houston  texas  at the end of the day  it doesn t matter how big or how small it was  it was a waste of your money and the stamp was a waste of your money   locke raves in the video   don t ever send me anymore nonsense from planned parenthood  there has never been an organization in the world that has killed more innocent people other than radical islam than that of planned parenthood   locke lied  naturally  he did not cite a source for the claim   look  i m just gonna say it whether you like it or not   planned parenthood does not give one flip of a wooden nickel about women s healthcare  it s a bunch of deceptive individuals that are in it for the money that have been known to sell baby parts on the black market and they have done nothing but butcher innocent lives for years  it s safe to assume that locke was referencing abortion there  which is only three percent of the total services planned parenthood provides women  the organization absolutely has not  been known  outside of certain circles of people who can barely operate a fork without adult supervision to sell  baby parts on the black market   previously  the organization accepted reimbursements to cover the costs of preparing and shipping donated fetal tissue  but it has since stopped accepting the reimbursements because of liars and zealots like locke  as far as i m concerned  i don t care if i ever get another piece of literature from you guys again because you re just wasting your money to send me this nonsense   locke says  adding that  pastor greg locke has absolutely positively tee totally nothing to  do with planned parenthood  y all can keep butchering babies  i m gonna keep speaking the truth   he concludes after throwing the nice thank you letter in the garbage apparently  some awesome people decided to get together and go to planned parenthood s donation page  where they filled out the form and made a donation   of course carefully checking the  yes  my gift is in honor or in memory of someone special  box where they entered locke s information and the address of his church   old lebanon dirt rd in mt  juliet  tn zip code   so planned parenthood knew where to send their thanks  not that we re encouraging you to do it or anything  you should totally do it within a week of his initial posting  locke complained about all the love he is getting from enthusiastic supporters of women s healthcare  apparently  there have been  hundreds of donations  in his name not only is this a win for planned parenthood  but the look on locke s face in the video is worth every cent that is donated watch locke s unhinged ravings below featured image via screengrab
