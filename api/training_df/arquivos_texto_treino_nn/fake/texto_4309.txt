after a tape was released in which donald trump was heard talking about how he loves to grope women  even married women  you can expect a rash of his victims to come forward  the first one  it appears  was with his one time business partner  jill harth the new york times wrote about harth s experiences on friday  in it  she called trump  relentless   the man she described in the interview was a predator   a would be rapist she and her longtime boyfriend  george houraney attended meetings with trump in the early   even when sitting at a table with her boyfriend  harth recalled trump putting his hand up her skirt  all the way up to her crotch  i didn t know how to handle it  i would go away from him and say i have to go to the restroom  it was the escape route  darth and houraney had approached trump with a business proposal that was right up his alley  they wanted to hold  calendar girl  beauty contests  an automobile show  a music competition and other events at his atlantic city casino  they wanted trump to do business with them  but as the evening wore on  harth was getting more and more uncomfortable the first sign of trouble came the day before the evening groping  in an initial business meeting in which  harth and houraney say  trump spent the time asking about the breasts of the beauty contestants   real or enhanced    and staring at harth  then   at one point he asked houraney   are you sleeping with her   houraney explained awkwardly that they were a couple  but trump was unfazed  you know  there s going to be a problem   trump told houraney  according to a  sexual harassment lawsuit harth filed against him   i m very attracted to your girlfriend  about six weeks later  trump gave harth and houraney a tour of mar a lago  they brought some of the calendar girls  but trump wanted harth  he pulled her into ivanka s room  that s right  he tried to have sex in his daughter s bedroom   i was admiring the decoration  and next thing i know he s pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me   harth told me   he was trying to kiss me  i was freaking out  harth says she was desperately protesting  and finally managed to run out of the room and find the group again  she and houraney left rather than stay the night  as they had intended harth and houraney tried to continue the business relationship  trump kept persisting and harth was afraid he was going to rape her  his mind was in a totally different place than mine   harth recalls   he thinks he s god s gift to women  they did end up doing business with trump  she didn t report it to the police  trump  not surprisingly  tried not to pay the couple  but he eventually settled out of court  but only after she agreed to withdraw a sexual harassment suit  which detailed all the allegations the couple eventually married and then divorced  they do not speak  but their stories  according to the times  did match  eventually  harth ended up dating trump  when asked why  harth responded  i was scared  thinking   what am i going to do now   she says   when he called me and tried to work on me again  i was thinking maybe i should give this a try  maybe if he s still working on me  i should give this rich guy a chance  here she is talking about it with the guardian trump didn t respond to the new york times  but he has publicly trashed harth in the past  saying she was the one who was obsessed  she  surprisingly  wanted to work on his campaign  doing his hair and makeup  still  the times is convinced her story is true and after friday s revelations  it wouldn t be surprising  we know trump has zero respect for women  we know he sees them as a collection of body parts and that s it  we also know that he feels entitled to take whatever the hell he wants  even if what he wants is a human being  trump is even accused of raping a  year old  would attempting to rape an adult be so inconceivable  it is going to be tough for trump to spin his way out of this featured image jill harth via video screen capture   featured image of donald trump via diane freed getty images
