rather than do the damn job he swore to do  donald trump is now obsessed with complaining about media estimates of his inauguration crowd size trump had predicted that his inauguration would draw a record breaking crowd  to break the record  which is held by president obama in   trump would have had to get over   million people to show up but he didn t even get half a million as aerial photographs and reports from the dc metro show that trump s audience left a hell of a lot of empty space in the national mall during a visit to the cia  trump complained about the media reports and claimed that his crowd numbered at least   million  we had a massive field of people  you saw that  packed   trump claimed   i get up this morning and i turn on one of the networks and they show an empty field  i said   wait a minute  i made a speech   i looked out  the field was it looked like a million  a million and a half people   trump said   they showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there  they said   donald trump did not draw well   it looked honestly like a million and a half people  whatever it was  it was  but it went all the way back to the washington monument and i turn on  by mistake  i get this network  and it showed an empty field  said we drew   people  now  that s not bad  but it s a lie  we had   people in the little ball that we constructed  trump then insisted that the entire national mall was packed all the way to the washington monument and then warned the media that they will  pay a price  for accurately reporting the numbers here s the video via twitter president trump on crowd size at inauguration   it looked like a million and a half people   https   t co  https   t co   cnn   cnn  january     up near the capitol where trump spoke was clearly packed  but the national mall definitely was not in fact  we can compare trump s inauguration attendance to president obama s in  with photographs taken at the same time just before the inaugural address was delivered for those saying  trump can t be that hated  look at the size of the crowd     inauguration pic twitter com   stefan kay     january    is shown is that president obama s crowd reaches all the way to the washington monument in the photo on the left  while trump s crowd is  indeed  sparse and does not reach the washington monument as he claims apparently  trump is thinking of president obama s inauguration crowd instead of his own and the dc metro statistics corroborate the photos metro ridership  as of    trips taken so far today                            wmata  metro   wmata  january    fact is that simply by looking at the photo it is possible to estimate the crowd size  and trump s claim just doesn t match up with reality furthermore  it s incredibly disturbing that trump continues to threaten the media for telling the truth about him  especially when there is photographic evidence that proves him wrong trump owes the media a public apology and then he needs to focus on the presidency instead of engaging in petty feuds with the free press he s just mad because the size of the women s march in washington dwarfs his crowd size featured image via screenshot
