the department of justice has begun their criminal probe into wells fargo over the firing of   employees after said employees were coerced into opening over  million unauthorized accounts in an effort to boost their stock prices as the criminal probe begins   senators  including bernie sanders and elizabeth warren  whose video grilling ceo john stumpf went viral  wrote a letter to attorney general loretta lynch asking that the investigation primarily focus on executives with the company  not lower level employees every time the department of justice settles a case of corporate fraud without holding individuals accountable  it reinforces the notion that the wealthy and powerful have purchased a higher class of justice for themselves  that s why the wells fargo investigation is so important   last week s senate banking committee hearing with wells fargo chairman and ceo john stumpf raised serious questions that demand additional answers and point to potential individual wrongdoing  we are not in a position to determine if any of the senior executives at wells fargo committed criminal conduct   that is ultimately the job of the justice department and courts   but these facts raise questions about whether senior executives  including mr  stumpf  knowingly allowed illegal conduct to continue senators who signed the letter are tammy baldwin  richard blumenthal  dick durbin  al franken  kirsten gillibrand  mazie hirono  angus king  amy klobuchar  patrick leahy  ed markey  jeff merkley  bernie sanders  elizabeth warren  and ron wyden twelve democrats and two independents  not a single republican signed the letter the letter states that stumpf knew as early as  that employees were opening up the illegal accounts but failed to disclose the information to investors and instead used the illegal accounts as a way to inflate stock prices  in other words  stumpf was committing fraud the end of the letter praises the actions taken by warren s consumer financial protection bureau  but it still holds out hope that the doj will investigate executives personally while the consumer financial protection bureau and office of the comptroller of the currency settlements in this case are a good first step toward providing restitution to wells fargo s customers  they are no substitute for a thorough justice department investigation into potential wrongdoing by senior executives at the bank   we hope the department follows through on its promise in the yates memo and brings all the resources it has to bear on investigating the conduct of wells fargo s senior leadership sanders wrote a letter to regulators earlier  asking if any investigations against the executives personally were being conducted  saying   wall street won t change until we make it clear that no bank is too big to fail and no ceo is too big to jail  so far  his questions remain unanswered  hopefully  the letter sent by these progressive senators doesn t go unanswered featured image via justin sullivan getty images
