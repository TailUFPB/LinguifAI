after hillary clinton did the unthinkable   told the truth about the trump base of support   the republicans were quick to call it her   percent moment   the politically incorrect group of right wingers were furious that clinton wasn t being p c   so they decided to engage in a faux outrage campaign  complete with an already made ad from the trump campaign donald trump was particularly offended by clinton s comments  saying  the disdain hillary clinton expressed towards millions of decent americans disqualifies her from public service  is that so  well  then i guess trump should disqualify himself from being president of the united states  considering he accused  percent of the country of being lazy moochers just last year in a june  interview on fox news with sean hannity  trump told viewers  the problem we have right now we have a society that sits back and says we don t have to do anything  eventually  the  percent cannot carry and it s unfair to them but cannot carry the other  percent  certainly not as hyperbolic as  basket of deplorables   but still reminiscent of a legitimate   percent  moment   only this time trump bumped the number up  just six months earlier  in january   before he announced his candidacy  trump told msnbc s kasie hunt that   we have a tremendous amount of people in this country that don t want to work  they have no inclination to work   trump also told romney he shouldn t apologize for making the infamous comment  saying that it was correct so trump has gone on the record saying he thinks  percent of this country is comprised of lazy moochers who take from the other  percent  where in actuality it s the top  percent that take from the next  percent  so  insulting a faction of a right wing extremist political electorate based on the reprehensible things they have said and believe in is wrong  but calling  percent of the entire country lazy and moochers isn t  conservatives really know who to get offended easily what clinton said wasn t insulting  it was the truth  what romney  and now trump said  was insulting  spare me the outrage  republicans featured image via brian blanco getty images
