the nation s nuclear arsenal is going to be even more difficult to maintain because donald trump just ordered the top people at the national nuclear security administration to resign immediately donald trump has previously claimed that he wants to ignite a nuclear arms race and expand america s nuclear arsenal  but it looks like he s only interested in making america less safe the national nuclear security administration is charged with keeping america s nuclear weapons up to date and ready to go so that if we ever need to use them they ll be in working order the nnsa presents a budget to congress every year and asks for money to do their jobs  but if trump has his way  the nnsa will not be able to do these things in the past  presidential appointees to posts like the nnsa have traditionally been held until after the new president appoints and the senate confirms their replacement  such a tradition ensures that the government is still working even during a transition of power but according to gizmodo trump  however  appears determined to immediately push out everyone who was appointed by obama  regardless of whether or not he has anyone in line for the job  or  as our source put it   it s a shocking disregard for process and continuity of government  just as with obama s soon to be removed international envoys  trump has ordered under secretary for nuclear security frank klotz and his deputy  madelyn creedon both obama appointees to leave their posts  even if it means no one is in charge of maintaining the country s nuclear weapons  according to our energy department source  trump s team has yet to nominate anyone to succeed them  since both positions require senate confirmation  if could be months before their chairs are filled  and the vacancies may extend beyond the leadership roles and because klotz and creedon are the only ones in the nnsa who can present a budget to congress  it means the agency could end up without leadership and funding to do what it is supposed to do until trump and the senate do their jobs  and that could take months an energy department source told gizmodo that   i m more and more coming around to the idea that we re so very very fucked  donald trump is putting our nation at risk by not observing the transition traditions that keep the government working efficiently and smoothly  he is apparently obsessed with ousting anyone who disagrees with him and anyone who was hired during the obama administration  but republicans should remember that if they allow trump to do this  they have no right to whine when democrats do the exact same thing to conservatives in four years  because then we ll see what taking out the trash really looks like the fact that trump is literally willing to weaken the effectiveness of our government and endanger our national security with his pettiness is frightening  the only person who is probably happy about this news is vladimir putin  once again  trump is a useful idiot to russia featured image  pixabay
