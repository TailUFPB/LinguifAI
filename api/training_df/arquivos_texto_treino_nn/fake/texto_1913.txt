remember when the world laughed at donald trump when he claimed that president obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at his gigantic golden tower in new york  apparently he forgot  because he is still claiming it is true despite multiple intelligence agencies disputing the ridiculous allegation in an interview with financial times  trump was asked if he regrets any of his tweets   like this one terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    now my last tweet  you know the one that you are talking about perhaps  was the one about being in quotes wire tapped  meaning surveilled   trump said   guess what  it is turning out to be true  it is not turning out to be true in the least  trump tower was monitored for two years ending in   but president obama did not order it  the fbi did  and the probe led to gran jury indictments of  people involved in a russian money laundering operation including one of the country s most notorious mob bosses in addition  numerous trump transition team members were caught up in  incidental collection  while intelligence agencies were looking into foreign criminals trump s desperate attempts to distract from the russia investigation   especially since michael flynn offered to roll over in exchange for immunity   are at this point pathetic featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla
