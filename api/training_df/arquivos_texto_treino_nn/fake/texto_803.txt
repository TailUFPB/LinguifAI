it turns out that william f  buckley s own son wasn t thrilled about sean hannity receiving an award named after his dad and that may be the exact reason why the conservative group known as the media research center rescinded the  media excellence  award he was set to receive  despite the fact that hannity has done nothing but push conspiracies and kiss donald trump s ass according to cnn  the naming of hannity as the award s recipient  caused distress among buckley s family   in particular his only child  best selling author christopher buckley  a source familiar with the situation tells cnn that christopher buckley  expressed great dismay  at the announcement that the award would go to hannity  who has spent a great deal of time insulting conservative intellectuals on twitter  particularly since he became a strong supporter of donald trump indeed  hannity is not an intellectual at all  he s a college dropout who peddles bullshit that should have gotten him kicked off the airwaves years ago  meanwhile  william f  buckley was a true conservative intellectual who loathed trump buckley s son informed the media research center of his disapproval and the group quietly removed hannity s name from the gala on their website and decided not to give hannity the award they made the right decision  the only thing hannity deserves for the crap he spews on television and radio is a pink slip of course  the news upset hannity and he took to twitter to throw a temper tantrum  attacking cnn and christopher buckley hey fake news jake  i was offered an award  i was unable to attend  and i respectfully turned it down  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  july     nro  never trumpers  or wfb s son were upset about me receiving the award  they never told me  now i m really glad i said  no thanks  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  july      awards  are bs ways to raise    the only  award  i care about is serving my audience  the support of my audience  and saving the usa https   t co ycyjtesuto  sean hannity   seanhannity  july    buckley  no wfb  needs to speak out about how  nro has readers pay for free cruise  vacations   thank god for conservative review   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    idea  i never spoke to chris a single time  i was going to humbly accept it  but i ran into a conflict and declined   nro is never trump  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  july    just demonstrated precisely why he should never have been picked to receive a media award  attacking the son of the man it is named after isn t exactly an example of media professionalism hannity is just desperately trying to save face after being rejected  he knows it  the media research council knows it  cnn knows it  we all know it featured image via paul zimmerman getty images
