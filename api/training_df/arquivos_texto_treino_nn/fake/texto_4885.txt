this hypocrite just got his ass handed to him by karma ken adkins is an anti gay  christian  pastor in georgia who cheered when a gunman killed nearly  people at a gay nightclub in orlando florida this past june the nation was horrified by the mass shooting  but many so called conservative  christians  were very pleased adkins himself wrote on twitter that the victims deserved to be killed  i don t see none of them as victims   he wrote   i see them as getting what they deserve   his tweet received wide condemnation but that didn t bother the  year old  man of god   he simply continued preaching hate to his congregations but now karma is biting adkins in the ass for doing something that conservative  christians  often falsely accuse gay people of doing on friday  adkins turned himself in to police after he was accused of molesting a child in  adkins alleged molested the victim on multiple occasions in several different locations  including the church  in his car  and at the victim s home the charges against adkin s are especially ironic considering what the pastor has said about lgbt anti discrimination laws according to the florida times union adkins is a controversial figure in jacksonville politics  particularly because of comments and crude caricatures he posted on his twitter account while he helped lead the fight against expanding jacksonville s anti discrimination law to cover lesbian  gay  bisexual and transgender people among the criticisms that adkins lodged was his assertion that expanding the law would make it easier for sexual predators to find victims in bathrooms yet  it sounds like we need stricter laws protecting children from pastors instead adkins isn t the only pastor to meet karmic retribution after remarks about the pulse nightclub shooting pastor steven anderson actually called for executing gays across the country in a video in which he cheered the slaughter at pulse the good news is that there s  less pedophiles in this world  because  you know  these homosexuals are a bunch of disgusting perverts and pedophiles   anderson spewed  these people all should have been killed  anyway  but they should have been killed through the proper channels  as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them  convicted them  and saw them executed  you gotta wonder when anderson will also be arrested for child molestation someday  after all  he sure does enjoy talking about pedophilia and accusing people of committing it even though he has no proof to back up his claims at any rate  at least we got to see him throw a fit about various companies terminating their business ties with his church  you know  because businesses generally don t want to have anything to do with bigots who support mass murder featured image via wikimedia
