if donald trump hadn t proven himself to be the worst person to ever occupy the white house  he certainly proved it on friday  while hurricane harvey was about to hit land as the largest hurricane in over a decade  he pardoned the racist sheriff joe arpaio as it turns out  trump s timing wasn t just heartless and it wasn t at all oblivious  like nearly everything the former reality show star does  it was about television ratings  in the middle of a hurricane  even though it was a friday evening  i assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally   trump said during a press conference with finnish president sauli niinist    you know  the hurricane was just starting  he s done a great job for the people of arizona  he s very strong on borders  very strong on illegal immigration   trump said about arpaio   i thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started  source  the hillby pardoning the man who was convicted of disregarding a court order to stop racially profiling  trump already proved himself to have zero compassion  but the fact that it was some sort of ratings grab proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that trump isn t even human it also explains a lot about his media coverage during the election  trump seems to have one skill  and that is to bring on ratings  in much the same way as any shock jock might  he doesn t elevate the national dialogue  he shoves it into the gutter  he will never be my president because he refuses to be my president  he is only the president to those who voted for him  he is by far the most divisive man  and i use that word very broadly  to ever hold office  he is id with a dangerous dose of ego and friday s pardon of arpaio showed the worst of both featured image via drew angerer getty images
