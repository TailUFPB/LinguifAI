donald trump is quickly closing in on his first  days in office  and despite his many  many promises of accomplishments during this presidential milestone  he s accomplished zilch other than a handful of executive orders that would help make america and the world a living stinkhole  so what does trump  whose ever and only a showman do  he holds photo ops  where he holds up oversized documents to show off his cartoonish signature his latest executive order was the type of empty photo op you d expect from a game show host  not from a president  because it literally did nothing  it was supposed to empower education secretary  betsy devos to screw with washington  d c  public schools in much the same way as trump is allowing oil companies to screw with our environment  why just d c   because they are the only school district within the purview of the federal government and not the states  so  every time republicans want to bully people of color  they go after washington  d c  fortunately for the school children  though  this executive order was about as toothless as the average fox news viewer  as senior department of education official rob goad admitted q you said at the top that this executive order would empower the secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that don t comply with law  how will that process work mr  goad  so i think at the end of  days  and after we have produced a report  we will make those decisions once the report has concluded q so is she empowered to modify the regulations as needed  or is that going to be a separate process entirely mr  goad  the executive order gives her   empowers her to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal law q isn t she already empowered to do those things  this executive order doesn t give her those powers  right mr  goad  that s right source  sharebluethat  apparently  was too much transparency for the administration  goad was prompted to shut down the press conference right after that question
