wow  the cruelty of republicans knows no bounds apparently  republicans truly believe that healthcare is a privilege that only people with money should be able to receive that s basically what ohio gop rep  warren davidson told a mother who expressed her concern that her son won t have healthcare coverage if republicans repeal the affordable care act the woman s son works in the service industry  which usually does not provide health insurance to workers  pay is also low enough that workers qualify for medicaid  a program that republicans fiercely oppose because it benefits low income americans prior to the passage of the affordable care act  her son did not have health insurance  he  like millions of other americans  could not afford it  but the medicaid expansion finally gave him the healthcare coverage he desperately needed  now that is being threatened by donald trump and the republican controlled congress  can you explain why my son and millions of others in his situation are not deserving of affordable  decent health care that has essential benefits so that he can stay healthy and continue working   the mother asked davidson at a town hall event on tuesday davidson responded by giving a heartless answer that resulted in a round of boos and jeers from the crowd in attendance  ok  i don t know anything about your son  but as you described him  his skills are focused in an industry that doesn t have the kind of options that you want him to have for health care  so  i don t believe that these taxpayers here are entitled to give that to him  i believe he s got the opportunity to go earn those health benefits  first of all  service industry workers pay taxes  too  so they have every right to be covered by medicaid  second  healthcare is a right that everyone should have regardless of where they work or what industry they work in  third  there are not enough of the kind of jobs davidson is talking about to provide everyone in this country with workplace provided healthcare coverage benefits  and finally  if davidson and his republican colleagues got off their asses and passed a law requiring the multi billion dollar service industry to provide healthcare to their workers or pay their workers enough so they can afford to buy good health insurance plans themselves  this woman s son and millions of others would not have to live in fear of losing their coverage but davidson literally told this woman to tell her son to get a different job  and he dug the hole deeper for himself by compare health insurance to cell phones  if he doesn t want a catastrophic care plan  don t buy a catastrophic care plan  if you don t want a flip phone  don t buy a flip phone   davidson said  once again  the crowd reacted in total disgust buying a cell phone is not the same as buying health insurance  and it s time for republicans to that through their thick skulls health insurance costs hundreds of dollars a month or more while a cell phone payment plan is relatively cheap in response to davidson s remark  the woman snapped back and then walked away with the knowledge that her own congressman doesn t give a damn about her or her family  i m sorry  health care is much different than a cell phone and i m tired of people using cell phone analogies with health care   she said here s the video via youtube  the exchange begin at the  minute mark this is why republicans should be ousted in  featured image via screenshot
