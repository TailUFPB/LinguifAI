most of us tend to be quite selective about who we give our phone number to so you would instantly assume that the president of the united states would guard his personal cell number with a great deal of secrecy too  well  apparently that isn t the case in yet another break from convention  president donald trump has been handing out his personal cellphone number to world leaders  telling them to call him directly  raising security concerns in the white house  even if it is just for conversations with other world leaders  it s still more than a little hypocritical of president trump to be using a personal phone when he has spent a great deal of time and energy berating hillary clinton for using a private email server while she was secretary of state  claiming the practice left her vulnerable when sending confidential information and leading to chants of  lock her up   from trump supporters while on the presidential campaign according to both former and current unnamed us officials  president trump has urged the leaders of mexico and canada to call him on his personal number  however  only canadian prime minister justin trudeau has taken him up on the offer  furthermore  according to an unnamed french official  trump also swapped phone numbers with emmanuel macron  president of france  when the two spoke immediately after macron s victory earlier in may although it doesn t seem that crazy to think that world leaders might hit each other up on their cells  leader to leader calls generally follow a standard protocol  in the case of us presidents  calls are usually placed on one of several secure phone lines  including those in the white house situation room  the oval office or the presidential limousine  according to national security experts  trump using his cellphone for such calls puts him at an extremely high risk of being listened in on  particularly by foreign governments  if you are speaking on an open line  then it s an open line  meaning those who have the ability to monitor those conversations are doing so   said derek chollet  a former pentagon adviser and national security council official  if someone is trying to spy on you  then everything you re saying  you have to presume that others are listening to it  a perfect example of this practice was when edward snowden leaked that the us was monitoring german chancellor angela merkel s cell in back in   despite germany being an american ally  if you are macron or the leader of any country and you get the cellphone number of the president of the united states  it s reasonable to assume that they d hand it right over to their intel service   said ashley deeks  a law professor at the university of virginia and former assistant legal adviser for political military affairs in the u s  state department giving your personal number out when you re a new york city real estate mogul is obviouslyly common practice  but trump should probably find another way to make his deals now that he is president of the united states featured image via brian blanco getty images
