this is yet another egregious abuse of power if the supreme court caves in to donald trump s latest demands  it will truly be the end of the rule of law as we know it two weeks ago  a  year old migrant  known as jane doe in court records  sought an abortion but was denied the procedure by the trump administration the government forced her to remain in a refugee center in texas rather than allow her to exercise a constitutional right so the american civil liberties union  aclu  took the trump administration to court and asked the judge to grant their client the ability to seek the medical care she needed to make a long story short  she won  and she won again when the trump administration appealed  the girl then went to a doctor and got an abortion but  of course  this made the trump administration angry despite the fact that the girl legally received an abortion  trump s justice department is throwing a temper tantrum because they think the girl should have informed them so that they could block her by appealing to a higher court  this was a total surprise  and we re disturbed about it   disgraced attorney general jeff sessions whined let s make this clear  the girl had the abortion following a ruling by a federal appeals court judge that granted her request to seek the procedure  she did not have to wait nor did she have to inform the government  it is the government s responsibility to file appeals quickly  but the trump administration did not file quick enough and now the trump administration is demanding that the supreme court punish the aclu lawyers for winning their case and helping their client get the abortion she wanted according to the tribune washington bureau on friday  new solicitor general noel francisco filed an appeal that asks the supreme court to set aside the lower court s rulings and to consider  disciplinary action  against the aclu they  kept the government in the dark about when ms  doe was scheduled to have an abortion   he told the justices   given the extraordinary circumstances  of the case  the court should consider sanctions against one or more of the aclu lawyers  he said trump s administration is stooping to a new low  the supreme court should not be used as a tool to punish or attack lawyers who help their clients win  the aclu won their case twice and their client exercised her right to have an abortion in accordance with the court decision  they were not required to inform the federal government  that would have been a violation of their client s privacy  if the trump administration wanted to appeal  they should have done it much faster instead of expecting a teen girl and her lawyers to keep them informed about her every move aclu legal director david cole reacted strongly to trump s demand  this administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion  after the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion  it was the aclu s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn t delayed any further   not give the government another chance to stand in her way  our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with court orders and federal and texas law  that government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault  not ours  if the conservative justices on the supreme court go along with this demand  it will only further erode the credibility of the court and our justice system  and trump would have a new weapon to use against anyone who opposes him in a court of law featured image  alex wong getty images
