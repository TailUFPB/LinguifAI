donald trump s conflicts of interest were of massive concern for many americans  and rightfully so  there is absolutely no doubt that trump has been trying to profit off of his presidency   and now there s proof this year  trump s company turned    million in profit at trump international hotel  which is far higher than expectations  the trump organization actually predicted it would lose    million in the first four months of trump s presidency  but the business is instead boasting a  percent improvement over what the trump family projected when the hotel was opened in the fall at the center of these profits are members of trump s own cabinet  who have either stayed or lived at the hotel  the hotel is also frequently visited by trump s inner circle and republican leaders  who are willing to spend big money and food and beverages at the hotel s bar and restaurant  currently  the hotel is charging guests an average of    a night  which is  percent higher than the company s expectations  this makes the hotel the most expensive in the city   many others such as four seasons and willard are only charging   per night it s no wonder that several ethics experts and democrats have objected to this arrangement  rep  peter a  defazio  d ore   called the government s lease a  highly unethical arrangement   he said  what makes all of this particularly galling is that we now have the unprecedented situation where the president of the united states is both the landlord and tenant of a federal building  trump has made absolutely no effort to address ethical concerns about his businesses  even though he had originally promised to do so when he won the election trump continues to be involved in his businesses and continues to profit off of them  already  he has been sued by government watchdog groups and state attorneys general over these business practices  however  his behavior clearly shows that he doesn t care  trump has only been in office for a few months  and he s already spent  days at his properties and continues to host dinners that look more like promotions than anything else  what trump is doing is beyond unethical  and it must be stopped featured image via tom pennington getty images
