donald trump is absolutely obsessed with erasing president obama s achievements and taking credit for them in yet another twitter tantrum on monday morning  trump began by whining about the affordable care act if obamacare is hurting people    it is  why shouldn t it hurt the insurance companies   why should congress not be paying what public pays   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    usual  trump is lying his ass off the truth is that members of congress must buy health insurance through the exchanges like the rest of us and they don t get a special subsidy either  they pay what the rest of us do according to factcheck org   lawmakers and their staffs face additional requirements that other americans don t   and the  subsidy  which trump appears to be referring to is just a contribution from the federal government  lawmakers are merely getting a contribution from their employer like ordinary americans who get insurance through their employer  except lawmakers are not getting insurance through their employer like they used to  members of congress used to get their healthcare paid for by the taxpayer  that ended under obamacare as lawmakers were forced to buy a private plan through the exchanges like everyone else  in other words  congress pays what we pay and then trump once again took credit for president obama s economy highest stock market ever  best economic numbers in years  unemployment lowest in  years  wages raising  border secure  s c   no wh chaos   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    the end of president obama s tenure  and long before trump was elected  the stock market had already reached record highs  unemployment fell to under  percent thanks to obama s record  consecutive months of job growth  wages also rose by   percent  wages under trump have actually remained flat no matter how much he wants to take credit for imaginary wage hikes  the border was also secure under obama as illegal immigration dropped significantly under his watch  and if trump really thinks his white house isn t chaotic he is truly delusional the bottom line is that trump is trying to take credit for things president obama did while trying to erase his legacy  trump won t have a legacy  so he is trying to steal obama s for himself  it s just more desperation from a pathetic man who is unfit to be president  but a perfect fit for federal prison featured image via alex wong getty images
