republican nominee donald trump s outreach to win over minorities has been a disaster  and what he just said about a group of exonerated men is probably going to end whatever support he had trump had been big on accusing the  central park five    the five teens wrongfully accused of raping a woman in central park   ever since the case blew up in   during that time  trump had taken out a full page ad in the new york times blaming the teens  and using them as the reason why new york state should bring back the death penalty  ironic  because trump himself has been accused of rape several times   the ad  which was signed by trump himself  said  they should be forced to suffer and  when they kill  they should be executed for their crimes  just to be clear  these were minority teenagers  one was latino and four were black   and trump called for their death  decades later  trump continues to double down on those comments  according to a cnn report  trump revealed that he still thinks these five men are guilty  despite the fact that they were exonerated and awarded   million for wrongful imprisonment in   trump said  they admitted they were guilty  the police doing the original investigation say they were guilty  the fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous  and the woman  so badly injured  will never be the same  yes  trump still believes these men are responsible for what happened to trisha meili  despite the fact that dna evidence pointed to matias reyes  who confessed to the crime trump has questioned the release of the central park five before  after the men were released and received their settlement in   trump said   settling doesn t mean innocence  fortunately  no one has forgotten trump s racist past with the central park five  and are spreading this information far and wide just weeks ahead of the election  this is certainly a bad time for trump to be reminding everyone how racist he is twittertwittertwittertwittertwitterit s mind boggling that trump still cannot accept their innocence  despite the evidence  but perhaps this explanation by michael d antonio  the author of the truth about trump  will shed some light onto it  he s not a person who takes in new information and then adjusts and accepts reality  the only reality that matters to him is his judgment  which was rendered many years prior  featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
