one of the arguments against the affordable care act  obamacare  is that people are losing options as insurance companies are pulling out  that s true  insurance companies are pulling out  but republicans tell us it s because the law isn t viable and that insurance companies are leaving because they aren t making money  well  a ruling from a federal judge just blew the lid off of that theory the ruling  from judge john d  bates  a george w  bush appointee  was in a case involving aetna  who has pulled out of all but four of the states where they were part of the exchange  the claim was that they were losing money on the deal  judge bates found that that was a lie now a federal judge has ruled that that was a rank falsehood  in fact  says judge john d  bates  aetna made its decision at least partially in response to a federal antitrust lawsuit blocking its proposed   billion merger with humana  aetna threatened federal officials with the pullout before the lawsuit was filed  and followed through on its threat once it was filed  bates made the observations in the course of a ruling he issued monday blocking the merger source  la timesthat pretty much eliminates one major talking point in the debate surrounding health insurance the judge s conclusions about aetna s real reasons for pulling out of obamacare   as opposed to the rationalization the company made in public   are crucial for the debate over the fate of the affordable care act  that s because the company s withdrawal has been exploited by republicans to justify repealing the act  just last week  house speaker paul ryan  r wis   cited aetna s action on the  charlie rose  show  saying that it proved how shaky the exchanges were in fact  the judge ruled  aetna was profitable in some of the states but pulled out nonetheless just to make a point   a point that risked the lives or at least the health coverage of upwards of  million people  bates believes that aetna will start selling insurance in at least some of these markets again  so there goes the whole  obamacare is imploding  idea clearly  not all insurers are lying to americans  kaiser permanente loves the law  they ve even profited from it  the fact is that if they can do it  there s no reason other companies can t  all they have to do is cut back on the greed featured image via win mcnamee getty images
