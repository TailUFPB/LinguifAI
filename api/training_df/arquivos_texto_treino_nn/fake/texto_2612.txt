donald trump is no fan of cnn  he has repeatedly tried to discredit and delegitimize the network  even going so far as to call them fake news and refuse to answer a question from one of their reporters during the only press conference he has held since inauguration day well  one of cnn s best anchors  jake tapper  who hosts the lead and state of the union  stopped by the late show with stephen colbert on wednesday night  and of course the topic of trump came up  more specifically  the topic of cnn s relationship with trump came up  after the niceties were exchanged colbert started out by reading a list of insulting adjectives that trump had used to describe the network  then went on to ask tapper  why are you so mean to him  jake  if you guys just didn t fact check him anymore  he wouldn t be saying these things about you  tapper responded  that s a good point  then  colbert went on to say  what s it like in the halls over there knowing that the president actively doesn t like your network  tapper then delivered the best   and presumably honest   zinger that would really hit home for trump  i don t think anybody cares  now  this is important because trump needs people to care about him  how he feels  what he says  what he thinks  as tapper points out  it is not a reporter s job to be liked  it is a reporter s job to hold people accountable  now that we have a president and a white house that actively lies on a routine basis to the american public  it s vital to the survival of our democracy that tapper and those like him continue to fact check trump  no matter how many insane insults he throws at them the relevant part comes a couple of minutes into the following video  but the entire interview is beyond awesome featured image via video screen capture
