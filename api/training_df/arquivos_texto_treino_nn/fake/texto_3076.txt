madonna has never been shy about expressing the fact that she hates president elect donald trump with a burning passion  not only was she a major supporter of hillary clinton  but after trump was elected she was noting saying that she was  ashamed to be an american   who could blame her   and that america was  f cked  and she s far from done speaking about trump  in a recent interview with harper s bazaar  madonna got real about how everyday life has been since the electoral college allowed a completely undeserving bigot to lead this country for the next four years  opening up about a feeling that many of us are now all too familiar with  madonna said that every day she s woken up and it s felt like when you break up with somebody who has really broken your heart  many americans have been equally heartbroken and disappointed about the election results  and are frightened about the future of the country  she said  it s like being dumped by a lover and also being stuck in a nightmare  reflecting on the night trump was elected  madonna said she was doing what most americans were  i was sitting at a table with my agent  who is also one of my very best friends  and we were truly praying  we were praying we were doing everything  lighting candles  meditating  praying  offering our lives to god forever  if only  despite the collective despair that many americans are feeling right now  madonna says that she   and every other american that rejected trump   can t quietly accept defeat  putting herself and fellow celebrities on blast  madonna urged anyone with a platform to speak out  she said  i have to get way more vocal and become a little bit less mysterious  what i find really astonishing is how quiet everybody is in my industry  she revealed that while many celebrities are disgusted by trump  they are afraid to get involved because they still want to  maintain their popularity  and  because it doesn t affect their daily life yet  no one s doing anything about it  if trump s disastrous  bigotry filled transition and upcoming administration is any indicator  our lives will be affected before we know it  now is not the time to be silent twittertwitterfeatured image via stephen lovekin and drew angerer   getty images
