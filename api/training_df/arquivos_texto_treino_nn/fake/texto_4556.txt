you ve got to love robert reich  the former secretary of labor under future first lady and former president bill clinton met a trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldn t resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guy s week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him  facts  i finally found a trump supporter   this morning when i went to buy coffee   i noticed a trump bumper sticker on his car     reich writes in a facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it monday morning  then he completely dismantled trump   politely   before the guy s very eyes  hi   i said   noticed your trump bumper sticker  yup   he said  a bit defensively  i hope you don t mind my asking  but i m curious  why are you supporting him  i know he s a little bit much   said the trump supporter   but he s a successful businessman  and we need a successful businessman as president  how do you know he s a successful businessman   i asked  because he s made a fortune  has he really   i asked  of course  forbes magazine says he s worth four and a half billion  that doesn t mean he s been a success   i said  in my book it does   said the trump supporter  you know  in   when trump was just starting his career  he said he was worth about   million   i said   most of that was from his father  that just proves my point   said the trump supporter   he turned that   million into four and a half billion  brilliant man  but if he had just put that   million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends  he d be worth twelve billion today   i said the trump supporter went silent  and he got about   million in tax subsidies  just in new york alone   i said more silence  he s not a businessman  reich concluded   he s a con man   hope you enjoy your coffee  while it s unlikely that reich managed to change the trump fan s mind   or even reach him on a level that matters   he surely left the guy steaming more than a freshly brewed cup of go go  juice  oh  to be a fly on the wall during that conversation featured image via getty images  win mcnamee  screengrab
