oh  north dakota  they just had to go and set the bar lower for themselves  instead of figuring out why protesters disrupted a lot during the long fight against the dakota access pipeline and maybe finding a productive solution to disruption  they ll just try and eliminate protesters in a way that skirts the  amendment and it s really horrific  this allegedly  pro life  crowd wants to make it legal for drivers to run over anyone blocking a roadway  they hate protesters to the point where they actually introduced a bill in the state legislature to do just that  a driver of a motor vehicle who negligently causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road  street  or highway may not be held liable for any damages   the bill reads   a driver of a motor vehicle who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road  street  or highway is not guilty of an offense  yeah   unintentionally   well  that just makes everything okay  then  doesn t it  infuriatingly  they say that this is necessary after the dapl protests  and they claim that pedestrians are intentionally putting themselves in danger if they protest on roads  because protests are supposed to happen in the background where they won t make people uncomfortable what s the difference between this and running over someone who s just jaywalking  isn t that person intentionally putting themselves in danger  the bill doesn t actually mention protesters  so it s somewhat safe to assume that someone guilty of hitting just any jaywalker out there could get away with it  too  no compensation for medical bills or funeral costs  no punitive damages for the family of the victim  it s sick the big problem here is proving intent  proving intent  or lack of intent  is really fucking difficult to do  so north dakota is working on making the world more dangerous for pedestrians and for protesters  because  reasons  reasons that involve terrifying people into not protesting republicans really are a sick breed featured image by alex wong via getty images
