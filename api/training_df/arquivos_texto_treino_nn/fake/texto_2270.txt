republican rep  jason chaffetz has made a living in congress starting investigations into just about anything in an effort to hurt democrats  but even he thinks donald trump has nothing to support his accusations against president obama on saturday  trump made the outrageous claim that president obama wiretapped trump tower to spy on him and demanded that congress investigate even though he didn t offer a single shred of evidence to back up his claims terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    s accusations were even shot down by former national intelligence director james clapper  who served in the position from  to  clapper told meet the press on sunday that if president obama had ordered a wiretap  whether legal or illegal  he would have known about it of course  that s not stopping republicans from including trump s accusations in their investigation of his russia scandal  which means we can expect republicans to focus more of their energy trying to desperately prove trump s claim than they will on revealing trump s ties to russia and vladimir putin but one republican concedes that he hasn t seen anything that would support trump s accusation utah rep  jason chaffetz loves investigations  he is obsessed with witch hunts against democrats and will start endless investigations into anything if he thinks it could be a scandal to hit democrats with  on the other hand  he isn t really interested in investigating republicans like trump when true scandals like russian interference in the election arise  but even he says that trump has nothing to prove his accusations against president obama  you never know when you turn a corner what you may or may not see   chaffetz said on cbs this morning  but thus far i have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said  despite that concession  chaffetz has offered to support an investigation into trump s allegations even though he isn t interested in leading the investigation himself  look  it s a very serious allegation   chaffetz continued   the president has at his fingertips tens of billions of dollars in intelligence apparatus  i ve got to believe   i think he might have something there  but if not  we re going to find out  here s the video via youtube so chaffetz literally went from saying that trump has nothing to saying that he might have something  this is the kind of double speak that americans despise from politicians the fact is that trump has zero evidence to support his claims and congress has no evidence to justify starting an investigation based on those claims  trump is slandering president obama based on a conspiracy theory he read on breitbart and republicans appear to be willing to start a witch hunt over it  and american taxpayers will be paying for it donald trump is hoping to distract congress from investigating his russia scandal by telling lies about president obama  it s sad that republicans are incapable of seeing through trump s bullshit  as usual  republicans are demonstrating that they would rather investigate democrats instead of doing anything that threatens their own power featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
