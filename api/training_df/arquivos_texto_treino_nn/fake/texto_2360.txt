jon stewart may not be routinely commenting on america s politics anymore  but he certainly hasn t stepped away from the spotlight  last night  stewart took a break from his personal projects to hijack stephen colbert s the late show  where he couldn t resist weighing in on donald trump during the show  stewart nailed a personality trait of trump s that shows just how untrustworthy trump is  while it s well known that trump lies through his teeth every chance he gets  he was also proven to be the most dishonest presidential candidate last year   there s one behavior of trump s that gives it all away   and stewart pointed this out perfectly  mocking one of trump s most obvious speech patterns  stewart said  nobody says  believe me  unless they are lying  he elaborated  trump lies more in one press conference than cnn does in a year  and this is coming from a guy  who as you know  hates cnn  stewart also had some equally harsh words for the media  and advised the press that it should  get its groove back  and stop latching onto trump s every attack  stewart said to the media  let s face facts  you kind of let yourself go a little bit these past few years  put on a few pundits  obsessing  hours a day  seven days a week  about this one guy   what s donnie up to  did he say anything about us  you think he s gonna come on our show   stewart compared the behavior between trump and the media to a bad breakup  and suggested that it was an opportunity for improvement  stewart said   take up a hobby  i recommend journalism  colbert asked stewart if he felt the press would actually do some self reflection and improve  and stewart joked  i really do   believe me  you can watch stewart weigh in on trump and the media below  featured image via screenshots
