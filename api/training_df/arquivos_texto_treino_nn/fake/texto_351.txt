the military s budget is being massively expanded this year  and nobody is really sure why  the answer seems to be  because we can   republicans in the senate have decided that the pentagon should receive even more money than trump s hawkish white house wanted  and is giving the military things it never requested and does not need  the  national defense authorization act approves a budget of   billion  an annual increase of   billion  meanwhile  republicans are out to gut aid programs for low income americans so why aren t  deficit hawks  like paul ryan questioning where this money will come from  we re ballooning the deficit to kill people  and for what  exactly  the pentagon does not need the money  for example  the budget has allowed for  new f  lightning fighter jets  via bloomberg the measure would authorize  f  jets made by lockheed martin corp    more than requested by the president and seven more than the house agreed to in its version of the bill oh  by the way  the budget is also illegal  why is that  well  a law passed in  only allows   billion in base related expenses  the united states has  military bases and hundreds of thousands of soldiers occupying nations around the globe  the budget as it stands recommends   billion senate armed services committee chairman john mccain  r ariz   said during floor debate that his panel ignored the budget constraints set in law because responding to national security challenges requires more resources  the threats to our national security have not been more complex  severe  or daunting at any time in the past seven decades   and our job is to ensure we have a military capable of meeting those threats   mccain said   for too long  we have locked ourselves into making strategic decisions based on budget realities  it is time to start making budget decisions based on strategic realities  that s right  republicans think we should make  budget decisions based on strategic realities   completely ignoring military related deficits  in order to pay for jets  and other stuff  the military never asked for and does not need or  maybe  the massive lobbying arm of the defense industry has more to do with it  they ve already spent tens of millions in  alone to buy politicians and influence  and there s no slowing down these two things are unrelated pic twitter com   adam h  johnson   adamjohnsonnyc  september    else could that money pay for  great question  common dreams has a great perspective on the true cost of needless military spending put another way  with a   billion military budget  the u s  would be spending more than three times as much as china on its military  and  times as much as russia  according to   the u s  already accounts for more than a third of all military spending yes  in the entire world  the united states  with about   of the world s population  is responsible for over   of the military spending worldwide  who are we preparing to fight  exactly or with   billion a year  you could make public colleges and universities in the u s  tuition free  in fact  sanders s proposal was only estimated to cost the federal government   billion per year if the additional military spending over the next  years instead went to pay off student debt  it could come close to wiping it out entirely yet those kind of ideas  or universal healthcare coverage  are dismissed out of hand by republicans  maybe that s because the everyday people who would benefit most don t pay as well as insurance and military lobbyists  maybe that s because most politicians  but especially republicans  are more invested in personal careers and success than they are in their country eight members of the senate voted against the bill  bernie sanders  i vt   jeff merkley  d or   bob corker  r tn   kirsten gillibrand  d ny   patrick leahy  d vt   mike lee  r ut   rand paul  r ky   and ron wyden  d or  featured image via win mcnamee getty images
