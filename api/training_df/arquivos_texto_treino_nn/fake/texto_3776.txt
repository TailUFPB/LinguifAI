republicans are stooping to a new low when it comes to their disdain for civil disobedience and the bill of rights as anti trump protests continue across the nation over a week after the election  a republican lawmaker in washington state is drafting a proposed law that would label the protesters as  terrorists  and give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to charge them with  economic terrorism  according to fox   the law  would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets  cause property damage  threaten jobs and put public safety at risk  state senator doug ericksen  who proposed the legislation  insists that he  respects  the right to protest   but when it endangers people s lives and property  it goes too far  fear  intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression   he continued   those who employ it must be called to account  breaking the law would be considered a felony and would apply to any protester who is accused of trying to  intimidate or coerce private citizens or the government by obstructing economic activity  and  those who fund  organize  sponsor or otherwise encourage others to commit acts of economic terrorism  accomplices may be required to pay restitution up to triple the amount of economic damage  we are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism   ericksen said   we are going after the people who fund them  wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle class jobs  in other words  republicans are literally trying to classify acts of civil disobedience as  terrorism  in order to ruthlessly put down the mass protests against their fascist leader of course  if hillary clinton had won the election  republicans would not being saying the same thing about right wing protests  even if those protests included acts of bloody violence that trump supporters threatened to use if trump had lost  somehow  they believe rebellion and armed government coups are patriotic  but they consider civil disobedience an act of terrorism as doug honig of the washington aclu explained  if this kind of law had been in place during the protests against segregation  every black person who sat down at a  white s only  lunch counter to protest discrimination would have been charged with committing terrorism  that s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need   honig explained   let s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as  disrupting business  and  obstructing economic activity   and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to  coerce business and government  so this is the latest strategy republicans are looking to employ to silence people who disagree with them and it would drastically restrict the right to protest to the point of elimination  but again  this law would not apply to right wingers who openly protest through displaying or using firearms in order to scare and intimidate  this law is solely aimed at protesters who disagree with them  it s the very definition of political retaliation and is the beginning of a concerted republican effort to rip up the constitution and replace it with fascism featured image  spencer platt getty images
