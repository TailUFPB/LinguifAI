donald trump is absolutely livid that the crowd for his presidential inauguration crowd yesterday was so pathetic and small  like his hands  in comparison to the massive turnout for former president barack obama s two inaugurations he started throwing a temper tantrum yesterday  and it s continued into today as the women s march on washington drew massive support from around the world  making history as the largest  most widespread protest against a president the resistance to his presidency has bothered trump so much that he went off on the media in a speech at the cia  claiming that the media has been lying about his shamefully low attendance numbers  despite the fact that many americans witnessed just how any empty the inauguration was through live footage  trump is still trying to convince everyone that the media is dishonest  he s gotten so desperate for approval and attention that he actually put photos of the  crowd   comprised mostly of his own vips  in the white house press briefing room in a sorry attempt to show that people actually attended his big day  however  one of trump s main targets in the press has just hit back cnn  a network that trump has called  fake news   ran a segment on trump s ridiculous claims by talking about trump s cia speech  jim acosta  a cnn reporter that trump had attacked recently  explained trump s numerous comments to his colleague  jake tapper  after the long list of childish remarks and behavior was finished  tapper couldn t have been more hysterical as he completely deadpanned and said  i can t think of anything more important to the american people  the moment was so awkward and perfect  that cnn closed the topic completely   and that s what hurts trump the most  nothing makes him more upset than when attention is taken away from him  you can watch this moment below featured image via screenshots
