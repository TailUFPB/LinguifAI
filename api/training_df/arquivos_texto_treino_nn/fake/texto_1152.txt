the golden state warriors just clenched the  nba champions against the cleveland cavaliers  they fought hard in the   series  winning the title monday night in their home city of oakland  the following morning they decided to do something almost as amazing golden state decided in a unanimous decision not to go to the white house and meet with donald trump  which is customary for the winning team to do each year this is the second nba championship for golden state in the past three years  as well as the third consecutive finals series against cleveland when the warriors beat the cavaliers in the finals back in   they attended the customary celebration ceremony at the white house and were honored by former president barack obama  last year  the cavaliers took part in a similar visit this isn t the first time american sports champions have refused to attend the customary white house visit under trump  many players on the new england patriots did not visit trump after their super bowl win due to political reasons the golden state warriors have yet to make any statements about why they made this decision  but it s pretty obvious  what better way to use your fame and influence than to let trump know how dissatisfied the people are  america is choosing to celebrate its biggest victories without him  go warriors photo by thearon w  henderson getty images
