donald trump wanted to celebrate power like a dictator  but the military rejected his demands we ve all seen how north korea and russia put on big flashy military parades in a desperate effort to get attention and brag about how tough they supposedly are  american presidents  however  have never really done that  trump wanted to be the first apparently  trump and his team wanted tanks and missile launchers to roll down pennsylvania avenue as if to threaten his critics and political opponents while trying to convince everyone that he s tough and doesn t have small hands thankfully  our military responsibly rejected trump s idea in favor of giving him a rare military flyover instead according to huffington post during the preparation for friday s transfer of power  a member of trump s transition team floated the idea of including tanks and missile launchers in the inaugural parade  a source involved in inaugural planning told the huffington post   they were legit thinking red square north korea style parade   the source said  referring to massive military parades in moscow and pyongyang  typically seen as an aggressive display of muscle flexing the military  which traditionally works closely with the presidential inaugural committee  shot down the request  the source said  their reason was twofold  some were concerned about the optics of having tanks and missile launchers rolling down pennsylvania avenue  but they also worried that the tanks  which often weigh over   pounds  would destroy the roads  military aircraft will fly over the inauguration on friday doubling as a training exercise so that trump s ego can be stroked just enough to keep him happy such flyovers are rare  president obama did not ask for one and the only president before ronald reagan to get one was harry s truman  who oversaw the end of world war ii but what trump was asking for is literally something that dictators in north korea and russia do so the fact that trump wanted to be like kim jong un or joseph stalin does not help his tyrannical image at all here s video of a north korean military parade via youtube seriously  trump wanted something very similar to this  are you scared yet  america featured image via screenshot
