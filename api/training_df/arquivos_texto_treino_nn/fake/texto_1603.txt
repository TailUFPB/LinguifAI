jared kushner is an orthodox jew working in a white house surrounded by neo nazis  but he s also the son in law of donald trump  so principles be damned  now  kushner is normally a reasonably handsome man  if you like the boyish white collar criminal type  but lately it seems  he s been channeling some of his father in law s worst qualities  including  bizarrely  his hair  which he s been wearing in that famous trump combover swirl whatever the hell that thing is i think we re in big trouble now  for some reason  jared kushner has started styling his hair like donald trump   pic twitter com   mike sington   mikesington  april    and the kids bring treats out to the secret service https   t co tmtsunqxzi pic twitter com   daily mail us   dailymail  april     obviously  has their theories  squeegeesink  mikesington ivanka wants him to look like her dad  yeah i went there   a   amatorah  april    mikesington ivanka wants him to role play daddy  nqcowboy     april    mikesington  annanotherthng i had a terrifying thought  what if ivanka chose the style  because the weird fascination and inappropriate relationship is a  way street   pic twitter com   loryn kilpatrick     april     mikesington well  he s in charge of everything i m sure his hair is falling out and a weird combover is necessary  sad  sheila h garland     sheilaginhb  april    mikesington  gillyarcht the right posterior oblique partline  combined with an anterior pushthrough  is classic emerging authoritarian  pic twitter com   alan   gammacounter  april    mikesington i ve heard of being  groomed  to take over  but this is ridiculous   monica a    stillsheresists  april    see something a bit more calculated  mikesington mimic the narcissist  that is how you rise in power  that is how you stay in power  trump will notice   limp ego will get momentary rise   snohomo   snohomo  april    s entirely possible that kushner chose this new look to impress his father in law  although he was made the de facto president with his old hair  so he had clearly already made the right impression more likely  this hairdo was trump s doing  despite the fact that trump is a one man what not to wear  ties too long  suits too big and that hair      is obsessed with what everyone around him wears  kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of trump s  stylist  which is located across the street from trump s new york residence  it s not tough to imagine him telling kushner to get  the trump  on a subconscious level  though  this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss  it s about a full makeover  which with kushner  includes his principles featured image via win mcnamee getty images
