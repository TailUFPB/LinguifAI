donald trump s presidency may be going great for him and his best friend vladimir putin  but his daughter s bottom line is really taking a pounding from his authoritarian policies  yes  daddy s little girl was likely hoping   like the rest of her family   that she would be able to use her father s position to make a lot of money  but things aren t working out quite that way nordstrom was recently targeted by the  grab your wallet  campaign  which encourages people to avoid shopping at any stores that do business with the trumps  bloomberg reports that the department store chain has elected  like other businesses  to stop selling ivanka trump s brand this season based on abysmal sales  whether this was because every single one of her products  like every member of the trump family  save barron  is terrible  or because of the boycotts cannot be said for sure  but in any case  her products have already disappeared from the retailer s online store  some products will remain on the shelves for now  but they will be gone as well  in this case  based on the brand s performance  we ve decided not to buy it for this season   the company said in a statement  grab your wallet co founder shannon coulter says she is  thrilled  with nordstrom s decision to drop ivanka trump  though some trump supporters are threatening their own boycott if nordstrom drops ivanka s sh tty merchandise  they can t expect much sympathy from the company  in an email to employees  co president pete nordstrom said that the concept of  if people don t buy it  we won t sell it  applies in this situation though the company says the decision is sales driven  it is entirely possible that they just want to distance themselves from ivanka  who has already attempted to use her father s presidency to push her products  her company sent a  style alert  to journalists monday promoting a bracelet that ivanka wore during an interview with   minutes  about her father   a clear sign that the trumps know nothing about avoiding conflicts of interest as donald trump continues to threaten to send troops to mexico  f ck up diplomatic relationships with countries that have been our strongest allies since world war i  waste our tax dollars on his stupid wall  and attempt to discriminate against an entire religion solely based on his own bigotry  we can expect his daughter s brand to continue to suffer   as well it should featured image via boston globe
