as if donald trump isn t paranoid and delusional enough on his own  one of the people who carries a lot of influence with  is one of the most certifiably insane  in my amateur opinion  people to ever hit the airwaves  rabid right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones  jones is now advising trump to use violence against those who oppose him  and the frightening thing is  trump could listen on his youtube channel show on monday  jones fed into trump s ridiculous conspiracy theory that his offices were wiretapped by president obama and i feel so sorry for people that can t see it  that have been caught by this weird demon spirit of the age  to just go along with evil and corruption and just thank god  mr  president  that we re not the scumbag obama  the loser of eight years  the failure  now who thinks he can be the big community organizer down the street from you  who brags it s his plan to bring you down  then the new york times acts like it s not true  codify the data each day  go after them with their own words  hold up where they admit they were wiretapping your trump tower and then show the new york times saying they re not doing it  just like you have been doing it  and they will fall there were even more paranoid rantings  but the bottom line was that trump should kill all his enemies before they take him down they re going to destroy you  they re going to destroy barron  they re going to destroy eric  they re going to destroy donald jr   they re going destroy me  they re going to destroy matt drudge  they re going to destroy ron paul  they re going to destroy anybody like  stephen bannon that actually stood up for the little people  because that example can t be allowed  because if you let one ant stand up  they might all stand up  and those little ants outnumber the parasites  to one  if they want a war  let s let them have it  now they re getting their ass kicked in the economy  your approval ratings are going up  sir  they don t care  they re going to intimidate and pay off and roll people in your second level operation to try to burn you  you must go on the offense  this is war  you think george washington kicked the redcoats  ass just with information  no source  media mattersthen  with no irony at all  he accused trump s opponents of being funded by the russians here s the audio most people would just dismiss jones s words as the rantings of a lunatic  which they are  but trump loves jones  along with breitbart  where trump got the wiretap story to begin with  and other assorted right wing sources  jones is one of the people trump relies upon to get information featured image via alex wong getty images
