less than  hours after trump claimed he would be exclusively blaming democrats for not endorsing his bill to uninsure  million people  he was lashing out at republicans instead  he just couldn t help himself the meltdown began last night as trump used his twitter account to promote fox news  jeanine pirro s saturday night show  when people tuned in  they saw pirro go on a vicious assault against paul ryan  demanding he step down as speaker of the house  trump  apparently too much of a coward to say it himself  wants you to know how much he hates paul ryan the next morning  his temper had only gotten worse  not leaving it to paul ryan  trump lashed out at conservative republicans for not properly supporting the bill democrats are smiling in d c  that the freedom caucus  with the help of club for growth and heritage  have saved planned parenthood   ocare   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    tweet was particularly awkward because it was disturbingly true  yes  democrats are smiling following the disastrous trumpcare misfire  things like planned parenthood and obamacare provide life saving resources to tens of millions of people  preserving those things is something worth smiling about  the fact that trump and paul ryan humiliated themselves in the process only makes those smiles a little broader msnbc s lawrence o donnell observed i m smiling at you attacking the people you need on your next vote  please keep doing this  please  https   t co   lawrence o donnell   lawrence  march    s latest meltdown   directed exclusively at republicans   signals the sheer chaos that s rippling through the gop following their healthcare fail  the implosion was so spectacular that nobody seems to be able to agree on a coherent message  trump  for his part  has oscillated between  i m not mad   and spittle laden fury  he may have even found a scapegoat  reince priebus source close to  potus says he s being advised to replace     is open to possibility   healthcare was last straw  tara palmeri   tarapalmeri  march    if anyone is squarely to blame for the gop s failure to repeal and replace obamacare it s trump himself  who spent a truly embarrassing lack of time on trying to accomplish it  here s a typical write up of trump s involvement in the legislative process despite the proclamations of paul ryan  sean spicer  and others to spin trump s participation in the ahca push as some impressive feat of presidential prowess  several reports indicate that trump was mostly disengaged from the process  divided over its merits  and only involved himself at the last minute  largely out of ego the perception among lawmakers and white house insiders was that trump was never personally invested in the bill  repeatedly asking aides if they thought it was good or not  typically prompted by the consistently negative media coverage of the bill that trump was watching  according to the washington post many people  some even close to the president  admitted that they didn t believe trump actually knew what was in the bill the fact that he s now using his own shoddy leadership as a pretext to go to war with his own political party is music to any liberal s ears  this is a man whose ego is so large that he would rather burn every bridge he has than accept the fact that he botched the rollout of a complicated bill through incompetence and indifference  instead he s incoherently lashing out at anyone he can think of  democrats  paul ryan  reince priebus  the entire republican party what a piece of work featured image via alex wong getty images
