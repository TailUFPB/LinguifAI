with every new detail revealing itself about donald trump s administration  the humiliation that america is enduring is getting harder and harder to stomach  we have never seen an administration fail so hard from the start  and just when it seems it can get no worse  trump sets a new precedent  the latest detail in trump s white house will have americans more disappointed than ever before apparently  the morons in the trump administration are so incompetent and lazy  they aren t even able to choose top officials correctly  vanity fair just reported a very disturbing detail about trump s china adviser  who was sought out by the potus  son in law  jared kushner  kushner chose this adviser not by interviewing experts  like a normal person   kushner found trump s china adviser by searching amazon  vanity fair wrote at one point during the campaign  when trump wanted to speak more substantively about china  he gave kushner a summary of his views and then asked him to do some research  kushner simply went on amazon  where he was struck by the title of one book  death by china  co authored by peter navarro  he cold called navarro  a well known trade deficit hawk  who agreed to join the team as an economic adviser   when he joined  navarro was in fact the campaign s only economic adviser   kushner operated in much the same way when it came to crafting trump s tax plan calling up someone for help out of the blue  given the initial absence of pros who could do the job properly  he also tried his hand at writing speeches  responding to criticism from the boss   jared  this is terrible     kushner said  according to a person familiar with the episode   i m not a fucking speechwriter  i am a real estate guy  the idiocy being displayed here is mind boggling  kushner  who at least has the sense to admit that he s way out of his league and he s just  a real estate guy   is the person trump has put in charge of basically everything  the same man that s looking for advisers on amazon let s not forget that this idiot is the man in charge of bringing peace to the middle east  with this amount of incompetency in the white house  it will be a miracle if the united states can get through trump s presidency without a major crisis  although we re already getting pretty close to one after trump s attack on syria and afghanistan  and his inflammatory comments toward china and north korea if anyone thought that jared kushner and ivanka trump were going to being the check and balance for trump  this report certainly crushes that hope  even the most level headed people in trump s administration are dangerously ill equipped featured image via scott olson   getty images
