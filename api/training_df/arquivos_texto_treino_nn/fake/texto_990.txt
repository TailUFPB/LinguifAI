watching the healthcare bill he staked his entire presidency on flame out in the senate seems to have broken trump s brain  within  hours  he was on twitter having a spittle laden meltdown over the negative coverage he s been receiving  two articles   one by the new york times and the other by the washington post   seem to have pushed him over the edge first  there was the new york times  which found a number of senate republicans willing to call him a moron senate republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with mr  pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the  primaries  and some of the white house s efforts have clearly been counterproductive then there was the washington post  which discovered that trump had photoshopped a picture of himself onto the cover time magazine and hung it in his golf courses the framed copy of time magazine was hung up in at least five of president trump s clubs  from south florida to scotland  filling the entire cover was a photo of donald trump  donald trump  the  apprentice  is a television smash   the big headline said  above the time nameplate  there was another headline in all caps   trump is hitting on all fronts       even tv  but that wasn t true the time cover is a fake there was no march     issue of time magazine  and there was no issue at all in  that had trump on the cover so trump being trump promptly lost his mind the failing  nytimes writes false story after false story about me  they don t even call to verify the facts of a story  a fake news joke   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june     amazonwashingtonpost  sometimes referred to as the guardian of amazon not paying internet taxes  which they should  is fake news   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    s attack on the washington post was particularly insane  not just because he seemingly invented the term  guardian of amazon   but that he demanded amazon pay a non existent  internet tax    the price for amazon s owner also owning the washington post  it s how a particularly nasty dictator in a particularly nasty banana republic might behave  hate the message  go after the messenger and everyone the messenger associates with  it confirms much of what trump s critics have been saying  trump is at war with the free press how will the administration defend trump s meltdown  by hiding  sean spicer ran into the metaphorical bushes  quickly releasing a  revised  press briefing schedule that demanded no cameras be allowed to film white house briefing today  off camera with  presssec pic twitter com   jeremy diamond     june    it comes down to it  even sean spicer seems to know that the president s actions and comments are indefensible  he s banking on the fact that if he isn t filmed  perhaps history will forget his humiliating role in this administration featured image via alex wong getty images
