is there some reason people like donald trump and his most ardent fans can t handle problems without making threats  sean hannity is publicly threatening someone after tweeting that he s been talking to lawyers about  libel  slander  defamation  tortious interference   as an alleged journalist  he really ought to know what those words mean and not throw them around he s also doing quite a bit of posturing about it  up to and including issuing this threat oh fyi  whoever you are just remember  ip addresses are traceable  get ready   sean hannity   seanhannity  may    on that tweet assume he s referring to his sexual harassment accuser  debbie schlussel  however  this tweet suggests he s talking about whoever it is he thinks  the traitor  is at fox news this is way way way bigger than any one individual  https   t co ervdrmudee  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    recently gave an interview to vanity fair  in which he defended embattled co president bill shine  who has been caught up in the sexual harassment investigation into fox news  in it  he said there was a traitor at fox news  and claimed to know who it is  after bill o reilly s ouster amid a sexual harassment scandal  people began saying that  they  were going to come after hannity sure enough  schlussel came forward saying that hannity had been creepy with her  hannity has repeatedly denied that he was even remotely inappropriate with her  and he and his followers seem to think that she s either an active participant in some grand conspiracy to shut down fox news  and indeed  conservatives in general  entirely  or a pawn that  they  are using to take down every conservative there is honestly  he sounds too much like trump  dropping saying on twitter that he s got all this information and hinting that it could blow something wide open  since he s a television personality  it s a little more likely that he s actually got something on someone  or a lot of someones   but then again he really does sound like trump blowing hot air and this could wind up being a huge nothingburger he shut down before he  said too much  to his twitter audience  and is now simply saying   stay tuned   so he s hinting that he and his  team  are going to bust something wide open  because the scandal at fox news can t possibly be a culture fostered by serial harasser roger ailes  and probably other serial harassers   could it featured image by gerardo mora via getty images
