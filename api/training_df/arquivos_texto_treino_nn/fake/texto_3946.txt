republican nominee donald trump definitely has the worst surrogates out of anyone who has ever run for president  they can barely keep their stories  lies  straight  and have a really difficult time talking positively about their candidate at this point in the race  after his campaign as been riddled with scandals  lawsuits  and sexual assault allegations something absolutely ridiculous happened today on twitter when former arkansas gov  mike huckabee decided to make a case for why trump was the better candidate for president  as expected  this pathetic attempt at some trump praise went horribly wrong when huckabee referred to trump as a  car wreck    but at least one that s  pointed in the right direction   huckabee tried to argue that this was better than clinton  who he described as  a drunk driver going the wrong way down the freeway  twitternot only is the metaphor problematic   as the former presidential candidate is already saying that trump has ruined everything in a crash   but it didn t take long before twitter users tore the metaphor and huckabee s reasoning to shreds twittertwittertwittertwitterhuckabee s weird compliment is so reminiscent of what happens with many of trump s surrogates  another former rival turned supporter  ben carson  has become infamous for giving trump back handed compliments  and as trump s campaign continued on  we witnessed trump s supporters having a more difficult time defending the business mogul s erratic behavior and insane statements huckabee   and many other republicans that continue to support trump   know that he s an absolute disaster for the gop  but they d rather stay loyal to their party and worry about the supreme court than actually do what s best for america  huckabee called trump exactly what he was in his tweet   a wreck   and any goper who is aware of this and continues to support trump is as unethical and spineless as he is featured image via christopher furlong getty images
