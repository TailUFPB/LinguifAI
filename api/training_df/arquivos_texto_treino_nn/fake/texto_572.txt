as more time passes after the violent riots related to the white nationalist rally that took place yesterday in charlottesville  virginia  americans become more and more disappointed by donald trump and his failure to denounce white supremacy one very noteworthy criticism of the racist commander in chief comes from none other than the vice mayor of charlottesville  who blasted trump in an interview with cnn s wolf blitzer today  vice mayor wes bellamy stated that his community has come together in solidarity to fight against the white supremacists and neo nazis who were responsible for riots that resulted in the death of a counter protester  and while trump has continued to pretend he has no connection or responsibility for the riots  bellamy directly called him out and held him accountable in the interview  bellamy stated that if white supremacists under the guidance of their president  number   returned to charlottesville  the community wouldn t hesitate to drive them back out  he said  they can continue to come  but our community will not break  the people here of charlottesville  white people  black people  yellow people  old people  young people  we re a community that rallies around together  this is a community that i saw pick me up on my darkest and deepest moments to encourage me   and they ve done the same for other people  we re a resilient group  bellamy then spoke directly to trump  pointing out that he has the responsibility to condemn white supremacists  which he still has not yet done  bellamy said  so   we re looking for your leadership  condemn that white supremacist attacks  condemn these domestic terrorists  tell them to leave  you re their leader  stand up  it was the perfect message to send trump  and he will look even worse if he ignores bellamy and fails to respond  hopefully  trump will start acting like a leader and speak out against these attacks you can watch bellamy shred trump below featured image via screenshots
