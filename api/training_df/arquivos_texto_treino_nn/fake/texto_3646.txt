north carolina governor pat mccrory lost his re election bid to his democratic challenger roy cooper three weeks ago  however  mccrory is trying every trick in the book to re install himself as governor for another term against the will of the people of the state  one of those tricks is alleging widespread voter fraud  and mccrory filed several complaints in that direction now  remember   the north carolina board of elections is run by republicans  not democrats right now  therefore  one would think this would give mccrory an edge in his crazy attempt to overturn this election by any means necessary  but not so  even his republican colleagues are sick of mccrory s nonsense  and they made the decision to toss his ridiculous voter fraud complaints  these complaints were designed to make it appear that people who were not eligible to vote had indeed voted  thus costing him the election  however  the board of elections said to get rid of the complaints that merely disputes the eligibility of a voter  here is the response from roy cooper all of this comes on the heels of obvious voter suppression efforts on the part of the north carolina gop  the complaints filed by mccrory include the  counties in the state where the north carolina gop at large started purging voter rolls  accusing people of voting without being eligible  despite this  the gop elections officials are still going against mccrory mccrory needs to concede  cooper now leads him by more than   votes and counting  the people of north carolina do not want him to be their governor any longer  instead of accepting that  he is whining and stomping his feet like a child  he s embarrassing himself  his state  and his republican colleagues  this guy is like north carolina s own donald trump in a way   too childish and prideful to admit when he s wrong  if mccrory continues this nonsense  he should be forcibly removed from office when his term is officially over featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
