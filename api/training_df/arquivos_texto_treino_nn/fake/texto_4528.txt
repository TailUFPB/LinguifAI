donald trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country  the city of new york recently ended  stop and frisk   but trump is pushing for it  apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate  former new york city mayor rudy giuliani  from politico in a pre taped interview on fox news scheduled to air wednesday night  trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address  violence in the black community  and  black on black crime   trump responded by proposing that  stop and frisk  policing  in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband  be adopted nationwide  i would do stop and frisk  i think you have to  we did it in new york  it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and  you know  you really help people sort of change their mind automatically   trump told the questioner stop and frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by new york city residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and latino residents  they were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers  in what some felt were quotas set up by police management when the city stopped using stop and frisk  they did not see an increase in crime  despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity  most people who had been subject to stop and frisk were let go  because they hadn t done anything wrong former us district court judge shira scheindlin  who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court  described it as  destructive  in an interview with buzzfeed  she added  in short  the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police  cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it  featured image via flickr
