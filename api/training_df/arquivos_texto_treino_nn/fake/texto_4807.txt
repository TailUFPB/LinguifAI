boy  wasn t wednesday an embarrassing day for donald trump  not only did the low energy gop candidate almost sleep through his joint press conference with our neighbor to the south s president  but he managed to get caught lying about wall negotiations  and  of course  he s been  repeatedly hammered by president enrique pena nieto as he continues to lie about their encounter all in all  trump s decision to stop by for a photo op in mexico was a humiliating experience both for him and america as a whole   but more for him  as his temper tantrum about brown people that he thought was a policy speech managed to lose him numerous members of his national hispanic advisory council  the amount of fail involved in this operation is almost enough to make one s hair stand on end the internet has noticed something else that might be a little more embarrassing for him than the rest of his failure of a trip  based on his history of going insane over his hair  he forgot to take the bobby pins out of the wet albino muskrat that functions as his hair before stepping onstage here  have a closer look  o k   what i do is wash it with head   shoulders   trump once told rolling stone when asked if he has a combover   i don t dry it  though  i let it dry by itself  it takes about an hour  then i read the papers and things  ok  so i ve done all that  i then comb my hair  yes  i do use a comb  do i comb it forward  no  i don t comb it forward   trump continued  i actually don t have a bad hairline  when you think about it  it s not bad  i mean  i get a lot of credit for comb overs  but it s not really a comb over  it s sort of a little bit forward and back  i ve combed it the same way for years  same thing  every time  one thing that was missing from that explanation was the existence of bobby pins if trump can t be honest with us about his hair routine  how can we know he s telling the truth when he says brown people are coming to kill and rape us  or his tax returns are unimportant  or that he has the very best people who will do the greatest things you can see it in this video  if you hate yourself  trump bobby pins by dailypoliticsfeatured image via screengrab
