donald trump has called himself a patriot many times  yet according to recent investigations he didn t donate a penny to   charities  despite claiming otherwise  that definitely doesn t seem very patriotic mr  billionaire trump promised to donate    to a major   charity  yet the money was never received  to a billionaire     is pocket change  so why didn t he actually give it to the charities  is he really that greedy  leave it to trump to make a scene  order more fame and attention  only to have made the whole thing up ny daily news says city controller scott stringer conducted a review of hundreds of pages of previously sealed records of the two main   charities at the request of the daily news  and found that trump and his charity hadn t donated a dime in the months after   it s not unlike trump to want more public attention and create whatever lie necessary for that attention  however  even for a pig like him  this is a bit too far not until april of    while running for president   did donald trump actually donate money to a   related cause  during his first visit to the september  museum memorial he made another grand scene while donating    dollars to the museum  this time the money was actually received  but we can safely bet it s only because of how much attention is on him this goes to show donald trump is only  charitable  when it suits him  and it s not even really charity   he s buying publicity  not donating money  in his view  he s always been a lying  scandalous pig  yet now could quite possibly the next president of our country  let s make sure that doesn t happen come november photo by drew angerer getty images
