donald trump s paranoia and desperation to keep the american people in the dark just took an unconstitutional turn for weeks  various news outlets have obtained inside information from white house sources such as memos and descriptions of what is going on behind the scenes  that s how we know about what executive orders trump is considering and how we know about the chaos and infighting that has been plaguing trump s administration  it s also how we know more about trump s russia scandal rather than address his executive orders or the chaos in the white house or his russia scandal  trump would rather whine about the leaks instead the real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of washington  will these leaks be happening as i deal on n korea etc   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    is being illegally given to the failing  nytimes    washingtonpost by the intelligence community  nsa and fbi   just like russia  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by  intelligence  like candy  very un american   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    know what is really un american  forcing your staffers to hand over their phones for an inspection according to a report by politico  white house mouthpiece sean spicer actually confiscated the phones of his staff to go through them in order to make sure they are not leaking any information to the press of course  if someone had refused to hand over their phone they would have more than likely lost their job so they definitely didn t volunteer to give their phones up  they had to do it out of fear the staffers were called to an  emergency meeting  and told to place any electronic device they had on them on a table  including personal cell phones  so they could be searched but the constitution specifically bars such illegal searches and seizures the fourth amendment states  the right of the people to be secure in their persons  houses  papers  and effects  against unreasonable searches and seizures  shall not be violated  and no warrants shall issue  but upon probable cause  supported by oath or affirmation  and particularly describing the place to be searched  and the persons or things to be seized  in other words  if trump really thinks the leaks are  illegal   he should have to get a warrant to search the phones of his employees  but he didn t  which means his search is illegal and in violation of the constitutional rights of his staffers  trump and spicer can hardly call the confiscation voluntary either since many of these staffers probably believed they would be fired if they did not hand over their phones  that means they were forced to do so  and they can file a lawsuit for having their privacy violated once again  donald trump and his team are violating the constitution  republicans in congress cannot continue to allow trump to trample our constitutional rights  it s time to investigate and impeach him  because at this rate  he ll literally be ripping up the constitution if he isn t stopped featured image via win mcnamee getty images
