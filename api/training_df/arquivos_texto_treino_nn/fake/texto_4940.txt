donald trump is making a lot of money thanks to the donors giving money to his presidential campaign  and it s all legal  even though trump s actual wealth is still a secret thanks to his refusal to release his tax returns  he is required by law to submit annual spending reports on the behalf of his campaign to the federal elections commission the latest filing from the trump campaign shows a new way that trump has found to make money  and it comes directly from those who believe he should be president and are giving them his money trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at trump tower to    in july  when he was raising funds from donors  compared with march  when he was self funding his campaign  according to a huffington post review of federal election commission filings  the rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in july than he did in march the trump campaign paid trump tower commercial llc    in march   the same amount it had been paying since last summer   and had  paid employees and consultants  in july  it paid  employees and consultants the filing is the latest piece in the ongoing mystery that has bedeviled campaign observers  trump is bringing in millions of dollars  but so far has barely spent any money on advertising or basic campaign infrastructure like field offices in key swing states  instead  as this filing shows  trump has funneled a lot of the campaign dollars right into his own pockets by using trump businesses as vendors to the campaign what ends up happening is that the array of trump businesses ends up sucking up all the money that donors think is going to a political campaign like his other businesses that went belly up   trump steaks  trump water  trump university  the trump taj mahal and various other real estate projects   trump profits while the investors  and now donors  are hung out to dry featured image via flickr
