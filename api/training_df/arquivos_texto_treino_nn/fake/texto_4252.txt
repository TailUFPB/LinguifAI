eric trump  one of donald trump s two creepy adult sons  tried on monday to defend his father s revolting comments about sexually assaulting women  his pathetic excuse  that s just what happens when  alpha  males get together and start talking the younger trump followed the narrative that has been put forth by everybody else in his daddy s campaign  it s no big whoop  it s just locker room banter   and besides  it s the clintons who we should really be talking about  i think that s hillary going low   eric trump said on tuesday   i think you ve seen that for a long time  if you look at her track record with women  i think you saw that yesterday with some of the people we had sitting at the debate  it s horrible  she ll dig out dirt on someone from  years ago when someone is in entertainment  and  listen  my father apologized for it  he was right to apologize for it  and i m glad he apologized for it   he continued   at the same time  if you look at her track record with women  it s horrible  it s absolutely horrible  nevermind the fact that there isn t one shred of evidence that the clintons were behind the release of the bombshell  p ssy  tape eric added that he was completely  surprised it came out  at the same time  i think it s locker room banter   he said  repeating his father s description of it   i think sometimes when guys are together they get carried away  and sometimes that s what happens when alpha personalities are in the same presence  at the same time  i m not saying it s right  it s not the person that he is  so  there s nothing to see here folks  ignore that my father will soon be sitting before a judge after being accused of raping a  year old child  forget that he nags out with the likes of proven sexual predators like jeffery epstein and roger ailes  he s just an  alpha  male and all  alpha  males  brag about sexual assault featured image via joe raedle getty images
