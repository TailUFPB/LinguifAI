in a more innocent time  say    you d be hard pressed to find a person willing to call dick cheney a voice of reason   except perhaps  when talking about his daughter s right to marry the woman she loves   but in a speech at the economic times  global business summit  he appeared to be just that  only in his very neo con way  cheney called russia s meddling in the  election an  act of war  there s no question that there was a very serious effort made by mr  putin and his government  his organization  to interfere in major ways with our basic fundamental democratic processes   said cheney   in some quarters that could be considered an act of war  i would not underestimate the weight that we as americans assign to russian attempts to interfere with our process   said cheney  finishing the thought source  business insiderfeeling a little conflicted  who can blame you  for nearly  years  dick cheney has been itching to go to war with nearly anyone he can find  on the other hand  he s right  there is no more blatant an act of war than interference with our election  even cheney is saying that trump is likely an illegitimate president  and this is a man who only held his office as vice president because the supreme court overturned the will of the people of course  the problem with that is that the constitution has no mechanism for dealing with another country stealing our election  we can  however  impeach  which might not put us in a much better position  could donald trump s election be nullified by some legal process  if it was found that either the russian interference could be deemed decisive in accomplishing trump s victory  or that trump and his team have somehow contravened the u s  public interest through a treasonous relationship with the russians  article ii of the united states constitution states in section  that  the president  vice president  and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for  and conviction of  treason  bribery  or other high crimes and misdemeanors  source  midas letterthis  apparently  is exactly where we are  while the smoking gun might still be classified  it s becoming increasingly apparent that there is a smoking gun there are several smoking guns  all covered with the fingerprints of trump and his associates while this might be just another case of cheney banging the war drums  he s still right  russian interference was an act of war and while it shouldn t be addressed with bombs and boots on the ground  it should be addressed featured image via ethan miller getty images
