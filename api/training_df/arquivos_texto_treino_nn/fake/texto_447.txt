believe or not   moderates  do exist in the republican party  to those of us on the left  they hardly seem moderate  but they certainly aren t like  say  the ted cruz s of the world  in the house of representatives  they even have a name  they call themselves the tuesday group  and since donald trump took office  it has been republicans from that group who have been pushing back the hardest on trump s more extreme and cruel policies  to that end  it should come as no surprise that trump s band of trolls in his base are threatening the people in the tuesday group with primary challenges in  at the top of the trump trolls  list of targets is tuesday group co chair charlie dent  r pa   they re letting rep  dent know that his days are numbered in the most public of ways   by holding a huge event where they blasted their warnings to him from a park in allentown  pennsylvania  adam gingrich  who gives political advice to hard right politicians said to dent  you re gonna get primaried  this particular rally is just the beginning  these people seem to be ready to primary anyone who has been critical of trump and his agenda from the right  there s just one problem with that  though  they don t seem to understand some of these districts  in a place like pennsylvania  ted cruz style policies will not fly  these people have to be more moderate than say  members of the ultra conservative freedom caucus or they don t get elected and re elected  there s that  and the fact that most of them seem to at least be attempting to appear reasonable  despite these facts  though  word has leaked out that trump himself went after rep  dent in a private rant  saying that dent is destroying the republican party  so  as they are likely to do  the trump trolls came out in force on friday in order to back their orange man up  northampton county gop chairwoman gloria  lee  snover said of rep  dent  i looked charlie dent in the eye and i saw the swamp  in times past  i ve supported charlie dent as the only alternative  but now  with his disregard and disrespect to my president   i will no longer be able to support congressman dent  for the first time  we finally are going to have primary challengers we can get behind  so  in other words  fall in lockstep with trump or get out  rep  dent  to his credit  is pushing back  though  he says of the situation  i have repeatedly made it clear that on issues such as reforming the va  making the regulatory environment more reasonable  improving america s infrastructure  providing necessary funding to help meet the needs of our military and spurring economic growth  i will work constructively and supportively with president trump  at the same time  i am not a sycophant  if the president errs on issues that are important to the people of the   or for the entire country  i will continue to state my opinions respectfully and civilly  the best part of this is that it could be a huge gift to democrats  pennsylvania is a swing state that  until   always went blue  therefore  the idea of a hard right conservative being elected there is pretty out there  we can t rule it out  of course  but if the gop spends all of its times fighting with itself and the democrats unify around one candidate  we win get it together  democrats  here are a whole bunch of seats we could possibly win simply because trump trolls can t abide a gop lawmaker who isn t licking trump s boots   featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
