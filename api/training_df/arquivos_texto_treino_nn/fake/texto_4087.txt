if donald trump goes down  so does house speaker paul ryan at least that s what trump supporters are suggesting in an attack on ryan on breitbart com  whose ceo steve bannon works on the trump campaign an article posted on breitbart accuses ryan being a hillary clinton supporter who has a pro islamic agenda simply because he has been critical of trump and some of the things he has said and done throughout the campaign ryan and clinton share a progressive  globalist worldview  which is at odds with trump s  america first  approach  indeed  both clinton and ryan have said that they see themselves as representatives not only for american citizens  but also for foreign nationals and foreign interests  this view that the needs of foreign citizens are equal to the needs of american citizens reflects the belief that americans are only part of many interest groups that a lawmaker ought to consider when crafting legislation even as he or she negotiates with other countries  which always put their citizens first  the divide between progressive globalism and nation state conservatism perhaps helps to illuminate why ryan has spent months both quietly and loudly undermining his own party s nominee for president   the article continues of course  saying that paul ryan is in league with hillary clinton is absurd  after all  ryan may be one of the less openly insane republicans but he s definitely not a progressive but conservatives are so enraged at ryan for not blindly pledging allegiance to trump that they are now calling for his head  which means paul ryan is in serious jeopardy of losing the tight house race he is embroiled in  and even if he wins on november   ryan faces a revolt from conservatives against him continuing to be speaker  that is if republicans keep control of the house either way  paul ryan is being undermined by trump and his minions  so it continues to be a mystery why ryan still hasn t unendorsed him conservatives are even questioning ryan s loyalty to america and to the party the push to remove ryan as speaker is  picking up some steam   said congressman mark meadows who also voted for ryan last year after leading the charge to remove ryan s predecessor  john boehner  as speaker  meadows explained that a lot of conservatives now  question the loyalty of the speaker  in light of ryan s treatment of trump frankly  republicans only have themselves to blame for this  they gave their far right conservative base a place at the table and now these extremists have taken over the party  for years  republicans used fear and hate to gin up their base against democrats  now that anger is being turned against any republican who refuses to bow down and kiss trump s ass trump has used the republican playbook against them  and the result is a once proud party descending into chaos and tearing itself apart from within featured image  mark wilson getty images
