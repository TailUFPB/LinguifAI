donald trump is fuming over the size of his little inauguration last weekend  not only did his inauguration have embarrassingly low attendance numbers when compared to barack obama s previous inaugurations  but it was also completely outnumbered by the women s march  which was a protest against him trump has tried to make his inauguration look less pathetic by having his team spew lies  despite the fact that photographic evidence clearly shows that almost no one went to see him get sworn in as the  president of the united states  while trump continues to soothe his monstrous ego on twitter  his political opponents are having the time of their lives mocking him   and what democratic senator jeff merkley just did was the perfect way to troll someone like trump at the confirmation hearing for rep  mike mulvaney  r sc   trump s pick for director of the office of management and budget  merkley forced mulvaney to humiliate trump in front of everyone by showing side by side photos of trump s inauguration and obama s  inauguration  to make things even worse  merkley asked mulvaney to publicly state which inauguration crowd was bigger faced with the evidence and a room full of peers  mulvaney was forced to admit what trump and his team wouldn t  that obama s inauguration crowd was bigger  merkley then tied it all together  making sure to state his point in mocking trump  he said  the reason i m raising this is because budgets often contain varied deceptions  you and i talked in my office about the  magic asterisk   this is an example of something where the president s team  on something very simple and straightforward  wants to embrace a fantasy rather than a reality  you can watch this beautiful moment below later  merkley made sure mulvaney got the point by calling on him to give actual budgets instead of the  alternative facts  trump s team has become well known for this was absolutely brilliant  and we need more senators calling trump and his team out for their lies  they need to be held accountable  and this was a great way to do it featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
