one of the things that happens when one runs for president is the fact that the united states secret service and other intelligence and security agencies begin to protect that person and his or her family  if said family is that of the elected president or vice president  that protection becomes the expense of the american taxpayers   no matter where those people are  in the case of donald trump becoming president elect  that means that new york city is now paying astronomical amounts of money to protect the trump family  this is especially expensive  seeing as how the trumps  prior to the donald running for   and eventually winning   the presidential election  lived in a golden glass tower in the middle of new york city s fifth avenue  which is one of the busiest streets in the world well  one person is sick of trump being able to milk the taxpayers of new york city   a city that in no way voted for him   for huge amounts of money and even more inconvenience to protect him and his family and their staff in the fifth avenue version of a palace in america  new york city police department deputy commissioner of intelligence  john miller  is sick of the trumps bleeding a city that can t stand the guy and his family and didn t want them in the white house to begin with  and he doesn t want the people of new york city footing the bill on this one  miller says of the chaos and money trump is causing the city  we went down to washington and we described those costs to our congressional delegation from new york  they got it immediately  but congress has failed to pass a budget again  and to get funding for this  they had a continuing resolution  we asked them to add   million to reimburse new york city for   they came up with a figure of   million  which covers a piece of the overtime but not the rest of it  miller continued on  saying that new york city is  obviously disappointed   with the idea of protecting trump via taxpayer dollars in a city that clearly despises the man  miller continued  we really won t be able to gauge the long term costs  john  until we know  is he coming home every weekend  featured image via drew angerer getty images
