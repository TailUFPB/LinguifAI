as our current administration continues to prove that it has no actual concern for the working class  it s hard to image why trump is supported by anyone other than the rich  the white house s current budget proposals put support for the poor  sick  and elderly on the chopping block in favor of tax breaks for the wealthy  besides being economically unjust  wouldn t these slashes in services be against the christian obligation to charity  why do evangelicals stand strong in their support for trump the fact that trump is a seemingly odd choice for political leadership among evangelicals has been debated since he first announced his bid to run  the prevailing explanation for their support is that evangelicals merely tolerate trump because they care about fighting abortion lgbtq and therefore the preservation of their religious freedom but why the support for tax cuts over the assistance for those in need  according to an article by religion dispatches  it s about more than just toleration  the huge budget cuts are part of the religious right keeping up their understanding of a  biblical worldview  and are an important part of its agenda according to  sphere sovereignty    a theory of how the bible rules every aspect of life   god has given authority to men in government  but this authority has very limited roles  this view holds that man s role in civil government only allows for property protection and criminal punishment  according to this view  it is the families job to help the poor  with some secondary help from the church  if tax money is used to help the poor it is seen as  tyrannically exceeding  the biblical authority of the government and is considered stealing this arcane position is held and popularized in some mainstream evangelical circles and articulated by radio host david barton  it s also taught in christian school curricula and promoted in books and conferences this view is the basis for many new administration policies  and the reason many of trump s appointees are trying to shut down the agencies they are in charge of  even the department of education is being led by a person who strongly believes that it s the families responsibility to educate children and that civil government should stay out of it trump himself probably doesn t hold these theoretical views  but mike pence sure does  and he s already making sure the  biblical worldview  is the basis for trump s policies photo by chip somodevilla getty images
