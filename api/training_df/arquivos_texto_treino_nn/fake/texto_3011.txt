president elect donald trump made another major mistake when he had the audacity to trash civil rights icon rep  john lewis  d ga  just two days before martin luther king day it all started because lewis said what many americans were thinking when he stated  i don t believe donald trump is a legitimate president   and trump couldn t hold back his little orange fingers and gigantic temper tantrum  he tweeted  congressman john lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district  which is in horrible shape and falling apart  not to mention crime infested  rather than falsely complaining about the election results  all talk  talk  talk   no action or results  sad  the clueless former reality television star got absolutely gutted on twitter for this  and rightfully so  unfortunately  his moronic supporters are defending him   one of them being cnn conservative political commentator and radio host ben ferguson  who bashed lewis  comments and called them  unprecedented   ferguson said  i can t imagine the fallout  the backfire that you would have if a republican ever implied that about barack obama or bill clinton or jfk or anyone else for that matter  anyone in their right mind not only knows that lewis is right  but that trump is a moron for criticizing the civil rights hero  cnn host poppy harlow was having none of it  and she immediately tore into ferguson and the republican party for complaining about the same things they did to president barack obama for the past  years  she said  ben  ben  ben  that s exactly what many republicans did  including the president elect for years questioning the legitimacy of the first black president  bringing up the fact that trump was a major voice behind  birther  conspiracy theories involving obama  harlow totally shut ferguson down by reminding him   the president elect did that to the sitting president for years  you can watch the pro trump republican get put in his place below featured image is a screenshot
