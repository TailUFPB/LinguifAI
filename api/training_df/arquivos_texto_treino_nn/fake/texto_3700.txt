megyn kelly s new book   settle for more   seems to have trump s fans in a tizzy  she doesn t paint him in a very flattering light  so obviously the book is politically motivated and she had no business writing it  let alone selling it on amazon  trump s trolls decided they would try to shut down  or at least depress  sales  and amazon decided they weren t having it at all  amazon pulled a ton of one star reviews that all came from a pro trump reddit  while usatoday reported early this morning that  percent of the reviews on kelly s book were one stars   at one point   percent of those reviews were one star ratings  there were more than  reviews total that came in over the weekend  which means that a lot of people were trying to kill the book s sales because they love trump and despise anyone who makes him look even slightly less than godlike these reviews consisted of things like  this woman is not a journalist   she is an attention seeker   she is also paid by the dnc to report fake stories that have no truth to them whatsoever  megyn kelly is getting paid by the dnc to report fake news  not hardly  but unfortunately  amazon does not require anyone to source their accusations when they leave a bad review another said  wow get over yourself  your  not that good    your treatment of newt and trump was inexcusable  the reddit forum that many of these reviews came from is simply called   thedonald   and now they re mad that they ve been shut down  one man known only as  tim from md  whined that over  one star reviews had been deleted  then he said  are we living in a free country anymore  trump is president  but she wrote the book certain that clinton would win  now the book and her shows and advertisers are getting boycotted  so apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted  and they succeeded  i m shocked  because that s totally what happened  while the publisher  harper collins  did contact amazon over the fact that these reviews had all the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit megyn kelly  her own attorneys may or may not have contacted amazon as well  whether that s what happened or not  trump fans have shown  time and again  that they re willing to force issues over to their liking simply by banding together it s ridiculous  while it s true that amazon has likely deleted reviews it shouldn t have all across their site  the problem of fake reviews designed to artificially inflate someone s reputation  or destroy something that a certain group of people can t stand  like conservatives who can t stand anything remotely resembling facts  was a major one and they did have to do something about it  when many of the reviews are all coming from one source  that s a pretty good sign that they aren t genuine reviews  plus  amazon didn t delete all of the negative reviews   just the ones that were obviously part of a concerted effort by trump trolls to destroy megyn kelly and her book if anyone needs to get over it  they do  as the one reviewer above stated  trump won  so what s the deal here  grow up  guys featured image by jemal countess via getty images
