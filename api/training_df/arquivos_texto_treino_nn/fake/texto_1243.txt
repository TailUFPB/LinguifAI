when then president elect donald trump held a press conference on january  to separate himself from his business ventures  he said   these papers are just some of the many documents i ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons   while standing next to a table stacked with manila folders  sure  the papers all looked blank and the media wasn t allowed to examine them  but his intentions were clear  they are not going to discuss  with me   trump said of his sons   again  i don t have to do this  they re not going to discuss it with me   of course  few believed a word of it for even a second  why should they  a shrewd  dishonest businessman who puts wealth  status and power over everything was weeks away from being sworn in as the  president of the united states of america once again  the doubters have been proven right  quite a few of them were republicans who truly didn t care or see a conflict of interests as they wanted a businessman in the white house anyway  but the thin veneer separating trump s presidency and his business interests is rapidly starting to crumble president trump s two oldest sons  donald jr  and eric  took to the morning show circuit this week to promote the latest budget accommodation in the trump hotels line  but that didn t stop them from weighing in on issues surrounding their father s presidency  while appearing on good morning america on tuesday morning  eric trump described the russian probe as the greatest hoax of all time   while his brother  donald jr   had some strong words for london mayor sadiq khan  saying that   maybe he should do something to fix the problem rather than just sit there and pretend there isn t one   just like their father  the pair also found time to bash the media the unsettling news is that  although the pair aren t technically breaking any laws  they are setting a new  unchartered precedent for future american leaders  it s hard to describe what they re doing in polite words   said mark foster  a lawyer who specializes in ethics at the firm zuckerman spaeder llp   if he   and this is a loaded term   if he gets away with it  then obviously he sets a new standard for future presidents   it s ok to do this   which i think would be extremely regrettable because it s never been the standard and it ought not to be the standard   foster continued   but if he does it and gets away with it  then  you know  what president down the road is gonna feel constrained not to set his own standards  there are no standards  in an interview with forbes magazine  eric trump claimed that he doesn t talk politics with his father   there is kind of a clear separation of church and state that we maintain  and i am deadly serious about that exercise   he said   i do not talk about the government with him  and he does not talk about the business with us  that s kind of a steadfast pact we made  and it s something that we honor  however  just like his father  it didn t take long for eric to contradict himself  when he admitted just minutes later that he gives the president business updates   yeah  on the bottom line  profitability reports and stuff like that  but you know  that s about it   he said  adding when asked how often   yeah  probably quarterly  funny  only one quarter has passed since trump was sworn in as president and what reason do we have to believe a son who is this close to his father   my father and i are very close   eric trump says   i talk to him a lot  we re pretty inseparable  this latest disclosure from trump s son that he s talking about these things is confirmation that the attestations that the president made back in january regarding there being complete separation are a sham   said alex howard  deputy director of the sunlight foundation  a government accountability and transparency nonprofit   look  i don t care what you say  money influences the way you think   he said   you know  i tend to think favorably of my clients because they pay me a lot of money  that s not a bad thing  it s just human nature   except if i were president of the united states  you wouldn t want people influencing my thinking by giving me money either directly or indirectly  you d rather i was thinking about the national interest  a spokesperson for the trump organization declined to comment  however  hopefully next time voters reconsider putting a businessman in the white house featured image via jeff vinnick getty images
