in the wake of yet another court decision that derailed donald trump s plan to bar muslims from entering the united states  the new york times published a report on saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes according to the article  back in june  trump stomped into the oval office  furious about the state of the travel ban  which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then  instead  he fumed  visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements it was then that trump began reading from a document that a top advisor  noted white supremacist stephen miller  had handed him just before the meeting with his cabinet  the page listed how many visas had been issued this year  and included   from afghanistan  a country not on the travel ban     from haiti  also not included   and   from nigeria  sensing a pattern yet    and trump expressed his dismay at each according to witnesses in the room who spoke to the times on condition of anonymity  and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article  trump called out each country for its faults as he read  afghanistan was a  terrorist haven   the people of nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of america  and immigrants from haiti  all have aids  despite the extensive research done by the newspaper  the white house of course denies that any such language was used but given trump s racist history and his advisor stephen miller s blatant white nationalism  it would be no surprise if a freedom of information act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with  it was miller  after all  who was responsible for the  american carnage  speech that trump delivered at his inauguration this racist is a menace to america  and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for  let s hope that more indictments from robert mueller are on their way as we speak featured image via chris kleponis pool getty images
