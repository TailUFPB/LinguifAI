it s still more than three weeks before the incoming trump administration is set to take office  but one member of his staff has already been forced to resign over an alleged sex scandal just two days after being chosen as trump s communication director  jason miller changed his mind about the job after it was revealed that he might be a philanderer  his excuse  of course  is that he wants to spend more time with his family the scandal broke  perhaps ironically and perhaps not at all  because another trump staffer tweeted hints at an affair  the new york daily news got screenshots of trump senior advisor  a j  delgado s twitter account  before the twitter account was deleted the first tweet congratulated miller and then  but then it got weird  congratulations to the baby daddy on being named wh comms director   she wrote in one now deleted tweet  the  version of john edwards   she wrote in another  referring to the disgraced ex democratic senator who fathered a child with his mistress  it s clear they need to be my top priority right now  and this is not the time to start a new job as demanding as white house communications director   said miller  whose wife is expecting their second child source  ny daily newshere s the video to be fair  a good old fashioned sex scandal seems absolutely wholesome compared to some of trump s behavior  not only is trump an admitted adulterer and an accused sex offender  he s blatantly thumbing his nose at the constitution with his conflicts of interest and with campaign improprieties this clearly also points to the fact that trump is not doing his due diligence when it comes to picking his staff  the president elect hasn t been vetted  which is frightening on its own  but congress can t do much about that fact  they can  however  put up a real fuss  if they so desire  about skeletons in the closets of trump s nominees  the fact that this came down over the christmas holiday  when few people are paying attention  shows how embarrassing this is to the incoming administration featured image via drew angerer getty images
