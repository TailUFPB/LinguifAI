it sounds like paul lepage just claimed that he was elected twice via a rigged system because that s the only real way he can honestly declare that maine is already in the bag for hillary clinton but that s exactly what the tea party maine governor said during a phone interview with wvom radio this week in defense of his buddy donald trump the republican nominee has been desperately trying to convince everyone that the only reason he is losing in the polls and will lose on november  is because the media and hillary clinton s campaign are rigging the election against him and lepage  whose own constituents in maine are calling for him to resign  believes him  i am not confident that we are going to have a clean election in maine   lepage said   will people from the cemetery be voting  yes  all around the country  the media and the democratic party want everybody to vote  whether they re citizens or not  lepage also said that he doesn t  think the elections in the state of maine or the united states are legitimate  unless voter id laws are in place everywhere those are pretty strong declarations  there s just one large problem  if maine elections are  rigged  by democrats  how the hell did paul lepage win in  it s a good question  and one that maine secretary of state michael dunlap posed in an email to the bangor daily news  maine has a proud history of full access for voters to participate in our elections   dunlap wrote   it s curious that the governor would question the integrity of a system under which he was elected twice  indeed  not only has paul lepage won in his state twice  he did so the first time when democrats controlled the entire state government  democrat john baldacci served as governor from  to   including during the  election that somehow swept lepage into office  in addition  democrat michael dunlap was also secretary of state at the time  furthermore  democrats had control of the statehouse as they had for four decades  so really  if democrats had been in the business of rigging elections  lepage would not be in office right now  he would have lost his race in  the fact is that voter fraud is incredibly rare in this country according to the washington post  a comprehensive study found that out of one billion votes cast between  and   only  cases of voter fraud were found in other words  america does not have rigged elections  so like trump  paul lepage would be better off shutting his big mouth featured image  cagle
