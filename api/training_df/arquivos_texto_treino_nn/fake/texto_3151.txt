a new report shows that we have at least  electors who were ineligible to cast their votes on dec    as a result  a nationwide  bipartisan legal team is preparing a    briefing for members of congress  who still have to certify the vote on friday  jan    this number would bring trump down from  to   making his election victory less than constitutionally legal republicans are absolute hypocrites   they only whine about election fraud when it looks like things aren t going their way  if things are going their way  then the votes are legit and any effort to prove otherwise is partisan bullshit  it s quite similar to how trump said he d accept the results of the election prior to nov     if he was the one who won  otherwise  look out  is what seemed to be his message as part of their electoral vote objection packet  an advocacy group known as americans take action tells congress in no uncertain terms that at least  electoral votes were not  regularly given or not lawfully certified   that number could actually be over   the group is non partisan   they have republicans as well as democrats and independents working on this they also have  attorneys  legal assistants and law students who prepared the brief pro bono to deliver to congress in a last ditch effort to get them to object to certifying the electoral college s votes  the illegitimate votes  according to the report  include two from arkansas  one each from louisiana  michigan and oklahoma  three from texas  and seven from north carolina the report also includes electors who were ineligible because they already held public office  such as florida attorney general pam bondi  who s suspect as it is given that she dropped a case against trump after he donated several thousand dollars to her reelection campaign  ryan clayton  of americans take action  an advocacy group that headed up the effort behind both the research and the briefing  said  trump s ascension to the presidency is completely illegitimate  it s not just russians hacking our democracy  it s not just voter suppression at unprecedented levels  it is also  there are republicans illegally casting ballots in the electoral college  and in a sufficient number that the results of the electoral college proceedings are illegitimate as well republicans like to talk all the time about people voting illegally  we have a list of a bunch of republicans that allegedly voted illegally in the electoral college  pam bondi is the attorney general of the state of florida and the florida constitution says that you cannot hold two offices  and she holds the office of attorney general and she holds the office of federal elector in the electoral college  that is a violation of the law  that is a violation of the constitution  and the vote that she cast in this election is illegal  this is a last ditch effort and we re sure everyone knows this  however  bringing this to the attention of congress is the least anyone can do  we cannot have an illegitimate election  whether it s by hacking from a foreign power  illegitimate electoral votes  or both featured image by alex wong via getty images
