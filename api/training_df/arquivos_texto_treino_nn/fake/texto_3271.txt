it s no secret that donald trump has some kind of boy crush on russian president vladimir putin  despite the fact that putin is nothing more than a dictator and a murderer  trump can t seem to find anything but good things to say about the guy  well  one cnn guest has absolutely had it with trump on that front  cnn host poppy harlow mentioned the fact that putin had tweeted about how the democrats were handling the unexpected november loss  repeating what trump had tweeted  vladimir putin said today about hillary and the dems  in my opinion  it s humiliating  harlow then went on to say  he is agreeing with vladimir putin on anything  it s just surprising given the russian relations  russian hacking  but that he is talking still about winning the election  the election he won  at a time  i mean  how many geopolitical issues were there in the last week that he could be tweeting about  that s when harlow s guest  washington examiner senior correspondent david drucker  piped up  vladimir putin is basically a quasi dictator  and he s busy lecturing an american candidate about how to lose with dignity  when the man doesn t actually win or doesn t actually lose  he just runs the show  he s the last person  i think you can make an argument here in the u s  we can all talk about whether clinton and her team post election can handle their loss properly  some believe they have and some believe they haven t  vladimir putin is the last person on earth that should be lecturing our candidates about how to lose with dignity  drucker is right  putin knows nothing of losing with dignity  because he just murders and jails people who go against him  he s not a real president  as we have in this nation  no matter how much i might have disliked any number of presidents we ve had  i certainly recognized and respected the fact that they were duly elected  and certainly none of them killed people to keep themselves in power  these are things putin knows nothing about  he would never be able to handle losing  which is why he will never allow it to happen  in the end  the biggest bullies are the real cowards  and yes that stretches to vladimir putin  that makes it all the more alarming that the incoming united states president admires such a man on this grand scale watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
