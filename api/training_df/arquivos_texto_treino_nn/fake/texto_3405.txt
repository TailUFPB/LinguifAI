just a few days ago  president elect donald trump concerned americans around the country when he stated that he didn t have to receive regular intelligence briefings more than once per week because he was  like  a smart person   that s right   trump only gets briefings once per week  and his vice president mike pence gets these briefings six times per week these briefings are so important that president barack obama  who has been running the country for eight years  still gets updated on a daily basis  so having someone as unqualified and stupid as trump turn these briefings down is really terrifying on wednesday  former cia director leon panetta pointed out the consequences of such ignorance when he stated that trump could be held responsible for any future terror attack if he continued to refuse more regular briefings  panetta said that trump s resistance to knowing what is going on in the world beyond twitter  can t last   i ve seen presidents who have asked questions about whether that intelligence is verifiable  what are the sources for that intelligence  but i have never seen a president who said   i don t want that stuff   if we endure another attack and the intelligence officials had indications or information regarding that attack and the president did not want to listen to that  for whatever reason  the responsibility for that attack would fall on the president  to refresh  trump s reason for not receiving more frequent briefings   which he confidently broadcasted on fox news over the weekend   was that they were repetitive and that he already knew about potential threats  trump said in a fit of pure ignorance  you know  i m a smart person  i don t have to be told the same things in the same words every single day for the next eight years  panetta  and the rest of america  pretty much  disagrees  the ex cia chief also advised that trump should get on board with what the u s  intelligence agencies are reporting regarding russia s interference in the u s  election   a claim that trump has denied and called  ridiculous   panetta said  when it comes to russian interference in our last campaign   intelligence agencies agree that russia is involved in that effort  i think the president would do well to say we ought to find out what russia s role was  we ought to investigate it and ensure that it never happens again  if trump is to increase the amount of briefings he gets  it s going to be because he s forced to   not because he thinks he actually needs them  trump is incapable of coming to terms with his excruciatingly obvious shortcomings  and it s going to backfire tremendously on america and its people featured image via brian blanco getty images
