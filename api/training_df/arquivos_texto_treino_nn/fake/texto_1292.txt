the right has been in a frenzy over comedienne kathy griffin s distasteful piece of artwork featuring donald trump s decapitated head  causing many to remember a simpler time when someone could literally threaten the president repeatedly and get invited to the next president s oval office to hang out ted nugent   a racist douchebag who sh t his pants to dodge the draft and once adopted a minor child so he could legally have sex with her   has repeatedly threatened and called for the deaths of  president obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton over the years as the right defended his patriotic expressions of free speech that totally weren t threats at all while one might expect nugent to shut up long enough to allow the vipers on the right to continue striking at griffin for her distasteful work of art  nugent isn t that smart  i ve never threatened to hang anybody  i ve never suggested anybody get hung  except the one time after benghazi  i recommended that hillary clinton be charged  arrested  tried and hung   the washed up rocker said in an interview on wednesday with far right radio host ben ferguson   what she did as secretary of state was certainly treasonous  and i stand by that  hillary clinton  of course  did nothing treasonous during her time as secretary of state or during any other time   but nugent s threats have been pretty graphic  we need to ride into that battlefield and chop their  heads off in november   nugent said of president obama during the  election    if barack obama becomes the next president in november  again  i will either be dead or in jail by this time next year   nugent s post calling for the government to be  cleansed  of obama and hillary with the help of mr  noose is still live  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    our unholy rotten soulless criminal america destroying government killed  americans in banghazi  period  what sort of posted by ted nugent on wednesday  january     who expects us to believe that his  year old son and possibly some of his other children can t tell the difference between a highly unrealistic mockup of his head  says that his children  are having a hard time with  griffin s rather unfortunate joke   but when nugent actually made threats  here s what he said ted nugent was obviously using a figure of speech  unfortunate as it was  it just shows the anger people have towards  barackobama   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    s interesting that trump and company were perfectly fine with actual threats  but can t take a joke fortunately  we may not have to deal with their bullsh t for much longer if our elected officials do their jobs though ted nugent once again renewed his call for hillary clinton s murder  the right only has the sound of tiny crickets chirping away to offer listen to nugent s interview below featured image via screengrab
