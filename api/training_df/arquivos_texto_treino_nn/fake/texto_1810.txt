in an interview with fox business that aired tuesday  donald trump responded to news that the fbi had successfully obtained a fisa warrant to look into his former advisor carter page by trashing james comey for not locking hillary clinton up  sure  clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything  but according to trump she is guilty guilty guilty  when jim comey came out  he saved hillary clinton  he saved her life  trump said  apparently forgetting that a certain letter from comey helped swing the election his way  when he was reading those charges  she was guilty of every charge  and then he said she was essentially ok  nevertheless  for some reason trump says he trusts comey to clear him with regard to russia trump also complained that he is understaffed because of  obstructionist  democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants   like  the law   in reality  the problem is that the donald isn t actually nominating people  democrats have only  obstructed  when there was a legitimate objection  like that the person worked with russia or is a white supremacist trump told fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused president obama of  tapping  his  wires  at trump tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the fbi for their illegal activities  many involving russia   while it is true that trump tower was monitored years ago  it had more to do with the russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below trump s penthouse than anything else  over  russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
