rather than making america great again  donald trump is making american business owners in florida go broke every time trump spends the weekend at his mar a lago resort in palm beach  it costs taxpayers   million  so far  trump has spent nearly every weekend there since taking office  and the price tag has eclipsed   million if trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace  he ll outspend president obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under a single year taxpayers are going to feel the burden of this  but business owners in palm beach are especially feeling the pain because trump s frequent visits are literally going to put them out of business if he doesn t stop because of the extra security  businesses in palm beach are losing tens of thousands of dollars every weekend  we re basically going broke   said a spokesperson on behalf of southern helicopter when approached for comment by nbc nightly news   we were not expecting him to come down almost every weekend  but that s exactly what trump is doing instead of working for the american people  trump would rather spend his weekends playing golf and throwing lavish parties  and that is taking a toll on the local economy as taxpayers in palm beach county have to pony up    million for extra security when trump is in town and just as trump stiffs his contractors when he owes them money  trump is stiffing palm beach county after they asked the white house to reimburse the massive costs stellar aviation group president jonathan miller told nbc that his business is losing    every weekend when trump is in town  he fears his business will fold if trump doesn t halt his trips soon here s the video via nbc this is yet another example of trump only caring about himself  he is selfishly vacationing every weekend at taxpayer expense and it doesn t matter to him that local business owners are struggling to remain afloat as long as he gets to party and golf nbc noted that trump promised to  rarely leave the white house  during the campaign  and pointed out his hypocrisy since he often whined about president obama s vacations so trump is a liar and a hypocrite who is making the local palm beach economy suffer americans should be outraged by this  how can trump claim that he is creating jobs when he constant vacations in palm beach alone are threatening to cause many people to lose their livelihoods  trump should be ashamed of himself and america should demand their wasted tax dollars back featured image via screenshot
