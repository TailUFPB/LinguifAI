on thursday  donald trump eased sanctions against russia s spy agencies following a phone call last week with brutal russian dictator and trumpfriend vladimir putin  details of the call have been scarce  limited to a vague  one paragraph statement posted on the white house website president donald j  trump received a congratulatory call today from russian president vladimir putin  the call lasted approximately one hour and ranged in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating isis to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including syria  the positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the united states and russia that is in need of repair  both president trump and president putin are hopeful that after today s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern many have been wondering why information about the specifics of the call has been so scarce  according to ian berman  vice president of the conservative leaning american foreign policy council  the reason is simple   trump turned off the recording  on wednesday  bergman said at a forum on russian turkish relations at the bipartisan policy center that  there was no readout of the trump putin call because  white house turned off recording    ilanberman   there was no readout of the trump putin call bc wh turned off recording    kremlin readout is very positive  bpcbipartisan pic twitter com   ilhan tanir   washingtonpoint  february    kremlin s clearly sanitized readout sounds very nice  if one ignored the fact that multiple intelligence agencies have confirmed that putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda campaign on trump s behalf or that he began receiving his quid pro quo when the donald eased sanctions against his spy agencies  according to a statement on the kremlin s website   both sides expressed their readiness to make active joint efforts to stabilise and develop russia us cooperation on a constructive  equitable and mutually beneficial basis  and  the sides stressed the importance of rebuilding mutually beneficial trade and economic ties between the two counties  business communities  which could give an additional impetus to progressive and sustainable development of bilateral relations  in other words  putin and trump talked about how our own fascist dictator intends to repay russia s leader for his help in securing the oval office while it is yet unconfirmed that the recording does not exist  it seems this is the case given the vague readout and the clear attempt to keep information from americans  if he did indeed shut off recording  why would he do that  there is only one answer   plenty was said that would be uncomfortable if the american people learned the details we as americans need to demand a full release of every call trump has had with world leaders  we need to demand answers   because we will not get them otherwise featured image via getty images win mcnamee
