saturday night live is having a high old time ruthlessly mocking the governmental train wreck that is the fledgling  incompetent trump administration  first  they returned alec baldwin to his role as trump  and re enacted his absolutely disastrous first two weeks in office  then  they debuted melissa mccarthy as white house press secretary sean spicer   specifically his bizarre meltdown where he scolded the press regarding trump s continuing obsession with having a smaller inaugural crowd size than president obama did mccarthy appeared in an ill fitting suit  much like the one spicer wore to tear into the press during his very first official appearance as press secretary  and yelled and screamed  and even swallowed bunches of gum  in a mockery of the report that spicer has a problem where he eats and swallows copious amounts of orbit cinnamon gum daily  as he does this  mccarthy spicer says  i m here to swallow gum and take names  when challenged by a reporter at one point  mccarthy spicer took out a super soaker gun and shot the reporter with water  the spoof even had mccarthy spicer pick up the press podium and attempt to attack reporters with it  the erratic press secretary insisted on apology from the press for how they are treating trump   and him  apologize to me  that apology is not accepted  this is hilarious  but it is also scary  considering how close it is to the person who is currently serving as the actual white house press secretary watch the clip below featured image via video screen capture
