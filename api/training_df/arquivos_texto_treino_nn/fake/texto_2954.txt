out of all the insane people who are part of trump s posse  former campaign manager roger stone has to win the loony prize  stone regularly immerses himself with full on white supremacists  during the presidential campaign  stone was so insane that he  was forced to  quit because of all the controversy surrounding him  apparently  he didn t want to upstage the candidate s own controversies  now he says he has been poisoned because he knows too much about russia  only it s not russia  he says  that s doing the poisoning on tuesday  stone appeared on conspiracy nut alex jones  infowars claiming that he had been poisoned with polonium  which is putin and the russian s poison of choice  however  stone is making the claim that it was congress  or something  that poisoned him  i became extremely ill  this manifested itself in over  days of high fever  delirium  night sweats  i had lesions on my chest and my face   stone explained to jones   the general consensus is i was poisoned  i was poisoned with polonium or a substance that has the characteristics of polonium and this made me exceedingly ill   stone s theory is that someone poisoned him because he has proof that russia was not behind the hacks of the democratic national committee and john podesta   this is about stopping the trump agenda   he said   i would blow the whistle on this whole bogus russian narrative that they just won t let go of  source  mediaitehere s the insane video he also tweeted about it yes  i believe i was poisoned to stop me from exposing the  russian hacking  lie  the congressional investigation  stonecoldtruth  roger stone   rogerjstonejr  january     doctors say i was poisoned   who would do such a thing   https   t co   roger stone   rogerjstonejr  january    this story sounds like a bad tom clancy novel  it makes zero sense since people knew of russia s involvement long before the election and if there was some vast anti trump  anti russia conspiracy theory  it would have come to fruition before trump won the electoral college  not after  the far more believable explanation is that stone  who nobody really gives a crap about  wasn t poisoned and that he s trying to hawk his new book featured image via spencer platt getty images
