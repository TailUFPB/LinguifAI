there has been a lot of social media speculation over what will happen if and when donald trump is impeached or he is forced to resign  the constitution  obviously  says that mike pence will be made president  pence  it s assumed  will be a slightly better alternative  while he s anti lgbt and anti woman enough to be the inspiration for the handmaid s tale  he appears to be just bland enough to be called sane not so fast  he might be sane  but if his latest move is any indication  he could be going down with trump and the rest of the people who are in bed with russia  he has hired his own lawyer for the apparent inevitability of appearing under oath the vice president s office said thursday that pence has retained richard cullen  a richmond based lawyer and chairman of mcguirewoods who previously served as a u s  attorney in the eastern district of virginia pence s decision comes less than a month after trump hired his own private attorney  marc e  kasowitz  to help navigate the investigations related to the russia probe  and a day after the washington post reported that special counsel robert s  mueller iii is widening his investigation to examine whether the president attempted to obstruct justice source  washington postof course  the act of hiring a lawyer in no way means pence is guilty  what we do know  though  is that pence knew from at least march that trump s fired national security advisor  general michael flynn  was lobbying for a turkish firm  yes  there is evidence that policy changed because of flynn s turkish ties  flynn had supposedly left that out when pence was heading trump s transition team the white house  though  sat on that information for  days before firing flynn again  hiring a lawyer does not mean guilt  but only three vice presidents have done so  richard nixon s vp  spiro agnew  hired one when he was under investigation for extortion  tax fraud  bribery and conspiracy  he ended up resigning  even before watergate al gore also hired counsel over questions about illegal fundraising  dick cheney hired counsel several times the significant thing to note  though  is that none of the vps hired counsel because their bosses were in trouble  they hired counsel because they were under fire  we can t be positive  but it s safe to assume that pence will soon be testifying  and not just for his opinions featured image via justin sullivan getty images
