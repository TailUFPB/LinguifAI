kellyanne conway tried to baffle george stephanopoulos with bullshit on monday morning and got her ass handed to her with facts donald trump s muslim ban has caused worldwide chaos as airports across the country are detaining and blocking people traveling from seven countries  including green card holders who are permanent american citizens  children  and the elderly  for some reason  trump and his team think these people are terrorism threats but the ban not only violates constitutional rights  it is absolutely wrong about the seven countries listed because none of them are responsible for any deaths on american soil and during an interview with george stephanopoulos  conway took a beating after she claimed that protesters against trump s ban don t know the facts  i see all these protesters   conway whined   i think if you actually surveyed them  they would probably get the facts wrong  they re being misinformed  stephanopoulos then unleashed devastating facts  pointing out that saudia arabia  egypt  and the united arab emirates were left off the list even though those countries were home to the   hijackers  trump mentioned   as a reason for the executive order  none of the deadly terror attacks in this country since   have been carried out by anyone from those seven countries  eighteen of the    attackers came from egypt  saudi arabia  the united arab emirates   there is no ban from that country  those countries also happen to be countries where president trump has significant business interests  so why weren t those countries included  conway responded by blaming president obama  claiming that obama banned iraqi refugees for six months but that s a lie because it appears there was only a delay in processing visa applications of iraqi refugees in response to an actual threat  but there was no ban like conway claims  stephanopoulos even pointed out the inaccurate claim and informed conway that there was a lot of media coverage at the time conway then whined about not getting bipartisan cooperation  which is quite hypocritical to expect since republicans refused to work with president obama for eight years  she also demanded that democrats and republicans collaborate with trump on his tyrannical agenda  which she called an  extraordinary accomplishment  i mean  donald trump has been on the job for  what  eight  nine  ten days  barack obama was here for eight years  the extraordinary accomplishments in just the first week truly are breathtaking  no reductive curating reporting  in my view  is helpful to the american public to understand  we re being very collaborative and very open  we would just like the same in return  here s the video via twitter watch   gstephanopoulos interviews  kellyannepolls about pres  trump s immigration ban  countries not included and comments from republicans pic twitter com uzcfvtunev  good morning america   gma  january    it wrong to wonder when a house is going to fall on this witch featured image via screenshot
