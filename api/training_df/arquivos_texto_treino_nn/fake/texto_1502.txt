agents within the fbi are worried that president donald trump may succeed in killing the probe into his campaign s ties to russia  the daily beast is reporting on what has happened at the fbi since james comey was fired on tuesday  they say that agents who are working on the investigation fear they will be transferred to other departments and that their work will be discontinued  comey  they say  was much more important to the investigation than many  who are outside of the agency  understand  while he may not not have actively been conducting the investigation  his active support helped it continue a former lawyer in the department of justice s national security department  carrie cordero  said  he gave the agents  the investigators  cover politically  he said   you go where the facts take you and i will handle the politics of it  i ll go brief the hill  i ll hold off the white house   he s the lineman in football  keeping everybody away from the guys that are trying to run or make the pass  he provided a cover for them to do what they needed to get done  one fbi source said  management in counterintelligence are insanely concerned  worried about the overreaching obstruction and political influence from the white house   what could the white house do to stop the investigation  one former fbi official says  they could slow down the investigations to a crawl  prevent charges from moving forward to doj for prosecution  or any other number of ways the white house could subvert these investigations   said a former fbi official who worked on russian investigations a former fbi official  who was in the counterintelligence department  said   you have to remember  these agents have families they need to support  the threat of being fired for doing their job is real here  and what about the testimony andrew mccabe gave before the senate that the investigation would continue   one congressional staffer said   literally who cares  nothing he said matters  he ll be gone  of course  gumming up the works and intimidating fbi agents are not the only two things the white house can do to thwart an active fbi investigation  they can make sure it hits a wall when it gets to the prosecutorial stage at the department of justice  whereas the fbi is made up of career law enforcement personnel  the department of justice is headed by a number of political appointeesformer assistant director of the bureau s criminal investigation division  ron hosko said   there are often frustrations in sensitive  important investigations that you end up with prosecutors either too few  who are unwilling to move forward at the desired pace  or too many and you turn every simple decision into a debate club and it slows progress  here  i think that is the pulse that you in the media and others ought to be keeping close to  what s the pace  are the investigators getting the prosecutors  support that they need  hosko added  prosecutors will sometimes start to debate and question every word in a subpoena and it tends to slow progress  and then you start to ask questions about is this because of something political  hosko concluded with  the orange blob in the wh doesn t care about anyone or anything he can t control  he s made that abundantly clear  all of this means that it is critically important to appoint a special prosecutor to look into this  it is more than clear that the trump department of justice cannot be trusted to handle this investigation  featured image via andrew harrer bloomberg via getty images
