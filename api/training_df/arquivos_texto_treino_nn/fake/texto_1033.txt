of all the media networks to expose donald trump  the last one america would expect it to be is fox news  the conservative network is a known favorite of trump s  and is possibly the only mainstream channel to continue perpetuating trump s lies and groveling at his feet   but the network has just aired an interview that contains some truly incriminating information according to legal experts  trump put himself in jeopardy and furthered the potential for obstruction of justice when fox host ainsley earhardt asked trump about his recent admission that he did not tape his conversations with former fbi director james comey  even though trump had previously suggested that he did  of course  trump took the bait like the idiot he is and incriminated himself without even realizing it  this was part of trump s response when earhardt asked him why he lied  i didn t tape and i don t have any tape and i didn t tape  but  when he found out that there may be tapes out there  whether it s governmental tapes or anything else  and who knows  i think his story may have changed  i mean  you ll have to take a look at that because then he has to tell what actually took place at the events  and my story didn t change  my story was always a straight story  my story was always the truth  but you ll have to determine for yourself whether or not his story changed  but  i did not tape  when earhardt congratulated trump for finding such a  smart way to make sure he stayed honest in those hearings   trump made it even worse  he replied  well  it wasn t very stupid  i can tell you that  according to bloomberg  trump s lies about the tapes could mean major legal woes for the undeserving potus  bloomberg reported the tweets targeting comey  could be relevant  to an obstruction investigation  even if the tapes don t actually exist  said julie o sullivan  a former federal prosecutor who worked on the team investigating bill and hillary clinton during the whitewater inquiry  it s basically trying to tell comey   don t say anything   said o sullivan  now a law professor at georgetown university everything that trump says now   whether it s on twitter or in an interview   can be used against him in the russia scandal  trump s ego got the better of him during this interview  and fox news unknowingly used it against him  trump basically walked into this one  and he only has his big mouth to thank  you can watch the interview below featured image via pool   getty images
