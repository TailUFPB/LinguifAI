it s no secret that the trump administration  and donald trump himself  sees itself as a victim of a malicious mainstream media  when all the media has been guilty of is reporting the truth and of simply asking questions about the many scandals surrounding the administration  now  it appears  the white house has taken the fight against the media to a brand new low  the administration that constantly complains about  fake news  planted at least one story with the intention of trashing a political reporter  that s libel it all began with a report in politico by annie karni and alex isenstadt on sunday  in which it was reported that amid a frantic search for leaks  spicer told his staffers to dump their phones for a  phone check   he also threatened his staffers with more problems if the phone check was leaked to the media  it was  spicer also reportedly made a deputy communications director cry within the communications office  the mood has grown tense  during a recent staff meeting  spicer harshly criticized some of the work deputy communications director jessica ditto had done  causing her to cry  according to two people familiar with the incident   the only time jessica recalls almost getting emotional is when we had to relay the information on the death of chief ryan owens   spicer said  referring to the navy seal killed recently in action in yemen ditto also denied the accounts   this is  percent not true   she said sunday after the incident was reported   sean and i have a great working relationship  soon after that story was released  an article appeared in the conservative washington examiner that smeared isenstadt  saying he laughed at the dead of the navy seal  the examiner article  of course  cited an unnamed source my goodness  this is obvious what s going on here  https   t co   steven ginsberg   stevenjay  february    he started laughing about that seal   said one informed official  also upset at politico s  insulting  description of ditto in the story as a  more junior spokesperson  the irony is rich from an administration whose leader  on the very same day this story was released  said he wanted to ban journalists from using anonymous sources  if you recall your history  nixon was taken down because of an anonymous source  it s an important tool in journalism  of course  there was that time trump accused obama of being foreign born because of anonymous sources who clearly never existed  i guess trump has a good reason to distrust anonymous sources since he lies behind them as for isenstadt  while he might have a great case for libel  there s no word yet as to whether he ll sue featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
