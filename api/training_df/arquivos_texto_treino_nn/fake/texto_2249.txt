donald trump s media supporters are working overtime this week trying to defend his wiretapping accusations against president obama on saturday  trump openly made the accusation on twitter without providing a single shred of evidence to back up his assertion  trump made the claim after reading a conspiracy theory on breitbart and even called for congress to investigate again  trump has provided no proof to support his accusation and an accusation without proof doesn t justify an investigation trump has had days to provide such evidence and has failed to produce any  but trump supporter kayleigh mcenany claimed during a panel discussion on cnn on monday night that trump has evidence that he will release sometime in the future  and she got totally owned for it by anderson cooper mcenany insisted that trump has evidence that president obama wiretapped trump tower  but cooper was quick to remind her that if that were true he would have released it by now and that it would be easy for trump to confirm whether his accusation is true or not simply by asking certain intelligence and law enforcement agencies  but we know this by now  the president could know this by now by picking up the phone if he really believed this and if he s really that mad about this  he can find out the information   cooper said   he s the most powerful guy in the united states  in the world  indeed  but fbi director james comey has already strongly shot down trump s accusation  and former national intelligence director james clapper said on sunday that he would have been informed had president obama ordered such a wiretap  whether legal or not cooper then dropped the hammer by pointing out that if trump really had evidence he wouldn t be demanding an investigation by congress  if he had that information  why is he saying that it s president obama who did this personally and why is he calling for a congressional investigation to find out when he could find out   cooper asked here s the video via youtube donald trump does not have evidence to back up his serious accusation against president obama  he knows that he is slandering him and is desperately turning to republicans in congress to help him manufacture proof that is nonexistent  if trump had any proof at all he would be screaming it out from the rooftops to prove that he was right  because he s too much of a narcissist to keep that kind of information to himself featured image via screenshot
