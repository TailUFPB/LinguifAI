as donald trump desperately continues trying to convince everyone that he has great leadership skills  president obama just scored a major ranking by historians after eight years of dealing with uncooperative republicans who tried to obstruct him at every turn  and still managing to give healthcare to  million americans while improving american prestige around the globe  reducing iran s stockpile of nuclear material  and relentlessly pursuing equal rights  president obama has been ranked  in leadership among all presidents in history  george washington  franklin d  roosevelt  and theodore roosevelt retain their top five status  while dwight eisenhower moves into the top five for the first time   according to the press release   former president barack obama enters the ranks for the first time in the number  position  notably  his leadership category ratings range from number  for  pursued equal justice for all   to number  for  relations with congress  historian douglas brinkley praised obama s ranking as  impressive  considering this is the first time he was even eligible to be ranked this news comes as trump s approval rating has imploded and currently stands at  percent amid chaos and infighting in the white house  whereas president obama governed with a calm mind and steady hand  trump has tried to govern through bullying and misinformation while being too thin skinned to handle even the smallest criticism foreign nations like russia and china are taking advantage of trump  or challenging him and his domestic agenda which has been nothing but a disaster in fact  trump is so bad that historians actually ranked george w  bush higher on the list than he was last year  george w  bush  has benefited somewhat from the passing of years  his ranking at number   is up three places from our  survey   the press release continued indeed  trump is so bad that many americans actually miss bush now this is a major achievement for president obama  who has spent his post presidency living it up while trump is busy putting out one fire after another and embarrassing himself on a daily basis  it s more than clear that president obama was a real leader  trump  on the other hand  will probably go down as the most inept and worst president in american history now we wait for trump to throw a hissy fit featured image by pete souza white house
