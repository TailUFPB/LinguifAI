just a few years after republicans shut down the government  then came so close to defaulting on america s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced  then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president  then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault  republican representative tom rooney had an epiphany  maybe  maybe the republican party is a joke it may seem obvious to some  but even republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the gop has a single good idea in years rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the gop had spent seven years promising to pass  from start to finish  the effort was a spectacular failure  the bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in  million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money  the bill s popularity hovered around    then the right wing section of the republican party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance  then trump demanded the gop prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened  the bill failed before it even got a vote  humiliating both trump and house speaker paul ryan republicans  including rooney  were shook  so much so that rooney began saying the one thing you as a republican are never supposed to say aloud as the prospect of a loss became more real on friday  the frustrations of gop lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over   i ve been in this job eight years  and i m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that s been something positive  that s been something other than stopping something else from happening   representative tom rooney of florida said in an interview   we need to start having victories as a party  and if we can t  then it s hard to justify why we should be back here  like many americans  it s slowly dawning on republicans that they really are the  party of no   obstructionists  haters  fanatics  but not lawmakers and rooney wasn t the only one  the healthcare bill implosion was so incredible that other conservatives were having similar thoughts gop aide on caphill   i m starting to think that while we re pretty good at winning elections  we re not great at the whole governing thing   alex roarty   alexroarty  march    not great at the whole governing thing  could very well be the official republican motto featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
