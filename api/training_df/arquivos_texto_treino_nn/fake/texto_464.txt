legendary journalist dan rather says that robert mueller s ongoing russia investigation has donald trump  seized with fear  speaking to msnbc on wednesday  rather explained that the investigation into trump s possible collusion with russia has trump scared out of his mind  donald trump is afraid  he s trying to exude power and strength  he s afraid of something that mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out  a political hurricane is out there at sea for him  we ll call it hurricane vladimir if you will  the whole russian thing  it s still pretty far out at sea  but each day   this hurricane  this political hurricane   is building in intensity  mueller s investigation has been steadily picking up steam  it was reported on wednesday that new york attorney general eric schneiderman is now working with mueller to take an even deeper look at trump s former campaign manager paul manafort former national security adviser michael flynn has also found himself under a microscope and has even tried to cut deals for immunity to flip on trump  so far  neither mueller nor congress  who is conducting their own simultaneous investigation  has taken him up on the offer  this is presumably because they don t need to let flynn off the hook in exchange for his testimony to nail trump s hide to the wall publicly  trump still claims that the investigation is nothing more than a  witch hunt   however  those close to him say that behind closed doors  trump has become increasingly distraught over the intensifying investigation into his shady russian ties trump should be afraid  very afraid  in fact  being terrified of what mueller may find is probably the smartest thing he has done so far  sooner or later  the truth is going to come out just like it always does  and when that finally happens  trump is going to be beyond screwed  it s only a matter of time you can watch rather s interview below  featured image via video screen capture
