it doesn t take a rocket scientist to know that having a russia u s  cybersecurity unit is the most backwards  moronic idea an administration could come up with   which is exactly why donald trump is encouraging it when trump introduced the idea earlier this month that russia would be working with the united states on cybersecurity   even though russia interfered with the election and is our primary digital adversary   americans across the country were outraged in a collective mix of disbelief and disgust  it seemed as though trump was purposely trying to throw his russian scandal in everyone s face  ignoring the severity of the entire situation  fortunately  director of the national security agency adm  mike rogers shares the feelings of many americans  and has publicly announced his disapproval of the cybersecurity project in response to trump s discussion with russian leader vladimir putin on the creation of an impenetrable cyber security unit  to prevent further election hacking and cyber threats  rogers stated at the aspen security forum in colorado that now  is probably not the best time  for a project like that  diplomatically stating the obvious  trump s plan is idiotic this is just the latest criticism trump is facing on the proposal   right after he announced it  trump was hit with backlash from several lawmakers  which forced him to flip flop on his proposal  trump later said  the fact that president putin and i discussed a cyber security unit doesn t mean i think it can happen  it can t but a ceasefire can   did  as long as people like roger continue speaking out and acknowledging that trump has a massive russian scandal that is currently unfolding before our very eyes  none of trump s ridiculous schemes to keep befriending russia will have any success trump has an extremely shady  problematic relationship with putin   one that has undermined our democracy as the kremlin s interference in the election has been confirmed by the u s  intelligence community  although trump keeps denying it   the fact that trump is having secretive meetings with putin and thrusting russia into join projects with the u s  should not be taken lightly  trump must be watched closely  and he needs to be called out accordingly featured image via alex wong   getty images
