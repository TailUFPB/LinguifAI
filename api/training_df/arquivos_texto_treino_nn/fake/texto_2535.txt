following michael flynn s resignation after he was busted lying about the nature of his conversations with the russians  donald trump came clean with america  he admitted that flynn had discussed sanctions during those conversations and pledged to launch an investigation into the full extent of his dealings with a hostile foreign power in some alternate reality  in this one  he threw a tantrum on twitter because he s a child  the real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of washington  will these leaks be happening as i deal on n korea etc   trump tweeted tuesday morning the real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of washington  will these leaks be happening as i deal on n korea etc   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    s right   the fact that we  the american people  found out that flynn had been colluding with the same government that hacked our election on trump s behalf and ran an aggressive propaganda campaign to discredit hillary clinton  is the issue  not that it was happening in the first place  not that trump fired the acting attorney general shortly after she warned him that flynn had lied  to trump  the real issue is that we are finding out what is going on ironically  he seems to be unaware that one of his guests at the mar a lago snapped photos of the guy carrying the  nuclear football  and named him on social media   or  of course  that all of his guests had a full view of secure documents as trump perused them over dinner by the lights of his minions  cell phone flashlights bannon   flynn used phone flashlights for trump read most secure n korea docs w waiters serving  maybe rs can scream more about hrc emails https   t co   gene sperling   genebsperling  february    verge recently published a video demonstrating how easy it is to hack a cell phone camera  the concern is a hot mic attack  in which a hacker uses the compromised phone to record private conversations  but as our demo showed  it s just as easy to compromise the camera  allowing the attacker to see whatever is in front of the phone   the publication s russell brandom writes in an article on the north korea dinner debacle   that s usually not as useful  provided the target doesn t physically hold up the phone and point it at sensitive intelligence documents  but here we are  in other words  the only problems are trump and his team  and the only concern of compromised intelligence lies with him and the people he selected to run our country into the ground naturally  americans reminded him who is the boss  realdonaldtrumpyour administration got caught breaking the law then lying about it flynn didn t lie to pence you lied to us   mikel jollett   mikeljollett  february     realdonaldtrump no

you corrupt prick   megarock radio   megarockradio  february    realdonaldtrump so you re saying flynn would still be there  but for the leaks  no  twitler  your tweet just became the real story        february    intercept notes that trump makes the lives of foreign spies so easy that they  must be bored  tommy vietor  a former national security council spokesperson for president obama  pointed to another vulnerability exposed by the scene at mar a lago  the possibility that waiters at the club  who continued dinner service during the discussion of north korea s missile test  could be recruited by foreign intelligence services for a clue as to just how easy that might be  consider that the palm beach post reported in december that mar a lago hires dozens of temporary foreign workers each year  using the federal government s h  visa program it was not immediately clear where the foreign workers at mar a lago come from  but another club in the area told members that workers hired under the same visa program come from romania  ireland  and south africa donald trump represents perhaps the greatest danger our nation has ever faced   and it is up to each and every one of us to oppose him in every way possible  resist featured image via screengrab
