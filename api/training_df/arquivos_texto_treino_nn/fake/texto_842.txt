imagine your boss or a client sends you an email informing you of a meeting  what do you do  do you read the entire email so you ll be prepared or do just guess and wing it  you d probably read the email so you re prepared  jared kushner  though  who is supposedly a very successful businessman  apparently just wings it   at least according to his defense in regards to the russian meetings kushner wasn t the original recipients of the emails that arranged the meeting at trump tower with the very clear agenda of getting dirt on hillary clinton  but he was forwarded the emails  now a source is saying he didn t read the part about the russians  despite the fact that the subject line read   re  russia   clinton   private and confidential  in the emails  the contact  a former tabloid reporter called rob goldstone  said the lawyer  natalia veselnitskaya  was a  russian government attorney  who could provide  very high level and sensitive information  as  part of russia and its government s support for mr trump  but a source close to the situation told buzzfeed that mr kushner did not read to the bottom of the email  missing out key words like  russian government  and therefore did not realise what the meeting was about source  independentoh  and the defense gets worse  according to the source  kushner only attended the meeting to talk about russian adoptions  there was no mention of russian adoptions at all in the email chain not coincidentally  donald trump s campaign manager at the time  paul manafort  also claimed that he was innocent because he didn t read the whole thing what makes it even more difficult to believe kushner is that he s already proven himself a consummate liar  he lied on his security clearance application  which is a federal crime featured image via pool getty images
