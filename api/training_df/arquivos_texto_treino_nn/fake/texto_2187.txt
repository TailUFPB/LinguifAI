trump and his twitter habit may be breaking federal law  especially insofar as misspellings and other stupid errors  because he deletes and then reposts as though he thinks nobody will notice  he should take a hint   we all notice   because of that  elijah cummings and  amazingly enough  jason chaffetz  sent an official letter of warning to trump about deleting his tweets because doing so could be in violation of the presidential records act chaffetz and cummings sent their letter to white house counsel don mcgahn  and said  president trump uses at least two twitter accounts  an official white house account   potus  and an account that predated his inauguration   realdonaldtrump   many of the messages sent from these accounts are likely to be presidential records and therefore must be preserved  it has been reported  however  that president trump has deleted tweets  and if those tweets were not archived it could pose a violation of the presidential records act  so yeah  they think the man that got elected to the white house is actively breaking the law with his twitter account  it s silly  too   they re asking mcgahn to provide any evidence there may be of white house staff receiving training on the pra  trump seems to think that a lot of the usual training white house staff gets is unnecessary  he s  like  a smart person  remember they re asking mcgahn to identify senior officials covered by the pra who have used personal email accounts to conduct government business since jan    they want names  and the names of alias accounts and other accounts used  along with a whole host of other information to demonstrate that trump and his staff are in compliance with the law speculation has been going around for awhile about whether trump deleting tweets is illegal now  forbes published a question from quora about this same thing way back in february  carter moore  a former congressional aide  said   very unlikely  but while i hate to be too lawyerly about it  it depends on the nature of the tweet and on how thoroughly he deletes it the only  out  that the president would have in deleting a tweet would be if the twet could be argued to be a record of  purely private or nonpublic character which does not relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional  statutory  or other official or ceremonial duties of the president  he went on to explain that the law puts responsibility for preserving records on the president  so the countless screencaps of trump s deleted tweets don t count as preserving presidential records the white house put an auto archiving system into place under president obama so that his tweets  and the tweets of other top officials  were preserved regardless of what happened  those tweets now belong to the national archives  that may well still be in effect  but it applies only to official white house accounts  it wouldn t archive tweets from trump s personal account  which he uses all the damn time now that congress is on trump s case about this  it ll be interesting to see what happens  or trump might tell congress to go fuck itself  because he s donald trump and you don t question donald trump featured image by alex wong via getty images
