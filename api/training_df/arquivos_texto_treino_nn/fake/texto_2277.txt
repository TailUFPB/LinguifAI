following a series of unhinged tweets from trump that accuse obama of illegally spying on him during the election cycle  the intelligence community and the rest of the country have been in an uproar  many are screaming for him to release his evidence or shut the hell up  and he appears unable to handle the growing scandal around him  but the fbi is doing something else  director james comey actually asked the justice department to publicly reject trump s claims or  put another way  comey just asked the doj to openly state that trump lied to the american people comey says that the claim is false and must be corrected  and he would know because it was his agency that sought the warrant authorizing wiretapping from the fisa court  the fisa court granted the warrant back in october  after previously refusing to grant it over the summer  comey is angry because trump s claims suggest that the fbi broke the law this is unprecedented   it s the fbi director issuing a public rebuke to a sitting president  the white house  however  isn t backing down because they don t back down on anything  once trump says something  the white house goes through all sorts of bizarre gyrations to back him up  we get that it s bad for white house spokespeople  aides and senior staff to contradict their boss  but this is ridiculous  this is something on which they should know better while the doj has yet to actually issue a statement saying anything at all  it seems that this is something trump can no longer handle  one of the rogue government accounts  rogue potus staff  says that trump actually seems to be traumatized by the unfolding scandal   he can t cope with it at all we re not making light of anything  potus seems actually traumatized by recent spate of russiagate coverage  he can t cope right now   rogue potus staff   roguepotusstaff  march    the end  it doesn t really matter if he s unable to cope with an unfolding scandal the size of watergate  or big enough to blow watergate out of the sky   he lied to the public  and the fbi and doj both need to publicly say so  along with including the recordings from the taps in their investigations photo of james comey by chip somodevilla getty images  photo of donald trump by jim lo scalzo   pool getty images
