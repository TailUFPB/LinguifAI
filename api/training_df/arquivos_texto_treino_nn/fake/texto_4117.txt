the only way that trump can talk about immigration  and immigrants  is in racist terms  for someone other than  well  someone in a position of power  it d probably be easy to explain his use of the term   bad hombres   as simple ignorance  maybe  with him and his racist tendencies  though it s not  and he proved that during the final presidential debate in talking about undocumented immigrants and the crime they re supposedly committing  he said  but we have some bad hombres here that were going to get them out  because that s what everyone wants  supposedly  what he misses isn t just that his border wall and deportation force plans aren t realistic   he also misses the fact that saying   bad hombres   is horribly racist  why is that using a culture s own language to attack them is inherently racist   hombre  means  man   in spanish  and specifically refers to  tough men   but using it against them like that is to demean the entire race and the entire culture trump doesn t care  though  he has a very long and well documented history of racism  he doesn t care what he says  but there he is  up on that stage  calling undocumented immigrants  bad hombres   for the purpose of painting latinos as inherently bad people that s not a u s  president featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
