walmart may be discontinuing the sale of black lives matter t shirts because a police union whined that the shirts hurt their precious little fee fees  but the need for the message exists nonetheless  on wednesday  an african american texas woman made the mistake of assuming the police would be on her side after she called to report that a white man choked her son  unfortunately  as happens too often in america  he just decided to brutalize her and her family instead of dealing with the situation she was reporting according to jacqueline craig  a neighbor put her  year old son in a chokehold after he allegedly tossed a piece of paper on the ground and refused to pick it up  now  a grown man assaulting a child is a serious issue  but you wouldn t know that by the  white  responding officers response  after craig explains what happened  the cop asks the dumbest question in the history of stupid utterances by police  why don t you teach your son not to litter  let s ignore for a moment that there is zero evidence that the child actually littered   that s just the justification used by craig s neighbor  the officer didn t ask  is your son ok   he didn t bother to do anything related to getting to the bottom of the situation  something about craig and her son caused the officer to decide that the boy was guilty  naturally  this didn t sit well with craig  he can t prove to me that my son littered   craig angrily told the officer   but it doesn t matter if he did or didn t  it doesn t give him the right to put his hands on him  why not   the cop asks as craig began to yell a bit  i mean   why not   for f ck s sake   the officer informed her that her lecture  pissed him off  and craig s daughter quickly stepped in front of her mother to calm her down because at this point it was clear where things were headed though it was clear to everyone including the officer  the girl had her back to him  that the girl did not pose a threat the cop did what cops do best these days and became unnecessarily violent  throwing  both craig and her daughter on the ground and pointing a taser at craig s head and wildly swinging the weapon around to aim it at lookers on as the video ends  the unnamed officer looks into the camera and tells the person filming   you re going to jail too  as he knocks the camera out of her hands here s a little tip for cops who protest until companies stop selling civil rights related merchandise  if you have a problem with that but refuse to condemn an officer like this  then you re part of the problem fort worth police department s internal affairs unit is currently investigating the  unusual arrest  of the women  the man who allegedly choked craig s son was not arrested  in fact  the officer never bothered to take a report on the incident from craig watch this horrific example of why  black lives matter  is needed below this mother reports to the police in fort worth that a grown man choked her son  in seconds  he is brutalizing her and her family  pic twitter com   shaun king   shaunking  december    image via screengrab
