trump and the house gop suffered a stunning defeat on legislation they promised would deliver better healthcare to millions  despite that promise being a lie  they pulled the trumpcare bill from the floor early friday afternoon  before getting a vote  because they knew it wouldn t pass  and that was absolutely humiliating for them but what may be more humiliating is what the american action network a conservative pac did on friday night   the exact same day the bill failed  during friday night basketball games  they ran television ads about the triumph of trumpcare over obamacare  saying the following  republicans are keeping their promise with a new plan for better hrealthcare  more choices and lower costs  putting doctors and patients in charge again  no more big government penalties or job killing mandates  they go on to explain that the tax credits contained within trumpcare would make healthcare more affordable  and that protections for people with pre existing conditions would remain in place  which wasn t necessarily true  and then they do something truly amazing  given that these ads ran long after all the drama from the bill s death had quieted down  watch one of these ads below why didn t they have these pulled  that just makes them look completely moronic featured image via screen capture from embedded video
