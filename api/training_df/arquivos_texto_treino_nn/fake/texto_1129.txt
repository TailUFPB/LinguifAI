rep  steve king  r ia  has been in the news constantly  and it hasn t been good  his most recent stunt will certainly raise eyebrows and even make people wonder if he wants to be re elected at all  because it is absolutely ridiculous and pathetic while many republicans were quick to blame the republican baseball shooting  in which rep  steve scalise and four others were injured  on democrats and liberals  king decided to take it a step further  reviving one of the most tired  played out traditions of the republican party  king blamed the shooting on former president barack obama king made these comments in an interview with simon conway on who iowa radio  where king actually had the nerve to accuse obama of  dividing  the country during his presidency  therefore causing the shooting  king s comments are seriously disgusting  and reflect a gop that is clearly out of touch with reality and ignoring the fact that it nominated the most divisive presidential candidate to lead the country   donald trump  king said  i do want to put some of this at the feet of barack obama  he contributed mightily to dividing us  he focused on our differences rather than our things that unify us  and this is some of the fruits of that labor  unfortunately  conway was more than happy to join in on the obama bashing  conway said  of course he also spent eight years telling us all how terrible we all are and what a garbage can america was and how unexceptional we all were  i agree  i absolutely agree with what you said  the gop has been blaming everything on obama for the past several years  and the fact that we ve had a new president for months now hasn t stopped them  king s comments are repulsive and incorrect  as he clearly cannot see the amount of division trump has caused in just a few short months in the white house  you can listen to king s interview below in contrast  at least republican congressman mark sanford  r sc  had the brains to recognize that trump has fueled a toxic political environment  and should carry part of the blame for the baseball shooting featured image via pool   getty images
