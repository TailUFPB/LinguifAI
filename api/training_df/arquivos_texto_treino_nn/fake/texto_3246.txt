donald trump just got burned for using twitter so much during an appearance on msnbc with lawrence o donnell  conservative radio host charlie sykes was very blunt about what he thinks about trump s intellect o donnell said that trump s tweets don t mean anything but mentioned that his tweets are causing concern because a single tweet about boeing caused its stock price to drop trump s use of twitter is causing anxiety among millions of americans  including conservatives  especially after he picked a fight with china and sucked up to russia while declaring his intention to expand america s nuclear weapons stockpile in what he terms a  new arms race  you just don t know   sykes replied   i mean  when does this jump the shark  i mean also  this is going to encapsulate  and this is really going to symbolize the quality of this man s thought  i mean  there was a time when we had presidents who read books  now we have presidents who write in one hundred and forty character messages  you know we once had presidents who were eloquent  who could rally the nation  but  you know  here is a president who does feel comfortable on twitter because i do think that that is the perfect venue for the quality of his thinking  and i think that that is going to be something that s going to be a defining element in his presidency  here s the video via msnbc in other words  trump is not smart enough to get his message across to the american people in more conventional ways  he would rather lazily use twitter and the  character limit  which allows trump to avoid providing details or evidence of his claims we all know that trump gets crushed whenever he has to debate someone in person or gets interviewed by a journalist who does their damn job but on twitter  trump presents his opinions as facts and attacks anyone who criticizes him  unleashing his deplorable supporters upon the people he targets but twitter is not a forum for critical thinking  and trump has demonstrated over and over again that he is not a critical thinker  he speaks before he thinks and often lashes out over the smallest slights or any other thing fox news bitches about in the morning americans are sick and tired of trump s reliance on twitter  they want real answers and they want details  not a meaningless blurb devoid of evidence and civility featured image  mark wilson getty images
