the woman that trump claimed he tried so hard to sleep  and admittedly failed to do so  is nancy o dell  who hosted the miss usa pageant in  and   trump spoke of sexually assaulting her in   but what many may not know is that he apparently tried to have her fired after that at the time  he said he didn t like the way she looked while she was pregnant  tmz reported  back in   that trump couldn t do that  o dell s contract was with nbc  not with trump  and he got overruled  o dell kept her job  and trump got to sulk in the background so the  official  reason for wanting to fire her was that he didn t like the way she looked pregnant  knowing trump  though  he was butthurt that she d spurned him and wanted to punish her for the audacity  this is the man that pretended to be a pr person to hype up his own prowess with women back in the early    after all trump claims he was just joking with billy bush on an  access hollywood  bus when the ahem disgustingly unfortunate comments about assaulting o dell were made  o dell was slated to host miss usa with bush that year  making this all the more terrible billy bush is now a co host of nbc s  today show   and is probably in some hot water  considering this is the third time he s given nbc problems  he issued an apology for his role in pushing sexual harassment and assault as something men can just do when they re famous  saying  i was younger  less mature  and acted foolishly in playing along  i m very sorry  yeah  younger and less mature totally excuses this  it also totally excuses trying to fire her afterward  trump s true motives may never be known  but it s highly suspicious  and knowing trump  it s because her rejection just rankled him and he had to put her in her place photo of donald trump by ralph freso getty images  photo of nancy o dell by david becker getty images  images merged by rika christensen
