whoa  the day after he fired now former fbi director james comey  donald trump did perhaps the dumbest thing a person under investigation for collusion with russia could possibly do  he gave highly classified information directly to representatives of the russian government  how classified  it s stuff we haven t even shown our allies the washington post reports that when trump met with russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and ambassador sergey kislyak  trump  went off script and began describing details about an islamic state terrorist threat related to the use of laptop computers on aircraft  i get great intel  i have people brief me on great intel every day   trump bragged to the russians according to a white house official trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the united states only learned through the espionage capabilities of a key partner  he did not reveal the specific intelligence gathering method  but described how the islamic state was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances  most alarmingly  officials said  trump revealed the city in the islamic state s territory where the u s  intelligence partner detected the threat the washington post is withholding most plot details  including the name of the city  at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities  everyone knows this stream is very sensitive and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the russians is troubling   a former senior u s  counter terrorism official who worked with team trump told the post  russia  armed with the information trump handed them  can now use it to identify the u s  ally or gain more information about intelligence operations  this is code word information   the official said   trump revealed more information to the russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies   one official tells buzzfeed that   it s far worse than what has already been reported  russia could identify our sources or techniques   the senior u s  official explained  i don t think that it would be that hard  to figure this out  if that partner learned we d given this to russia without their knowledge or asking first that is a blow to that relationship   the official said  adding that trump also informed the kremlin about defensive measures the united states has taken  i m sure kislyak was able to fire off a good cable back to the kremlin with all the details  the meeting  which occurred just after the donald fired james comey for requesting additional resources for the russia investigation  was off limits to u s  press  but trump allowed russian media in to take photographs  the white house readout does not discuss trump s decision to give away our nation s secrets to the country that financed and executed a hacking a propaganda operation intended to install him in the oval office featured image via screengrab
