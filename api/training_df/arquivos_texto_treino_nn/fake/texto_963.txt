blackmail is a crime  it s time to impeach donald trump despite a desperate effort by the white house to deny it  trump derailed those efforts by posting on twitter friday morning in response to a washington post story in which joe scarborough and mika brzezinski claim that trump tried to blackmail them in order to force them to apologize by promising to stop a national enquirer tabloid story about the pair if they complied with his demands  trump went on twitter and confirmed the whole thing watched low rated  morningjoe for first time in long time  fake news  he called me to stop a national enquirer article  i said no  bad show  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    problem for trump is that while he claims scarborough called him and he s the one who said no  scarborough has actual evidence to support his side of the story and he informed trump of that on twitter while calling him out for lying at the same time yet another lie  i have texts from your top aides and phone records  also  those records show i haven t spoken with you in many months  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  june    do you keep lying about things that are so easily disproven  what is wrong with you  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  june    trump not only lied again  he literally tried to use blackmail against members of the media  it s all the more credible since the owner of the national enquirer is david pecker  a longtime friend of trump s if anyone should be apologizing to someone  it s trump  what he said about brzezinski on thursday was totally deplorable and completely beneath the dignity of the office he holds as you recall  trump attacked the morning joe hosts for criticizing him earlier in the week by claiming that mika was  bleeding badly from a face lift  and that she is  crazy  i heard poorly rated  morningjoe speaks badly of me  don t watch anymore   then how come low i q  crazy mika  along with psycho joe  came    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    to mar a lago  nights in a row around new year s eve  and insisted on joining me  she was bleeding badly from a face lift  i said no   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    trump had to do is ignore their rightful criticisms  instead  he lashed out because he has thin skin and a vulnerable ego and made things worse by trying to blackmail them  that s the very definition of abuse of power this national circus has to be put to an end  trump s crimes in office far exceed richard nixon s during watergate  trump should be sitting in prison  not in the oval office featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
