in the first half of the debate  donald trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles  after peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that hillary clinton is too sick to be commander in chief  one must ask themselves why trump couldn t stop sniffling  is he sick  was he holding back tears  after being pummeled by clinton  howard dean  former head of the dnc and presidential candidate  has a more unconventional answer  he was on drugs dean  who is now a contributor for msnbc  tweeted last night notice trump sniffing all the time  coke user   howard dean   govhowarddean  september    supporters took to twitter to express outrage  completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against clinton and her stamina abilities  but hey  get offended when dean points out what could be the obvious  after all  trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system and considering he hasn t released any medical records  who knows what adverse effects drugs  if he does them  has done to his body and mental state of course trump denied he was sniffling  even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country  and the globe  and the republican nominee denies that he is sick  so that begs the question  what else could it be dean s assertion is just that   an assertion  it has no factual ground to stand on  but it is ironic to see how trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate  perhaps they  and trump  will think long and hard before trying to paint clinton as anything she s not if this debate showed one thing  it s that hillary came out on top and trump is not happy about it  why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior  howard dean is featured image via joe readle getty images
