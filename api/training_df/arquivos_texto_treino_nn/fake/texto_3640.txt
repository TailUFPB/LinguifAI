it was just a few weeks ago that president elect donald trump repeatedly attacked the cast of broadway show hamilton for giving a respectful speech about equality and diversity to his vice president  mike pence  despite the fact that pence was not offended and did not want an apology  trump railed against the cast for days  causing his rabid supporters to call for a boycott it turns out  trump and his supporters got a brutal reality check today  hamilton  the broadway show that trump called  overrated  in one of his tweets  just broke a record for ticket sales  guess the  boycotthamilton movement didn t really have the effect trump and his minions had hoped twitterhamilton shattered the broadway record for the most money made in a single week  selling    million in tickets  the last time any broadway show came close to this was in   when wicked sold    million in a nine show week  hamilton only had eight shows  and it still surpassed wicked  and that s not all  according to the new york times  whom trump also attacks regularly  this also happened   set a record for the highest premium ticket price charged by a broadway box office       although some people have paid more buying tickets from resellers  twittertwitterit just goes to show that although trump  pence and their moronic supporters want to set this country back several decades  that s not what the majority of the country wants  when the hamilton cast spoke about freedom  diversity  and equality  those are the values that resonate with most of us  the outpouring of support that hamilton has received since the  hamiltonboycott proves that the majority of the country does not agree with trump  after all  he lost the popular vote by millions  and his bigotry has no place in america featured image via alex wong and facebook
