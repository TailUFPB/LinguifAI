donald trump s biggest claim to fame  the apprentice and celebrity apprentice  were endangered last year when he revealed himself to be nothing but a horrible  childish bigot in presidential candidates  clothing  at that time  nbc fired him and began looking at who might replace him  and now they have their answer  along with a very insulting tagline nbc tapped arnold schwarzenegger to replace trump last fall  but made it official with a new promo they released over the weekend  it says  on the apprentice s youtube channel  brains  brawn and business acumen   we re building a better boss   ouch  that can be taken several different ways   the most obvious being that they think schwarzenegger s more rounded personality is a better fit than trump ever was that s insulting enough  however  nbc specifically fired trump over his comments about mexican immigrants last year  at the same time other companies cut ties with him for the same reason  so this could also be seen as a dig at him for what s proven to be his severe lack of even a modicum of professionalism pretty much anywhere nbc also won t bring trump back  even if he loses the election and comes crawling back on his hands and knees  nbc s entertainment chair  robert greenblatt  said earlier this month  no  he would never be back on  celebrity apprentice   as long as i m here  woe to trump if whatever new business ventures on which he embarks after losing in november fail  just like so many of his other businesses have failed rumors are swirling that trump may be using this election cycle to help launch his own television network  rather than making a serious run at the white house  however  trump steaks  trump vodka  trump university  trump taj mahal  and more  were all such dismal failures it s a wonder trump thinks he can even pull off a new business venture  despite possibly having help from roger ailes and steve bannon  a trump television network might fail just as hard oh  trumplestiltskin  his days of fame are numbered  and nbc is trying to make that number shrink  watch the promo for  celebrity apprentice  below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
