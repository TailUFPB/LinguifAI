it s hard not to feel that john mccain  after  years in the senate  is tired of it all  on tuesday  he made an admission that s sure to piss off mitch mcconnell  donald trump and the rest of the gop congress  and i m sure he doesn t care mccain was asked whether he was one of the few to see the super duper secret republican senate healthcare bill  his answer was  no   but that wasn t even the stunning part  and in a normal world  it would be a stunning admission   it was what he said next  even if it was an off the cuff joke  that really highlights the state of today s republican politics  no  he hasn t seen the bill and   nor have i met any american that has   he added  according to bloomberg   i m sure the russians have been able to hack in and gotten most of it  source  the hillmccain is not happy  he  and the rest of the senate  are expected to vote next week on a bill they ve never seen  note that these are some of the same people who say obamacare was rammed through congress with no debate  when in fact  the bill was debated and amended for over a year before becoming law  while the legislation was lengthy  every member of congress and every american would have been able to read it before its passage  this isn t the case with the bill put forth by the senate  which is presumably so bad that they re afraid to let even fellow republicans see it mccain s also not happy with the fact that russia is freely hacking into our government  even if trump isn t somehow complicit  he certainly doesn t seem to give a rat s ass about it nor does he want to solve this national security threat  instead  he pretends to bury his head in the sand  even if that s not collusion  that s a violation of his oath of office at least mccain  unlike most of his gop brethren  knows that even when you refuse to see  or show  evil  evil exists  now it s time for him to get on board with impeaching trump featured image via alex wong getty images
