this is the craziest explanation of why donald trump is getting his ass handed to him in the polls and you have to hear it for yourself the republican nominee s newst campaign manager kellyanne conway was interviewed by the uk s channel   where she was grilled about trump s poll numbers and whether he can really win once again  trump s minion dismissed the polls as being  cherry picked  by the media because they supposedly want to destroy him conway claimed that online polls are more accurate because they allegedly show trump in the lead and she argued that college students are keeping their support of trump secret so they aren t alienated on campus  donald trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the election  it s because it s become socially desirable  if you re a college educated person in the united states of america  to say that you re against donald trump  the problem with online polls  however  is that anyone can take them and they can be easily skewed if a bunch of people take it with the intention of making the results lean one way or the other  in short  they aren t scientific  like real polls conducted by cnn  gallup  nbc  and quinnipiac  all of which show trump losing badly to hillary clinton furthermore  polls are anonymous so there is no need to hide one s support of a candidate  but polls overwhelmingly show that trump is getting trounced by hillary among young voters  so it s pretty clear why conway would make any excuse to explain the wide gap there conway then claimed that trump will win the election in november because most of his voters are supposedly  undercover  yeah  you read that right  she literally said trump has  undercover voters  that are in hiding until they can rush to the voting booth and cast their votes  the hidden trump vote in this country is a very significant proposition   she said when asked if she has numbers to back up her claims  conway said she does but refused to share them  i can t discuss it   conway said   it s a project we re doing internally  i call it the undercover trump voter  but it s real  here s the video via youtube someone get this woman a straight jacket and a rubber room  because this claim is as delusional as the claim that the government will send black helicopters to whisk critics away in the middle of the night or that the government is going to take way all of our guns seriously  this a crock of bullshit  the idea that voters are  undercover  is totally ridiculous  donald trump s campaign is imploding and the best his new campaign manager can do is cite the vote of imaginary voters as proof that trump will win  it s pathetic and it sounds like trump needs yet another new campaign manager featured image via screenshot
