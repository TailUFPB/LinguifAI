in a recent interview with fox news  trump said that california is  out of control  for advancing legislation to provide statewide sanctuary for immigrants and keep law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities in enforcing trump s many anti immigrant measures  trump told fox that he will take away every penny that california receives from the federal government the state of california has one of the ten largest economies in the world  not only is it a giant among states  competing with the economies of some of the most affluent countries worldwide  but it is one of the few states that pays more into the federal treasury than it receives in government funding  it would be a huge mistake to put the state of california in a position that legislators may decide to stop paying taxes altogether  but donald trump seems determined to do just that because  well  he s an idiot  if we have to  we ll defund   he said   we give tremendous amounts of money to california  thanks to the state s liberal policies  california has outpaced the rest of the nation on job growth and had a gross state product of   trillion in   placing it sixth behind the united kingdom in world economies  ranked by gross domestic product  and  in the world ranked by cost of living in other words  california would be fine without the federal money it receives if the state stopped paying taxes to the federal government  officials are currently looking into doing exactly that if trump follows through on his threat to take federal funding from the state  california could very well become an organized non payer   if trump follows through on threats to punish cities and states that do not comply with requests to turn over jews undocumented immigrants to trump s goons  a former speaker of the state assembly told kpix  on sunday   they could recommend non compliance with the federal tax code  i don t want to defund the state or city  i don t want to defund anybody  i want to give them the money they need to properly operate a city or a state   trump says  but  if they re going to have sanctuary cities we may have to do that   certainly that would be a weapon  ir would be a weapon  but the federal government needs california s money more than the state needs funding from the government  this fact alone is enough to virtually assure that lawmakers will choose to defund trump rather than violate their conscience and hand over people trump has deemed  undesirable  looks like trump s threat has been called  it s time to find out if he is really stupid enough to try this kind of stunt read more featured image via getty images  drew angerer
