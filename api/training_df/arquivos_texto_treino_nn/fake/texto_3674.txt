despite the fact that many election experts have been hoping that the  election results would be examined  democratic candidate hillary clinton is being attacked by the trump campaign for supporting the efforts of green party candidate jill stein to recount the votes in wisconsin  michigan and pennsylvania earlier today  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway unloaded on clinton s campaign   but trump couldn t just leave it at that  shortly after conway criticized the recount effort  trump chimed in with a statement of his own  in trump s response  he blamed stein and the green party for their  ridiculous  recount  scam  and accused stein of trying to profit from it  trump said  the people have spoken and the election is over  and as hillary clinton herself said on election night  in addition to her conceding by congratulating me   we must accept this result and then look to the future  it is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country  we won  electoral votes on election day   the most of any republican since    and we carried nine of  battleground states   of  states  and more than   counties nationwide   the most since president ronald reagan in   this recount is just a way for jill stein  who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states  to fill her coffers with money  most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount  all three states were won by large numbers of voters  especially pennsylvania  which was won by more than   votes  this is a scam by the green party for an election that has already been conceded  and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused  which is exactly what jill stein is doing  trump is right that clinton conceded the election  but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede  another glaring mistake in trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement  which is hilarious considering clinton won the popular vote by a landslide  as the atlantic s david frum pointed out twitterin wisconsin  there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies  trump and his team are not hiding their anxiety over this issue very well  and they have every reason to be worried featured image via win mcnamee and ty wright   getty images
