donald trump doesn t have any legislative wins under his belt yet  but there s one thing he s been really good at   shattering records with his historically low approval rating thanks to a new gallup poll  we now know that trump s disapproval rating has a three day rolling average of  percent  beating his own previous record  you can check out the stats below according to gallup  trump s approval ratings are also near his administration s low point when looking at the three day approval ratings gallup reports daily  for june    trump averaged   approval  one point above his low of   measured march    trump s current three day average of   disapproval is  by one point  the highest of his administration  now that a vast majority of americans   many of which are probably republicans or trump voters   are finally admitting that they want trump out of the white house  we couldn t be happier  it s clear that trump s insane russia scandal is taking a toll on his standing with the country  and his many losses are undoubtedly helping him become more unpopular by the day these numbers from gallup come just as the senate republicans are trying to roll out another health care bill   which will probably only make trump s ratings plummet even more  considering how badly the first stab at trumpcare hurt trump s ratings trump loves boasting about his wins and records  but it s unlikely that he s going to want to brag about the fact that no president in history has gotten so unpopular so quickly   and the chances are  trump is going to keep going down because he sabotages himself almost every day with his erratic behavior and social media habits  it won t be long before even more of the country turns against him  especially as trump s russia investigation is currently heating up  he can t hide from the facts for long   america won t let him featured image via pool   getty images
