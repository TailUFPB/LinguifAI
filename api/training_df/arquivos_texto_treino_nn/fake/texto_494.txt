donald trump is about to get his first real test as commander in chief  hurricane harvey is a category four storm that s about to hit landfall in texas  it will be the worst since hurricane katrina in  and on the very same day it s set to hit he s going to sign an executive order that will potentially make future hurricane damage much worse trump s executive order is just another petulant attempt at undoing everything obama did because well he was obama  it would reverse standards that would make government buildings safer from flooding   something needed with rising sea levels  and yes  with hurricanes the trump administration has complained that it takes too much time to get permits and approvals for construction projects  the administration has issued dozens of rules and orders to reverse or rescind obama era regulations addressing climate change and its consequences such as rising sea levels and more severe storms the obama era standard required that builders factor in scientific projections for how climate change could affect flooding in a certain area and ensure projects can withstand rising sea levels and stronger downpours source  cnbcthe scientific consensus is that sea levels are going to rise at an alarming level  by the end of the century  they could rise by more than six feet  while that may not sound like a lot  think about the havoc on your own home when there are just a few inches of flood water obviously  this executive order only affects federal buildings and state regulations could easily override them  but many of the states in the flood zones  like texas  louisiana  the carolinas  georgia and florida  are led by  and overwhelmingly inhabited by  republican climate change deniers  washington  d c  is also in a flood zone trump sees safety regulations on buildings as an inconvenience for him  overturning obama s executive order does two things  it helps erase the black guy s legacy and it helps the grifter in chief just in case he gets a federal contract featured image via pool getty images
