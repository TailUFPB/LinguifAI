donald trump has won the white house and now  republicans have control of the senate and congress  too  house speaker paul ryan has hinted at plans to privatize medicare  ryan s ayn randish vision for america has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower income classes yes  this is a war  one in which americans will suffer greatly  millions of low income americans on medicaid could lose their health coverage if trump and the republican controlled congress follow through with their plans vox reports that trump has  already endorsed ryan s plans on medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length  his vice president  mike pence  is a longtime friend and congressional ally of ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones ryan wants we can expect an increase in poverty  i ve been working on these issues since    robert greenstein  the founder and president of the center on budget and policy priorities and washington s leading advocate for poor and low income americans  said  according to vox   this is by far the gravest threat to the safety net  and to low income people  that i ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues  i think there s a potential in the first seven months  by the august recess  for congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century  if obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement   million people will be denied coverage paul ryan  like his conservative colleagues  seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies  insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down trump s replacement plan is even worse than ryan s the committee for a responsible federal budget estimates it d spare just  million people who d otherwise lose insurance through obamacare repeal  full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from  million  trump s plan takes it away from  million  the difference is minimal and yet  here s the thing  trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet  he has suggested that he won t fully repeal obamacare but now  he s beholden to republicans who control the senate and the house  even if he says no  the wheels are in motion  he s the one who started turning them because eating while poor is bad cbpp estimates that the most recent house budget gets  percent of its cuts from programs for low  and moderate income people  that includes at least   billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly   billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low income programs like ssi  which provides cash to the disabled and elderly   pell grants  and what little remains of welfare republicans have been trying to eradicate president obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down  tea party republicans went to town halls where democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents  the noise from republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill  so  it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad  they told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads as it happens  medical professionals do not want obamacare repealed  trump and his republican colleagues just want you to think that featured image via zach gibson getty images
