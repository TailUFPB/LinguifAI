it s been a well known fact for quite some time that donald trump doesn t handle criticism particularly well  but what has become glaringly obvious during his ten month tenure as the president of the united states is that if his skin were any thinner  he would need to be carried around in a bucket  remember  this is the same man who filed a   billion libel lawsuit against author timothy o brien for causing  actual malice  by claiming that trump was only a multi millionaire  not a billionaire since he s been in office  president trump has had a fixation on size  from exaggerating the size of the crowd present at his inauguration and other public appearances  to that of the size of his manhattan penthouse in trump tower and even the height of the building itself for that matter trump is not a small man  standing around     although i ll say    to save myself from any legal ramifications  but he does have a clear cut napoleonic complex people have been giving trump a hard time about the size of his hands since the  when spy magazine dubbed him a short fingered vulgarian   the references to the size of then candidate trump s hands gathered steam again during his presidential campaign  something that has stuck in his craw to this day with the president still feeling the need to justify his hand size   my hands are too big   he said as he attempted to put on a pair of latex gloves while serving meals in early september to those affected by hurricane harvey in houston if one man could be that affected by a claim that he has small hands  then how would he feel if his entire body were small  we don t exactly know yet  but people are photoshopping trump to appear small in photos to hilarious effect to get under his skin and the results are just brilliant there are several approaches photo manipulators are taking  the most obvious being to make him out to be the child that he is others are just opting to make trump seem tiny in general  but particularly when he s in the company of other world leaders if there s one way to drive a sexist crazy  it is to make them seem minuscule in the presence of a woman  particularly family members  in trump s case  there s the added advantage of making that woman his arch nemesis  hilary clinton this is a trend that is certainly going to go viral so if you think you ve got some photoshop skills  it s time to get to work and feel free to post your masterpieces in the comments featured image via screenshot
