carl paladino s racism against president obama and first lady michelle obama is so bad that his own son just publicly denounced him last week  paladino  who served as a trump campaign official  wrote a wish list full of hate against the obamas  obama catches mad cow disease after being caught having relations with a herford   paladino wrote   dies before his trial and is buried in a cow pasture next to valerie jarret  who died weeks prior  after being convicted of sedition and treason  when a jihady cell mate mistook her for being a nice person and decapitated her   he continued of michelle obama  he said   i d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with maxie  the gorilla  the racist outburst caused much outrage   and even paladino s own son could no longer sit silent ellicott development company ceo william paladino released a statement condemning his father on christmas eve  ellicott development takes pride in being a culturally diverse company with over  hard working dedicated employees  we value and respect our employees  friends  partners and all of our commercial and residential tenancies and we do not condone the statements made about the president of the united states and his wife  they were disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary  however  many people pointed out in the comments that carl paladino is still the chairman of the board at ellicott and that it s not enough to condemn his remarks if he is still allowed to hold onto his position  therefore  a boycott has been called for against ellicott and any business  government  and bank connected to them carl paladino doesn t appear to be bothered by the condemnation either  suggesting that his son is only publicly breaking with him while privately supporting him  there is no reason for the company and its  employees to suffer from my politic  especially with the hate spewed by the activists who are devoid of any understanding of our history  our government and our constitution   the elder paladino wrote in an email to the new york post what carl paladino said about the obama family is disgusting and he should be expelled from any remaining position he has with ellicott and a stronger condemnation needs to be released from the company  but let s all remember that carl paladino worked for donald trump s campaign  which means trump condoned paladino s racism  that s not surprising  of course  considering trump pandered to white supremacists throughout his campaign and has some working in his new administration featured image  screenshot
