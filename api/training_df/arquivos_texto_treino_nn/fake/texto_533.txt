this year america has seen an interesting and terrifying new technique for dealing with protesters  republicans  buoyed by their base s enthusiasm for physically harming people who inconvenience them  took a hard look at all of the things being protested across the country  they saw natives at standing rock  young african americans at black lives matter rallies  and a pretty wide assortment at donald trump s inauguration  and they decided the best way to deal with it was to hit them with cars that s not hyperbole  i guarantee you have had at least one argument on facebook with a relative or old high school friend who sees pictures of protests and jokes about running over the people in the streets  the gop decided to codify that behavior by writing laws that would reduce or remove penalties for drivers who do just that beginning with north dakota  lawmakers in six states began to pen a series of proposals that all looked very similar to each other  house bill  would set the tone notwithstanding any other provision of law  a driver of a motor vehicle who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road  street  or highway  is not guilty of an offense similar laws cropped up in florida  north carolina  rhode island  tennessee  and texas  these heartless laws were part of a larger effort by republicans to stifle dissent on a larger scale  a proposal in oregon would have required schools to expel protesters even peripherally involved in a riot  while one in ferguson  missouri   the heartland of the black lives matter movement   would have created an offense called  unlawful traffic interference  with which protesters could be charged if they stood in the path of any important white people on their way to do important white people things it took until the murder of heather heyer for fox nation to take down a video posted in humor on their website entitled here s a reel of cars plowing through protesters trying to block the road  i guess this like what a conscience looks like on fox but even after the events of this last weekend in charlottesville  virginia  those gop legislators are still defending their bills  on sunday  texas rep  pat fallon was wondering if  the far left  knew the difference between a street and a highway  he deleted his social media posts  but his proposal remains a person operating a motor vehicle who injures another person with the motor vehicle is not liable for the injury if  at the time of the injury    the person operating the motor vehicle was exercising due care  and     the person injured was blocking traffic in a public right of way while participating in a protest or demonstration any wild guesses what it might take in texas to prove you were  exercising due care  when you hit that troublesome agitator featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
