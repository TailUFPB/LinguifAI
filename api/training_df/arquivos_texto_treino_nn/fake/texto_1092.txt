with the news dropping that supposedly trump isn t under an investigation for obstruction of justice  we re all scratching our heads  especially since trump admitted he s under investigation himself abc this week with george stephanopoulos has an idea of what s going on  the president wants to take down bob mueller  his lawyer wants to take down bob muller and the question is why  and i think the answer is they wanna lay the foundation to discredit whatever bob mueller comes up with   stephanopoulos said in a video posted on twitter given that trump himself has admitted on twitter that he is under investigation and that it s a  witch hunt   it sounds like a very plausible answer stephanopoulos goes on to say that  they re essentially engaging in a  scorched earth  litigation strategy that is beginning with trying to discredit the prosecutor  he closes the video by saying that mueller is just doing his job and is only just getting started  so we shouldn t just automatically dismiss mueller or that trump is being investigated stephanopoulos has a point  it does seem likely that trump and his team would try to cover an investigation up  they don t want the public to know   it would damage his reputation  not that he has a glowing one in the first place  why shouldn t we believe what trump tweets  he knows what he s tweeting  why shouldn t we believe the other sources an excerpt of  this week  shows pierre thomas  abc news senior justice correspondent saying  now  my sources are telling me he s begun some preliminary planning  plans to talk to some people in the administration  but he s not yet made that momentous decision to go for a full scale investigation  if that s the case  it s possible that mueller is backing off on the idea of investigating trump  why obviously  something is going on behind the scenes  stephanopoulos may have just given us the real answer photo by lorenzo bevilaqua abc via getty images
