eric trump tried to spin a tale on fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire  only to be smacked down with a reminder that donald trump started out as a millionaire the republican nominee s demon spawn appeared on outnumbered on friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the american dream after trashing hillary clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters  eric trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them  and his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad s life  he s built an amazing company  he s become the epitome of the american dream   eric trump said   he s gone from practically nothing to a man who s just but that was a total lie and julie roginsky didn t let the younger trump get away with it roginsky cut eric trump off and reminded him that his father got   million from his father fred trump to start out with nothing   roginsky said   he got a million bucks  come on  eric  indeed  donald trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in america  he has never known poverty in his entire life  in   he was given   million by his father  an amount that trump called a  small loan  moments after he claimed that life  hasn t been easy for me  during a town hall event in october  of course  that s an insult to the millions of americans who live in poverty daily and can t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it  they struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills  but donald trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy  trump s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi million dollar inheritance when he died  in other words  donald trump knows absolutely nothing about starting from nothing but eric trump didn t address roginsky s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps  he epitomized what america s all about  opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed  right   eric trump continued   it s no different than a zuckerberg  right  who went out with a great idea like a facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it  that is achieving something  right  and i think it s very different than a person who has been a career politician  here s the video via vidme can no member of trump s family actually refrain from lying about their past because it s clear that donald trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor  they have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives  but for some reason  they think   million is the definition of starting with nothing featured image via screen capture
