if you watched the second presidential debate last night  you know that there were several cringeworthy moments  most of them created by republican nominee donald trump  one of the most noteworthy of them was when the business mogul threw his vice president  mike pence  under the bus by disagreeing with pence s stance on how america should respond to the war in syria the moment shocked everyone watching  and was the perfect representation of just what a disaster the trump pence ticket is  to make matters worse  this is just one amongst a long list of things trump and pence have disagreed about  jerry springer  the host of  the jerry springer show  said it better than any of us could have when he weighed in on this awkward debate moment  while i may not be able to moderate a debate  sounds like mike pence and donald trump might need to come on my show to talk things out  seriously   and springer s tweet about trump pence couldn t be any more fitting than at this moment  when pence basically refused to defend trump over the lewd misogynistic comments that were discovered in a recently leaked audio tape trump s entire campaign has gone on like a reality tv show  so it s not a stretch to say that trump wouldn t feel right at home on springer s show  and according to previous tweets from springer  the talk show host already knows this twitterspringer  who has fiercely endorsed hillary clinton  has been taking trump and the gop to task on social media  and it s pretty awesome  springer also made sure to bring those who support trump into the mix of insults twittertwittertwitterconsidering that trump is a serial rapist who wants to bang his daughter and can t agree with his most important team member  springer s show might be the only place trump and his weird  volatile campaign belongs featured image via stephen lovekin and scott olson   getty images
