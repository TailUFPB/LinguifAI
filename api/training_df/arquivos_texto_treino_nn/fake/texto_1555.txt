the majority of america has already noticed   and figured it out a long time ago   that donald trump doesn t have a measured  steady reaction to anything  widely known for his lack of mental and emotional stability  america s new failing president continues to horrify the nation  and the world  with his over the top  inappropriate reactions to even the most straightforward issues and disagreements  how trump treats members of his own team is a perfect example of this last month  trump made a controversial remark when he insisted that south korea should pay for the terminal high altitude area defense  thaad   a missile defense system that would help keep north korea at bay  as trump frequently talks out of his a   and makes statements that have no basis in reality  he was quickly contradicted by his own national security adviser  h r  mcmaster  in a public statement  mcmaster stepped in and quickly assured the korean government that the cost of thaad would be taken care of by the united states  apparently  trump didn t take that too well according to bloomberg  it s just been revealed that trump lost his sh t over this and tore his own adviser a new one over the phone  bloomberg reported  trump was livid  according to three white house officials  after reading in the wall street journal that mcmaster had called his south korean counterpart to assure him that the president s threat to make that country pay for a new missile defense system was not official policy  these officials say trump screamed at mcmaster on a phone call  accusing him of undercutting efforts to get south korea to pay its fair share  trump  as usual  was having a highly inappropriate reaction to his fragile ego being bruised  apparently  this isn t even the first and only time something like this has happened  bloomberg stated that in private  trump calls mcmaster the general undermining my policy  and appears regretful that he appointed him the lack of trust and in fighting we ve seen in the trump administration   as well as trump s lack of respect for the advisers he appointed   is unprecedented on so many levels  this administration continues to be an embarrassment to this country  and most of us can t wait until this nightmare is over featured image via pool   getty images
