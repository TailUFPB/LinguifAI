donald trump won the presidential election  but did he really win as it stands right now  he s down in the popular vote by two million votes  two million  for comparison  president obama s victories came with a five million vote lead    and a massive  million vote lead     even trump says he likes the popular vote better   he just also claims he d have won if that s what was counted  which is clearly not the case  from politico trump himself is a noted critic of the electoral college who called it  a disaster for a democracy  in   and he told new york times reporters tuesday he would  rather do the popular vote  and was  never a fan of the electoral college until now  the popular vote would have been a lot easier   trump said   but it s a whole different campaign  i would have been in california  i would have been in texas  florida and new york  and we wouldn t have gone anywhere else  which is  i mean i d rather do the popular vote  but i think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because you d go to a few places   he added   i think that s the genius of the electoral college  i was never a fan of the electoral college until now  in fact  if her lead keeps growing  there s a possibility she could win the popular vote by more than george bush did in   when he won re election   and while we re on that note  here s an even more heartening statistic  republicans have won the popular vote only twice in the last  years  they are completely reliant on electoral shenanigans and gerrymandering to hold any national power  and after the next census elections  there s a good possibility even their cheats will be eroded  and without that  they re finished the difference between barack obama and donald trump can be summed up like this  when obama ran for his first term  he was elected with the most votes ever won by a presidential candidate  ever   almost  million  trump  he is setting a record  too   for the biggest popular vote loss in history while winning the election  other presidents have lost the popular vote while winning the election  but donald trump is unique in that he lost by more than all of them combined  times two great job  donald trump  you singlehandedly made reforming the electoral college a major political issue  and if the national popular vote bill is passed in a few more states  the nation won t see another republican president until they broaden their appeal here s a video from rachel maddow breaking down exactly how crazy these election results really are featured image via video screenshot
