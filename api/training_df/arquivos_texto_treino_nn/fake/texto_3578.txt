despite his promises to  drain the swamp   trump is doing the exact opposite  so far  his cabinet picks are basically a  who s who  of washington insiders and big business executives  making the swamp slimier than ever and the democratic party isn t missing the opportunity to highlight trump s incompetence and hypocrisy in a  second video released on twitter  the democrats lambasted trump for hiring the very idiots who caused the financial crisis to undo all of the hard work done by the obama administration to pull this country back from the brink of financial ruin you can watch the video below  we ve seen so much economic growth over the last  years  now donald trump is hiring the people who created the crisis we recovered from  pic twitter com   the democrats   thedemocrats  december    the list is always changing  you can see a live updated version by the new york times here   here s a quick rundown of his current appointments and their anything but outsider backgrounds steve bannon is a white supremacist and nationalist  and architect of breitbart  which he has called a platform of the  alt right   alt right is the politically correct word for neo nazis that can t stand being called neo nazis  he was also an investment banker at goldman sachs  and ran his own financial firm  bannon   co reince priebus  who was chairman to the rnc and instrumental in the rise of paul ryan  scott walker  and others  is about as establishment as you can get  he s a lawyer and career politician  and was the chairman of one of two major political parties  what is more establishment than that   yet  for his early promotion of the donald  he s getting rewarded with a spot in the white house  trump doesn t give a damn about draining the swamp  he s giving favors to friends flynn isn t as bad as trump s other picks at first glance  that is  he seems to have no clue what he s talking about with regard to many political issues  but on the subject of national security  he does at least have some expertise  unfortunately  that expertise is tempered with a  let s bomb the shit out of everything   attitude combined with extreme islamophobia  lovely  he s also been reported to have a loose relationship with the truth  a leaked email from former secretary of state and four star general colin powell is even more telling  i spoke at dia last month   powell wrote to his son  michael  on july  before relaying a story he apparently heard from marine lt  gen  vincent stewart  the current dia director   flynn got fired as head of dia  his replacement is a black marine  star  i asked why flynn got fired  abusive with staff  didn t listen  worked against policy  bad management  etc  he has been and was right wing nutty every  since    the washington post come on  trump  you can t do better than that  who am i kidding   of course you can t none of those require senate confirmation  so they re already a done deal  the following names  however  are not yet set in stone  but are likely i won t get into the many  many terrible policy positions of jeff sessions  that s not important here  what is important is that he is another career politician who is owned by the insurance industry and has no interest in fighting for the common citizen  he s yet another swamp monster in an administration that won an election on the promise of changing business as usual in washington it s hard to know where to start with betsy devos  her desire to privatize education  not improve it  her belief in creationism  the fact that she thinks christianity belongs in public schools  or maybe just that she s another billionaire swamp monster  she married into amway money  amway  if you re not familiar  is a massive pyramid scheme under investigation in many countries for its  multi level marketing  scam   multi level marketing  is code for  pyramid scam    it s one of the largest privately held companies in the united states  and she is a huge political donor who is very fond of money influencing the political process you know who would make the best secretary of the treasury when you re trying to get rid of  business as usual  in washington  a billionaire investment banker and hedge fund manager who spent  years at goldman sachs  that s who  here s a flashback to trump just months ago  i m not going to let wall street get away with murder  wall street has caused tremendous problems for us  we re going to tax wall street  huh  how about that steven mnuchin been sued by trump  partnered with george soros  and has done basically anything he can to make as much money as possible  it s hard to see how liberals or conservatives would support him  but trump supporters will follow him no matter what he does or how many promises he breaks and in case you forgot  people like mnuchin caused the great recession  now we ve gone from not regulating them enough and allowing them to buy politicians to directly placing them in power  that s some great swamp draining right there wilbur ross is a predatory billionaire investor and former banker  is this starting to sound repetitive  he also served under rudy giuliani  as well as bill clinton  and has been both a democrat and a republican as the need arises  not exactly a political outsider and heads up  coal miners  he s currently under investigation by multiple agencies for his degree of responsibility in the deaths of a dozen coal miners in west virginia  the mine that collapsed had over  safety citations  and he was  intimately familiar  with the company and problems in question during the time leading up to the incident  do you think trump really gives a flying fuck about you when he s hiring people like that elaine chao has served under two previous republican administrations already  as well as obtaining a white house fellowship under reagan  she was the secretary of labor under dubya  and the deputy secretary of transportation under his marginally more competent father  president george h w  bush she s also senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s wife  not only that  but she s worked at multiple banks as well as the heritage foundation  she is as deeply embedded in the world of politics and the swamp of washington as it is possible to be with this list of washington insiders and bank executives on their way onto the white house team  it s more clear than ever that everything trump told his supporters during his campaign was a lie  he s in it for himself  his children  and his rich friends  after that  he ll listen to anybody that pretends they like him or tells him what he wants to hear  sad featured image via screen capture from embedded video
