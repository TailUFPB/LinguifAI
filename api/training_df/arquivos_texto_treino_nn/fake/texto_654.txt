maybe you ve finally heard by now that a mosque in bloomington  minnesota was bombed early saturday morning  maybe  it seemed confusing as it was being reported  because nobody was calling it what it actually was  an act of terrorism aimed at a church  in fact  you were hard pressed to find anyone even calling it a hate crime  despite the fact that it clearly was  everything about the incident added up to exactly what america would have called a terrorist attack   if it had been committed by muslims  instead of against them in the new york times report  details included the fact that congregants has just begun to gather for morning prayers  the fact that the bomb was thrown into the imam s  pastor s  room  and the fact that one worshiper ran outside at the sound of the explosion just in time to see a truck speeding out of the parking lot  just everything you might need for a terrorist attack  maximum presence  a specific target  and a fleeing suspect when news hit the wire that it was carried out with an improvised explosive device   an ied  in the parlance of middle east wars   you d think that would draw some response from the president of the united states  a terrorist attack on a church  using a weapon you might find in the desert of iraq  condemnation from every republican in washington  right not so much apparently there was a terrorist bombing in minnesota today  take one guess why trump has said nothing about it  https   t co   mark follman   markfollman  august    i miss trump s statement of concern for the victims of this bombing and members of the mosque does he care  https   t co   marty parrish   martyparrish  august    bombed a mosque in minnesota recently  you probably didn t hear about this because mainstream media likes to demonize muslims   brown saraah   brownsaraah  august    took until sunday before someone finally called it a terrorist attack  and it was minnesota s own democratic governor  mark dayton  who used the appropriate language  he visited the dar al farooq mosque with a cadre of other public officials  and was devastated by the sight what a terrible  dastardly  cowardly act was committed  it is a criminal act of terrorism but muslims across the country surely know that trump s silence on the issue is quite purposeful  he s made it very clear that his aim since before he even secured the republican nomination was to curtail muslim entry into the us  to marginalize them and monitor them as though their very presence were terrorism in itself  every attack inside the us that is perpetrated by a muslim  whether it is related to religion  hate crimes  or simply random  is immediately branded terrorism  but crimes against them are never looked at in the same light we must support our muslim brothers and sisters across this country  and never allow them to be marginalized the way trump and his fellow republicans want them to be  if we don t hold the terrorist responsible for this attack to the same account we would demand of a muslim attacker  we are no better than the trump fans across the country who were no doubt secretly glad that it happened featured image via spencer platt getty images
