during presidential campaigns  it is pretty standard procedure for there to be a press corps that travels with the major party candidates  however  last night  donald trump s press corps was late getting to his rally  instead of doing what any normal  reasonable candidate would do and telling the crowd to wait patiently for the press to arrive  trump held the rally without them  they got there  minutes and  seconds before the rally ended  as if that weren t bad enough  trump actually bragged about snubbing the press  and mocked them for their travel issues  i have really good news for you  i just heard that the press is stuck on their airplane  they can t get here  i love it  they re trying to get here now  they re going to be about  minutes late  they called us and said   could you wait   i said   absolutely not  let s get going    the media members on twitter were not going to let trump and his campaign get off that easy  though  they took to trump s own favorite social media platform and slammed the trump campaign for allegedly screwing around with their travel situation  so that they would miss the rally  they also blasted the candidate himself for not having the same sort of official press pool that trump s democratic rival hillary clinton   and  indeed  every presidential candidate in modern history prior to donald trump   has  here are just a few of those tweets  via the hill trump doing this rally without his traveling press corps even here is an absurd joke   phil mattingly   philmattingly  september    week  conway said clinton treats the press like second class citizens  please note that trump is speaking right now and we are on a bus  sopan deb   sopandeb  september    s another view of trump s traveling press corps as trump is on stage in nh pic twitter com   noah gray cnn   noahgraycnn  september    now apparently he s on stage mocking the fact that he started without the press arriving    https   t co kabvyvuack  jeremy diamond     september    traveling trump press saw  minutes and  seconds of his rally in laconia   nick corasaniti   nytnickc  september    is disgraceful  but hardly surprising  trump hates the press  in fact  he hates them so much that he has actually banned a multitude of media outlets from having press credentials to cover his rallies  just because he doesn t like what they have to say about him  this is just another new low for donald trump and his travesty of a campaign  hopefully  the media keeps hounding him  and treats him just as badly as he treats them featured image via mark wallheiser getty images
