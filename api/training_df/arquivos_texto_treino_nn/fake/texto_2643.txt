donald trump is scheduled to make his first state visit to britain later this year  since the united kingdom is one of america s closest and oldest allies  the utmost diplomacy and courtesy is usually afforded when either leader visits the other  that will not be the case during the trump era  though  if uk house of commons speaker john bercow has anything to say about it  citing trump s  racism  and  sexism   bercow says that he is against allowing trump to address the uk s members of parliament  mp s  bercow says that speaking before the distinguished body  is not an automatic right  it is an earned honour   many mp s were elated at bercow s move  while others were irritated and worried that he might be straining relations with an ally that the uk needs in his proposed treatment of trump  bercow said of his decision  after the imposition of the migrant ban by president trump i am even more strongly opposed to an address by president trump in westminster hall  i would not wish to issue an invitation to president trump  bercow then added passionately  i feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the house of commons  labour party mp stephen daughtry offered high praise for bercow s extraordinary statement  i am delighted that the speaker has listened to members from across the house regarding our deep concerns that donald trump not be honoured with an address in westminster hall or elsewhere in the palace of westminster  after his comments and actions on women  torture  refugees and the judiciary  another labour party mp  yvette cooper  said that trump has been  continuing his assault on the democratic values that the british parliament holds dear  this really should come as no surprise  because during the election cycle  the entire british parliament spent more than three hours excoriating trump  he was called  crazy   a  buffoon  a fool    bonkers    dangerous   and more  regardless of party  the entire house of commons were in agreement in their contempt for then candidate trump  here is a highlight reel  courtesy of the washington post  on that debate all in all  trump is ruining relationships for america  likely for years to come  just because of his repugnant personal characteristics  good on house speaker bercow for putting principle above niceties  hopefully  people continue to support this move  in the meantime  let s hope our allies don t judge all americans by the actions of one unhinged  illegitimate leader featured image via alex wong getty images
