trump won the electoral college on nov    the electoral college formally voted for him on dec    congress certified that vote on jan    and he was sworn in on jan    he won the election so why is he still beating his  i only lost the popular vote because millions voted illegally   drum  he s so obsessed with it that he s promised to open up a major investigation into the massive voter fraud that supposedly denied him his rightful popular vote win i will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud  including those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     those registered to vote who are dead  and many for a long time   depending on results  we will strengthen up voting procedures   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    the hell is president asterisk getting his info  it seems he s certain that voter fraud is rampant because he saw something in a polling place once  he supposedly saw bernhard langer  a famous golfer  down in florida sometime after election day  langer told him a story of how he was turned away at the polls  but others were allowed to cast provisional ballots and he was frustrated the first glaring problem here is this  langer is a legal permanent resident  but a german citizen  and is therefore barred from voting in national elections  if he did try to vote on election day  an official would have been legally obligated to turn langer away but still  according to the new york times  ahead of and behind mr  langer were voters who did not look as if they should be allowed to vote  mr  trump said  according to the staff members   but they were nonetheless permitted to cast provisional ballots  the president threw out the names of latin american countries that the voters might have come from  because someone s appearance is totally how you can tell whether they re legally allowed to vote here  of course trump would focus on how people look  it seems that  in his mind  if they appear to be latino  they re obviously in the country illegally and people with more than half a brain cell know that s stupid  trump told the story to a room full of congressional leaders at a  get to know you  gathering in the state dining room  the times says that this little anecdote was greeted with silence  then reince priebus tried to nudge trump onto a different topic this is where trump is getting his proof that millions of people vote illegally in this country  anecdotes like this  that might not even be true  are why we re going to waste time and effort on a claim that s been debunked repeatedly  just so he can make people stop pointing to numbers that show he s a loser abc news is reporting that the white house has started working on an executive order to open just such an investigation  with all of this  one would think trump has at least some solid evidence that there s widespread voter fraud  he doesn t he is way out of hand and he hasn t even been in office for a week featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
