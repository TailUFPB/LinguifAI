former vermont governor howard dean has already served as the chair of the democratic national committee from    as the democratic party recovers from shocking losses and a lack of leadership  he chose to run for that same position again  however  as of friday  dean has chosen to get out of the race for dnc chair  saying that it is a time for the party to be led by new faces this is a huge win for the progressive wing of the party  who has appointed new  farther left leaders like elizabeth warren and bernie sanders to senate leadership positions while retaining nancy pelosi as the democratic leader in the house of representatives  gov  dean was right to do this  as he has had his run  and it is time for new blood  however  he seems to have his reservations about selecting a sitting member of congress  such as rep  keith ellison  d  minn   for the top job  there are three people left in the pile of candidates  including naral pro choice president ilyse hogue should she leave her current job  hogue would be a great pick  seeing as women s rights are under attack  and she s the perfect person to preserve them  speaking in regards to the demands of the job and the need for someone to be able to do it full time  gov  dean stated  i know this job better than anyone in this room  it requires  hours of work a week and constant travel across the country to fundraise    this is a full time job  whether or not that is true  i have no idea  however  i am glad that gov  dean put his party s welfare before his own political ambitions  the democratic party is becoming more and more progressive by the day  and it s time for those young  progressive voices to take the reigns  we must not give in to moderate challengers like rep  tim ryan  d ohio   and we must not give into continuing the same old failed leadership  godspeed to whoever wins  and may we take back congress with your leadership in  featured image via win mcnamee getty images
