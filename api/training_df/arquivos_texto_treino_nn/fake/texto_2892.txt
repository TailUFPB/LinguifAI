people who voted for donald trump and receive medicaid are about to get some really bad news for decades  republicans have wanted to destroy medicaid  a healthcare program that helps low income people with a combination of federal and state resources the idea of block grants would mostly achieve this goal by slashing the amount of money the federal government provides and would shift the fiscal responsibility to the states according to the new york times a block grant would be a radical change  since its creation in   medicaid has been an open ended entitlement  if more people become eligible because of a recession  or if costs go up because of the use of expensive new medicines  states receive more federal money if congress decides to create block grants for medicaid  lawmakers will face thorny questions with huge political and financial implications  how much money will each state receive  how will the initial allotments be adjusted   for population changes  for general inflation  for increases in medical prices  for the discovery of new drugs and treatments  will the federal government require states to cover certain populations and services  will states receive extra money if they have not expanded medicaid eligibility under the affordable care act  but decide to do so in the future also  republicans could punish blue states by giving them less money while giving more money to red states but once the money runs out  people will suffer regardless of which state they live in because that s what a block grant is  it s a set amount of money  states would have to decide if they want to spend more money on healthcare after the funding dries up  basically  lawmakers will be deciding if you get medical care or not  in other words  death panels massachusetts governor charlie baker told republicans in congress that   states would most likely make decisions based mainly on fiscal reasons rather than the health care needs of vulnerable populations  louisiana governor john bel edwards echoed the same concerns  under such a scenario  flexibility would really mean flexibility to cut critical services for our most vulnerable populations  including poor children  people with disabilities and seniors in need of nursing home and home based care   he said again  this is basically the death panels sarah palin was freaking out about when the affordable care act passed  only these are real and would be run by the states because the federal government is forcing them to decide who gets care and who doesn t by imposing funding limits medicaid covers more than  million americans across the country  many of whom are conservatives in some of the poorest states  that s  million people who are going to face great suffering and death over the next four years if trump and republicans have their way featured image  spencer platt getty images
