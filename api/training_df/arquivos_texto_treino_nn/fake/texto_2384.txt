donald trump has no reason to give a shit about what is happening with the democratic party right now  he got elected president as a republican  and right now the democrats are trying to rebuild and elect new leaders  of course  we all know that tom perez got elected chair  and immediately named keith ellison his deputy chair in a clear effort to unite the two wings of the party there s no reason for a gop president who also has the benefit of controlling much of the nation s governorships and state legislatures  as well as the federal government  to address this  however  it s trump  so of course he had something to say  in a classic early morning set of tweets  trump used the dnc elections to talk about a  rigged   electoral process congratulations to thomas perez  who has just been named chairman of the dnc  i could not be happier for him  or for the republican party   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    race for dnc chairman was  of course  totally  rigged   bernie s guy  like bernie himself  never had a chance  clinton demanded perez   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february     how who is chair of the democratic national committee affects the republican party at this point is beyond me  as a democrat  it is hard for me to admit this  but we are in a very weak position right now  so  the gop really shouldn t give a shit about what is going on in our party  however  trump is a narcissist  so he must make himself become the story  no matter what the story is  this guy is a nut  so it s useless trying to make his words or actions make sense at the end of the day  this is really about his continuing inability to admit that he legitimately lost the popular vote by numbers never before seen in modern presidential history  while winning the electoral college and thus the white house this guy is a delusional nutcase  and must be removed post haste  for the safety of the republic featured image via tama getty images
