abc host martha raddatz proved once again why she is one of the best choices to be a presidential debate moderator on sunday  when she grilled kellyanne conway about the republican nominee s immigration plan after trump s campaign manager talked about how hillary clinton and tim kaine supposedly don t answer questions correctly because they make it about trump and are not  forthcoming   raddatz asked conway to clear up some questions about trump s plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants  which she proceeded to answer by not really answering it  he said that the priority will be criminals and those who have overstayed their visas  that still amounts to between  million and   million people that he says will be quickly removed  the cost estimate for that is between   billion and   billion  how will he manage such a massive operation and who will pay for it  conway replied by putting the onus on ice officers and once again said trump will build a wall and force mexico to pay for it  completely avoiding answering for how trump intends to pay for such a costly plan  he ll manage it the way it should have been managed all along  by enforcing the law and relying upon those law enforcement officers and those ice officers to do their job   conway said   they ve been completely hamstrung in their ability to do their job  he also has   said that he will triple the number of ice agents to try to help  conway then did exactly what she whined about kaine and clinton supposedly doing by pivoting to talking about how they don t have an immigration plan except hillary clinton does have an immigration plan and you can find it on her website here raddatz then steered conway back to trump s plan  back to immigration  he said there will be no amnesty  all immigrants here illegally will be subject to deportation   raddatz said   so will they be subject to deportation and removal  this is where conway really began to wither because republican logic dictates that all undocumented immigrants are criminals  which means all  million would have to be deported  but conway tried to have it both ways  if they re criminals  they re going immediately  and we don t know what that number is  we hear anything from  million to  million   conway replied   and then  of course  he has also said  this being the most generous country to immigrants in the world  that if you want to come to america and immigrate here legally  raddatz s bullshit detector went off and she once again tried to pin conway to the wall by asking her point blank that if these immigrants have not committed a crime in the united states will trump still deport them  well  conway couldn t handle that question either  he has said that you should stand in line and immigrate legally   conway said before raddatz cut her off again   so you mean they have to go   raddatz asked conway once again could not handle the question and made a series of gaffes in response  she once again falsely claimed that hillary clinton does not have an immigration plan while trump has a  ten point plan   for the record  hillary s plan is a nine point plan and it is posted on her campaign website conway also said that trump plans to  rescind all those executive amnesties   so does that mean trump will rescind any executive order that has ever granted amnesty to immigrants  including those issued by presidents that came before president obama  because that would be very worrying if that s the case as trump s immigration plan could then affect millions and millions more people raddatz finally realized that conway was not going to be forthcoming in her answers and proceeded to slam her for it here s the video via youtube this is why martha raddatz is considered one of the toughest interviewers in the media  she took conway to the cleaners and made her look like the hypocrite and fool that she is  donald trump s plan would be costly  not to mention an international incident between mexico and the united states since you have to wonder how trump will actually force mexico to pay for something it has repeatedly refused to pay for and the fact that conway is literally lying about hillary clinton by claiming that she doesn t have a plan is equally infuriating  if there s one claim raddatz should have challenged conway on it s that one  other than that  conway crashed and burned because raddatz is a pro  which should be making trump very nervous since he will have to face her later this year when she moderates a debate featured image via screen capture
