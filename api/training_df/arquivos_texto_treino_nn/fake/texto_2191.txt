i m not sure why  after nearly a decade of republicans gleefully sh tting on the american people  i would suddenly expect that house speaker paul ryan and his cohorts to realize they work for the us  not for the highest bidder  but alas  ryan  with his gawdawful healthcare bill  that s guaranteed to give  million people the boot  while enriching the already rich  proved once again who his real constituents are  and it s not us  if you need proof  ryan attended a fundraiser with health insurance lobbyists just two hours before rolling out the bill the two things were related  the thursday morning breakfast fundraiser he attended was hosted by a lobbying firm working to unwind the affordable care act on behalf of health insurance company blue cross blue shield  one of the big winners of ryan s proposed legislation the breakfast  according to an invitation  was sponsored by mcguirewoods pac  the political action committee for the lobbying firm mcguirewoods  blue cross blue shield pays mcguirewoods    a year to lobby on changes to health reform  records show  attendees of the event paid were asked to pitch in as much as    source  the interceptit seems it was money well spent for the insurance company  the bill would allow insurance executives to make a lot more money  companies can currently only deduct up to   million in salaries  per executive  from their taxes  the bill would remove that cap it would also allow insurance companies to add a  percent surcharge if someone faces hard times and they let their insurance lapse  in other words  poor people will have to pay a lot more   a lot more  it would also put a real burden on the young  who might forgo insurance for now  thinking the  percent surcharge might not be a big deal in a few years there is nothing about this bill that benefits the people of the united states  but ryan is dressing it up and entering it into what he calls a beauty contest  this beauty contestant  though  is ugly both on the outside and the inside  in fact  what is that smell featured image via win mcnamee getty images
