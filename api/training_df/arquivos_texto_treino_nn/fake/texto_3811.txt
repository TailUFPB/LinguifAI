trump has just made his campaign ceo  steve bannon  his new chief strategist  and that doesn t bode well for anybody who might hold out some hope that trump doesn t have fascist tendencies  bannon is the former ceo of breitbart news  and breitbart is positively reveling in trump s win  they feel it gives them legitimacy  and bannon s placement gives them unprecedented access to and influence over a presidential administration the new york times published a report on this  and alexander marlow  breitbart s editor in chief  told them  so much of the media mocked us  laughed at us  called us all sorts of names  and then for us to be seen as integral to the election of a president  despite all of that hatred  is something that we certainly enjoy  and savor  they re thrilled now because they think this makes them legitimate  what they apparently don t see is that people laughed at and dismissed breitbart because they became an alt right conspiracy site  as opposed to a legit conservative media site  they want to shape narratives like everyone else  but bannon s dictatorial rule turned them into just another infowars  his placement on the transition team  along with the blowjobs he probably gave trump in order to get on the campaign  makes this dangerous it opens a very wide door to a state run media outlet  throughout his entire campaign  trump vilified any media outlet that dared criticize him  he openly and repeatedly claimed to want to open up libel laws so it would be easier to sue outlets for saying bad things about him  he only liked media outlets that gave him favorable coverage  and he wanted to burn any outlet that didn t make no mistake  this is a reason to be nervous  state run media is nothing more than a government s propaganda arm  and breitbart s newfound fame reaches a lot of people  they re even talking about expanding into paris  cairo  and berlin  according to the times report state run media uses a variety of methods to control information  and one that could become true here very quickly is known as  the big lie   what is  the big lie   according to north korea s media  for instance  it s the idea that there s no poverty and everyone would have laid down their life for their late dictator  kim jong il  the  media  even claimed that people ran into buildings damaged by a munitions explosion to save paintings of kim before they tried saving their own family members who believes that actually happened and that north korea is so prosperous under the kims that there s no poverty  really yet  breitbart already does things like this  too  they ran unsubstantiated rumors about hillary clinton s health  they ve claimed the rash of hate crimes since election night is  fake   and they turned their backs on one of their own reporters  michelle fields  after corey lewandowski grabbed and bruised her furthermore  mike pence himself tried to start a state run media outlet in indiana  he wanted it to compete with indiana s independent media  they would even  break  stories ahead of everyone else  most likely to shape the narrative before the mainstream media had a crack at it  there s a good chance he d be on board with breitbart being the administration s own personal propaganda machine then there s the liar of liars himself  trump just lied about the new york times again after a campaign filled with these lies  realdonaldtrump  nytimes fact  surge in new subscriptions  print   digital  with trends  stops   starts   x better than normal   nytco communications   nytimescomm  november    can easily start pushing these lies  too  and anything else they see fit  kurt bardella  a former breitbart spokesman who quit earlier this year  voiced worry over the idea that breitbart was suddenly so close to the white house  it will be as close as we are ever going to have   hopefully   to a state run media enterprise  think it really can t happen  because we re already full of independent journalism along with a constitutional right to a free press  think again  the times floated this small fact in their report  he site s influence on social media  where more and more americans now consume information  has been palpable  on election night  breitbart s facebook page received the fourth highest number of user interactions on the entire platform   beating fox news  cnn and the new york times  if they get big enough and command a large enough audience  other media outlets could fade to irrelevance  it snowballs from there  of course  the times says that breitbart s editor in chief totally rejects the idea that they could become trump s own propaganda mill  which is baloney  our loyalty is not going to be to donald trump  our loyalty is to our readers and to our values  that s regardless of what role steve has if trump runs his administration and honors the voters who voted him in  we re all good  but if he is going to turn his back on those values and principles that drove his voters to the polls  we re going to be highly critical  we re not going to think twice about it  trump and bannon can quietly use breitbart to push whatever they want  they can use its propaganda to counter what the mainstream media is saying  and people will buy it up lock  stock and barrel featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
