in perhaps the clearest example of the small  but egregious way donald trump lies about even the little things  he got caught screwing up less than  seconds after announcing that he  doesn t make mistakes  it unfolded like a scene from a comedy  trump  angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals  complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his white house  rather than admit he s only human  trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong  one mistake and it s no good  but we just can t make mistakes  right  so we don t make mistakes  ready for the punchline trump next passes the conversation over to  ken  go ahead  ken  that wasn t  ken   that s chuck canterbury  the head of the national fraternal order of police oops while flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about  it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in trump s white house  he s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said   no matter how false  trump never apologized for linking ted cruz s dad to the jfk assassination  his  apology  for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a  sorry  not sorry  publicity stunt  he can t even admit his unfounded claim that obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication but here s the really scary part  a lie as obvious as  i never make mistakes  brings us to an unsettling truism  if a person will lie about the little things  what will he do to cover up the big ones featured image via youtube
