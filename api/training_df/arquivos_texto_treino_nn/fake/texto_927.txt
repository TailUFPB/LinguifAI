from day one of donald trump s failure of a presidency  it was perfectly clear that the former reality television star thought he was a king and expected america to roll over and do whatever the hell he wanted  unfortunately for the unworthy potus  his presidency is panning out a lot differently than he imagined  and he s just been sent another great big  f ck you  by the united states trump s voter fraud conspiracy has just been dealt a major blow and suffered a humiliating defeat  as every single state in america is refusing to give up the voter data that trump is demanding  according to the washington post  in a rare display of bipartisanship  officials in nearly every state have said they will partially or fully refuse to comply with president trump s voting commission  which has encountered criticism and opposition after issuing a sweeping request for voter data nationwide  even as some of the resistance centers on trump and members of his commission  the broader responses from the states indicate a strong and widespread belief that local officials should be managing elections and that the white house s request for volumes of information went too far  that s right   america as a whole united and agreed that what trump wanted was unconstitutional or illegal  and made moves to protect americans  private data  this is not only extremely embarrassing for trump  but it also reveals that his administration is increasingly lazy and sloppy  having not even bothered to look and see if their request for the voter data was legal by state law unlike trump and his incompetent team  the majority of america is not so reckless and willing to bow down to a complete idiot  this will go down in the books as yet another one of trump s failures  as he is once again defeated by the checks and balances he thought he could overrun with his dictator style  leadership   way to go  america featured image via drew angerer   getty images
