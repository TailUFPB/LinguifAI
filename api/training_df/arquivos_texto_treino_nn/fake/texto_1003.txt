while on the campaign trail  donald trump  a former reality show star  repeatedly promised to repeal obamacare and his supporters cheered him on  now that the gop senate has revealed what they came up with after having years to create a viable alternative to obamacare  the reality is setting in  trumpcare benefits the rich and gives absolutely nothing to lower income americans and the middle class  but it does gift the wealthy with a nice tax break  on top of that  the cbo score released yesterday concludes that  million americans will lose insurance coverage under trump republicare  this move will largely affect red state residents who voted for donald trump on tuesday  a clearly emotional trump supporter told cnn s don lemon that there s no way he could afford health insurance if not for obamacare  he sure stuck it to liberals by voting for trump though  huh  ardent trump supporters never thought for a moment that trump s promise would be fulfilled  the  lock her up   and  build that wall  and  repeal obamacare  chants were all fun and games but slowly it s dawning on them  we need insurance coverage or we could potentially die  you re a lifelong republican  yet you and your wife are insured through obamacare   lemon told don riscoe   what will happen to that insurance if obamacare is repealed  we probably won t be insured  riscoe replied  you okay   lemon asked the visibly upset trump supporter  yes   riscoe replied   we won t be insured if obamacare goes away  we won t be able to afford premiums  do you know what it would cost you to get insurance on an open market and could you afford that   lemon asked riscoe  i know we can t afford it  it s over    a month   riscoe told the cnn host  it would be incredibly hard on you financially  that s what you re saying   lemon asked riscoe said   absolutely  we wouldn t be able to afford coverage without the affordable care act  so you voted for donald trump even though he promised to repeal the program you rely on   lemon said   why is that  because  riscoe said   i think that hopefully  they ll bring about something that will be fiscally sound that will last   he said that he thinks that  obamacare does have problems that do need to get fixed  i hope they ll be something in place so that we do have coverage  watch  riscoe is a florida resident  and that state will be hit the hardest  according to the aarp    of the state s residents age  to  would pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars more each year for coverage  mr  riscoe appears to be in that age group it s difficult to feel sorry for this trump supporter after he voted for a man who is doing exactly what he said he would do  did he think that repealing obamacare would only affect liberals without coverage  i could not afford to start the medical treatment that begins today  which would cost  without insurance  for a  week period      and that is just for one pill per day  with insurance  the treatment will cost me nothing    million americans have this disease  good luck  mr  riscoe  we hope he doesn t have any pre existing conditions like most of us do image via screen capture
