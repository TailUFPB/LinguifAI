trump s weekend trips to mar a lago and his nearby golf course have repeatedly been met with crowds of protesters  just yesterday  protesters surprised trump by showing up on his route to his golf course despite the fact that he had tried to keep the trip a secret  how d they know  unfortunately for trump  protesters correctly guessed that just  hours after he kickstarted a war in syria he would probably be back on his golf course pool  motorcade passed  group of about a dozen protesters w  signs reading  resign    loser   and  impeach trump  outside the golf course    kyle griffin     april    clearly doesn t enjoy seeing reminders that his presidency is highly unpopular  this appears to be trump s solution the newest addition to mar a lago  a helipad and trump chopper  pic twitter com   vivian salama   vmsalama  april    s administration claims the helipad was built to carry trump from the airport to his resort without interrupting traffic  they also conceded that traffic will likely still be blocked off or otherwise disrupted near the resort each time he is in town   roughly once a week  and like everything trump does  the helipad comes at the expense of the average people unlucky enough to live nearby trump s resort when the proposal was first drawn up  it faced criticism for its disruptions to the lives of those around the area jesse h  diner  a fort lauderdale attorney representing woodbridge avenue resident nancy demoss  urged commissioners to hold off on approving the project until they consider alternatives to the location  these are big helicopters  they re like flying tanks   diner said demoss requires around the clock health care that has been impacted by trump s weekend visits  diner said she and her family is worried that the loud helicopters will be a nuisance  and she is uncomfortable with the u s  coast guard boats sporting guns when trump is in town trump went ahead with the plan anyway adding more absurdity  trump s personal helicopter appears to be using the helipad this weekend  the official marine one  nor trump  have used the helipad so far  but a giant helicopter with trump s name printed in red across the tail sat in its spot  trump s staff said it would be  staged  there until sunday   a shameless photo op attempt it s also not clear whether trump or taxpayers are paying for the helipad used exclusively to indulge trump s golf obsession  the helipad was registered by the national trust for historic preservation suggesting trump wants to treat his helipad as a site of national significance as if it s mount rushmore and not an excuse for trump to take more vacations if the cost of the helipad indeed comes out of the pockets of taxpayers it will be a stiff addition to the already   million trump has spent taking vacations while president for just  weeks  at this rate  trump is projected to eclipse obama s entire cost of travel in just  months it s for this reason that trump appears desperate to rebrand his opulent resort as the  southern white house  in order to deflect criticisms that he s too often partying there instead of doing the job of president  it would be unsurprising to find that someday trump renames the  hole at his florida golf course after the oval office featured image via twitter
