the donald trump campaign is relying heavily on a  year old to help open a field office in one of the most important counties in the swing state of colorado  you read that right  a  year old is being relied upon to ensure that the thin skinned man baby candidate obtains keys to the white house weston imer is co chair of the campaign in jefferson county  but his mother  the official field coordinator  said that she gave her son the bulk of the work in order to help teach him responsibility weston sits in the office instructing volunteers on what to do  as well as making phone calls to trump supporters  get involved   kids need to be educated   weston said  according to kdvr  parents have the responsibility to educate their kids   laurel imer said weston will be at the field office every day until he has to start school in september  at the tender age of  years old  weston is likely in the  grade  do you want to be president of the united states one day   a reporter asked weston  definitely   watch for me and baron trump if you re watching  i ll take ya as my running mate   imer said watch the  year old would like to become president of the free world one day  we re pretty sure that donald  his idol  never dreamed he would get this close to the white house since he s done everything possible to discourage that donald trails hillary clinton by ten points in colorado  according to a fox news poll  again  we re talking about a fox news poll  it s not exactly surprising since donald s campaign doled out    million to his family and trump owned companies  instead of increasing spending on staff or organizing   like in crucial states such as colorado   the campaign spent    million on hats and other merchandise it s commendable that mrs  imer wants to teach her child responsibility but this is a presidential election in important battleground territory  aside from that  educating her child while using donald as a model for responsibility is counterproductive  donald is a scam artist  nothing more image via screen capture
