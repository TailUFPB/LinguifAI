on wednesday  donald trump warned the special counsel investigating the russia scandal not to look into his business or personal finances and that s exactly like saying   hey  special counsel robert mueller  look into my finances   well  that s just what happened  it s like after robbing a bank and the police stop you for running a red light  so you say   don t look in the trunk  so  as part of the probe into possible ties between the donald trump campaign and russia in the  presidential election  the special counsel is now is examining a broad range of transactions involving trump s businesses as well as those of his associates  according to what a person familiar with the probe told bloomberg fbi investigators and others are looking at russian purchases of apartments in trump buildings  trump s involvement in a controversial soho development in new york with russian associates  the  miss universe pageant in moscow and trump s sale of a florida mansion to a russian oligarch in   the person said the trump crime family and associates look like they re in deep sh t the investigation also has absorbed a money laundering probe begun by federal prosecutors in new york into trump s former campaign chairman paul manafort trump s lawyer  john dowd  said on thursday that the inquiry into trump s businesses is  unrelated  to last year s election  those transactions are in my view well beyond the mandate of the special counsel  are unrelated to the election of  or any alleged collusion between the trump campaign and russia and most importantly  are well beyond any statute of limitation imposed by the united states code   he stated in an email we disagree  there s a saying which goes like this   follow the money  and apparently  mueller has heard that wise quote before  there s a way that trump could clear this all up  it would require the sitting  president  to release his tax returns  you know  like all of his predecessors have done by the way  if trump s resort in florida mysteriously catches fire and he says   don t look in the garage for propellant  then i m pretty sure they will look into the garage  nevertheless  trump didn t see this coming  somehow photo by ann heisenfelt getty images
