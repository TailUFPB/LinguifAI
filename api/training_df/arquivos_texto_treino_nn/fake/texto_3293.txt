trump s inauguration is becoming one of the biggest jokes in presidential history  and it hasn t even happened yet the president elect has yet to convince any real talent to perform at his ceremony  with even b list celebrities turning down invites  the biggest name on trump s list of possibilities was renowned italian opera singer andrea bocelli  but according to the new york post  because of backlash from fans on social media  he has also declined to perform a source told the post  bocelli said there was no way he d take the gig       he was  getting too much heat  and he said no  with no real talent showing up  other than the mormon tabernacle choir  the rockettes and america s got talent singer jackie evancho  it s sad enough  but now it looks like former presidents are also resisting the event  so far  and we re less than a month away from this debacle  it looks like jimmy carter is the only former president who has confirmed that he will be in attendance politico reports carter  who endorsed clinton  announced at his sunday school class in georgia earlier this month that he would attend the inauguration following tradition  all former presidents are invited to attend the ceremony on jan   when trump will be sworn in  but not all living presidents have consistently attended the inaugurations of their successors president barack obama in  enjoyed the presence of all four living presidents  both bushes  carter and clinton   at his first inauguration  but the bushes skipped obama s second event in   citing george h w  bush s compromised health since trump s election  the clinton family have been virtually out of the public eye and because of the nasty events leading up to the election  this is not surprising  after the way hillary has been treated by trump and his supporters  it would make sense for former president bill clinton to decline to be in attendance  though some say this would be  petty  on their behalf and would make hillary look bad if she didn t show up  a spokesman for bill clinton declined to comment to politico regarding whether they would be there or not neither of the two bushes endorsed donald trump  most likely due to the brutal way trump mocked fellow republican candidate jeb bush  and while george sr  has already announced that he would not be at the ceremony  bush s spokesman  freddy ford said that george w  bush was still weighing his options and would probably not make a decision until january trump s inaugural committee did not respond to politico s request for comment  but it doesn t appear as if anyone wants to celebrate his so called  massive victory   as trump himself would say  things are looking pretty  sad  featured image via getty zach gibson
