after taking office  donald trump has repeatedly taken credit for president obama s economy and regularly touts jobs numbers on his twitter timeline  now that trump s economy is in effect  we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing   jobs last month while some of this can be attributed to natural disasters  trump has also failed to pass any major legislation job growth in august and july was revised down  to   less than previously reported  economists expected   new jobs instead of a   job loss the economy has added an average of   jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a   average over the past three months  showing a trend which is not in trump s favor axios reports economists widely blame the disruptive effects of hurricanes irma and harvey for the disappointing number  because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included september  are not counted as employed but the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth  suggested the slowdown is not all weather related after obama took office  he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars  but he did it  obama s economy took an upward swing  even after natural disasters such as hurricane sandy and the floods which ravaged louisiana  throughout his campaign  trump called obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents  that was far from the truth fact  obama took office during the worst recession since the great depression when the economy was losing   jobs a month and already had lost a record  percent of gdp  obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed  consecutive months of growth the unemployment rate  however  just fell to   percent  and we re sure trump will bring that up  let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward north korea  also  if trump manages to get the gop tax proposal in the works  we ll see more reports like this one but for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything obama has done  he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in  years photo  alex wong via getty images
