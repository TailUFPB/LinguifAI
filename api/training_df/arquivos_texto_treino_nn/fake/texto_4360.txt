still couldn t defend trump s blatant misogyny and racism  hell  pence himself is a misogynist  against the lgbt community  and fiercely anti worker and anti immigrant all in all  this tweetstorm during the vp debate shows us  yet again  how ill suited trump is for the office of the presidency and simply isn t fit to lead featured photo by joe raedle getty images  twitter
