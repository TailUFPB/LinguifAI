usually  once the peaceful transfer of power is complete  the outgoing administration lays low so as not to disrupt what the new administration is doing  however  since the gop has control of the entire federal government and most of the state level governments with the corrupt  incompetent donald trump at the helm  it is literally impossible for former officials of the obama white house to keep from weighing in  this is especially true since the gop senators have rolled out a  healthcare bill  that is literally nothing more than a massive tax cut for rich people  the most vulnerable among us will literally die if this monstrosity of a bill becomes law  therefore it should come as no surprise that former vice president joe biden is weighing in taking to twitter  uncle joe minced no words about what the gop is about to unleash upon the nation the senate health bill isn t about health care at all it s a wealth transfer  slashes care to fund tax cuts for the wealthy   corporations   joe biden   joebiden  june    medicaid hurts kids  the elderly  people with disabilities and those struggling with addiction  all for tax breaks for the wealthy   joe biden   joebiden  june    now  when so many communities are struggling with opioid addiction  the bill s drastic cuts to medicaid are cruel   joe biden   joebiden  june    s see a bill that actually tries to improve folks  health care  and then we can have a reasonable debate about how to best do that   joe biden   joebiden  june    would be great if paul ryan  mitch mcconnell  and all the rest of the gop wanted to actually help people  make no mistake though   they don t  they don t care about people  they care about themselves  keeping power  and making sure they and their rich friends get richer   even if it means that every day americans literally die in fact  it is perfectly plausible that paul ryan thinks that the most vulnerable among us deserve to die  after all  this is the man who openly admitted to dreaming about bringing about the end of the life saving care provided for the most vulnerable among us since he was a college kid  despite the fact that what he now calls  entitlements  are what got him through college after his father s death  as he paid for his education with the survivor s benefits  funny how people forget where they come from  isn t it oh  if only joe biden or hillary clinton were president  we might actually have some compassion at the top  instead of the sociopathic monstrosities who somehow pass for human beings that we have now featured image via leigh vogel getty images
