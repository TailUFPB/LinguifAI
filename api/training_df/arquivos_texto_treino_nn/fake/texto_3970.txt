what is it with trump supporters constantly threatening future president hillary clinton s life  oklahoma state rep  john bennett  who endorsed the donald last year  decided he needed a little something to help his re election bid next week  so he skipped straight from  lock her up  to  hang her and lock her up if you can t    a message that is sure to be popular with deplorables who happen to escape from their basket linking a far right blog post blaming clinton for the benghazi attacks  come on  guys  this dead horse is beginning to smell terrible   bennett offered a solution to dealing with this imagined criminal for her non existent crimes  murder after removing the post failed to make it go away because screenshots exist  bennett moved on to damage control  explaining that he doesn t wish death on anyone   because he apparently meant the kind of firing squad that shoots water guns  he explains that she should be charged with treason or thrown in jail for whatever the f ck he thinks she did this week  though he did not say whom would be the judge in this case since no actual judge would participate in this bit of dumbfuckery   we can only assume he would nominate himself to pronounce her guilty and get the ball rolling on the whole murder thing threatening a presidential candidate is a felony offense  but for some reason trumpsters never seem to be held responsible for their actions  hopefully  since this threat was made by an elected official  things will be different this time featured image via screengrab
