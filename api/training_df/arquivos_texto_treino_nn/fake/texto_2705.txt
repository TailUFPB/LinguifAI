donald trump hasn t even been president for a month  and already americans  and the world  are extremely concerned about the future of this country  one of those people is nancy pelosi  the highest ranking democrat in the house of representatives  and she delivered a few stunning comments recently in condemnation of trump s terrifying choice of steve bannon for the national security council bannon is well known as a white supremacist  and pelosi wasn t afraid to call him just that  while republicans have sugar coated and flat out lied when it comes to trump s disgraceful behavior and choices  pelosi pointed out the severity of the situation when she blasted trump for this reckless decision stating that she was in full support of gop rep  jason chaffetz s idea to require presidents to pass a mental evaluation  pelosi said she  can t wait  until this is actually a reality  what s making america less safe is to have a white supremacist named to the national security council as a permanent member while the chairman of the joint chiefs and the director of national intelligence are told   don t call us  we ll call you  you re no longer permanent members     it s a stunning thing that a white supremacist  bannon  would be a permanent member of the national security council   you probably are aware of this  but i found it intriguing that house oversight committee chairman  chaffetz told the washington post that he was weighing legislation that  in essence  says that if you re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes  we should probably know what mental state you re in  i can t wait until he introduces that legislation to be able to join as a cosponsor of that   i think it s a very good idea  we all know that if trump were required to pass a mental exam  he would be done for  he lacks the temperament  the intelligence and the focus to make logical  sound decisions and he is far more preoccupied with defending his tiny hands and inauguration crowds than improving the country  pelosi is far from alone in being concerned about trump s mental state   most of americans  and many psychologists  agree that he needs an evaluation  asap you can watch pelosi s remarks below featured image via win mcnamee and pool   getty images
