after eleventy billion investigations into hillary clinton  her handling of benghazi  and the whole brouhaha over her emails  the gop is getting desperate  the fbi has been giving emails to the house oversight committee  and one republican congressman is very unhappy about the way they re doing it he wants to know just one simple thing   why do the fbi s document releases coincide with federal holidays yes  that s an actual  official question that rep  michael turner  r oh  asked fbi director james comey about how they re releasing information  please explain how the fbi s procedures for processing documents and information to the public coincide with these federal holidays  and how those procedures could be improved to ensure greater public awareness  and reduce the appearance of political motivations  the fbi told the house that it would release information and documents as they became available  no matter the day of the week  they had to know that could include weekends and holidays  some information was released over the independence day weekend  but not independence day itself   and more was released over the labor day weekend  but not labor day itself   coincidence  yes  but intentional  turner needs a lot more than that to accuse the fbi of playing politics there are no words for how laughably nonsensical this is really  turner s attempt to make this look like a political ploy on the part of the fbi is  in fact  a political ploy on his part  carried out on behalf of the republicans who are terrified of hillary when the fbi decided not to press charges against hillary for mishandling classified info  the house decided to open a new investigation into whether she lied under oath  anything to prove that she s a criminal in presidential clothing  they also pushed to re open the investigation into her private server recently  and there s a huge push to investigate whether there were improper dealings between the clinton foundation and the department of state if they have a legitimate case  they should pursue it in a legitimate manner  posing this kind of a question to the fbi just shows that they re more scared of hillary than they re trying to let on featured image by alex wong getty images
