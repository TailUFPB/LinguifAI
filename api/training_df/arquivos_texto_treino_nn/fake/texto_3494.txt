trump mouthpiece kayleigh mcenany attacked former labor secretary robert reich on thursday night and quickly discovered that she was out of her depth while cnn awaited donald trump s appearance at a rally  anderson cooper turned to reich for his thoughts on trump conflicts of interest and his cabinet selections reich slammed trump s picks  pointing out that he has chosen people to run departments that they want to destroy  for instance  jeff sessions has been chosen to run the department of justice and he s an opponent of civil rights and the voting right act  betsy devos hates public education and she has been chosen to run the education department  and andrew puzder was recently chosen to run the labor department even though he is hostile towards workers and opposes minimum wage  overtime pay  and basic labor regulations well  of course  kayleigh mcenany threw a hissy fit about what reich said and she proceeded to attack him and offer a pathetic defense of trump s choices  i just want to quickly say to secretary reich  i thought it was really unfair the way you characterize the cabinet picks   she began   you know jeff sessions is a great guy  he s not against the voting rights act  but that s not true  jeff sessions is  in fact  against the voting rights act  he has often claimed that its provisions are unconstitutional and actually cheered when the supreme court gutted a key piece of it in  and then mcenany defended trump s labor pick  i think the pick today  mr  puzder  is a guy who his employees have said he cares about the cashier the same way he cares about the business owners   mcenany said   i think it s really unfair to characterize him that way  she continued to defend puzder by noting that he only opposes the federal minimum wage  which really doesn t help since without federal minimum wage many red states would set their already low wages even lower  she then accused reich of attacking puzder just because he s a conservative  just because he s conservative  it doesn t mean he s anti worker   she whined but reich was prepared for such bullshit and promptly ripped mcenany a new one  i m not saying he s anti worker because he s conservative   reich replied  i m saying he s anti worker because he s anti worker  the department of labor came into his restaurants and found that half his restaurants had wage and labor violations that violated the law of the united states  you think that s pro worker  you think it s pro worker that his weekly paycheck equals the average yearly paycheck of his workers and he s against a minimum wage increase  you think that is pro worker  i m sorry i ve never heard of that  mcenany then resorted to accusing reich of being a socialist and claimed that puzder is qualified because he s a rich fast food ceo  of course  she doesn t mention that he s a staunch opponent of the  fight for     a movement by fast food workers to raise the minimum wage to   an hour  in other words  he has a conflict of interest because by taking the labor secretary job he can destroy the drive for fair wages that his own employees are part of and reich called mcenany out for it  but why should they be secretary of labor when they are in charge of enforcing the labor laws and they have a record of not even obeying the labor laws   he asked mcenany then spouted bullshit about how trickle down will work because it worked in the   which forced reich to shut her down  it did not work in the    reich forcefully declared   wages were flat the median wage started to flatten and decline  and that s because we had a president who believe in supply side trickle down economics and nothing trickled down nothing nothing trickled down to typical workers  here s the video via youtube indeed  the only people who saw gains because of reagan s policies were the wealthy  and his economic policies are still punishing americans to this day and all republicans want to do is double down on them like they did in kansas  and as we all know  kansas  economy has imploded the next time mcenany thinks about attacking a former labor secretary who was also a former harvard professor and current professor at the university of california at berkeley  she should just keep her mouth shut  she won t embarrass herself that way featured image  screenshot
