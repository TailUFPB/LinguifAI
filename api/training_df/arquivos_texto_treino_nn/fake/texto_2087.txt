we all knew that donald trump would be a nightmare for the supreme court  his nominee  judge neil gorsuch  is trying to present himself as some sort of legal scholar who will enforce the law fairly regardless of his personal views  however  his past is coming back to haunt him  and it turns out that he is a a misogynistic bastard   and would make horrific decisions when it comes to protecting women s rights in the workplace  in a letter written to the judiciary  a former student of judge gorsuch from his days as a law school professor says the following of his views regarding women in the workplace  judge gorsuch outlined how law firms  and companies in general  had to ask female interviewees about pregnancy plans in order to protect the company  at least one student countered that an employer could not ask questions about an interviewee s pregnancy plans  however  judge gorsuch informed the class that was wrong  instead judge gorsuch told the class that not only could a future employer ask female interviewees about their pregnancy and family plans  companies must ask females about their family and pregnancy plans to protect the company  another anonymous declaration to the judiciary also confirmed and complained of gorsuch s views on working women  saying that he said that many female lawyers became pregnant  and questioned whether they should do so on their law firms  dime  this goes against a ruling from the court in   which says of asking women about deeply personal issues such as family planning  which says  historically  denial or curtailment of women s employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first  and workers second  this prevailing ideology about women s roles has in turn justified discrimination against women when they are mothers or mothers to be  this opinion was authored by chief justice renquist  and it went on to say  these mutually reinforcing stereotypes created a self fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver  and fostered employers  stereotypical views about women s commitment to work and their value to employees  this should come as no surprise  after all  trump himself  as well as mike pence  are huge misogynists  however  it is downright terrifying  if this guy is confirmed to the supreme court  he ll turn back women s rights  years  and let s not even get started on women s reproductive health  roe v  wade will be gone in a heartbeat with this guy democrats  if ever there was an important fight to take on  it s this one  keep neil gorsuch off the supreme court  no matter what it takes featured image via alex wong getty images
