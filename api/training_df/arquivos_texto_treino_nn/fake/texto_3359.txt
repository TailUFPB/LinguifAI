donald trump s desperate effort to make people ignore the fact that russia helped him win the election runs contrary to american values and van jones ripped him for it during a panel discussion on cnn this sunday about trump s reaction to russian interference with our political process  jones chimed in with a searing takedown  this is baffling to anybody with a functioning brain stem   jones began   we have to be honest about this  indeed  the cia and  intelligence agencies along with the fbi all agree that russia launched a cyber attack against our political institutions with one of the goals being to help trump beat hillary clinton now vladimir putin will have a puppet in the white house for the next four years who refuses to condemn russia because it would acknowledge that he is illegitimate  yes  other presidents have tried to say nice things about the russians   jones continued   not in the face of an active attack on the country  it s true  past presidents have made attempts to be friendly toward russia  but trump is doing so after our intelligence community just concluded that russia committed espionage  which is an act of war  against our country  but trump is defending russia instead  cyber war is real war   jones explained   so you have an active attack on our country and you have the president elect who cannot find in himself to say this is wrong and it needs to stop  jones pointed out that trump has responded personally and as a partisan to attacks  but has demonstrated an unwillingness to respond as a patriot to an attack on our nation s sacred election infrastructure  this is an attack on our country   jones said in conclusion   and i just think that everybody sitting here trying to pretend this is normal  this is not normal and it s dangerous  here s the video via youtube donald trump recently demanded that china return a united states navy drone they seized in the south china sea  he s more upset about that than the attack on our democracy perpetrated by russia  that s unacceptable and it s why trump is unfit to be president featured image via screenshot
