remember the pro trump white supremacist pac that was placing robocalls on the donald s behalf during the primaries  yeah  well  they re back  and this time  they have unleashed a xenophobic radio ad touting donald trump as the champion of christians william daniel johnson  a los angeles attorney  was happy to foot the bill for the new ad via the super pac american national  the white nationalist pac is not actually affiliated with the trump campaign  but man  they just love the gop nominee and his bigoted messages  our country is at a crossroads and time is running out   the ad begins  it then throws in some good old fashioned anti brown people fearmongering and asks   do you want a strong leader who will secure our borders and stop the flow of illegal aliens and radical islamic terrorists   and follows up with a reminder that a vote for trump is clearly a vote for jesus  asking  do you want a president who will safeguard the interests of christians  so just who is william johnson  well  for starters  he a well known white supremacist who says he wants to create  a white ethno state because  that s the only way western civilization and the white race will survive  johnson is also serving as the president of the american freedom party  afp   according to the southern poverty law center  the afp was  initially established by racist southern california skinheads   and aims to deport immigrants and return the united states to white rule  there was an uproar when it was discovered that the trump campaign had chosen johnson to serve as a delegate  following the backlash  the campaign claimed it was all a mistake due to a database error   and johnson stepped down  the afp said it was no big deal because plenty of other of white supremacists were serving as trump delegates the robocalls johnson sponsored during the primaries featured such phrases as   we don t need muslims  we need smart  well educated white people   in another call  an older woman identified herself as a proud member of the afp and said  i am voting for donald trump because he will not only be presidential  he will put america first  furthermore  he will respect all women and will help preserve western civilization  trump was pressured into giving one of his half ass condemnations of the robocalls  but he followed it up by excusing the calls as simply the result of people being angry  so no harm  no foul johnson also set up a   hotline offering legal advice and emotional support to trump fans who felt they had been bullied by one of hillary s evil liberal minions the radio ad is scheduled to air in alabama  arizona  florida  missouri  nevada  oregon  and tennessee featured image via  christopher gregory getty images
