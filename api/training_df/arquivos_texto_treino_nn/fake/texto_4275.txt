donald trump s lewd comments about sexually assaulting women in a  leaked audio tape are wreaking havoc on his presidential campaign  not only are prominent republicans distancing themselves from him  but even his own running mate  mike pence  looks like he s about to jump ship first  pence pulled out of a wisconsin rally  where donald trump said pence would be taking the place of house speaker paul ryan  who also canceled following the tape s release  now  pence has canceled a new jersey fundraiser for trump that was supposed to take place today   signaling a trend of upcoming disruptions in trump s campaign schedule  there were supposed to be  people at this event  who all paid   to attend this isn t surprising  considering how strongly pence opposed trump s disrespectful  misogynistic comments in the  recording  trump s running mate released a statement that said  as a husband and father  i was offended by the words and actions described by donald trump in the eleven year old video released yesterday  i do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them  this cancellation is even more questionable considering that on trump s campaign website  a message showed that all mike pence events had been canceled trump website the site was later updated with two new events for today   in north carolina instead of new jersey   but this is certainly a strange move for a campaign  trump spokeswoman hope hicks has not yet returned comment on whether pence would actually be attending the north carolina events   we wouldn t be surprised if he skipped those  too it could very well be that trump s degrading  rape like comments about how he interacts with women were the final straw for the republican party  and the final straw for pence  it s bad enough that pence and trump have previously disagreed on several policies and issues   but now it seems that trump has crossed the line and pence can t stand to represent him any longer featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
