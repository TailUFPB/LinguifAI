donald trump has repeatedly shown that he has zero respect for the independent judiciary  every time a judge rules in a way he dislikes  he attacks the judge  the court system  and claims that he is the victim of some kind of political witch hunt  therefore  it should come as no surprise that he has flat out refused to hand over a key memo  drawn up by mega trump fan and former new york city mayor rudy giuliani we all remember how giuliani went on fox news and admitted that trump had asked him to find a way to keep the oft touted campaign promise of banning muslims   but  of course  to make sure whatever order they came up with to do that passed constitutional muster  given these damning words  it s no surprise that trump doesn t want a judge to see the memo that giuliani drew up for him  the american civil liberties union is taking trump s lawlessness on  though  miriam aukerman  senior staff attorney for the aclu of michigan  says of the situation  if  as the administration claims  the executive order is not a muslim ban  then why is the administration refusing to turn over the giuliani memo  what is in that document that the government doesn t want the court to see  the aclu  along with several state attorneys general and other civil rights organizations have sued trump and his government over the obvious discrimination  and it is pretty clear that they are not done fighting trump was supposed to have that memo to a judge in detroit by may   and it has yet to materialize  we all know why   trump s executive order is most definitely a muslim ban  and that memo will show it  hell  i don t know who they think they are fooling here  giuliani himself admitted that this is what trump had asked him to do  we also  of course  have trump s own words to prove exactly what the intent is here as well trump is quickly learning that no one is above the law in this nation   not even the so called  president  featured image via michael reynolds getty images
