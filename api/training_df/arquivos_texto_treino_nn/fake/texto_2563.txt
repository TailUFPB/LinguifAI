we can expect another angry  weeks long tantrum from donald trump after meryl streep s speech at the human right s campaign s  greater new york gala dinner on saturday  suddenly  at one point in the  century  for reasons i can t possibly enumerate in my two remaining minutes  the clouds parted  something changed   streep said  speaking of the advances in civil rights we have made in recent history   for the first time in   years  women began to be regarded as  if not equal  at least deserving of equal rights  men and women of color demanded their equal rights  people of sexual orientation and gender identification outside the status quo also demanded equal regard under the law   but then she turned her eye toward an orange  thin skinned coward who threatens to undo decades and decades or work  which brings us to now  we should not be surprised that fundamentalists  of every stripe  are exercised  and fuming  we should not be surprised that these profound changes come at a steeper cost than we originally though  if we live through this precarious moment  if his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn t lead us to nuclear winter  we will have much to thank our current leader for  he will have woken us up to how fragile freedom is  the whip of the executive  through a twitter feed  can lash and intimidate  punish and humiliate  delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic regularity and easily provoked predictability   she told the crowd streep recently sent trump into a rage fit after her speech at the  golden globes when she went for trump s throat over his decision to mock a disabled reporter s condition  this instinct to humiliate  when it s modeled by someone in the public platform  by someone powerful  it filters down into everybody s life  because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing  disrespect invites disrespect  violence incites violence  and when the powerful use their position to bully others  we all lose  trump has been very stressed lately with his muslim ban dying in multiple courts and all  we can probably expect the donald to cheer himself up by attacking streep again  which he seems to think is his job  watch some clips from her speech below sing for us all  meryl streep    hrc pic twitter com   jordan roth   jordanroth  february    streep pays tribute to lgbtq pioneers and those on the front lines of fighting for civil rights  pic twitter com   raymond braun   raymondbraun  february    image via screengrab
