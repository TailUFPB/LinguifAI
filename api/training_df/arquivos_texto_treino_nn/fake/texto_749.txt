on monday night  donald trump traveled to west virginia to give a speech to a bunch of boy scouts   you know  children  in that speech  instead of inspiring them and being a role model  trump chose to swear  re litigate his electoral college victory  talk about cocktail parties  and rant about political issues  of course  this is a stunningly inappropriate speech for any adult to give to little kids  much less for someone in trump s position to do it there have been many responses to this insanity  but perhaps the best one came from pete souza  the enthusiastic photographer in the obama white house  souza s instagram account has become a goldmine of images trolling trump s most outrageous moments  and this one was no different  souza posted the following photo during trump s speech of president obama greeting a young boy scout in the oval office   petesouza on instagram responds to trump s boy scouts speech pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  july    course  it also bears pointing out that president obama was in the indonesian equivalent of the boy scouts  while obviously trump was never any kind of scout  plus  when it comes to character  obama exudes what the scouts strive to be  while trump is everything they don t want anyone to be the striking part of all of this  though  is to show just how low we have gone as a country to have this orange fascist and his goons running it  trump is racist  misogynistic  xenophobic  vindictive  a bully  and a con man  on the other side of that  president obama was easily one of the most extraordinary human beings to ever hold that office  he is  as a person  the very definition of class and dignity oh  america  what have we done  how did we elect a man who is the best role model we could ask for when it comes to having behavior in the oval office we want future generations to emulate  to having a fraudulent vulgarian in there who exhibits behavior even toddlers know better to engage in we can only speculate  but thank goodness for pete souza s instagram account to help us remember what it was like to have a real president featured image via official white house photo by pete souza
