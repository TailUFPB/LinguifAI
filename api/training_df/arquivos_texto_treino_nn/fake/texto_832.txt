how the hell can anybody call themselves intelligent when they re supporting donald trump  it s a question that baffles people who are able to think critically  able to read and comprehend both history and current events  and able to see through trump s thin fa ade of know it all ism and deep into what he is   an ignorant  narcissistic  and dangerous conman trump supporters not only don t see this  they re happy that there s someone running for president that thinks exactly like them  take melanie austin  of brownsville  pennsylvania  she thought her beliefs about obama being a gay muslim from kenya and michelle being transgender were just fringe beliefs   right up until she started hearing similar stuff from trump and other right wing extremists now she knows she s right about all of this  you can t tell her that she s ignorant and dumb if she can t figure this out for herself  you can t tell her she s delusional  you can sit there with her  and countless others like her  and present facts  figures  charts  studies  and more  all from the most reputable sources there are  and prove that her lord and savior is wrong  and you ll still get shot down there s more to this than the problem of confirmation bias  austin gets much of her information from fringe right wing blogs and conspiracy sites  but that s not all of it  many of trump s supporters are seriously too dumb to know they re dumb  it s called the dunning kruger effect  and it s an unshakeable illusion that you re much smarter  and more skilled and or knowledgeable  than you really are people like austin labor under the illusion that their knowledge about things is at least as good as  if not better than  the actual facts  for these people  though  their knowledge isn t just superior   it s superior even to those who have intimate and detailed knowledge of the subject at hand  trump himself has exemplified this countless times  such as when he claimed he knows more about isis than even our military generals do his fans simply take his word for it  and believe that because he knows  they know  they are literally incapable of seeing that they don t know to be sure  the dunning kruger effect is present everyone all across the political spectrum  and indeed  in every walk of life  we all overestimate our abilities and knowledge somewhere  however  the effect is especially pronounced in people with limited intellectual and social skills  eople who are unskilled in  suffer a dual burden  not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices  but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it  so basically  yes  it s possible to be too dumb to realize you re dumb in four separate studies  people who scored in the bottom quarter on tests involving everything from humor to logic  and even to grammar  grossly overestimated where they thought they would score  they averaged scores in the  percentile  while their average estimate of their own scores was the  percentile the researchers attribute that huge discrepancy to a literal inability to distinguish accuracy from error  or  to put it another way  those who are the most lacking in skills and knowledge are the least able to see it take the case of mcarthur wheeler  a man who robbed two banks in  and was caught rather easily  he thought he would get away with it because he rubbed his face with lemon juice  which is used in invisible ink  to test the theory that lemon juice would turn him invisible  he rubbed it on his face  took a polaroid  and his face wasn t in the picture  so he thought he was safe from security cameras because he could make his face invisible he was shocked when police caught him because of that  saying   but i wore the juice   he literally couldn t see the ridiculousness of that line of thought  david dunning  one of the first to catalog the dunning kruger effect  hence its name   has studied human behavior including voter behavior for decades  he penned an op ed in politico that explains why this effect is so pronounced in trump s supporters  it suggests that some voters  especially those facing significant distress in their life  might like some of what they hear from trump  but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes  they fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps   again  the key to the dunning kruger effect is not that unknowledgeable voters are uninformed  it is that they are often misinformed their heads filled with false data  facts and theories that can lead to misguided conclusions held with tenacious confidence and extreme partisanship  perhaps some that make them nod in agreement with trump at his rallies  trump is completely inept  and his supporters are way too poorly informed to know that he s inept  and too dumb themselves to know how dumb they are  that s why trump s supporters are so sure they re smart and their president is smart that they won t listen to reason  the effect is strong in these people featured image by mark wilson getty images
