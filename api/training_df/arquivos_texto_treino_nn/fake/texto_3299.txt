the national school lunch program that provides healthy free or reduced meals for children in need has joined social security  medicaid  and medicare as yet another program republicans want to gut in  not only do republicans want to take social security away from the american people and take away healthcare for adults and children alike  they apparently also want to let children starve at school  too for years  both parties supported the school lunch program  but republicans have becomes so greedy and heartless that they are breaking that spirit of cooperation in order to ruthlessly take food out of the mouths of the children who need it most the program currently costs    billion  which is a drop in the bucket considering donald trump just called for expanding america s nuclear weapons stockpile  which will cost way more than a school lunch clearly  trump nor the republicans have ever heard president dwight eisenhower s chance for peace speech calling excess military spending a theft from the american people every gun that is made  every warship launched  every rocket fired signifies  in the final sense  a theft from those who hunger and are not fed  those who are cold and are not clothed  this world in arms is not spending money alone  it is spending the sweat of its laborers  the genius of its scientists  the hopes of its children  the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this  a modern brick school in more than  cities  it is two electric power plants  each serving a town of   population  it is two fine  fully equipped hospitals  it is some fifty miles of concrete pavement  we pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat  we pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than   people        this is not a way of life at all  in any true sense  under the cloud of threatening war  it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron indeed  while republicans are only too happy to increase military spending way beyond our needs  they are more than willing to sacrifice the care of the american people to do it low income families rely on the school lunch program to make sure their kids have something good to eat during the day  eating well helps children learn better and develop healthy eating habits but republican don t care republicans are targeting the school lunch program because they claim the kids aren t eating the food because it s too healthy  they also claim that the program  risks becoming insolvent   which is bullshit because congress funds the program also  while there are always complaints when change occurs  experts agree that schools are adapting and and number of complaints have dropped according to huffington post margo wootan  director of nutrition policy at the advocacy group center for science in the public interest  said the gop attack on the program was  out of touch with the progress that s been made  improving school lunches wootan acknowledged there were well founded complaints about the program s stricter standards  but the gripes have declined as schools have adapted  she described freedom caucus opposition as  purely political anti government sentiment  that upends the program s historical support from both parties indeed  it appears republicans only want to gut the program because michelle obama made it her focus over the last eight years to improve the nutritional value of school lunches in other words  republicans are being petty because they hate president obama and the first lady in fact  food waste in america s schools has always been a problem but a study in  published by the american journal of preventative medicine found that the new meal standards ushered in by michelle obama did make food waste worse so republicans are attacking the program for no real reason and are apparently willing to hurt the well being and health of children if it means hurting michelle obama these conservatives are truly sick monsters featured image  childrensadvocate org
