donald trump doesn t exactly hide the fact that he s a sociopath  just looking at the most recent events this country has faced  we ve witnessed the president of the united states turn his back on human suffering and be completely indifferent to those in need  as we saw with the hurricane that ravaged puerto rico and the las vegas massacre  trump is constantly missing in action and spending more time on twitter than actually doing his job  that s why the latest move by trump and his campaign shouldn t surprise anyone  even though it s downright heartless on saturday  trump s campaign sent out a fundraising email that was so disgusting  it immediately drew attention on twitter  in the email  trump exploited the mass shooting in las vegas to raise funds for his pathetic re election campaign  in the trump pence weekly newsletter  the trump campaign spoke to potential donors and supporters of trump  mentioning trump s recent visit to las vegas  the emails said  our nation is still in shock and mourning following the massacre of  concertgoers and hundreds of others injured in las vegas  then  the email states that trump and first lady melania had spoken to victims and given credit to first responders  we know that your sorrow feels endless  we stand together to help you carry your pain  you can catch a glimpse of the horrific email below unreal  the trump campaign just sent an email using the las vegas shooting to fundraise for the campaign  pic twitter com   matt mcdermott   mattmfm  october    has been doing fundraiser after fundraiser in preparation for his re election campaign  which is somewhat hilarious considering that his approval rating just hit a new historic low  one thing is for sure  though   if trump wants to appeal to the american people  he might want to stop exploiting tragedies for his personal gain featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
