while they are sad and in understandable despair  liberals are not simply sitting shell shocked over the election of donald trump to the presidency  very aware of the danger the newly elected republican government will mean for vulnerable citizens  liberals are rushing to the defense of key organizations that have been targeted by republicans few groups have been the subject of republican and conservative attacks like planned parenthood has  and now liberals are letting them know they ve got their backs since the election  the planned parenthood federation of america said it has received nearly   new donations nationwide  although it did not disclose the money amount planned parenthood of illinois said online appointments for long acting contraceptives like iuds  or intrauterine devices  rose nearly  percent in the past two days compared to the same period last week  it said it plans to increase the number of available appointments to meet demand  we have been overwhelmed by community members making donations and contacting us to offer to volunteer and provide support   said sarah wheat  spokeswoman for planned parenthood of greater texas  where successive republican governors have cut funding to the organization republicans have gone after planned parenthood because they provide birth control and abortion access to women  regardless of income  the right has gone after them with hoax videos designed to implicate the group in criminal acts  brought its leaders before congress in order to berate them without cause  and voted over and over and over to cut federal funding president obama and congressional democrats have repeatedly pushed back against the republican onslaught  but many of the measures they have put in place have been weakened by sustained republican obstruction over the last eight years  many of these protections can be undone by a trump presidency  and while trump himself has not strongly pushed on the abortion issue  many republicans will be looking to him in to attack women s health featured image via flickr
