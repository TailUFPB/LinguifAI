after a brief and almost meaningless visit to texas  during which donald trump didn t meet with a single victim of hurricane harvey  the president s cavalcade moved on to missouri  where he returned to what he really cares about  more money for wealthy people he s first  of course  his tweets from wednesday morning prove unequivocally that the only victim he cares about is himself  he sent out a placating message about  horror and devastation   which he didn t ask even one harvey refugee about  just  minutes after a tweet about north korea  and only  minutes before he went back into martyr mode  after reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines  it makes me wonder  why  all i want to do is  maga   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    that much obsession on his own well being  why wouldn t the next logical step be another campaign style stop to try and convince people to support his awful tax plan  did i say campaign style  what i mean is  this was not a white house event  this was straight up partisan  if donald trump operated under the rule of law  the rnc would have to reimburse taxpayers for his missouri speech  in which he explicitly called for the ouster of a democratic senator  claire mccaskill  speaking to a crowd in springfield  trump said we must lower our taxes and your senator  claire mccaskill  she must do this for you  and if she doesn t  you have to vote her out of office that s campaigning  not laying out policy  but he doesn t have much policy yet to reveal  the gop has yet to agree on much of what will go into their  tax reform  package  trump himself would like to see the  business  tax rate lowered to    a number so low that it would cripple the government without slashing spending on the poor  but even most republicans oppose so low a rate  and his plans for  tax relief for the middle class and repatriating offshore profits  are  so far  still out in the ether somewhere the bottom line is  now that he s got that awful trip to texas out of the way  trump is on the warpath  and his only focus is now on winning  he even warned the members of his party not to disappoint him on taxes  the way they did on trumpcare i am fully committed to working with congress to get this job done  and i don t want to be disappointed by congress  do you understand me oh  we understand  donnie  you were embarrassed by mitch mcconnell and humiliated by john mccain  so now you want a mcvictory to soothe your fiery case of butthurt  americans see through your  tax reforms   though  the rich get richer and the poor get poorer  it s the republican way featured image via michael b  thomas getty images
