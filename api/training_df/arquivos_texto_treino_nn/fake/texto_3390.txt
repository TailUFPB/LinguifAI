the double talk that spews forth from king cheeto s mouth is astonishing  if for no other reason than so many people believe all of it  he s a liar  he s a hypocrite  he s an autocrat  he s a narcissist  and he promises to continue talking out of both sides of his mouth the same as he did on the campaign trail and his audiences will continue to eat up every syllable  why on earth do they do that  matt bai  a political columnist at yahoo  news  boils it down to this one sentence  trump is a pure opportunist  a pitch perfect crooner of whatever note resonates   boom  there it is  right there  trump knows exactly what will make people respond favorably to him and he says it  in doing so  he renders anything he said before irrelevant  no matter how contradictory  look at all his cabinet picks that followed his promise of  draining the swamp  of washington insiders  elites and cronies  his cabinet is wall street bankers  it s establishment politicians  it s members of the very same military leadership he called stupid during his campaign trump embodies a type of leader known as the  charismatic leader   and that s not necessarily a good thing  true  not all charismatic leaders are bad  but they aren t all good either  in trump s case  this is a very bad thing  in management today  columnist adam gale says the world that trump comes from is one where  force of personality is more important than collaboration or cold reasoning  that s all that matters  and why we re suddenly living in a post fact world  facts  truths  and reason don t matter if trump can convince people they don t matter  and he himself admitted to playing his audiences like the violins they re not in the art of the deal  i play to people s fantasies  people may not always think big themselves  but they can still get very excited by those who do  that s why a little hyperbole never hurts   think he won t do that as president  think again   he s already done it  his loyal subjects still bleat about how amazing he is to have struck a deal with carrier to keep jobs here in the u s  they completely ignore the facts that carrier is still sending jobs to mexico and is planning to raise prices  they don t seem to care that they re going to automate their indiana plant  which will destroy some of those jobs trump supposedly saved so they can keep their costs down  their parent company s ceo  greg hayes  said that outright  we re going to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive  is it as cheap as moving to mexico with lower cost labor  no  but we will make that plant competitive just because we ll make the capital investments there  but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs  in the case of the carrier deal  trumpkins  specific fantasy is the idea that trump can coerce  cajole  and even strongarm companies  one by one  into not only keep jobs here  but also into at least maintaining their current workforce  or adding more jobs  the fantasy is that trump is going to be able to erase every individual s personal economic distress that s impossible  but that s what they see through their rose colored glasses  there are other fantasies  too  like this  my whole life i ve been greedy  greedy  greedy  i ve grabbed all the money i could get  i m so greedy  but now i d like to be greedy for the united states  washington post columnist and the nation publisher katrina vanden heuvel hit the nail of that trumpkin fantasy on the head with this  it was a compelling story  the rapacious mogul turned robin hood  setting out to reform the rigged system that made him rich in the name of the common good  she went on to describe how that s an illusion that trump has created for his faithful subjects  but which his actual policy positions during his campaign should have shattered this is how trump s followers can keep right on crowing about trump s awesomeness and how he s the president we need to be great again  one could even say that they re brainwashed in a very real way  they also seem to be too stupid to see how stupid they are  but that s a different subject  oh sure  there are a few who are angry  there are a few who have woken up  former congressman joe walsh  of illinois  is one such person  and agreeing with that man on anything at all makes us feel like we re in a bizarre alternate reality where night is day  hell is cold  and dragons really do exist  but  well  there it is  sarah palin called out his deal with carrier as crony capitalism but so many others  they re on social media being as trashy as ever toward the press  toward democrats  toward anyone who doesn t march exactly to trump s drumbeat  they re calling any news that doesn t reinforce the golden crown they see on cheetolini s head  fake news   and completely ignoring how many campaign promises trump has already broken  they trust him implicitly because he knows exactly how to sing their tune in perfect time and pitch  whether he means it is irrelevant and he ll keep right on playing them  bai said he ll do it until someone can prove to him that there s a real cost  bai is right featured image by chip
