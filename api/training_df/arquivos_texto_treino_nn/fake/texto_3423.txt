donald trump isn t exactly a stickler for facts and he has made it clear that he is not convinced that climate change is real  heck  he doesn t necessarily even believe that science is real  maybe global warming is just a chinese  hoax   right  and the people he has picked for his cabinet are far from environmentally friendly well  scientists have taken notice and are taking action  they are scrambling to copy u s  climate data before trump s administration has the chance to make it all just disappear the washington post reports the efforts include a  guerrilla archiving  event in toronto  where experts will copy irreplaceable public data  meetings at the university of pennsylvania focused on how to download as much federal data as possible in the coming weeks  and a collaboration of scientists and database experts who are compiling an online site to harbor scientific information nick santos  an environmental researcher at the university of california at davis  is one of the scientists who is not risking it  over the weekend he started copying government climate data onto a public server  something that seemed a little paranoid to me before all of a sudden seems potentially realistic  or at least something you d want to hedge against   santos said  doing this can only be a good thing  hopefully  they leave everything in place  but if not  we re planning for that  michael halpern  who is the deputy director of the center for science and democracy at the advocacy group union of concerned scientists  said in an email that the people trump has picked to head up government agencies so far have been a  band of climate conspiracy theorists  they have been salivating at the possibility of dismantling federal climate research programs for years  it s not unreasonable to think they would want to take down the very data that they dispute   he wrote   there is a fine line between being paranoid and being prepared  and scientists are doing their best to be prepared        scientists are right to preserve data and archive websites before those who want to dismantle federal climate change research programs storm the castle  trump has never said he intends to manipulate scientific data  but scientists located across the country aren t taking chances  researchers at the university of pennsylvania are feverishly trying to figure out the best ways to copy and preserve their data the university of toronto is holding a guerrilla archiving  event this weekend to collect vital federal environmental data before trump takes office  according to organizers  the event  is focused on preserving information and data from the environmental protection agency  which has programs and data at high risk of being removed from online public access or even deleted  this includes climate change  water  air  toxics programs  lawyers with the climate science legal defense fund will be available to meet one on one with concerned researchers at the american geophysical union s fall meeting in san francisco  the organization is also handing out booklets at the event titled   handling political harassment and legal intimidation  a pocket guide for scientists  we literally thought about it the day after the election   said lauren kurtz  the legal defense fund s executive director   i have gotten a lot of calls from scientists who are really concerned        so it s intended in some ways to be reassuring  to say   there is a game plan  we re here to help you  eric holthaus  a meteorologist who describes himself as a  climate hawk   issued a call to action via twitter on saturday when he posted  scientists  do you have a us  gov climate database that you don t want to see disappear   mountains of data immediately began pouring in  i don t actually think that it will happen   he said of the possibility that trump s administration could alter or destroy scientific data   but i think it could happen        all of these data sets are priceless  in the sense that if there is a gap  it greatly diminishes their usefulness  featured image via university of hull
