if it wasn t clear before that donald trump is worse than george w  bush ever was  it s definitely clear now during an appearance on the today show on monday  bush was asked to comment on trump s assault on the free press  and he absolutely destroyed him  i consider the media to be indispensable to democracy   bush said   we need an independent media to hold people like me to account  power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive  and it s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power  one of those people  bush pointed out  is russian dictator vladimir putin  who controls the media in his country with an iron fist in fact  bush said he tried to persuade putin to allow a free and independent press in russia apparently  putin didn t budge now trump is copying his buddy putin by trying to muzzle the free press in the united states  much to the glee of conservatives who think the media should operate as a propaganda machine for their agenda trump has declared the media  fake news  every time he sees a story he doesn t like and has even gone so far as to bar news outlets like cnn and the new york times from press briefings and trump s effort to undermine the free press harms america s mission to spread democracy throughout the world because trump is making us look like a bunch of hypocrites  it s kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press when we re not willing to have one ourselves   bush said bush even believes the american people deserve an investigation into trump s ties with russia  which have only deepened and become more of a scandal in recent weeks because trump s administration is trying to use the cia  fbi  and top republicans on the senate and house intelligence committees to bury the reports furthermore  bush took a shot at trump s anti muslim travel ban  which caused worldwide chaos and was blocked by the courts  a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely   bush said  during bush s eight years in office  he strove to defend islam when bigoted people like trump attacked it as a religion of terrorism just because a few fanatics wrongly used it to justify their deadly attacks here s the video via youtube in a way  george w  bush must be so happy right now  on the one hand  donald trump is a complete disaster who is acting like a tyrant  it s definitely hurting american prestige and our reputation  but one the other hand  bush is no longer considered the worst president in american history  trump managed to take that title in under a month featured image via screenshot
