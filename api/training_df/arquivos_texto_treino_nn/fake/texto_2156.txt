it s time for the irs to end non profit status for all conservative organizations but at least they did the right thing by taking away the non profit status of the national policy institute  a white nationalist organization run by obnoxious trump nazi richard spencer for years  the nazi organization got away with being classified as a non profit  you know  because the irs apparently doesn t vet these organizations to make sure they legitimately should get such status that s why conservatives have created a ton of  non profits  over the years  it s a trump like scam designed to fleece people of their money and not pay taxes on it but spencer s little scheme got busted for failing to file tax returns for more the three years starting after  according to the los angeles times the irs had apparently misclassified the national policy institute and publicly listed the group as not being required to file such forms  the irs fixed the error in february  and on monday it updated its records to say that the national policy institute s tax exempt status had been stripped retroactively as of may     when the group s  tax return would have been due of course  spencer is trying to pin the blame on the irs instead of taking personal responsibility on monday  spencer said an irs error led him to believe his group was not required to file federal tax returns  and said he would appeal the loss of his tax exempt status  i don t know what to say  i don t want to make a comment because i don t understand this stuff   spencer said in a telephone interview   it s a bit embarrassing  but it s not good  we ll figure it out  tax experts  however  countered spencer s bullshit by pointing out that ignorance of the tax code is not an acceptable excuse they should have known that they should have been filing   said philip t  hackney  a law professor at louisiana state university who formerly worked for the irs  specializing in nonprofits   it s very clear under the law that if you don t file for three years  you lose your status  chuck mclean  a senior research fellow at guidestar  a site that monitors and publishes records of nonprofits  agreed   ignorance is no excuse   mclean said but the national policy institute should also lose non profit status because the organization openly endorsed donald trump  non profits are barred by federal law from supporting political candidates at one event held in november  spencer received nazi salutes after telling the crowd  hail trump  hail our people  hail victory  if anything  nazis should be punched in the united states  not given non profit status so they can spread their evil agenda featured image  win mcnamee getty images
