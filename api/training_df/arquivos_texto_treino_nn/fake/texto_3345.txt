the national fraternal order of police knows exactly what the president elect s values are and knows it s a massive advantage in its quest to return america to a less progressive time with full knowledge that donald trump does not give a damn about minorities and is in full support of profiling african americans and hispanics  the national fraternal order of police has called on trump to reverse or amend the broad  bush era ban on racial profiling  the ban on racial profiling has been around since   when president george w  bush created guidelines that prevented federal agents from factoring race or ethnicity in investigations  now  the fraternal order of police is acting to reverse that ban  as its website states that racial profiling is a  statistical disparity  and that the current ban burdens  law enforcement agency to somehow prove itself innocent of engaging in the unlawful use of race in its procedures and practices   the organization also doesn t like that the ban is meant to protect racial and ethnic minorities   which they feel is  excluding members of other races  while the proposed lifting of the ban is absolutely ridiculous  it becomes truly scary when you consider that trump himself has implied that he is in favor of racial profiling  it was only a few months ago  in september  when trump said that police forces needed more leniency when it comes to investigating people based on their race  trump said  our local police   they know who a lot of these people are  they are afraid to do anything about it because they don t want to be accused of profiling they see somebody that s suspicious  they will profile  look what s going on  do we really have a choice  we re trying to be so politically correct in our country  and this is only going to get worse  apparently  trump is oblivious to the fact that there have been various studies proving that racial profiling is ineffective and may actually be counterproductive  of course  the national fraternal order of police has accurately identified trump as their guy  they not only supported him during his campaign  but noted his  real commitment to law enforcement   the organization s president  chuck canterbury  said  mr  trump  however  has seriously looked at the issues facing law enforcement today  he understands and supports our priorities and our members believe he will make america safe again  featured image via drew angerer   getty images
