while the amount of trump s ahem charitable giving is under investigation courtesy of the washington post  his political contributions are coming under even worse scrutiny than that  in addition to his giving    to florida attorney general pam bondi at the same time she was considering investigating trump u   which we re sure is just a coincidence   he s given donations to several other attorneys general who were weighing investigations into his businesses  too there s a word for that  it s called bribes  and at least some of them are catalogued in the wall street journal  which isn t exactly the most liberal publication out there  trump and his associates have donated to the campaigns of attorneys general in new york for  years or more  up to and including eric schneiderman schneiderman is the attorney general who s ordered the trump foundation to stop soliciting donations immediately  and he s involved in one of the fraud cases against trump u  wsj discovered that the contributions to these campaigns all just happened to coincide with pending investigations into trump s business dealings clearly  the bribes to schneiderman didn t work   in fact  he returned them  trump didn t like that and claimed that schneiderman asked for the donations one of those donations a    pledge to robert abrams back in  came just as trump needed to get abrams  permission for three apartment building conversions  while abrams was unable to return that money  another former attorney general  eliot spitzer  returned them twice  the first time  it was because trump had plans in spitzer s office that were pending approval the second time  however  it was because trump was involved in a dispute with potential condo buyers who wanted their deposit back  spitzer s office had jurisdiction over that case trump donated something like    to california attorney general kamala harris  while she was considering investigating trump u trump freely acknowledges that political donations buys influence  and puts himself out there as an  outsider candidate   you can t be an outsider when you bribe politicians like this  when rand paul called him on that  he whined that paul was taking him out of context oh  please featured image by ethan miller getty images
