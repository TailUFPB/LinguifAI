while donald trump may have spent a lot of time dissing president barack obama during his presidential campaign  he has definitely changed his tone   likely because he knows how incredibly screwed he is if obama doesn t hold his little orange hands during this transition process on wednesday  trump horrified the entire republican party by showering praise on our current president and even said that he thinks so highly of our current commander in chief that he has taken some of obama s advice on his future cabinet  during an interview on the today show  trump touched on several subjects  but his most shocking statements were his kind words about obama  trump  who rarely takes advice from anyone but himself  said  i take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that i will be appointing and in one case have appointed where he thought very highly of that person  i love getting his ideas  and i may differ in many cases  i differ very greatly  it s safe to say that the  one  person trump says obama  thought very highly of  might be another one of trump s lies  or there might be a small chance that at least one of the people in trump s cabinet isn t a white supremacist  hopefully   and trump continued  as he just couldn t stop gushing about obama  i really like him  we have a really good chemistry together  i ve asked him what he thinks are the biggest problems  greatest assets we have very good dialogue  we wonder if obama would say the same  you can watch trump kiss up to obama below  with his comments starting at about the   mark you can only imagine how much this is going to bother the rest of the republican party featured image via win mcnamee getty images
