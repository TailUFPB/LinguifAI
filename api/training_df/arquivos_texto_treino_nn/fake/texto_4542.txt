another day  another real trump controversy  while the media hyper focuses on hillary clinton s  pay for play  scandal  that wasn t actually a scandal  just crappy reporting from the associated press   a washington post report has found a major smoking gun regarding the trump foundation donald trump spent more than a quarter million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire s for profit businesses  according to interviews and a review of legal documents totaling over    in foundation money  trump may have been involved in has violated laws against  what is known as  self dealing   something trump is used to  which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charity s money to benefit themselves or their private businesses so not only has the trump foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians  it has been found to be engaging in self dealing  and people think the clinton foundation is immoral here are some of the examples according to the post in those cases  tax experts said  trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business  they had to be put to a charitable use he did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use  but rather personal use  which is  as tax experts and the laws say  is illegal so turns out the only  crooked  one in this race is donald trump  and the only fraud isn t the clinton foundation  but the trump foundation  illegal contributions  illegal lawsuit payoffs  and personal gifts with other people s money  for non charitable use  of course  the clinton campaign hit on the issue  saying trump is a fraud who believes the rules don t apply to him    and that  clearly the trump foundation is as much a charitable organization as trump university is an institute of higher education   ouch let s see fox news and the trump camp try to spin this simply put  trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally  and if doesn t  he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is featured image via spencer platt getty images
