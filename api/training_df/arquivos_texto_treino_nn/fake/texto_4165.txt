new mexico republicans are resorting to intimidation tactics to scare voters into voting for donald trump the republican party is literally sending out flyers to people across the state warning them that if they don t vote gop on election day they will tattle on them to their neighbors and make life more difficult for them according to the daily beast the mailer shows a woman in a cold blue hue peeking through her blinds   when the democrats win the election and you didn t do your part  your neighbors will know   it reads  in all caps the back shows a map of houses  some tagged with red check marks in blue pinpoints  do your part in this election   it says   after all  voting is a matter of public record  while whether you voted or not is a matter of public record  who or what party you voted for is not  obtaining and using such information to threaten voters is election fraud and voter intimidation  both of which are federal crimes  u s  code  states whoever intimidates  threatens  coerces  or attempts to intimidate  threaten  or coerce  any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year  or both and a spokesman for the new mexico gop admitted that the party sent out the flyer  thus admitting to committing a crime  but when further questioned about the flyer  w  tucker keene hung up on the the daily beast while donald trump and his deplorable supporters continue to cry about election fraud  their own party is committing that very crime in new mexico  the question is do they have a problem with that or do they only care about non existent election fraud that democrats are supposedly going to commit because not having a problem with real election fraud just because it is perpetrated by republicans would make them hypocrites by outing people who vote democrat  the new mexico gop would be putting americans in danger of being persecuted or worse just because they voted a certain way sending out a mailer with the intent to intimidate voters is illegal and the new mexico gop should be under investigation by the department of justice  this is an outrageous dirty tactic and there needs to be serious consequences featured image  daily beast
