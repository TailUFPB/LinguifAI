we all know trump s paranoia over isis is making him do really annoying things  like ban travelers from countries that have never sent terrorism to us while ignoring countries that have  during his campaign  he also stupidly called on bill gates to  close up the internet   because the internet is one of isis  primary recruiting tools  yet  just like the rest of the right  he s completely ignoring a far more immediate terrorist threat  and it s growing much faster than isis according to a new study from george washington university  white nationalist groups  including neo nazis  the kkk  skinheads and more  seem to be working harder and having far more success recruiting people online than isis  over the last four years  the number of people claiming allegiance to these groups grew more than  percent   from about   people in  to over   in   isis worked hard  but these white nationalist types are much better at creating new terrorists image via george washington universitythey re outperforming isis in most metrics now  including follower counts and number of tweets  isis  online activity has dropped dramatically since   due in part to social media networks rooting out and suspending accounts  in that same time frame though  as shown above  white nationalist groups have grown considerably  and we hear silence from everyone and where s trump on this  we have to close up the internet to stop the spread of terrorism  don t we he s focusing on islamic terrorism and alleged criminal activity among those he believes are undocumented immigrants  he s totally ignoring a threat that the fbi  and other law enforcement agencies  has been saying is a far more immediate danger  these groups surged following president obama s election win  but aren t acknowledged as terrorists in fact  whenever an attacker or potential attacker  like  oh  say  wayde lynn kurt who pledged to assassinate obama  or dylann roof  who killed  people in a black church in south carolina  is white  even our media is likely to say they were a  lone wolf   or something of that nature  yet they re quick to jump on any attacker who shouts   allahu akbar   or proclaims allegiance to isis  as proof that terrorism is here worse  the report says that while increasing worry over isis is understandable  white nationalistic groups are able to watch and learn from isis  tactics both on and offline  so while we focus too heavily on islamic terrorism  to the point of trying to keep even green card holders from seven countries out of the u s   these groups watch muslim radicalization on and offline  and adapt those techniques to suit their own movements trump s ascendancy to the presidency has only further galvanized these groups  his protectionist rhetoric and overt racism is exactly what these people want to hear  for instance  david duke  the ex kkk grand wizard  hailed his election  and also hailed his muslim ban kevin macdonald  another white nationalist  applauded trump s plans to crack down on undocumented immigration  and for just generally saying what these people have been thinking forever and we still sweep this stuff under the rug as people acting alone  they appear to act alone because these groups aren t nearly as centralized as isis  also white nationalist groups don t generally claim responsibility for attacks the way isis does  but the movement is growing  growing quickly  and is far stronger on our home soil than isis  or any islamic terrorism  is trump and his administration will continue to ignore this  and even feed it  putting us in grave peril featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
