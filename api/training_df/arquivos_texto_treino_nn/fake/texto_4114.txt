donald trump is semi right  this election might be rigged  however  this election is rigged against the people  not him take a look at ohio  a key battleground state in the never ending  election  after purging more than two million voters from the roles  a high court smacked down republican secretary of state john hustad for violating the national voter registration act hustad s purge  which included some dead people and those who moved out of state  also included those who moved in the same county and those who have not voted in past elections  at least since    those who were purged were overwhelmingly black  low income and democratic voters  a reuters investigation found that in the state s major cities  cleveland  columbus  and cincinnati  the voters in democratic leaning neighborhoods and precincts were illegally purged at twice the rate as in republican so  on wednesday night  while everyone was watching the final presidential debate  in which trump again claimed the election is rigged against him   the united states district court for the southern district of ohio  at the behest of republican appointee judge george c  smith  ordered the voters   save the dead and moved   back onto the rolls immediately and have their voting rights restored judge smith accused hustad of voter disenfranchisement  writing if those who were unlawfully removed from the voter rolls are not allowed to vote  then the secretary of state is continuing to to disenfranchise voters in violation of federal law the case was originally heard by the  u s  circuit court of appeals  which also ruled against hustad  but was sent back to the district court for a rehearing  obviously  both courts realized the illegal power grab by the state at the behest of the gop  and they weren t having it time and time again the courts have struck down illegal rigging practices by the republicans  thus saving the nation from an unbalanced electoral system  voting is a right in this country  and partisan politicos should not have the power to take it away just because if anyone can complain about a rigged election  it s hillary clinton featured image via john sommers ii getty images
