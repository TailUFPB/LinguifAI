renowned scholar noam chomsky has been warning of a trump presidency and his fears have now become a reality  his assessment of the current situation  in an interview with truthout  chomsky said electing trump has given  total control of the government  to republicans  who he describes as  the most dangerous organization in world history  on november   the most powerful country in world history  which will set its stamp on what comes next  had an election   chomsky said   the outcome placed total control of the government   executive  congress  the supreme court   in the hands of the republican party  which has become the most dangerous organization in world history  chomsky s primary concern with republicans is their staunch refusal to accept climate change as a reality and their determination to destroy the planet as quickly as possible  apart from the last phrase  all of this is uncontroversial  the last phrase may seem outlandish  even outrageous  but is it  the facts suggest otherwise   chomsky explained   the party is dedicated to racing as rapidly as possible to destruction of organized human life  there is no historical precedent for such a stand  chomsky went on to say that humans are facing the biggest disaster in our history  republicans  especially trump  seem hell bent on doing all they can to ensure our demise  it is hard to find words to capture the fact that humans are facing the most important question in their history   whether organized human life will survive in anything like the form we know   and are answering it by accelerating the race to disaster   chomsky said he added that when it comes to trump   similar observations hold for the other huge issue concerning human survival  the threat of nuclear destruction  which has been looming over our heads for  years and is now increasing  chomsky said that trump voters were driven by their desperation for  change  and that is what trump offered  but he noted that the  change  that trump is likely to bring will be harmful or worse   he said that they were also driven by bigotry  citing studies which  show that doctrines of white supremacy have had an even more powerful grip on american culture than in south africa  the political theorist said that this is exactly what he has spent years trying to warn people about  for many years  i have been writing and speaking about the danger of the rise of an honest and charismatic ideologue in the united states  someone who could exploit the fear and anger that has long been boiling in much of the society  and who could direct it away from the actual agents of malaise to vulnerable targets   chomsky said   that could indeed lead to what sociologist bertram gross called  friendly fascism  in a perceptive study  years ago  but that requires an honest ideologue  a hitler type  not someone whose only detectable ideology is me  the dangers  however  have been real for many years  perhaps even more so in the light of the forces that trump has unleashed  a good deal depends on his appointments and circle of advisers  early indications are unattractive  to put it mildly   chomsky added you can read chomsky s full interview with truthout  here featured image via william b  plowman getty images
