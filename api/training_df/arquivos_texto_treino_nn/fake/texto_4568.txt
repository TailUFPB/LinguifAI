donald trump is perhaps the most predictable person who s ever run for president  if someone disses him  they are enemies for life  and if someone says something positive about the self proclaimed  we won t believe it unless he releases his tax returns  billionaire  brutal dictator or not  they will have trump s loyalty and respect now  things get a little weird when people are sarcastic  as is the case with a washington post article that  if you didn t read it  might be something somewhat positive about the gop nominee  trump obviously didn t read the article  he would have hated it  but he did retweet the article entitled  donald trump s birther event is the greatest trick he s ever pulled   donald trump s birther event is the greatest trick he s ever pulled https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    of us  at least those of us who are capable of critical thought  would probably not assume that the article was a positive portrayal of trump s birther farce  but  well  we re talking about trump  as for the article  no  it was pretty brutal toward trump  here are a few snippets donald trump is  at heart  a showman  he rose to national fame thanks to star turns on reality tv in which he played the tough talking boss to a group of aspirants hoping to become as successful as he has been in business  his great gift is the ability to draw attention   and then use that attention for his own  usually commercial  purposes trump might have read that far  he s proud of being a showman and he s pretty damned good at it  in much the same way that snake oil salesmen were good at their jobs trump may have outdone himself on friday morning  he and his campaign touted a  major  announcement at his newly opened hotel in washington  d c   at  a m  the word was that trump would walk away from his past skepticism about president obama s citizenship while also laying the blame for the birther movement at the feet of hillary clinton   that  of course  isn t true   according to numerous fact checkers   but no matter  trump planned to say it anyway  the article goes on to fact check some of trump s many lies  especially in regard to the birther controversy  no  hillary clinton didn t start it and yes  donald trump has long been a birther the washington post then went on to describe the event  and it wasn t flattering  this is how they described trump s announcement three sentences from trump himself   one that is totally false and two others that represent a total reversal from a position he held as recently as  well  thursday night clearly  trump didn t read the article  which is a little frightening  presidents are given several pages  if not hundreds  of important documents ever single day  it s critical that our president read and not just assume and retweet featured image via joe raedle getty images
