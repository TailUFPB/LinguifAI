recently  donald trump s new york campaign co chair  carl paladino  did what trump fans do best and made some incredibly racist remarks about the president and first lady  asked about his wish for barack obama by a weekly buffalo  new york  paper  paladino explained that he hoped barack obama would be caught having sex with a cow and die from mad cow disease  as for michelle  he explained that he wanted her to  return to being a male  and released in africa to live among the apes naturally  paladino s racist and hateful rhetoric   the exact sort that is  unfortunately  popular among the stupid part of america   didn t exactly make him friends outside of his racist little bubble  in fact  some  almost everyone  had a bit of an issue with the fact that he serves on the buffalo school board  words matter  mr  paladino   school board president barbara seals nevergold said during a meeting intended to oust the trump loving bigot   our president  the commander in chief of this nation for the last eight years  mrs  obama  our first lady  and mrs  valerie jarrett  special presidential council  are all african americans  among other things  they are accomplished  intelligent  beautiful people and that s not just my opinion  the impact on children of color  especially african american children is incalculable   she continued   how do we encourage them to use their god given talents to soar  to reach for the stars  when a sitting board member responsible for their education demonstrates such contempt of their role models  nevergold added that paladino s unmitigated and hateful  racist and misogynist  rhetoric  has reached a level that is almost guaranteed to adversely impact students of color  noting that his disgusting behavior  demonstrate such a lack of responsible leadership   the school board president explained that people from all over the state had shared their views on paladino s actions  they would like me to tell you   you re fired   she said  demanding paladino s resignation as the room exploded in applause while trump fans vigorously defend him  it is impossible for a rational person to believe that paladino could possibly serve on the school board while simultaneously believing that black people are apes  gorillas  or any other primate conservatives seem to use interchangeably paladino  as is expected from any racist coward  skipped the meeting entirely rather than answer for what he has done  watch her rip him apart below featured image via screengrab
