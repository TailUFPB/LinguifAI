donald trump and his disgraceful team deserve to be throttled for their horrendous responses and disrespect to gold star families  particularly after rep  fredericka wilson called trump out on his insensitive remarks to the widow of a fallen soldier after both trump and his chief of staff  john kelly  attacked wilson and lied their a  es off to clear trump s name  msnbc anchor joy reid brought on a guest that would make trump sorry he ever challenged wilson  noting that wilson was currently at the funeral of fallen soldier la david johnson while trump was playing golf  reid said  she is at that funeral as we speak  while general kelly and his boss  donald trump  are still standing by their attacks on her  like i said  extraordinary  then  she turned to one of her guests  retired colonel jack jacobs  and asked  donald trump likes to hide behind his generals  he likes to push them out front in order to give himself credibility  what do you make of general kelly s willingness to be used in that way this week and then to add this extraneous story that turns up not even to be true slamming the congresswoman  it was as if jacobs  a medal of honor recipient  had been waiting all day for the opportunity to rip trump and kelly apart  he said  well  it s quite surprising because i know   i don t know him very well  i m not that close to him   but i know general kelly i m quite surprised  attacks like this don t make any sense from anybody  the retired colonel  who is also the recipient of two silver stars  three bronze stars  and two purple hearts  also stated that trump and kelly owed wilson an apology  if it were i  i would  i mean  i d pick up the phone and say   look  this has gone far enough  i apologize   but that should have been the case from the very beginning when whatever is emanating from the white house was inaccurate as well  and the trashing continued with this brilliant attack  i can say this about donald trump  he s not real good at talking  if i were trump  i would have picked up the phone and said   look  that was my ham handed way of being sympathetic  i m not good at that and i apologize   and all this stuff would have been over  another guest  a former combat veteran  agreed with jacobs  while reid reminded everyone that  it s not going to stop because donald trump this morning  got up bright and early and starting tweeting again attacking congresswoman wilson  so donald trump doesn t want it to end and he doesn t want the discussion to be about the fact it took him  days to call the families of these four fallen soldiers  he wants it to be about congresswoman wilson  here s that tweet as usual  trump just makes things worse for himself  jacobs was dead on when he stated that trump could have easily ended this whole debacle by apologizing for his disgusting response and all the lies  but because he s trump  we all knew that wasn t going to happen  trump has gotten himself into this mess  and now he must pay the price you can watch jacobs crush trump below  featured image is a screenshot
