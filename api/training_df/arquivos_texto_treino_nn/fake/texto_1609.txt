donald trump s andrew jackson civil war debacle just continues to get worse and worse yesterday  trump had a massive history fail during a radio interview  where the moronic potus stated that andrew jackson   who had died  years before the civil war even started   was angry that the war had not been avoided  trump also said that jackson could have stopped the civil war from happening  lavishing praise upon the slave owning seventh president  and apparently  trump also thinks that he could have stopped the civil war trump s disgusting civil war comments have prompted andrew jackson biographer and historian jon meacham  the author of  american lion  andrew jackson in the white house  to speak out and address trump s comments  according to meacham  it was white house chief strategist steve bannon that made trump fall in love with jackson  the historian explained on msnbc today  i spent an hour  hour and a half with him in may of   talking with him about presidents he admired and jackson never came up  steve bannon put this in the conversation after the victory saying this was a jacksonian moment  it was then that trump connected himself to jackson in his usual superficial way  meacham said  it s a projection of the president s fundamental and enveloping narcissism  and then meacham dropped this bombshell  he told me a year and a half ago or so  a year ago  that  you know  he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the war  yes  trump actually said he could have prevented the war with one of his deals  if it s anything like the  deals  and failed legislation we ve seen so far during his presidency  it s safe to say that trump would have f cked that up  too meacham also said that being in the white house tends to enhance the  fundamental characteristics  of the serving presidents   which is awful news for america right now  meacham said  it s very hard  once you re there  to change  some people do  and that s why we talk about them as great presidents  but most people  once they re in the oval office  actually just become more like themselves   and i think in this case that s on a particularly tragic trajectory  we couldn t agree more  you can watch meacham take on trump s civil war comments below this is must watch   jmeacham  who won a pulitzer prize for his andrew jackson biography  on trump s  disturbing  jackson civil war comments pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  may    image via scott olson   getty images
