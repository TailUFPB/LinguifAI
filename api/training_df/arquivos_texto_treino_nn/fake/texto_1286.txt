this week  donald trump disappointed the entire world by pulling out of the paris climate deal  it was a decision that was condemned by several world leaders  and marked yet another way that trump had ruined america s standing as a global leader  to celebrate his horrible decision  trump organized a  pittsburgh not paris  rally to celebrate america s exit from the deal  there was just one major problem   trump blew it off the trump campaign had hyped up this event so much  and even organized it to be located right across the street from the white house   put donnie wasn t there  he bailed  and decided to play golf instead  so much for being a dedicated potus and showing his dwindling number of supporters that he appreciates them  as his approval ratings continue to plummet to historic lows the white house press pool told politicususa  after an uneventful ride along highways and byways toward sterling  virginia  motorcade pulled up to the trump national golf club at   a m motorcade split off and pool is now holding in a spectacular clubhouse overlooking indoor tennis courts  if any of trump s supporters still think trump cared about and appreciated them  this is a pretty rude awakening  when trump s campaign announced the rally  it certainly sounded like trump would actually be present  however  the event invitation was a little more cryptic  it said  as you know  the president has been under siege from the mainstream media and the democrats  especially now that he put american jobs first by withdrawing from the paris accord  therefore  we are organizing a group to demonstrate our support for president trump and his fearless leadership  either way  these trump supporters expected trump to be there  and he wasn t because he was playing golf   his main hobby when he wants to avoid doing his job  trump must know that his presidency is doomed  because blowing off a rally full of supporters when his popularity is suffering is a bold move  to make matters worse  this rally couldn t have been more convenient   it was just across the street  and yet  trump couldn t be bothered featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
