sarah palin  one of the nigh innumerable  deplorables  in donald trump s  basket   almost outdid herself in terms of horribleness on friday  i know  i know  it seems impossible   but it s true  palin posted a link to an article on facebook that shows a white man pulling a gun on peaceful african american protesters in charlotte only to get away with it  they re not protestors  they re rioters  and this changed some things   palin wrote triumphantly the driver  a white man likely suffering from an affliction that causes his penis to not only be tiny  but inverted  decides to show the protesters what a badass he is by pulling a handgun on the crowd and holding it out the window of the vehicle   protesters begin to yell  he has a gun   and the man can be sween violently swinging the door of his vehicle open as though he intended to attack the crowd  eventually law enforcement takes notice  an officer walks over to the nice ammosexual s car  they have a nice friendly chat  and the man is allowed to leave without a single charge  despite the fact that it is illegal in north carolina to brandish a firearm  or bring a gun to a protest  in fact  it is illegal to keep a handgun under the front seat or in an unlocked glove compartment  or concealed without a permit  we do not know if the man had a permit or not  but pulling a gun on peaceful protesters is against the law regardless   you may not carry a weapon at a parade  funeral procession  picket line  or other demonstration  except for guns carried on a rack in a pickup truck   state law decrees   you may not carry a weapon during civil disorder  riot  or other disturbance involving three or more people  white dude drives into crowd of peaceful protesters  draws gun  allowed to drive away alive  with my own eyes   heather head  who filmed the video  writes on twitter  though the usual conservative bunch jumped on twitter to claim the man was black  head pointed out that she had a first hand view of the gentleman with a gun  and  he looks pretty white bread to me  yes  he broke the law and was allowed to escape without learning a single thing from his actions via some form of punishment  but to palin s followers he s a hero         notice the language   animals    savages    they should all be shot   hillary clinton was exactly right   these people are a  basket of deplorables   or a billion more appropriate  less nice  terms  each and every one of these trumpaholics will be voting in november  make sure you re out there too watch it below featured image via screen capture
