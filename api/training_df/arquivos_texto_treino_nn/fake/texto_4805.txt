campaign volunteers are key to a winning presidential campaign  unpaid supporters are the most solid of true believers in a politician  and most campaigns would do anything to attract them and get them doing the grunt work that wins elections not donald trump his so called  ground game  of volunteers in swing states has been slow to catch up with hillary clinton s massive operation that have been working to register voters and get them to the polls since before the primaries began last winter but another reason trump is behind the curve may be his own ego  it has come to light that as part of volunteering for trump s  presidential campaign  volunteers must sign an unusual non disclosure agreement document that bars them from ever speaking about him the enquirer reports that the agreement  is a required part of the sign up process for trump red dialer  an online call system that connects volunteers for the republican presidential candidate with potential voters   and that a spokesman dodged a question about why they re necessary  we are running a state of the art campaign for mr  trump that involves best in market volunteer platforms  and it is attracting thousands of volunteers who are tired of the same old washington corruption and back room deals and are securing votes for a change in november   trump ohio spokesman seth unger said the contract specifies that volunteers could face financial damages if they violate the agreement by speaking about trump  similar agreements have been discussed before in the campaign  as one was apparently signed by former campaign manager corey lewandowski  the extremely expansive terms of the agreement led to him losing a book deal  and he actually could face a major lawsuit   as another former campaign staffer did  later settled   if he even criticized the campaign as part of his work as a commentator at cnn thinkprogress reports that by comparison  the clinton campaign doesn t require anyone to sign anything before working for the campaign as a phone banker  sounds like they want to win  instead of stroking the candidate s ego featured image via wikimedia commons
