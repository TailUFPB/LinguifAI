donald trump keeps claiming that the election is rigged  well  he s right  only it s the republicans who are doing the rigging wisconsin has one of the most restrictive voting laws in the nation  which republicans have bragged would hurt hillary clinton in the state the courts have ordered clerks to set up more polling locations to cut down on voting time and the long lines that plagued the state primary  but green bay city clerk kris teske  who was appointed by republican mayor and scott walker stooge  jim schmitt  tried to get around both the court order and a request from democratic state rep  eric genrich to put a polling location near the university of wisconsin green bay to make it easier for students to vote teske wrote an email to the wisconsin ethics commission in an effort to get out of doing so  arguing that not only would it cost money and require resources  but it would help democrats in the upcoming election on november   i don t like the idea at all for many reasons  staffing  ballot security  budget  etc    she began  i was reading the statutes and read  no site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party  uwgb is a polling location for students and residents on election day but i feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole  i have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat  i have spoken with our chief of staff and others at city hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen  i would like to know your thoughts on this  do i have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats  teske literally just argued for not setting up an additional polling place for students because she thinks they lean more toward voting for democrats that s the textbook definition of voter suppression and election rigging just imagine if a city clerk decided that churches can t be polling places because religious people lean more toward voting for republicans  or that we can t put polling places in rural areas because rural areas lean republican  republicans would be crying foul and throwing a temper tantrum over it kris teske should be removed from her position immediately if a polling location is not placed where rep  genrich requested  whether or not more students voting benefits democrats is beside the point and that shouldn t be the position of a nonpartisan city clerk   genrich told the nation   i don t know what kris s politics are  but it s really unfortunate to see her echoing the sentiments of republicans in wisconsin  who have been making it really difficult for citizens to vote in this state  we should be working hard to make sure everyone gets to vote in this country  anything less should be considered criminal featured image  ethan miller via getty images
