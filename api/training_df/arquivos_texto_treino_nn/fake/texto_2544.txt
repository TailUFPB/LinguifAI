amateur president donald trump met with canadian prime minister justin trudeau on monday to speak in a joint press conference  and he thoroughly embarrassed the u s  again by feeding his ego in front of the entire world  the topic of syrian refugees was brought up by a reporter  and of course  trump had to bring up his election victory  president trump  you seemed to suggest that syrian refugees are a trojan horse for potential terrorism  while the prime minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms   a reporter asked   are you confident the northern border is secure  you can never be totally confident   trump replied  trump heaped praise on department of homeland security secretary john kelly for doing a  great job  of deporting  very  very hardened criminals  so far  as reported by talking points memo  that s what i said i would do  i m just doing what i said i would do  and we won by a very  very large electoral college vote   trump said trump went on to say that he  knew  he would win the election  that s an odd statement to make since he admitted to being surprised that he won after the election during his thank you tour following the election  i knew this is what people were wanting  that wasn t the only reason  that wasn t my only thing that we did so well on  but that was something that was very important   trump said   i think that in the end  everyone is going to be extremely happy  and i will tell you right now  a lot of people are very  very happy right now  watch a lot of people are not  very happy right now  as trump suggested  his approval rating is tanking like the titanic  before taking the oath of office  trump s approval rating as president elect was the worst in modern history  and it s gotten even worse since inauguration day  trump s disapproval rating has risen  percentage points since just last week  since his  election   trump has witnessed mass protests across the country  the women s march on washington  which took place the day after he was sworn in  garnered a far larger crowd than his inauguration  nope  people are not  happy right now   but he knows that  that s why he repeatedly brings up his election victory and most times  tries to claim he won the popular vote by saying that  million people voted illegally in the u s  election  that s nearly the same number by which hillary clinton won the popular vote featured image by alex wong via getty images
