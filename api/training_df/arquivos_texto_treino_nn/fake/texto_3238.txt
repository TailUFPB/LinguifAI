apparently  bristol palin thinks musicians have no right to have their own opinions or choices ever since election day  donald trump and his team have been desperately trying to find an a list artist to perform at his inauguration in january  but none of them want anything to do with him in response  trump posted a pathetic tweet claiming that all a list celebrities are asking him for tickets to the inauguration and that he s the one rejecting them the so called  a  list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration  but look what they did for hillary  nothing  i want the people   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    is making it sound like he s insanely popular among relevant celebrities even though it s been clear for over a month that they despise him and sarah palin s hypocritical abstinence only crusader daughter decided to throw a temper tantrum about it on her blog if donald trump were still just a regular old billionaire and threw a party at trump tower in new york city  celebrities would be lined up out the door  and the most famous artists would be pining for a chance to perform  but because he will be inaugurated as the next republican president in january  these same mega celebrities  who would normally drool over an invitation to sing for the president  want no part of it trump s inauguration team sought out some of the world s greatest musicians  but nearly all of them have refused for fear of backlash or to stand against him politically isn t it amazing how  not cool  it is to be conservative in the public eye  either hollywood is that far off   or we have so many sissies we have in the spot light too scared to stand for what they believe in except trump isn t just a reality tv star with a big mouth anymore  throughout his campaign  he used divisive hateful racist sexist language and called for policies that go completely against what many celebrities stand for  so by refusing to attend and perform at his inauguration  these celebrities are making it clear that trump will not be able to use them to claim that they somehow support him when trump threw parties in the past  things were different  he was just a businessman with money  but now he is threatening everything america stands for  also  just because certain celebrities clamored to sing at president obama s inauguration doesn t mean they ll automatically perform for trump  bristol palin is acting like trump is entitled to be adored and admired by everyone and that celebrities should just kiss his ass but that s not the way the world works  in fact  republicans made that clear by the way they have treated president obama over the last eight years  the level of disrespect was unbelievable and no conservative crybaby can honestly say that any right wing celebrity like ted nugent would have respectfully performed at one of obama s inaugurations if they had been asked  especially since they said so many nasty things about the obama family but bristol went even further by listing the names of celebrities who have refused or allegedly refused to perform for trump  it appears she wants them to be punished  the problem is that these top entertainers have fan bases so large that they can easily say  good riddance  to conservative fans and not see much change in their star power and revenue stream speaking of revenue streams  clicking through the rest of bristol s rant means you will be bombarded with pleas to buy her books and her mommy s books  because being grifters is the palin family profession and there are a lot of gullible conservatives out there to fleece the bottom line is that bristol palin doesn t matter and she never will  she s just the spoiled brat of america s village idiot who refuses to let go of the fact that america rejected her ignorant unqualified mom eight years ago featured image via inquisitr
