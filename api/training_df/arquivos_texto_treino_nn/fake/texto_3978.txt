it seems that donald trump is rather unpopular with the workforce that will have to answer to him if he s elected  despite the union representing ice endorsing him  other federal workers in various ederal agencies view hillary far more favorably than trump  that s not too terribly surprising  what is surprising  though  is that a number of them may just up and quit their jobs if they find their agencies answering to a president trump a large number of them  a recent poll  from a federal publication called government executive  surveyed a random sample of   federal employees across  agencies and found that hillary has a commanding lead over trump  with  percent saying they d vote for her vs   percent saying they d vote for trump if the election were today image via government executivebut the more damning statistic was that  percent said they would  would consider  or might leave the federal service if trump was elected  that s compared to  percent for hillary  nine percent said they didn t know what they d do if trump was elected  compared to just five percent who said that about hillary image via government executiveimage via government executivefederal employees do tend to lean democratic in part because their jobs are more secure  and they do better economically  under democratic presidents rather than republicans  donald trump just adds to the gop s woes in this area because he s a completely incompetent fool that they allowed to become their nominee in fact  that s evidenced in another damning part of the poll  thirty one percent of respondents feel that hillary would be very effective at managing federal agencies  whereas only  percent feel trump could do that job very well  just  percent said that hillary would be  not at all effective  in that arena  compared to a whopping  percent who believe that about trump image via government executiveimage via government executivethe federal workforce is made up of more than four million people  including our   million members of the military  assuming everyone who resigned was in the civilian workforce  that s well over   employees who would leave under trump  add the military members who could consider early retirement into that  and trump s in a lot of trouble  at the bare minimum  trump would have to face a workforce that  by and large  doesn t like him  along with a quick loss of hundreds of thousands employees as for the rest of the country  the federal workforce would then fill up with trumpkins  which could make life worse for us even faster  we sooo do not need a federal workforce full of deplorables  that would be deplorable sure  republicans would probably paint that as a good thing because they say we need to shrink the size of the government anyway  but the whole thing could backfire spectacularly depending on which agencies suffered the heaviest losses but really  we can t blame them for feeling this way  trump would be the worst president to happen to this country featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
