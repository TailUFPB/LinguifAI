early this morning  donald trump was up to his usual nonsense on twitter  spreading misinformation and stroking his ego  today  he took a break from trying to convince america that the size of his inauguration crowd was respectable and once again complained about not winning the popular vote in doing so  trump brought up his tired  pathetic voter fraud conspiracy because he s incapable of dealing with the fact that most of america hates him  in a tweet  trump brought up his completely unnecessary  expensive and wasteful investigation into a matter that has been debunked several times for the record  gregg phillips is a random dude on twitter that runs a voter fraud conspiracy app called voter stand  and the information that trump is referring to was officially debunked in november  phillips even admitted that there was no proof of voter fraud in an interview with politifact trump s voter fraud conspiracy has been condemned by both democrats and republicans alike  and earlier today republican illinois congressman adam kinzinger took trump to task on cnn s new day  in a blistering rant  kinzinger stated that by spreading this false information and investigating  voter fraud   trump was undermining america s electoral system and constitution  kinzinger  who was one of the few republicans that would not endorse trump  said  this basically undermines the idea of an election  this undermines the constitution  just as i was upset about the russian hacking because it s an attack on the election system of our constitution  i don t like this  kinzinger also slammed trump for failing to bring forth any real proof that massive voter fraud took place  he said  you have to show why you re undermining the constitution  just show us the proof before you make the accusation  you can watch kinzinger tear into trump below featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
