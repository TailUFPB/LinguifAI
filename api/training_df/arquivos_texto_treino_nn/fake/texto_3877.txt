this election has been hard for south carolina senator lindsey graham  after fighting his little republican heart out in the primaries only to see a reality tv star defeat him and every other more qualified goper  graham continued to be devastated long after trump became the republican nominee graham s journey through trump s campaign has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster  starting with him trashing the donald and refusing to keep his promise to support the party s nominee regardless of who it was  then  graham eventually decided to support trump after much hesitance  only to completely disown him in the end after one too many offensive statements and erratic stunts  needless to say  graham is probably one of the most relieved people in the gop that this election has finally come to an end on tuesday  graham decided to celebrate election day with one more final  f ck you  to trump  someone that graham clearly doesn t think deserves to be anywhere near the white house  using his hatred for trump as the inspiration behind his voting choice  graham announced who he actually voted for on twitter  and it s going to break trump s little black heart twittertwittertwittergraham decided that since he can t stand the thought of voting for trump but didn t want to vote for hillary clinton  either  that he would just vote for the next best thing in his mind   evan mcmullin  who came into the election late with the simple goal of being an alternative to trump graham is the very first senator to publicly say that he s voting for the conservative independent candidate  and it s a huge slap in the face to trump  we expect that many more disgruntled republicans will be making similar choices  although many may not have the courage to actually admit it featured image via chip somodevilla and alex wong   getty images
