donald trump was nervous as hell over the hearing with fbi director james comey earlier today  and he had every reason to be  it s now been confirmed that trump is in fact being investigated by the fbi  however americans shouldn t rejoice yet  there are still more dangers facing america rep  adam schiff  d ca   the ranking member on the house intelligence committee  kicked the hearing off by stating that the meddling we saw from russia in the  election   the interference that helped trump win   could haunt us  according to the top democrat  it s highly likely that this sort of thing could happen again  maybe as soon as   schiff said  only by understanding what the russians did can we inoculate ourselves from the further russian interference we know is coming  it was a bombshell of a statement  and the warning became even more clear three hours later  when comey himself agreed with schiff during the hearing  comey said of russia  they ll be back  they ll be back in   they may be back in   and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process it is possible they re misreading that as it worked  and so we ll come back and hit them again in   i don t know  but we have to assume they re coming back  while comey couldn t give any specific details about whether or not trump has definitely been involved with russia  the announcement of the investigation implies that there is evidence  if trump is found to be connected to russia and its interference  he will have compromised the country and put america in a severe  unprecedented amount of danger featured image via drew angerer   getty images
