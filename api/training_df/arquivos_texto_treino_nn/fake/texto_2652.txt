the next time any flag waving  faux patriotic republican tells you president obama didn t care about the troops  veterans  or the welfare of the american public  tell them that he donated over   million to various charitable causes  then ask them how braggadocios he was about it that s right  president obama  during his time in office  not only saved the country from economic collapse  but used his own money to help his fellow countrymen  according to a forbes analysis of his tax returns from  to    percent of all donations went to various organizations that help children however  the biggest recipient of president obama s generosity was the fisher house foundation  which is tasked with supporting the families of veterans  this organization received over    over the course of obama s eight years in office  this donation s were given on behalf of the royalties president obama accumulated from his children s book  of thee i sing according to forbes he gave away    more to children s causes  including    to boys   girls clubs  he also gave away    to the mosaic youth theatre of detroit  another    went to the christopher house  a chicago based group that supports poor working families  even after he moved to washington  obama remained loyal to his chicago roots  he poured    into the midtown educational foundation  which offers enrichment programs to poor urban youth in the windy city  and he gave    to two groups fighting hunger in illinois  the    million of donations obama declared on his tax returns also do not include the    million he directed the nobel committee to give  charities after he won the nobel peace prize in   the biggest recipient of those funds was  again  the fisher house foundation  which got     another    went to the clinton bush haiti fund  and most of the rest went to various scholarship funds remember when republicans made fun of president obama for being a community organizer and working to make chicago a better place  even when busy running the free world  he never turned his back on where he came from or the people who put him where he is  that s a class act perhaps the most telling was how the president doled out his own money in the face of heartbreaking national tragedies  the forbes analysis shows that president obama gave    to a fund for families and victims affected by the boston bombing in   that same year  he gave    to the sandy hook promise foundation  remember when conservatives mocked him for crying over these tragedies while president  obama made over   million  with a majority   percent  of that coming from book royalties  that means president obama gave  percent of his earnings to charity contrast that to donald trump   who is worth    billion  because donald trump refuses to release his taxes  it is not know just how much he gives to charity  according to forbes filings for the donald j  trump foundation reveal that he gave   to his own charitable foundation from  to   the most recent year on record   he donated    million from  to    after he stopped giving in   other donors gave    million to the trump foundation over the next six years  which trump in turn doled out to various groups  apparently fooling some recipients into thinking the money came from him yeah donald trump cares  and obama is the heartless elitist  sure  whatever you say i would love to see how much rush limbaugh  ann coulter  sean hannity  bill o reilly  tomi lahren and the other conservative frauds have given to the troops and their families simply put  president obama was and still is a generous  compassionate  loving human being  he truly loves this country and the people who make it great  the haters are all talk  no action   all while collecting a paycheck while faking support read more featured image via darren hauck getty images
