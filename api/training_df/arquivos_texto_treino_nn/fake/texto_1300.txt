trump s decision to pull america out of the paris climate accord is being described by policy experts and scientists as nothing short of catastrophic  in a single day  trump managed to blunder america into a mistake that will be as disastrously consequential as the iraq war  and making matters worse  trump s speech in the rose garden was bursting with lies  when it came down to it  trump couldn t even find truthful justifications for why he was doing it   he had to fabricate them so why did he really do it a disturbing picture is emerging  but one that is so  on brand  for trump that it seems not only plausible but probably true  for starters  when trump kept teasing america with his decision it wasn t just because he treats his job like a reality tv show  it s because he is also incompetent and indecisive  this tweet wasn t just for drama   trump seriously didn t know what his decision would be on an agreement that would have an impact on all life on planet earth until a few hours before he announced it to the world i will be announcing my decision on paris accord  thursday at   p m  the white house rose garden  make america great again   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    ask fox news host  and noted non scientist  kimberly guilfoyle  who said trump called her this morning seeking advice on whether to stick with the paris agreement or not   guilfoyle  a climate denier  told him to pull out of the agreement  watch  kimberly guilfoyle says trump called her this morning to seek her advice on the paris agreement among other policy matters  pic twitter com   yashar ali   yashar  june    things only get sadder from here  buried at the bottom of a lengthy dive into trump s latest screw up  the washington post had this surreal tidbit if he needed a nudge  though  one came from france over the weekend  macron was quoted in a french journal talking about his white knuckled handshake with trump at their first meeting in brussels  where the newly elected french president gripped trump s hand tightly and would not let go for six long seconds in a show of alpha male fortitude  hearing smack talk from the frenchman  years his junior irritated and bewildered trump  aides said a few days later  trump got his revenge trump has long pegged his identity on something as stupid as a handshake  he yanks  twists  and grips the hands of his victims in an attempt to dominate them  it s juvenile and pathetic  but unavoidable  macron confirmed that he had prepared for trump s handshake and went into it with the idea that he would not allow trump to get away with it  with the tables turned  the awkward handshake went viral trump was described as seeking his  revenge  on macron for the handshake incident by torching the climate deal  trump s own comments seem to back this up  in his rose garden speech  trump said he was doing this for  the citizens of pittsburgh  not paris    a not so subtle dig at france the idea that trump would reduce a crucial decision about the planet s future to an opportunity to take a dig at a person who had a stronger handshake than him is reprehensible   but largely in line with what observers of trump s pettiness have long noted  when ego consumes every inch of your self worth  you ll go to great lengths to protect it  unfortunately for americans  and that includes  citizens of pittsburgh   we are now heading down a path to ruin because of trump s need to fuel his narcissism featured image via dan kitwood getty images
