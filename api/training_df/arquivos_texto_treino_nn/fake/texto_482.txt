just as they did during and in the aftermath of hurricane katrina a dozen years ago  mexico has extended a hand in friendship and assistance to the state of texas to help them deal with hurricane harvey  their generosity is especially moving in light of the horrible things our president has said about them  including insulting tweets as recently as sunday with mexico being one of the highest crime nations in the world  we must have the wall  mexico will pay for it through reimbursement other   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    are in the nafta  worst trade deal ever made  renegotiation process with mexico   canada both being very difficult may have to terminate   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    has  of course  repeatedly reiterated that it will not be paying for donald trump s multi billion dollar wall  the fact that a response is even merited still baffles me  because why in the world would they  but quite apart from their dealings with the u s  president  mexico has always had a good relationship with the state of texas  the ties between the southern state and the country they used to be a part of have always been strong  due to the large mobile population that blurs the border between our two countries both foreign minister luis videgaray and carlos gonzalez gutierrez  the mexican consul general in austin have contacted texas governor greg abbott s office to extend their offers of assistance  gutierrez  in fact  has been  in constant communication with the governor s office   according to the dallas morning news as we have done in the past  mexico stands with texas in this difficult moment the consul general in dallas  francisco de la torre galindo  echoed gutierrez  sentiment the offer for help and collaboration acknowledges a reality  we live in the same neighborhood called north america  we can t be distant neighbors  not any more  not ever after extensive searching on social media and on the office of the governor s website  we can t seem to find any acknowledgment from governor abbott of mexico s offers  that s disappointing  as mexico has very publicly made them and their help is always welcome  as of monday afternoon  however  there was nothing on texas gov  abbott s facebook page  or either his personal twitter account or his official account  the latter of which he uses extensively on texas   and america s  behalf  let me say   thank you mexico  and thank you  president pe a nieto for your offer  we can always use a hand featured image via john moore getty images
