donald trump turned a tragedy into an opportunity to do some heavy fear mongering after news broke that a truck had driven into a christmas market in berlin  germany  killing  and injuring dozens as expected  trump s response was highly inappropriate and reckless  as he jumped to conclusions and blamed  isis and other islamist terrorists  before any concrete facts about the incident had been reported here s what trump said  our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today s horrifying terror attack in berlin  innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the christmas holiday  isis and other islamist terrorists continually slaughter christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad  these terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth  a mission we will carry out with all freedom loving partners  likely another effort by trump to distract the nation from russia s involvement in the election  trump jumped at the opportunity to refresh his anti muslim rhetoric and remind everyone why he wants to ban muslims  there was zero hard evidence to support how trump reacted  and we can expect much more of this carelessness in january  when he takes office in contrast  germany s interior minister gave a much more measured  cautious response  there is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here  and we want to be very  very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results  not with speculation  those are words that trump could certainly learn from  whether or not isis sympathizers were actually behind the berlin attack is irrelevant to trump  as he is trigger happy and quick to point blame  even if he doesn t have the evidence to back it up  this raises massive concerns  and trump has approximately one month before he begins his role as commander in chief  if he doesn t start practicing some restraint  this country is going to be in big trouble featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
