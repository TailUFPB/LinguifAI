it was just this morning that donald trump once again tried to ignore his mounting failures and pump up his ego by trashing the press  taking to twitter  the undeserving potus bashed the new york times  again  with yet another one of his lies  and after trump trashed the new york times  he posted another tweet about the  vicious  and inaccurate media if the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     thanks to a new poll released by monmouth university  trump s temper tantrums about the press are far from over  because he seems to be alone in his opinion  the monmouth university poll revealed that thanks to trump s numerous lies and falsehoods  americans now view msnbc as a more credible source than him you can only imagine how devastating it is for trump to realize that his attacks on  fake news  are actually working against him and helping networks that dare to publish the truth about him  the poll stated  only   of americans are more likely trust trump as an information source compared to abc news while most     say they would tend to trust abc more  with   saying they would trust both sides equally  when pitted against msnbc    trust trump more while   trust the liberal leaning cable channel more  with   trusting both about equally  when pitted against fox news  only   trust trump more while   trust the politically conservative news outlet more  with   trusting both about equally  another interesting but not surprising finding from the poll was the fact that networks like msnbc and abc were viewed as more credible than fox news  which has previously been outed as the most dishonest network  which is likely why trump cites them so much   the only area where trump is actually succeeding in credibility is among republicans  who tend to take trump s nonsense as the truth  the poll reported  the story is different  though  when isolating the views of republicans  americans who identify as gop partisans are more likely to have confidence in trump over any of the news sources tested in the poll  this is especially true for msnbc   trump is more trusted by a   to   margin   and abc news   trump is more trusted by a   to   margin  the president even has a slight  although statistically insignificant    to   trust advantage over fox news among his fellow partisans  with   of republicans saying they trust both equally as an information source  so  trump basically screwed himself over by trying to damage the credibility of the free press  while it s somewhat satisfying to see his attacks on the media backfire  we must not forget that what trump s ridiculous behavior has resulted in is extremely dangerous  the white house now has no credibility  which could be devastating in the event that something serious happens  no one can trust the president  and he has undermined the credibility of the government  it will take a long time to repair this and rebuild the trust of the american people featured image is a screenshot
