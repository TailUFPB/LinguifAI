ben carson  the head of the department of housing and urban development  has come under fire for comments he made during a radio interview on tuesday when he called poverty a  state of mind  live on air  a statement like that would be quite low coming from anyone  but it takes on a whole new meaning when it comes from the lips of the man who oversees the department that handles housing for millions of low income americans the statement was made when carson was being interviewed by conservative media personality and personal friend  armstrong williams  carson  a retired neurosurgeon  has dealt directly with poverty himself and credits his mother for getting his family out of that situation  but that didn t stop him from implying that some people are just poor because they have a negative outlook on life according to a transcript of the interview with williams that was released on wednesday  carson didn t shy away from making his feelings on the subject known   i think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind   he said   you take somebody that has the right mindset  you can take everything from them and put them on the street  and i guarantee in a little while they ll be right back up there  but he didn t stop there  adding that lending a helping hand to those in need may not even improve their lives if they don t have the right mental attitude  thus there s really no point in trying   you take somebody with the wrong mindset  you can give them everything in the world   they ll work their way right back down to the bottom   he continued  strong words coming from the man who is in charge of trying to keep roofs over the heads of those not exactly living in the lap of luxury not every low income earner is presented with the same opportunities as carson s mother  but in his opinion  that shouldn t even factor into the equation   if everybody had a mother like mine  nobody would be in poverty   carson said   she was a person who absolutely would not accept the status of victim  naturally  twitter exploded after the release of the transcript on wednesday  as twitter tends to do  with everyone from former barack obama advisor valerie jarrett to beloved star trek actor and human rights activist george takei weighing in on carson s comments poverty is a state of mind ben carson  tell that to a kid who can t afford lunch for school or won t have anything to eat for dinner   it s kimberly   bkimberlyb  may    carson said poverty is a state of mind next month  i m going to tell my landlord that i paid my rent with positive thinking   zerlina maxwell   zerlinamaxwell  may    carson says that poverty is a  state of mind   you know what else is a state of mind  always being a blithering idiot   george takei   georgetakei  may    image via larry french getty images
