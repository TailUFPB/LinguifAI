republicans are panicking over today s special election in georgia  which pits democrat john ossoff against republican trump sycophant and woman who politicized the susan g  komen foundation  karen handel in a normal year  this district wouldn t be competitive at all  but this isn t a normal year  we have the least popular president in our history in office and he happens to be dragging the rest of the party down with him   at least that will be the argument if ossoff manages to win the squeaker election because the election is being seen as a referendum on trump  a trump super pacs are aggressively targeting voters with some pretty awful tactics  including associating ossoff with the gunman who shot rep  steve scalise during a baseball practice  another trump super pac is using president obama s voice to mislead voters into voting against ossoff great america alliance  which calls itself the  largest and most effective pro trump super pac   took a passage from obama s book  dreams from my father  to use it against ossoff  the passage describes obama s first haircut after arriving in chicago to become a community organizer obama s barber  named smitty  speaks in the passage of the racial and political tension in chicago before the city elected harold washington as its first black mayor in   and the neglect african americans felt from the democratic party at the time in the paperback version of the book  obama directly quotes smitty s words  in the audio version  obama reads them aloud source  washington postonly instead of using the real meaning of the passage  great alliance turned it on its head as a way to get african american voters to not vote for the democrat in the ad  an african american man named autry pruitt says   hi  my name is autry pruitt  a fellow black american working hard every day  just like you  it may seem out of season  but all of a sudden  democratic politicians have started coming around again  we normally only see them every other november  swarming around and making promises to get our vote  but nothing ever changes for us  does it  here s what president barack obama had to say about it  then  president obama s voice comes on with the out of context quote  a plantation  black people in the worst jobs  the worst housing  police brutality rampant   obama says   but when the so called black committeemen came around election time  we d all line up and vote the straight democratic ticket  sell our souls for a christmas turkey  then pruitt tells listeners not to  sell out for another christmas turkey  here it is don t sell out for a  christmasturkey  the time for change is now   gapol   pic twitter com drkiwbuuvq  great    alliance   trumpalliance  june    real passage  though  had nothing to do with the democratic party  instead  it laments a time before chicago elected its first black mayor  harold washington the misinterpretation is so blatant that politifact ranks it a  pants on fire  lie featured image via alex wong getty images
