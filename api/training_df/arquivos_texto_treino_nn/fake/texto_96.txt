on tuesday  donald trump told a story about air force one and former president barack obama  the only problem is that it never happened  before boarding the plane to come home  trump told the press that air force one was denied landing rights in the philippines during a trip by his predecessor because u s  relations with the nation were so bad trump said air force one  never got to land  in the philippines while be bragged about having  a very strong relationship  with the southeast asian nation  and as you know  we were having a lot of problems with the philippines  the relationship with the past administration was horrible  to use a nice word   trump told reporters in manila  i would say  horrible  is putting it mildly  you know what happened  many of you were there  and you never got to land   he continued   the plane came close but it didn t land  the associated press fact checked trump s bizarre claim president barack obama last visited the philippines in november   arriving in manila after an overnight flight from turkey  there were no problems with landing the plane  obama used the visit to announce the united states was transferring two ships to the philippine navy perhaps trump was referring erroneously to obama s aborted meeting with president rodrigo duterte  in september   obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new philippines leader in laos after duterte called him an obscene name  duterte was warning obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade obama did visit the philippines on several trips earlier in his presidency and even signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the country in   but trump claimed that our relationship with the philipines is  probably better than ever before  so it s very important that we get along with the philippines  and we really do  we have a very good relationship  i would actually say probably better than ever before   he said duterte has carried out an unlawful crackdown on suspected drug dealers and users  resulting in at least  thousand deaths by means including execution using death squads  hitler massacred  million jews  there are  million drug addicts  i d be happy to slaughter them   duterte declared in  however  while trump was there he largely ignored any discussion of human rights with the dictator  we understand that trump is jealous of president obama  but his lies prove why he has so much disdain for fact checkers  it s sad that he doesn t have that same disdain for murderous dictators  though photo by zach gibson   pool getty images
