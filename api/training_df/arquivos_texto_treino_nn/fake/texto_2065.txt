we re only two months into trump s failing presidency  and even the republican party wants nothing more than to see the end of it  what s even more surprising  is that many of the party s most prominent members are doing very little to hide their feelings and disappointment earlier today  sen  lindsey graham  r sc  took the opportunity to grill trump s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch during his confirmation hearing  graham has been a major critic of trump since his presidential campaign  and he made sure to insult trump on his stance on torture practices while questioning gorsuch  sending a warning to trump about his stance on waterboarding in particular  graham said to gorsuch  you have said several times he is not above the law  so if we have laws on the book that prevent waterboarding  do you agree with me that the detainee treatment act prevents waterboarding  under the detainee treatment act  waterboarding is illegal   and yet  trump has blatantly stated during his campaign that he doesn t believe waterboarding is a torture method  he has previously said in several different interviews that waterboarding  absolutely  works and claims it is  just short of torture  graham then followed his question to gorsuch up with this statement  which sounded much like a promise and a threat to trump  in case president trump is watching   if you start waterboarding  you may be impeached  gorsuch s response made it perfectly clear that he was in agreement with graham  he said  senator  the impeachment power belongs to this body  no man is above the law  you can watch graham send this shocking message to trump below there have never been more reasons to impeach a president  and now even republicans are beginning to recognize that this man does not belong in the white house featured image via screenshot
