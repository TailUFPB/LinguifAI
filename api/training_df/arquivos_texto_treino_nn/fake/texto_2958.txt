freelancers love entitled people  really we do  especially when those entitled people are also rich  giving away our services to those who can easily pay market rates for them is just so much better than  you know  getting paid in actual dollars that we can turn around and use to pay our bills  and tiffany trump and her mother  trump s second wife marla maples  just put themselves into the category of rich  entitled jagoffs who think people owe them work for free they re both going to trump s inauguration on friday  and of course  they have to look absolutely perfect  that means getting their hair and makeup done by stylists and artists  tricia kelly  a freelance stylist  received word from a contact with connections to the trumps that tiffany and marla were looking for someone to do this work for them  so she got in touch  gave them her rates for both work and travel  and marla wasn t having it but maples  through her assistant  balked   i was told they had a   budget for both of them for hair and makeup   kelly says how the hell do those two only have a   budget  a regular person with a decent paying job has a   budget for this  maybe   maples reportedly has a net worth of   million  tiffany has a reported net worth of just     but she s also  and she s also maples  daughter  and they only have a budget of   for this please  don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts kelly managed to negotiate a total cost of    which is still absurdly cheap  but that s apparently when things got really ridiculous  after kelly got maples  assistant to agree to that rate  she then asked if kelly would be willing to do the work  for exposure   it s not even  exposure  in the form of a tear sheet she could put in a portfolio  or something else tangible no this exposure would be in the form of maples mentioning her on social media jesus fucking christ but these people are spoiled rotten brats  and when kelly wouldn t do it  she got veiled threats in return  you are messing with the president of the united states   the maples contact wrote her  adding that maples was worried about her financial situation with tiffany out of college  ending child support payments from the president elect   she is used to a certain lifestyle and you don t understand that  so  she s still worth   million  so she can shut it  and even if one could say there was a legitimate worry about money now  well  like the rest of us  if she can t afford a pricey service  then she can jolly well do without  she is not entitled to people s work without compensation any more than any of the rest of us are sure  there are stylists  artists and designers who are willing to loan things to  or do complimentary work for  a list celebrities because that is exposure that will translate into more paying work and better rates and prices  sorry to say  though  that marla and tiffany are not exactly a listers here  and they are associated with politics  which people working in these fields tend to shun unless they re getting paid kelly was shocked by the entitlement complex  as any of us would have been in her shoes  there are people who make far less than they do who pay full price   she said   people on staff   the incoming white house and the outgoing one  pay full price  it seemed like they were trying to see how much they could get for free based on their names  the market rates for these services run anywhere from    to over     so even the   that maples  assistant said they would pay was a pittance seriously  give us a break  in other words  she and tiffany are just as used to getting what they want from us peons as cheetolini and the rest of his family  and if they want you to work for free  then dammit  you will work for free or you will face the consequences  and that is that featured image by kevin winter via getty images
