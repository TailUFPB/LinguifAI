monday morning  things got much worse for donald trump and his version of what happened during the phone call he made to myeshia johnson  the pregnant widow of sgt  la david johnson  who was killed in the nigerian ambush orchestrated by isis appearing on abc s good morning america  the grieving widow confirmed the account of the florida representative  frederica wilson  who was accompanying her on her way to meet her husband s remains when trump s call came in  not only did she repeat exactly what wilson had recalled  but she said it made her  very upset and hurt   and made her cry  even worse  on what must have been the worst day of her young life she said that she has  nothing to say  to president trump johnson was sucked into a bitter  public dispute over the call when wilson recounted what trump had said as she listened on speakerphone  the timeline of events just spirals from there  with trump  his spokeswoman sarah huckabee sanders  and his chief of staff retired  star general john f  kelly all taking swipes at representative wilson in lieu of overtly calling myeshia johnson herself a liar all of that changed monday morning after mrs  johnson s appearance on gma  trump went back to twitter one more time  it is now impossible to view what he s saying as anything other than calling her a liar directly i had a very respectful conversation with the widow of sgt  la david johnson  and spoke his name from beginning  without hesitation   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     spoke his name  part of the tweet refers to something very specific that johnson said in the gma interview   that the president could not remember sgt  johnson s name   couldn t remember my husband s name    that s what hurt me the most     myeshia johnson  widow of sgt  la david johnson pic twitter com   good morning america   gma  october    seems bizarre at this point that donald trump would continue to  defend  himself over his statements  but it s important to remember that the details of this terrorist ambush are still very  very unclear  if the whole affair turns out to be something akin to benghazi   the attack that killed four americans in    then public perception will play a big role in who the american public blames for every aspect what happened  including how he handled the deaths trump seems pretty eager to shift that blame off himself and onto literally anyone else even the widow of a dead soldier watch myeshia johnson s interview here featured image via joe raedle getty images
