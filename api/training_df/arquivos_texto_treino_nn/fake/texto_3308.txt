when a  charitable  foundation offers access to a public official in exchange for large donations it s called pay for play throughout the  campaign  donald trump and his team of minions led by kellyanne conway repeatedly accused hillary clinton of using the clinton foundation to sell access to the secretary of state s office  allegations that have been proven false no matter how many times conservatives repeat them but eric and donald trump jr  just got caught trying to sell access to their father through the eric trump foundation by requiring   million donations for a private meeting with the president elect that s the exact definition of pay for play  which is why the demonic duo rescinded the offer and quickly backed away from the scheme and when kellyanne conway pathetically tried to defend their scheme  cnn host chris cuomo took her to the woodshed for being a lying hypocrite  i think we should go back and look at what don jr  and eric have done and wanted to continue to do  which is raise money for charities   conway remarked in an attempt to evade cuomo s question about the illegal scheme   the eric trump foundation is  years old  it has done enormously great work  cuomo pointed out that conway herself whined when clinton s team made the same argument  it s the same thing the clinton people said when they were defending their allegations of pay for play  they  eric and donald jr   were selling off a million dollar trip to hunt with the boys and hang out with the president  that sounds like paying for access  but conway dodged again by throwing out the same accusations and attacks against the clinton s that have been repeatedly debunked  i don t know how that s the same as bill clinton giving a million dollar speech in russia and then hillary clinton  while secretary of state  turning around and giving  percent of the u s  uranium interests away   conway claimed  but that tall tale was rated false back in june then cuomo grilled conway cuomo   so paying a million dollars to hang out with the president is okay  conway   i didn t say that  cuomo   i know  you re not answering  you re going after the clintons  i m saying  what s your answer  conway   you mentioned the clinton foundation  you said it s the same  i m saying it s absolutely not the same  then cuomo dropped the hammer  you re giving the same defense that they gave  when you made the allegations against the clintons  they said   we do lots of great work  we took these meetings  there s never been a direct connection between what she did at the  and what was going on at the foundation   you re now saying basically the same thing   eric trump does great work with his foundation and paying a lot of money to hang out with the president is okay   if it s all okay  why are they backing away  conway then whined that the media isn t treating trump and his family fairly  which has been the main strategy when they are caught being hypocrites here s the video via youtube eric trump and his unfortunately named brother clearly knew what they were doing was wrong and that they were going to get busted running a pay for play scheme  that s the only reason why they backed out  and kellyanne conway knows it  which is why her defense was so pathetic  whining about the media and attacking the clintons have become the standard rules whenever trump or his family members are busted doing something wrong  one still wonders how conway can sleep at night or look at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she is defending satan and his demon spawn featured image via screenshot
