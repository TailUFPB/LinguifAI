donald trump is already making the republican party insane  and it hasn t even been a week yet  while many gopers found trump s twitter use concerning  it s reached an entirely new level considering that trump is unavailable to them by all other means on wednesday  the republican party suffered another humiliating blow when senator chuck grassley  r ia  was forced to go on twitter and beg trump   in front of everyone   to force his executive branch to answer senators  requests so that oversight could be performed  grassley tweeted  pres trump pls issue order to all in ur executive branch ppl to answer all senator requests for records so we can do oversight  this was followed by several pathetic attempts to get trump to respond  probably because trump and his team wouldn t play by the rules and answer more conventional methods of communication  no surprise there  grassley tried everything to get trump s attention   he even tried to educate the  president of the united states about  how important  oversight is  probably because grassley realizes trump doesn t know anything about how the government actually works grassley even tried to diss former president barack obama in hopes that trump would respond  hours later  grassley s pleas for trump to do his job had gone unanswered  and things got a little testy damn  but honestly  what did the gop expect from trump  the guy who took the weekend off from being president after his inauguration   this is a man who obviously doesn t care about doing the work of a president  he just wanted the title trump s first week has been such a disaster  and it s not even over  he s not only becoming a nightmare for all of americans and democrats   he s a liability to his own party  the fact that a republican senator had to publicly tweet at trump in order to get his attention is extremely embarrassing  but that s what they signed up for when they nominated him featured image via steve pope getty images
