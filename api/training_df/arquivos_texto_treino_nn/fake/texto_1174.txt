robert mueller  the man selected in may by the justice department to head the investigation into russia s interference in the  presidential election  probably thought the job was relatively secure when he initially accepted the position  but now donald trump s attorneys most likely have mueller second guessing his decision in an interview on sunday  jay sekulow  one of trump s attorneys  alluded to the fact that he wouldn t completely rule out the possibility that the president may fire mueller from leading the investigation into trump s campaign  why would he fire mueller  simply because he can abc s george stephanopoulos was interviewing sekulow on the program this week on sunday and the topic of the investigation came up  stephanopoulos asked sekulow if the president would give any assurance that he would not interfere in the investigation into russian ties or order u s  attorney general jeff sessions  a man that many believe has already committed perjury on more than one occasion since he was sworn in for the position in early february  to fire mueller  sekulow s response wasn t particularly convincing  look  the president of the united states  as we all know  is a unitary executive   sekulow said during the interview   but the president is going to seek the advice of his counsel and inside the government as well as outside  and i m not going to speculate on what he will  or will not  do  so  not only did sekulow not give any assurance that trump would pledge not to meddle in the investigation or have mueller fired  he completely avoided acknowledging both points  in fact  sekulow went on to add that he  can t imagine  the issue of firing the head of the investigation would arise  but  that  again  is an issue that the president with his advisers would discuss if there was a basis  nobody said getting to the bottom of the russia scandal was going to be easy featured image via andrew burton getty images
