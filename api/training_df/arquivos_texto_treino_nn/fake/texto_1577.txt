ever since donald trump won the election  republicans have felt they have free reign to show just how racist and despicable they can be  the party s true colors are on full display  and today s gopers have no shame in expressing their most vile thoughts and offensive sense of humor we saw this today when mike huckabee decided to celebrate cinco de mayo by tweeting an extremely racist message  which he obviously thought was hilarious  the problem is  no one else did people have criticized huckabee s jokes before  stating that they re either not funny or mean spirited  and some are just plain confusing  in this case  huckabee went full racist and unleashed his funny bone on twitter huckabee stated that in celebration of cinco de mayo  he would  drink an entire jar of hot salsa   watch racist cartoons and  speak spanish  all day  you can t get more racist than that  if you didn t think this  joke  was funny  you re not alone   tons of people on twitter didn t enjoy it  either   and they didn t hesitate to tell him  huckabee got dragged on twitter  proving that america won t stand for the  values  that the trump administration is trying to push on the country  here are some of the best responses       here s our favorite  and it s probably the response that will hurt the most  because it s true after his presidential campaign crashed and burned  coming to a pathetic end  huckabee is struggling to stay relevant  he hopped on the trump train for a while  and this joke explains exactly why he supported the undeserving potus   racists love to stick together hopefully  the backlash to this tweet will remind huckabee that no one likes him and that racism is still not okay  even if we do have a racist president at the moment featured image via getty images
