it s about time kansas republicans saw the light and told governor sam brownback to go f ck himself kansas has been taking a beating because of brownback s trickle down economics policy of slashing taxes  and republicans in the state have finally done something about it in   brownback convinced the republican controlled state house and senate to pass massive tax cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals  for the first time  conservatives employed their trickle down policy over an entire state  and the experiment turned out to be an immediate disaster that has destroyed the state financially to the point where little revenue was coming in  creating an unsustainable budget shortfall of hundreds of millions of dollars that was only going to get worse republicans desperately tried to plug the budget hole by cutting education and other programs  which caused a lot of kansans to suffer  basically  republicans refused to admit that their tax policies failed and hoped they could the problem without reversing the tax cuts unable to do so  and facing a   million shortfall  republicans in kansas passed legislation in the house and senate designed to  raise income tax rates and end a tax exemption for roughly   business owners   in other words  republicans rejected brownback s tax policy brownback  of course  vetoed the legislation  but lawmakers in the kansas house formally overrode his veto on wednesday by a huge margin of    the legislation now heads to the state senate if enough state senators have the backbone to stand up to their unpopular governor  revenues will start pouring into government coffers to cover the budget hole he dug and kansas will avoid future financial ruin for four years  republicans denied reality by insisting that tax cuts on businesses and the wealthy somehow generate more revenue and they continue to insist on such a policy at the national level  the problem is that republican tax policies have only created a skyrocketing national debt and trillion dollar deficits that cannot be filled by slashing things like food stamps  which only accounts for less than  percent of federal spending the fact is that taxes make civilization possible  if we want things like good education  healthcare  roads  food aid  and social security  then we need to pay taxes to pay for them  and that includes businesses and the wealthy  arguing otherwise on their behalf like republicans have been doing for decades is unpatriotic and un american  and kansas  failed experiment proves it featured image  win mcnamee getty images
