while it was billed as a one time only clash between the vice presidential running mates  the real matchup at the vice presidential debate turned out not to be mike pence versus tim kaine after all as this video from the group correct the record shows  mike pence spent more time slamming positions and statements held by his own running mate  donald trump  than either of the members of the democratic ticket here s the video it was really stunning to see pence again and again roll his eyes or exhale as kaine recited trump s bizarre rhetoric  only to use his response time to completely avoid defending trump or offering up the most token resistance it s no wonder that many observing the debate believe pence s tactics have more to do with a possible presidential run in  than any real interest in being trump s vice president for   years the thinking is that even on a losing ticket  pence will have the sort of national exposure that would be impossible to earn through any other means  as the most recent republican primary showed  a big name brand can conquer a field composed of governors  senators  and business leaders despite their credentials  even as a siting governor  pence would not have somewhere in the realm of  million people watching anything he could do as the leader of indiana compared to number two on the presidential ticket so while the strategy seems to hurt in the short term   whatever happened to party unity   it may be a play for the so called  long game  in which pence has a leg up over the post trump gop field that being said  it could just be an act of self preservation on pence s part  not allying yourself with the man who attacks muslims  christians  and blacks is just good brand management  even though by simply being on the ticket  pence is giving it validation in all its bigoted glory featured image via screen capture
