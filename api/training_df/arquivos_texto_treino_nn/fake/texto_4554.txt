donald trump is  well  deplorable  he s suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown skinned  rapists  and  drug dealers  from charging into the country  gotten on board with creating a national registry for muslims like hitler did with the jews  forcing said muslims to wear special identification badges  and even rounding them up into modern day concentration camps as a  temporary measure   he s even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad  the other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families  when you get these terrorists  you have to take out their families  they care about their lives  don t kid yourself  when they say they don t care about their lives  you have to take out their families  but he s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas  he also wants to bring that idea home  in a statement on the bombings in new york and new jersey over the weekend  the donald s senior communications advisor explained that trump is not fighting terrorism   he s fighting the  narratives  of barack obama and hillary clinton  and trump s  narrative  is  kill them all  last weekend s attacks  which are just the latest to be carried out on u s  soil on president obama s watch  should be a wakeup call for every american  it is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that  immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full u s  citizenship because of the failed policies supported by president obama and hillary clinton  even worse  clinton must explain her reckless support for a   increase in syrian refugees and her push for an all out open border policy  which will put even more americans at risk  the threat from radical islamic terrorism has only grown under obama and clinton  and isis has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational  our enemies neither fear nor respect hillary clinton  and as a nation  that is dangerous  and it is disgraceful  mr  trump will bring an end to these attacks  because unlike obama and clinton  he believes we re in more than a fight about  narratives    these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens pay attention to that last bit   they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens  now  we already know that the problem according to the gop presidential nominee is  radical islamic terrorism   and that trump has  numerous times  blamed muslims in general for any attacks he could  exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating  terrorists  they re protecting each other  but they re really doing very bad damage they have to open up to society and report the bad ones   trump said in march   when they see trouble  they have to report it  they are absolutely not reporting it  and that s a big problem  if muslims are  protecting  terrorists  are they not terrorists in trump s eyes  how many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows islam was rounded up  would there be mass exterminations  trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists  families  how would he define terrorism these are all questions it is unlikely that mr  trump will answer for himself   but remember he is exactly the sort of person who  with a wink and a nod  suggests disarming his political opponents  security to  see what happens  to them  shortly after suggesting that  second amendment people  could deal with them  we re dealing with an unstable  constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the  little red button  that launches our nuclear arsenal it s also important to remember that the attacks in new york and new jersey were committed by an american citizen   one with constitutional rights  no matter how much someone wants to call for blood  this  of course  matters not to the donald normally  suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole  but not with trump  he s said it himself  many times if we allow this alleged human  this oompa loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation   to assume office  it will not end well  be sure to vote in november if it s the last thing you do  if trump wins  it may be featured image via getty images joe raedle
