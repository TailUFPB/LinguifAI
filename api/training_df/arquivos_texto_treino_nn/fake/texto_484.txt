donald trump s so called presidency is plagued with so many scandals it s hard to keep up  so naturally  impeachment is being floated around  the former reality show star and co writer of  art of the deal   has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for  months now  trump s approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the  year history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign s possible ties to russia on top of that  white house advisers have reportedly been warning trump about his potential removal from office  which entails the exhaustive impeachment process  according to newsweek meanwhile  trump is so worried that he s taken to his twitter account to look for protection  it s very sad that republicans  even some that were carried over the line on my back  do very little to protect their president   trump tweeted in late july   if republicans don t repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare  the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand  according to the washington post  several white house advisers have voiced their concerns to trump about his possible impeachment  and about how overcoming such proceedings would require friendships with the elected officials responsible for making a decision as to whether he should remain in office  but instead  he seems to be at battle with them  including his republican colleagues  who he has lashed out at repeatedly  if democrats take the house in   impeachment proceedings could begin  and as far as funding his ego wall along the southern border  well  that wouldn t even be a consideration in a democratic controlled house trump s latest war has been with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  a man of influence in washington  dc  despite what we might think of mcconnell  he s a powerful man  he could  ironically  make trump a one term president  photo by alex wong getty images
