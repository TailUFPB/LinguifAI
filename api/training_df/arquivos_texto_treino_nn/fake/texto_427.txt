most of the nation and world watched in horror just a couple of weeks ago as white supremacists  neo nazis  ku klux klan members  and other various white power groups descended on charlottesville  virginia  their violent  hateful rally eventually resulted in the death of a brave counter protester   year old heather heyer as if that weren t bad enough  donald trump s response to this racist violence made the situation that had already turned the nation into a tinder box even worse  instead of condemning white supremacy as any sane  non bigoted person would  trump instead made an equivocation between the vile white supremacists and the people there protesting their hate  only when he was forced to do so did he condemn the violent hate groups by name  however  trump  being the arrogant  bigoted jackass that he is  could not let that carefully scripted statement stand  in a freewheeling press conference for the ages  trump ranted for more than half an hour about how the other side was just as bad as the white supremacists  well  now  it seems that members of the united states senate are sick of trump s bigotry and pandering to white supremacists  and they plan to force his hand on the issue politico is reporting that a bipartisan group of senators   tim kaine  d va   mark warner  d va   lisa murkowski  r ak   and cory gardner  r co   have drawn up a resolution that will have trump make a legal statement against what happened in charlottesville  that isn t all it does  though  it also forces trump  once and for all and on the record  to commit to  rejecting white nationalists  white supremacists  the ku klux klan  neo nazis and other hate groups  this is an extraordinary move  considering that resolutions are usually just symbolic in nature and not controversial at all  generally  they just recognize honorary holidays for people of note and things like that  however  this resolution   dubbed the charlottesville resolution   will force trump to  once and for all  stop winking and nodding at these vile hate groups  senator mark warner said  let there be no mistake  what happened in charlottesville was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a white supremacist  one that tragically cut short the life of a young woman  heather heyer  who was speaking out against hatred and bigotry  we will be pressing our colleagues to swiftly and unanimously approve this resolution in order to send a strong message that the united states congress unconditionally condemns racist speech and violence  senator tim kaine said in a statement of his own  during the violent white supremacist demonstrations in charlottesville last month  our country lost three brave virginians in heather heyer and virginia state police officers  lieutenant jay cullen and trooper pilot berke bates  this resolution honors their lives while supporting the charlottesville community as it heals and rightfully calls on us all  including president trump  to do better as we combat acts of hate  the beautiful thing about this is that every single senator will have to vote in favor of it  lest they be labeled a nazi sympathizer for the rest of their political careers  while teflon don gets away with being an open racist  it has been shown time and time again that these other politicians do not have cults of personality of their own and will not be so fortunate should they attempt the same sort of behavior to that end  trump will have no choice but to sign this charlottesville resolution  and it will be in the presidential records as long as this republic exists featured image via zach gibson   pool getty images
