on christmas day  donald trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day  but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row  the former reality show star blasted former president barack obama for playing golf and now trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played updated my tracker of trump s appearances at trump properties  rounds of golf including today s  at this pace  he ll pass obama s first term total by july  next year  https   t co  pic twitter com   philip bump   pbump  december    that makes what a washington post reporter discovered on trump s website really weird  but everything about this administration is bizarre af  the coding contained a reference to obama and golf   unlike obama  we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course   however  the coding wasn t done correctly the website of donald trump  who has spent several days in a row at the golf course  is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error  https   t co zrwpymxrcz pic twitter com   christopher ingraham   cingraham  december    snippet of code appears to be on all https   t co  pages  which the footer says is paid for by the rnc  pic twitter com   christopher ingraham   cingraham  december    s also all over https   t co   as others have noted in this thread  this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display  but who knows   christopher ingraham   cingraham  december    the coding was called out  the reference to obama was deleted update  the golf error message has been removed from the trump and gop websites  they also fixed the javascript     vs      problem  still not clear when these messages would actually display  since the actual   and presumably   page displays a different message pic twitter com   christopher ingraham   cingraham  december    suggests someone at either rnc or the trump admin is sensitive enough to trump s golf problem to make this issue go away quickly once people noticed  you have no idea how much i d love to see the email exchange that led us here   christopher ingraham   cingraham  december    the code was f cked up the best part about this is that they are using the      assignment  operator which means that bit of code will never get run  if you look a few lines up  errorcode  will always be                december    s coders can t code  nobody is surprised   tim peterson   timrpeterson  december    trump is obsessed with obama that his name was even in the coding of his website while he played golf again photo by joe raedle getty images
