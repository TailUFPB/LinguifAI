republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell might just find himself the next target of one of donald trump s temper tantrums on twitter earlier today during a politico playbook event  mcconnell basically threw trump under the bus and humiliated him in front of everyone when he very bluntly said that mexico would not be paying for trump s idiotic  ineffective border wall   a statement that greatly contradicts everything that trump promised during his presidential campaign when mcconnell was questioned about trump s wall  mcconnell first tried to give a diplomatic answer and said  there are some places along the border where that s probably not the best way to secure the border   however  when he was further pressed to see if he felt mexico would pay for the wall  mcconnell dropped all niceties and put his thoughts very bluntly  he smirked and said  uh  no  mcconnell and everyone in the room then shared a laugh  all at trump s expense you can watch mcconnell poke fun at trump below  for a leading republican like mcconnell to embarrass the republican party s leader and sitting potus like this is certainly surprising  and it only proves just how few people actually believe trump is competent enough for this role and will be able to deliver his promises to the american people already  we ve seen trump walk back several of his major campaign promises  one of them being this mexico border wall  mexico s leaders have already repeatedly stated that mexico will not pay for the wall  and trump has had to cover it up and lie to the american people and say that first taxpayers will pay for the wall  only to be reimbursed by mexico at a later date   which mexico has not agreed to  mcconnell s comments show that no one   not even the gop   believes trump anymore featured image via drew angerer   getty images
