this is a major conflict of interest that should automatically disqualify him when the senate judiciary committee voted along party lines to approve donald trump s nomination of brett talley to a federal judgeship in alabama  they did so without knowing that talley is married to white house lawyer ann donaldson  who is the chief of staff to white house counsel donald mcgahn that s a pretty big detail to leave out of a disclosure form according to the new york times mr  talley was asked on his publicly released senate questionnaire to identify family members and others who are  likely to present potential conflicts of interest   he did not mention his wife district judges often provide the first ruling when laws are called into question  decisions that can put them at odds with the white house and its lawyers  last month  for example  judges in hawaii and maryland temporarily blocked mr  trump s travel ban mr  talley also did not mention his wife when he described his frequent contact with white house lawyers during the nomination process talley has also never tried a case in his life  making him even more unqualified to be a judge  in fact  the american bar association judged tally as  unqualified  for the position in a very rare unanimous decision the senate could hold a confirmation vote as early as monday  and it is important that they reject talley  especially since he lied to them by omission if republicans confirm talley  they will be telling future nominees that it s okay to lie to congress in order to get an important job  that should not be allowed to happen  trump and republicans often claim that immigration should be based on merit  well  becoming a federal judge should definitely be based on merit  not based on who you re married to and whether you ll be a rubber stamp for a corrupt administration featured image  win mcnamee getty images
