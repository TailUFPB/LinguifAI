sean spicer is the former communications man for the republican national committee  he will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming trump administration  and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of trump s ongoing feud with the press  speaking with the hill  spicer whined about how the media treats trump  he began  there s some positive aspects here and there  but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves  i think for a lot of folks inside the beltway  and inside pundit world  they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the american people are  they continue to mock him in ways  when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the american people are and what they think  spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of democrats in the press  saying  there are countless examples of the media engaging   overtly or covertly   cheering on democrats and there s no accountability  but it s also not even frowned upon  the thing is  though  the press realizes what the republican party doesn t  which is that trump is a petty  vengeful  lying  unqualified  corrupt russian stooge who has duped just enough americans in the right states to be elected president  that does not mean that he is deserving of respect  though  in fact  respect is earned  not given  and trump has shown the media zero respect  rightfully  they are giving it back in kind  he has not earned their respect  and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with trump  saying that the white house press briefings that they   and the american people   have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a trump white house  it will be a daily something  when i say  something   maybe it s a gaggle  maybe it s an on camera briefing  maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions   because they can t afford to be in washington   but they still have a question  maybe we just let the american people submit questions that we read off as well  this is most definitely vague  and when it comes to vague with team trump  that is an ominous sign  most likely spicer then said that he had spoken with former white house press secretaries  from both major parties  and said of them  whether republican or democrat  every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time  counsel and advice  the respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them  speaking of former bill clinton white house press secretary mike mccurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised  spicer said  i think his conclusion   his points are right  the second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative  so  in other words  they want to cut the american people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government  the talk then turned to trump s insistence on using twitter for insults  policy announcements  and everything in between  many americans   including trump s own supporters   believe he needs to stay off twitter  spicer  however  scoffed at this notion  i think this is nonsense  i really do  because at the end of the day the american people want more than anything else is results  and success  and he s delivering already  and i think the american people   the people who have their jobs because of his actions   the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars  are appreciative  and i m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that  so  in other words  we can look forward to the tweeter in chief  we already knew that  though  spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press  journalists and everyone in america has a constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write  but he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight  the facts are known  and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable  so  this war with the media will continue for the next four years  considering trump s thin skinned  vengeful  vindictive nature  this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the white house to bully journalists and dismantle the first amendment  scary times indeed  folks   resist featured image via drew angerer getty images
