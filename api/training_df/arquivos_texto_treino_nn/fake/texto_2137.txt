cnn s jim acosta has been a thorn in the trump administration s side ever since donald trump insulted him during a press conference and called him and the news network  fake news   needless to say  every time acosta asks a question  trump s team gets nervous   and this was apparent yesterday when white house press secretary found himself cornered by acosta on the gop s new healthcare plan at a white house briefing when acosta brought up the fact that the republicans  new plan would result in millions of americans losing their insurance   a fact that was confirmed by the congressional budget office   spicer almost blew up trying to defend the gop s plan  acosta asked  would you concede that there will be some coverage losses  perhaps in the millions  there will be millions of people who will not have health insurance because of what you re doing  spicer tried to argue against obamacare s individual mandate  stating that many americans already chose not to purchase obamacare  instead opting to pay penalties   but acosta wasn t having any of it  acosta replied  the mandate forces people to buy insurance so you don t have the free rider problem  you have free riders and those folks end up in car accidents and end up at the emergency room  and then health care is much more expensive  spicer tried to hit back and say that obamacare  forced people to buy plans that they did not like that were mandated by the government   but acosta continued to lay into him with fact after fact  acosta was quick to point out that the cbo stated that over  million fewer americans would have coverage by   and argued that government run health care like obamacare was not the problem  acosta said  medicare is government run health care  i don t see citizens screaming that they want you to get rid of their medicare  acosta and spicer went back and forth over the gop s new healthcare plan for several minutes  and it was clear that spicer was unraveling and about to lose it  you can watch acosta rail against spicer below featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
