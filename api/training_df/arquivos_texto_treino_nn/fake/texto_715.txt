one of the things that has plagued america   besides donald trump himself   is the potus  twitter usage  every day  trump s twitter account serves as an endless amount of humiliation and chaos for a country that was once well respected around the world  while trump has proven to his staff  and the country  that he cannot be controlled on social media  a federal court may have just ruled that there are some things he just cannot do on twitter one of trump s most disturbing behaviors lies in his tendency to block people on twitter just because they disagree with him  currently  trump is being sued by the knight first amendment institute at columbia university for blocking people just because they expressed criticism  thanks to a federal court ruling that happened this week  trump may not be able to do that anymore this week  a federal court ruled on a case very similar to trump s  in which the chair of the loudoun county board of supervisors  phyllis j  randall  had been blocking constituents on her public facebook page  in the case davison v  loudoun county board of supervisors  randall wrote on her county facebook page  i really want to hear from any loudoun citizen on any issues  request  criticism  compliment  or just your thoughts   when brian c  davidson took her up on her offer  bringing up the alleged corruption in the county s school board  randall responded by deleting his comment and blocking him  the following morning  randall unblocked davidson but he was not able to comment on her page or send her messages  davidson argued that this was a violation of his freedom of speech  and a federal court ruled in his favor u s  district judge james c  cacheris ruled that this was a violation of the first amendment s free speech clause because randall was  offended by his criticism of her colleagues in the county government   which he regarded as unconstitutional  viewpoint discrimination    pretty much what trump does on twitter  cacheris explained defendant s offense at plaintiff s views was therefore an illegitimate basis for her actions particularly given that plaintiff earned defendant s ire by criticizing the county government  indeed  the suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the first amendment guards  by prohibiting plaintiff from participating in her online forum because she took offense at his claim that her colleagues in the county government had acted unethically  defendant committed a cardinal sin under the first amendment this certainly has implications to what might happen with trump s own twitter account  while trump might try to argue that his personal twitter page   separate from the  potus presidential account   is not intended to function as a public forum  it s obvious that trump uses it to make presidential announcements  members of his own team  such as former white house press secretary sean spicer  have even stated that trump s tweets are  official statements    which means this account should be subjected to the same rules as randall s public facebook page was featured image via steve pope   getty images
