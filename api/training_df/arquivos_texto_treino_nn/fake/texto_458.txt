donald trump and the republican congress may be failing miserably at their attempts to repeal and not replace the affordable care act  obamacare   but that doesn t mean trump isn t going to chip away at it  eventually dwindling it down to something that can be drowned in a bathtub trump took a big swing at obamacare on thursday by trying to keep the program secret from people who might be eligible to sign up  the white house is slashing the affordable care act s advertising budget by a whopping  percent  they re also cutting the budget for in person enrollment by  percent  so even if people do somehow get the message that they are eligible  good luck signing up  altogether  that s a  percent cut in programs designed to boost enrollment  which is the only way the exchanges will survive administration officials cited  diminishing returns  from outreach activities  in a phone call with reporters  they said that most americans already know about the affordable care act  they plan to make the deepest cuts to the enrollment workers who have signed up few health law enrollees source  voxif americans do know about the affordable care act  they have a funny way of showing it  a recent survey found that a third of americans didn t know that the affordable care act and obamacare were one and the same  most concerning  given thursday s cuts  is that those between the ages of  and  were among those least likely to know the difference  that s bad  the affordable care act needs younger and healthy participants  or it will smother under its own weight  the surest way to kill the exchanges is to keep them a secret   says timothy jost  a consumer advocate at the national association of insurance commissioners   sick people will find them  but getting younger and healthier people enrolled is the problem  that is exactly trump s point  he might not be able to kill the act through direct measures  but he can make it go broke  he already told us he would  republicans and  democrats let the american people down  as i said from the beginning  let obamacare implode  then deal  watch   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that trump doesn t give a crap about any of the american people  but that s no surprise  he is probably not even thinking about the millions of people he might be sentencing to death  only that he has another opportunity to stick it to the black guy  president obama  featured image via alex wong getty images
