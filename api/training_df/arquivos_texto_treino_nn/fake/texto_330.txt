john mccain survived brutal torture and six years as a prisoner of war during vietnam  if donald trump thinks he can intimidate him  he should think again on friday  the arizona senator released a statement announcing his intention to vote against the graham cassidy bill that republicans have introduced to repeal obamacare the bill would strip healthcare from  million americans  and turn medicaid into a block grant program that would cease to exist after a few years  the bill also gives states the power to obtain waivers so that insurance companies can discriminate against people with pre existing conditions  america s healthcare system would be thrown into dire chaos  and trump is absolutely okay with that mccain is not the issue is too important  and too many lives are at risk  for us to leave the american people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance  a bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach senators alexander and murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with obamacare  but i fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed  i hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail i cannot in good conscience vote for the graham cassidy proposal  i believe we could do better working together  republicans and democrats  and have not yet really tried  nor could i support it without knowing how much it will cost  how it will effect insurance premiums  and how many people will be helped or hurt by it  without a full cbo score  which won t be available by the end of the month  we won t have reliable answers to any of those questions and for that  trump viciously attacked mccain john mccain never had any intention of voting for this bill  which his governor loves  he campaigned on repeal   replace  let arizona down   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    had a   increase in obamacare premiums last year  with deductibles very high  chuck schumer sold john mccain a bill of goods  sad  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    block grants to states is a good thing to do  better control   management  great for arizona  mccain let his best friend l g  down   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    off  block grants are not enough to cover all the people who desperately need healthcare  in fact  it limits funding to the point where state officials will have to decide who gets care and who doesn t to avoid using up the grant money on expensive treatments  which sounds a lot like a death panel second  lindsey graham s friendship with mccain does not mean they vote the same  as graham made clear on twitter my friendship with  senjohnmccain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he s lived his life and the person he is   lindsey graham   lindseygrahamsc  september    has its flaws  but those flaws can be fixed easily with bipartisan legislation  mccain understands this and he understands that repealing obamacare would leave tens of millions of americans without healthcare  including millions of conservatives in red states donald trump is an asshole  he wants to kill a major healthcare law just because it is known as obamacare and because he is desperate for major legislation to sign  he hasn t even actually read the damn bill  which medical organizations and the healthcare industry agree is terrible besides  if trump wanted mccain s vote so much he should have thought of that before criticizing him for being a pow featured image  alex wong getty images
