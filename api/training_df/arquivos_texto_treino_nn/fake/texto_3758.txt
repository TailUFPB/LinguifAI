in what was supposed to be a celebration of thanksgiving  one little boy named caleb in west virginia was just brought to tears when his teacher ripped away his microphone right before he was about to say what he was supposed to say according to fox  phoenix  children in costumes approach the mic one by one to thank the audience and wish them a happy thanksgiving  when it comes time for caleb to speak  a woman is seen yanking the mic from its stand  caleb s mom  amanda riddle  said  i left in tears because one teacher mrs  linsey i think her name is grabbed the microphone from caleb and in a mean way  my son is a little different i know this but his heart is so big and he loves everyone  what does it matter if he wanted to say gobble gobble he was the turkey after all  i m sick of kids that are not considered  normal  be treated the way they are  according to the harrison county schools superintendent  dr  mark manchin  it s a mistake that was made  there was no malice  this teacher  as all of our teachers  truly care about these young boys and girls  the program was over  at least as i understand  and the teacher had taken the microphone  however  when looking at the video  it s very clear that the teach wanted to make sure the young child didn t get a chance to say what he wanted to say  of course  we don t know the full context of what happened  but any way you look at it  it doesn t look good  young caleb looked as though he was properly participating in the event  and it s doubtful his mother would ve have been upset if it was to be expected from the teacher needless to say  we can t treat children with autism in this regard  he was dressed up and ready to perform and was stripped of that opportunity  reducing him to tears watch here via fox  phoenix  caleb s not letting him get it down  though  and is now thanking everyone for their support  he s also finally sending his message of  gobble gobble   happy thanksgiving  caleb featured image via video screen capture
