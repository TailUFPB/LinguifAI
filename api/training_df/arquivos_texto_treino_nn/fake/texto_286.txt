trump supporters have been losing their minds over trump s assault on the nfl  with many abandoning their teams and publicly destroying merchandise they ll have to re buy in three weeks when their  boycott  fails like so many others  claiming to be outraged at nonexistent  disrespect to the flag  while crapping all over the freedoms it represents  conservatives are clearly mad at something one such trump supporter is in the video below  for as long as i can remember  i ve been a steelers fan   she begins   but i ve been american longer than that  it s unclear how she knows this  considering we ve already established steelers fandom as the beginning of her memory  moving on  coach tomlin  i read what you said  and the fact you said that  people shouldn t have to make a choice   what s the difference between making the choice between stupidity and standing for our american flag   she continues  executing her poorly rehearsed lines with all the confidence of someone who does not have a single honest friend  what s the choice between stupidity and standing for those who fought and died  and who stand at the stadium that you re at today and protect your sorry ass  it s unclear what she s talking about  she s referencing mike tomlin s decision to keep his team in the locker room instead of coming out on the field before last sunday s game  he made that decision because he did not want to see his team divided  before the nfl started taking payments from the department of defense to promote jingoistic   patriotic   themes  it was common practice for teams to remain in the locker room during the anthem  at the high school and college level  many teams still do the torture continues afterward  her awkward lines paired perfectly with her body language  which closely resembles that of a broken marionette in the care of a drunken puppeteer  well  from now on  i m done with the steelers  i stood for you guys  i fought for you guys  i argued for you guys  living in maryland  and this is what i get in return  it s unclear when she  fought  for them guys  perhaps when the quarterback  roethlisberger  was accused of rape  or maybe it was that other time he was accused of rape she then proceeds to melodramatically rip her steelers shirt off  uncovering   gasp   a trump shirt   go to hell   she says   all of you  the only flag that s going to fly in my house anymore is the united states flag  at this point  although it s not too relevant to the story  i would like to pause and point out that the person filming the camera hates her  they must  right  it s the only reasonable conclusion to draw from the following two facts    this video was filmed vertically  and   this video was filmed  nobody stopped her  nobody was like  hey  no  maybe you shouldn t post it to the internet  yet posted it was  it s at this point in the video she begins trying to light the steelers flag on fire  not the steelers flag   she absentmindedly adds  beginning her struggle with the confusing concept known as fire  forty arduous  failure filled seconds later  and she begins talking again  a nearly invisible wisp of smoke curling from the flag  this is just like a rag now  just like your team  a rag   she says  holding the torn shirt over the smoldering  ish   flag  trying to get it to light as well  it doesn t  the flag goes out  and then  she drops the shirt on top of it  perhaps finally confronting failure  go to hell steelers  go to hell nfl  piss off  god bless america  god bless donald trump  god bless america  done   she finishes the whole thing sounds like an incoherent facebook rant that one too many hillbilly cousins liked before ol  trailer park suburbia sally here got confident and decided it d make a good video watch below featured image via video screencapture
