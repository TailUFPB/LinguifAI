in an unprecedented move  the trump administration is considering not submitting a budget to congress next year  he would do this to avoid criticism and it s not illegal even though the congressional budget act requires the president to submit the fiscal  budget to congress between january  and february   as forbes notes  trump could easily say that it was the responsibility of the outgoing obama administration to comply with the law before the new president was sworn in on january    forbes  source of this news was someone in the gop congressional leadership again  this is unprecedented  but there s a reason  trumpfirsts was trending on twitter yesterday  clearly  the man doesn t know how to president every in coming president since the congressional budget act went into effect in the mid  has submitted a budget  in many years  those budgets  or amendments to the outgoing president s final budget  were submitted months after the first monday in february deadline and were truncated versions of the usual multi volume presentation  but  a fiscal plan with the new president s priorities was consistently released for over  decades a newly elected president is typically eager to submit a budget the first year because it s an opportunity to display the details and plans for things to come  it s showing the new president s priorities  but after a budget is submitted  it gives a platform for those who will criticize the administration  so if there s no proposal then there s no criticism and as for those promises trump made  it would also eliminate the need for the administration to publish a table with the very optimistic gdp growth promised during the campaign  the high interest rates many economists think are coming and trump s unrealistic assumptions on jobs and unemployment this is coming from a man who didn t release his taxes during his campaign  that  too  is not presidential  we d love to hear a good defense on this from trump supporters  y all got burned and we re going to have to clean another republican president s mess up when he creates an apocalyptic economy  by the way  the jobless rate is   percent right now  watch how fast that increases photo by alex wong via getty
