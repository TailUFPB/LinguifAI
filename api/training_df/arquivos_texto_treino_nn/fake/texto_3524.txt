if you thought senate democrats were going to capitulate and work with republicans after eight years of obstruction and a massive popular vote loss  you thought wrong  at least for now  senate dems are talking pretty big   and if the voters hold them to that path of action  it wouldn t make political sense not to continue at issue right now is the republican plan to repeal the affordable care act as soon as they gain power  without designing a replacement first  the republican strategy is this  repeal the aca immediately  but with a delay until it goes into place  there is debate about how long that delay should be  then  in the meantime  after it is repealed but before the repeal takes full effect  design a new system and pass it with partial democratic support in short  they want to take the healthcare of millions of americans hostage on the off chance that democrats will fold and do what they want not a chance  says senate minority leader chuck schumer  in an interview with the washington post  he had some interesting things to say about the republican strategy moving forward  we re not going to do a replacement   schumer said of the senate democratic caucus   if they repeal without a replacement  they will own it  democrats will not then step up to the plate and come up with a half baked solution that we will partially own  it s all theirs  republicans appear to be calculating that the looming prospect of millions losing insurance will force dems to cooperate with them to pass a replacement that covers far fewer people and offers less in consumer protection than the aca does   they may need dems to pass a replacement  because some conservatives may not vote for anything that spends and regulates to expand coverage   but if democrats do hold the line against anything far short of the aca  they may be able to leverage republicans into replacing it with something that is not nearly as regressive as the gop replacement might otherwise have been this is what schumer is now vowing to do  asked directly if democrats would refuse to support anything that falls significantly short of the aca in terms of expanding social welfare  schumer said   the odds  after they repeal without any replacement  of us sitting at the table to do something that will chop one arm off instead of two is very small  schumer said that in this scenario  democrats would not toss republicans a lifeline   they broke it  they own it   schumer said   all the problems in the health care system that they blamed on obamacare will now be in their laps  we re going to make sure that we say things would have been a lot better  had they been thoughtful and careful and worked with us to fix obamacare  and the fact remains that all republican options on the table are horrible  anyway  they want to repeal the individual mandate immediately for political points   but removing the individual mandate will cause the price of health insurance to spike as the pool of those insured rapidly shifts to older  sicker people  market instability will cause insurers to flee the markets  and is estimated to increase the number of uninsured to  million the study found that   million people would lose coverage directly due to repeal of the law s subsidies  medicaid expansion  and its individual requirement to carry health insurance another   million would become uninsured because of the ripple effects of market upheavals  that could happen if insurers lose confidence in the republican promise of a replacement and abandon the individual market  a key industry worry is that a repeal law would get rid of subsidies and mandates but still leave insurers on the hook for covering people with health problems the number of uninsured people would rise to nearly  million in   and the nation would have a higher uninsured rate than when the aca passed in   the study found   source that s right   if republicans move forward with their current plan  they re going to leave things in a worse mess than they were before  and they re already expecting democrats to fix it so that they can take all the credit  senate minority leader chuck schumer has now made it clear  if this is the republican plan  democrats aren t playing ball  the health of millions is at stake and if republicans don t have a replacement  democrats aren t going to let them play political games until they do featured image via win mcnamee getty images
