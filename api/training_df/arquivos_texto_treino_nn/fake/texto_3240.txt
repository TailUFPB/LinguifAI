while it s certainly not true that donald trump will have the least diverse cabinet in history  hell  before a generation or so ago  it was rare to see women or people of color in positions of authority  but it s   the culture is changing and skin color and gender  and religion and sexual orientation  shouldn t matter at all judging by the looks of his cabinet nominees so far  trump s administration will be the least diverse since bush george h w  bush trump  or more likely  someone working for trump  knows that he needs to offer at least some diversity  especially with the enemies he s made in the latino community with his  wall  rhetoric in the campaign  the problem is  though  he can t find any in a country with about  million latinos and hispanics  i can tell you now i have spoken to numerous folks on the transition  and they say that he s absolutely looking for qualified latinos for a cabinet post   said mario rodriguez  head of the latino pac hispanic   rodriguez  who sits on trump s hispanic advisory committee  said transition officials have asked him for recommendations and they gave him positive feedback about trump s prior meetings with hispanic candidates  i think some appointments are going to be pretty quick  president elect trump was very impressed by the candidates  he wants to put a latino in the cabinet  he s not doing it just for show  source  politicotrump is trying to fill the position of agriculture secretary with a latino and he s receiving a lot of backlash from his farmer supporters  according to politico  the farmers don t want it to be a political pick  of course  they are trump supporters  so there s a better than even chance they don t like the idea of someone with brown skin determining farm policy  especially after trump said he wants to deport latinos part of the problem is that trump is looking for a qualified latino to take the position  there s no doubt there are plenty  but few who likely share his political beliefs  still  it s weird that he should look for qualified now  his current picks are some of the least qualified to ever serve office  remember  rick perry  who has just a bachelor s degree and nearly flunked a class called  meats   is slated to be energy secretary and ben carson  who is a doctor  a medical doctor  will serve as director of housing and urban development  just as he is among the least qualified who will ever serve in the office of the presidency even if trump is able to hire a latino   even a qualified one  it might not matter many hispanic leaders say they are less concerned about having a cabinet pick than what trump s policies could mean  particularly with deportation and a wall along the mexican border  these people say picking a hispanic cabinet member for agriculture could be seen as a token with little real value and liken trump naming his only black cabinet member to lead housing and urban development in other words  trump could have the most diverse cabinet ever and still be the worst president for diversity in history  what latino  or really anyone  in their right mind would want history to remember them in that way featured image via drew angerer getty images
