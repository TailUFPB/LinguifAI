if the halting of donald trump s disgusting muslim ban was any indication  trump is quickly learning that the american people will do whatever it takes to stop his tyranny from infringing upon the true values of america and the constitutional rights of every citizen recently  the trump administration tried to move forward with an executive order attacking lgbtq rights  and was forced to drop it after america responded with an onslaught of backlash and criticism  facing immediate public outcry  the white house released a statement  president donald j  trump is determined to protect the rights of all americans  including the lgbtq community  president trump continues to be respectful and supportive of lgbtq rights  just as he was throughout the election  the president is proud to have been the first ever gop nominee to mention the lgbtq community in his nomination acceptance speech  pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression  the executive order signed in   which protects employees from anti lgbtq workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors  will remain intact at the direction of president donald j  trump  of course  the statement makes zero mention of the fact that trump might create another executive order that would allow for workplace discrimination  however  trump s draft of his halted executive order would have allowed employers to fire workers based on their sexual orientation  and would have allowed federally funded adoption and social service agencies to discriminate against the lgbt community  federal employees would have also been able to refuse service to lgbt individuals  with that being said  it s hilarious that the white house s statement talks about how  respectful  and  supportive  trump is when it comes to lgbt rights  but regardless  we re just fortunate that he s been stopped in his tracks trump s tyranny is terrifying  but one small silver lining that shouldn t be forgotten is the fact that he is so thin skinned and sensitive  his narcissism and desperate need for approval make him more easily swayed to public pressure  and public protests bother him more than anything else  the media was swift in reporting trump s executive order draft before he could sign it  and the public worked just as fast to express outrage  this takes away significant power from trump  as it is truly humiliating for him to receive so much backlash on the world stage  we need to keep this momentum going  and build upon the resistance we ve already seen   because it is working featured image via pool   getty images
