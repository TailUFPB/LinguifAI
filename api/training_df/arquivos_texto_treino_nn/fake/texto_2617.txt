as if we didn t already have enough proof that trump s administration is full of pathological  compulsive liars  along comes sean spicer with yet more  it s not his defense of kellyanne conway s mysteriously non existent terror attack at bowling green that lands him on the growing mountain of lies  rather  it s that he himself has referenced an imaginary terror attack multiple times cnn put together a short list of spicer s references to a terror attack in atlanta that never happened the first timehere s what spicer told abc s  this week  on january  while defending the president s travel ban  what do we say to the family who loses somebody over a terroristic  sic    to whether it s atlanta or san bernardino or the boston bomber  those people  each of whom had gone out to a country and then come back   spicer said the second timethe next day  spicer appeared on msnbc s  morning joe  and also mentioned atlanta while defending the travel ban  there was a very short period of time in which we had something to execute that ensured that the people of the united states were safe  everybody s been protected   spicer said   what happened if we didn t act and somebody was killed    too many of these cases that have happened   whether you re talking about san bernardino  atlanta   boston   would you wait until you do  the answer is we act now to protect the future  the third timeand in his january  press briefing  spicer once again alluded to an atlanta terror attack  when asked by a reporter why some countries linked to terrorism aren t on the travel ban list  spicer responded  right  and we re reviewing the entire process over this period of time to make sure that we do this right  but i don t think you have to look any further than the families of the boston marathon  in atlanta  in san bernardino to ask if we can go further  cnn has been unable to reach spicer for comment  but some speculate that he might actually be referring to orlando  the only problem is  he keeps saying atlanta and it s not like the orlando massacre was a small  minor incident where such a misstep might be understandable  the last known terror attacks in atlanta were at the  olympics  and at a lesbian club in   both happened at the hands of a right wing american terrorist in other words  they weren t attacks by radical muslims  and there have been no other acts of terrorism in atlanta  yet here s spicer  saying  atlanta  over and over again to defend trump s muslim ban the orlando attack  by contrast  was a massacre  and it s not like nobody can remember it  odd mistake to make  if that s what s even happening maybe he s talking about tighter security in atlanta following last year s terror attack in brussels  that s not especially likely  either  when he finally gets a story together  he ll talk to the press  or he ll ignore anything that has to do with his references to atlanta  but  like kellyanne conway  he said it  and then repeated it  it s hard to believe that s just a misspoken word read more featured image by mark wilson via getty images
