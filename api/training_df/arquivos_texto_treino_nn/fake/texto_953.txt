donald trump has never tried to hide the fact that he is a misogynistic a  hole  rosie o donnell  megyn kelly  and any other woman who dares challenge trump s right to  grab em by the pussy  becomes a target for his hate  clearly  this man has a problem with women  but somehow  we put him in the white house anyway this week  trump attacked msnbc s mika brzezinski  tweeting that he refused to let her hang out with him a few months ago because she was  bleeding badly from a facelift   and we all know that trump finds the idea of a woman bleeding out of her wherever  is just too gross for him to handle not surprisingly  it turns out that this kind of sexist degradation is a lifelong pattern for trump  new york times columnist gail collins remembers trump attacking her in the most degrading way possible i have to confess i ve overestimated donald trump back in the day  he sent me a copy of a column he objected to  with some notes suggesting i was a  dog and a liar  with  the face of a pig  i ve had many opportunities to make use of that story since trump became a presidential candidate  so it s all fine for me  however  i have to admit that it did not occur to me he d keep doing that kind of stuff as president of the united states this is not normal  a real man would never treat women the way trump does  calling them  fat pigs  and  dogs  and talking about dating his own daughter  but this isn t even just any man  this is the president of the goddamn united states behaving this way  it is absolutely appalling that this man is supposed to be leading our country  yet this is how he speaks about women worse yet  is that this has never been some kind of deep  dark secret  this is who he his and he has flaunted it for decades  and he won the election anyway  at least he did in a kind sorta type of way  but i digress  what the hell have we become  how are we allowing this  why are we acting like any of this is okay in any way at all featured image via alex wong getty images
