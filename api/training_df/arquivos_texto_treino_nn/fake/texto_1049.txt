it was supposed to be trump s one  big win  now it s completely falling apart the much publicized deal to save american manufacturing jobs at the carrier plant in indianapolis is looking less like a feather in trump s cap and more like a black eye  the latest details out of the plant paint a grim picture for the employees who were told just months ago that they had been saved by trump  according to a report by cnbc more than  employees at a carrier plant in indianapolis are bracing for layoffs beginning next month  despite being told by president trump that nearly all the jobs at the plant had been saved  the deal  announced with great fanfare before trump took office  was billed not only as a heroic move to keep jobs from going to mexico but also as a seismic shift in the economic development landscape nearly seven months later the deal has not worked out quite as originally advertised  and the landscape has barely budged  the jobs are still leaving   said robert james  president of united steelworkers local    nothing has stopped  shortly after winning the election and eager for a publicity win  trump had obsessed over the carrier plant  in an effort to secure the publicity stunt  he ordered then indiana governor mike pence to hand over   million in tax breaks to the owners of carrier in an effort to bribe the executives into keeping some jobs in the area  the carrier executives gladly took the money  which came out of indiana s taxes  then shipped the jobs to mexico anyways in perhaps the sickest twist in this sordid story  carrier had secured the   million by promising to  invest  an additional   million in the factory  trump never read the fine print  carrier now says it will use that promised money to develop more  automation  which will enable the company to cut even more jobs down the road that s one hell of a bad deal from donald  the dealmaker  trump unfortunately for americans looking to understand how trump might run the country and for the workers at carrier  much of the mainstream media hailed the carrier deal as an unequivocal success for trump  the new york times  for instance  praised trump for the bribe  parroting his campaign rhetoric  writing that this deal proved trump was  a different kind of republican  willing to take on big business  it s doubtful that the same media outlets will bother to retract their original praise or issue a follow up documenting the ways in which the deal has fallen apart  everyone has moved on  many americans might even still falsely believe trump saved the carrier jobs meanwhile an estimated  employees at carrier will now be jobless  plants will still open up in mexico  right on schedule  and the only real winners were the owners of carrier and trump  but was there ever really any chance that it wouldn t turn out this way featured image via tasos katopodis getty images
