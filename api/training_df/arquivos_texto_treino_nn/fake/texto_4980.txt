what is the one thing that might actually scare donald trump  that s right   the prospect of releasing his tax returns has him terrified  the mere thought of making them public  just as every single presidential candidate in recent memory has done  is more abhorrent to him than his sexual obsession with his daughter is to the rest of us  but unfortunately for the donald  he may not have a choice in the matter if senate democrats have their way the connecticut mirror reports that senators chris murphy and ron wyden have come up with a solution to trump s nonsensical refusal to be honest with the american people about his taxes   something even george w  bush was able to accomplish partnering with fellow democratic sen  ron wyden  d ore   murphy on thursday pressed for votes for a bill that would require all presidential candidates from major parties to make public their tax returns within two weeks of their parties  national conventions  the effort is part of a renewed democratic campaign over trump s tax filings in keeping his tax returns under wraps  murphy said trump is violating a   year standard of campaign transparency and may even be running for president to change tax laws that benefit his companies  this is an extraordinary moment in which the candidate may be seeking the presidency to protect his investments   murphy says of his effort what is trump hiding   many people are saying  he has made substantial donations to nambla   the north american man boy love association   he does not want to become public  while this is a long shot  as the organization is not actually tax exempt and would not show up on trump s tax returns  it is clear that he fears their release  in any case  the  presidential tax transparency act  would let the public know all of trump s dirty little tax secrets he desperately wants to keep hidden in fact  it would force the fec to post candidates  returns on the official website for all to see anytime they wish if the candidate did not voluntarily disclose them within two weeks of their party s national conventions so far the bill only has five co sponsors  including tim kaine  but the idea seems popular not only would this be a great idea  but it would lead to the most hilariously humiliating concession speech one can imagine featured image via getty images brian bianco
