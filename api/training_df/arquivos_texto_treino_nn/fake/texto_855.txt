we all know that the gop is the party of anti lgbtq theocrats  however  we usually don t expect lawmakers of either party to openly harass citizens and then go on to boast of what they have done without shame  that is  however  exactly what state rep  francis awerkamp  r ks  did when a group of lgbtq students  escorted by educators  visited the state capitol awerkamp promptly posted what he had done to facebook  burying his repugnant actions in a post disguised as a  legislative update  this was quickly done after he encountered the group at the capitol  in which he detailed a shocking display of open and unabashed bigotry and harassment  in the newsletter  the bigoted lawmaker said  i explained my clear position that  a man is a man  a woman is a woman  and marriage is between a man and a woman  and this is a reality that we can not change   the teachers  one of whom was a man wearing a skirt  identifying  as a woman  quickly led the students away  by the way the  man in a skirt  he mentioned was not transgender at all  she is a cisgender woman  due to the horrific nature of what has happened  tom witt  director of equality kansas  has gotten involved  he said that there was only one transgender teacher on the outing  and she was not dressed in a skirt  either way  it should not matter  witt went on to rightly blast awerkamp s confrontational remarks as beyond offensive and demeaning  the crazy man who likes to call himself a lawmaker also said he was  surprised  by the visit  and lamented the false idea that public funds are somehow being used to push a  homosexual agenda  newsflash  dude   people visit their state capitols all the time  it s the people s house  not yours  you work for your constituents  not the other way around the fact that this man is sitting in government is nothing short of appalling  the kansas state legislature should censure him immediately  given that it is controlled by republicans  though  i wouldn t hold my breath on that one featured image via screen capture from cj online
