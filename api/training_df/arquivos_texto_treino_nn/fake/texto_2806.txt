msnbc host joy reid was shocked when a conservative anti choice activist openly stated that birth control should be banned during a panel discussion on saturday  kristan hawkins of students for life literally admitted that she wants a law that forces women to get pregnant if they want to have sex the discussion began with reid pointing out that contraception and mammogram costs will go up for women if the affordable care act is repealed reid asked the panel if they agreed that contraception should be legal  and hawkins not only disagreed  she spewed misinformation about two popular forms of contraception  i believe certain forms can be legal  yes   hawkins said   i don t believe abortion causing contraception should be legal  when asked to specifically name a form of contraception she thinks should be outlawed  hawkins mentioned  hormonal contraception  like iuds reid   you think iuds should be illegal  hawkins   i don t think they should be legal  they put women at risk and they kill children  except that iuds are one of the safest forms of birth control  and they work by preventing sperm from joining with the egg according to the baby center both types of iuds work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg  the copper iud releases copper into the uterus  which works as a spermicide  the others release a form of the hormone progestin into the uterus  the progestin thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm can t reach the egg in other words  unless conservatives now believe that life begins before conception  they should have absolutely no problem with iuds but hawkins also declared that birth control pills should be illegal as well however  birth control pills also prevent conception by stopping sperm from reaching an egg according to columbia university birth control pills prevent pregnancy through several mechanisms  mainly by stopping ovulation  if no egg is released  there is nothing to be fertilized by sperm  and the woman cannot get pregnant so once again  hawkins is wrong  but she repeated her claims again after reid asked her to clarify her remarks  and hawkins confirmed once and for all that anti choice conservatives want to ban birth control as well as abortion  in my ideal world  yes  but i don t think that s something we re working towards in the pro life movement  in the pro life movement we re working towards abolishing abortion  that s why we want planned parenthood s money to go to health centers which don t do contraception  by taking money away from planned parenthood  millions of women would have less access to birth control that would prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions  we ve gotten some real clarity   reid commented at the end of the segment   i think the american people have gotten quite a bit of clarity on what your movement wants to do  here s the video via vidme and if conservatives like hawkins get their way  donald trump and republicans in congress will strip women of their reproductive rights  and women won t be marching in washington in defense of their rights next time  they ll declare war on washington featured image via screen capture
