if things keep going as they are  we may see a surprising candidate on the  presidential ballot  our favorite donald trump impersonator could be running against trump  year old alec baldwin might throw his hat in the ring  because according to him  there s no one who can beat trump  i would love to run for office because i think people need something different  i think that all the people that are on deck in   none of them are going to win   the  year old actor   who plays trump on  saturday night live    told  extra  in an interview released tuesday without naming names  baldwin reiterated   none of those people are going to beat him  source  the hillbaldwin s wife doesn t seem to be on board  during the interview  she shook her head and said   we re not going to do that  baldwin  though warned that if trump were to be reelected  things would be a lot worse  you think things are bad now   the performer added   i ll tell you when things are going to be worse   if he wins again  baldwin has been playing trump for a while now  to popular acclaim  he performed both that role and the role of bill o reilly on saturday night live on saturday here s the video that s not the same as actually being president  though  but the fact that trump is in office could ironically be reason baldwin might stand a chance baldwin is a popular liberal who has long been very vocal about politics  but he s no stranger to controversy  in   he left a message for his daughter calling her a  rude thoughtless pig   last year  he called a reporter by a gay slur in normal political times  baldwin s lack of political experience  along with his caught on tape controversies  would be an immediate deal breaker  but these are not normal times  baldwin s flaws are far less glaring than trump s  then again  democrats are always held to a higher standard than republicans featured image via d  dipasupil getty images
