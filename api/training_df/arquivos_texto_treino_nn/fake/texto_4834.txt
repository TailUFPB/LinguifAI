once again  a republican rape comment surfaces  and it s from the campaign manager of the republican nominee donald trump s campaign has been full of sexism and misogyny  so it was only a matter of time before his third campaign manager kellyanne conway made her own offensive comment about rape in   despite republicans being advised to keep their mouths shut about women and rape  conway appeared in a panel discussion to talk about women in the military  at some point  conway used rape as an analogy even though rape was not part of the discussion conway blamed women for being raped because they are not as physically strong as men and that  rape would not exist  if only women were not so weak  if we were physiologically   not mentally  emotionally  professionally   equal to men  if we were physiologically as strong as men  rape would not exist   conway said   you would be able to defend yourself and fight him off  here s the video via youtube  conway s rape comment is at the  minute mark conway s comment assumes that all rapes can be prevented simply by being physically strong  unfortunately  rapists have many tricks to incapacitate their victims  including date rape drugs  being strong also does not work very well if a rapist has their victim at knifepoint or gunpoint instead of blaming rapists  conway openly blamed women for rape  she was a republican pollster at the time  but now she is the campaign manager for the presidential candidate of the republican party clearly  trump either did not vet conway at all or he is okay with what she had to say about rape but this adds to the pattern of republicans blaming the victim instead of the rapist  for years  republicans have been saying outrageous things about rape  here s  of them trump is just another republican in a long line of republicans who apparently believe women are at fault if they get raped  his hiring of conway clearly demonstrates that  they seem to think it s acceptable to blame rape victims for their assaults  deny women the right to control their own health care  and downplay sexual harassment in the workplace   daily show creator liz winstead responded to conway s remarks   it s not  featured image via screen capture
