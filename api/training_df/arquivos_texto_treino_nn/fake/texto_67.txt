one of donald trump s favorite punching bags is cnn  he even once tweeted a gif image of himself punching a person with a cnn logo superimposed over the head   indicating that he d like to enact violence against cnn s reporters  then there was the time he tweeted the  trump train  roaring over  cnn   now  he s back at it   this time suggesting that  fake  cnn should be the ones representing america to the world  and that they are doing a bad job  here is that tweet   foxnews is much more important in the united states than cnn  but outside of the u s   cnn international is still a major source of  fake  news  and they represent our nation to the world very poorly  the outside world does not see the truth from them   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    course  it is beneath the dignity of most people to respond to a moronic buffoon like trump under normal circumstances  however  he is currently squatting in the white house  and has his tiny orange hands on the levers of power   not to mention the nuclear codes   so they have to stoop to a trumpian level when personally attacked  however  being  well  you know  fit to be doing the job they are doing  the good folks at cnn communications fired back at trump  and their response is nothing short of perfect it s not cnn s job to represent the u s to the world  that s yours  our job is to report the news   factsfirst   cnn communications   cnnpr  november     couldn t have asked for a sicker burn than this  and they are right of course   especially the part about  factsfirst  trump has a problem with the truth  as we all well know  that s what makes what the cnn communications people replied so fabulous  it is the ultimate truth   something the likes of the pathological orange liar that is donald trump knows nothing about featured image via  andrew burton getty images
