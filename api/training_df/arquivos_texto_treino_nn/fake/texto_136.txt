who knew that donald trump would humiliate himself and us as soon as humanly possible with his trip to asia  there was really no way to know that   this is one of the smartest men on the planet oh wait  this is donald trump  and in discussing north korea s decision to fire ballistic missiles over japan  he wondered why japan didn t just shoot those missiles down that  in turn  shows a complete and total lack of knowledge about how missiles work  about even our own military s capabilities  and about the optics of such an endeavor on ours and japan s part  first off  it would have been extremely difficult for japan to shoot them down due to their altitude and speed  japan does have missile interceptors  but north korea s missiles were very likely out of range then there are the optics  japan would have been embarrassed alongside us  our own capabilities to shoot down missiles are also limited  and tests on both systems have failed consistently  watching us and japan embarrass ourselves would have emboldened north korea because it would have told them that we can t stop their missiles  an emboldened north korea is the last thing the world needs right now but that s not all  trump also insulted all of japan by saying that he couldn t understand why a country full of samurai warriors wouldn t want to shoot down north korea s missiles  while the samurai are a part of japan s long and rich history  trump calling them  a nation of samurai warriors  just reinforces the rest of the world s belief that americans are too stupid and too arrogant to bother learning about anyone else  and would rather just fall back on ethnic stereotypes these remarks took place well before trump actually headed to japan  however  the news of it came out as he was en route  so  just like every other international trip on which the walking racist presidential impostor has gone  we have been embarrassed on the world stage  again featured image via mario tama getty images
