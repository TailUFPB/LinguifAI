it s apparently a new world  one in which it s perfectly acceptable to  in front of tv cameras  threaten political opponents and even people who aren t really political opponents  as long as they dare say mean things about our der fuhrer elect trump s chief of staff  reince priebus clearly got the new tough guy message  on abc s  this week with george steephanopoulos   preibus laid down a straight out of russia threat on the director of the office of government ethics walter shaub  the head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political   priebus said on abc news s  this week with george stephanopoulos  priebus suggested that shaub  who was appointed by president obama  was supportive of hillary clinton during the campaign  apparently  may have   publicly supported hillary clinton as calling out the president with info on twitter about our disentangling of the business over a month ago   priebus said   so i m not sure what this person at government ethics  what sort of standing he has any more in giving these opinions  here s the video this is all because shaub dared have an opinion that isn t necessarily favorable to the incoming dictator in chief  actually  the opinion was barely political at all  shaub simply said that trump just  stepping back from running his business is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective   instead  shaub urged trump to put his assets in a blind trust  as has become customary while shaub may have been a hillary clinton supporter  there s no evidence to say that   it was clear by his statement that he was simply doing his job  which is to oversee the ethics  or  in this case  lack thereof  of government officials  a man who ran on  draining the swamp  should welcome that  but it s donald trump  his enemies list is growing every single day trump and preibus should learn  very quickly  that not only is it acceptable to criticize the president  it s the foundation of our democracy featured image via alex wong getty images
