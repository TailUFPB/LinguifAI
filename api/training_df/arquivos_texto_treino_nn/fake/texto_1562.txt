trump s latest attempt to pass blame for his own mistakes onto others is backfiring in spectacular fashion  like a broken record  trump lashed out at former acting attorney general sally yates  who is set to testify that she emphatically warned trump s administration about the dangers of appointing disgraced general michael flynn as his national security adviser  he also tried to pin the blame on obama  justifying his hiring of flynn on the basis of obama having hired him during his administration   ignoring one major detail general flynn was given the highest security clearance by the obama administration   but the fake news seldom likes talking about that   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    thinks you re dumb enough to not realize that obama also fired flynn for being erratic and angry to such a degree that it disturbed his colleagues and staffers  obama appoints flynn  obama fires  dod renews flynn s   with no apparent vetting trump appoints him nsa https   t co   jake tapper   jaketapper  may     his peculiarly fierce attacks directed at obama over flynn betray his achilles heel  he is a one trick pony   anything he is guilty of  he accuses others of being responsible for  in this case  it turns out obama had actually warned trump about hiring flynn  in an oval office meeting just days after trump had won the election  obama sat him down and explained that his trusted adviser   who trump was reportedly considering naming vice president   was unfit for office nbc news according to all three former officials  obama warned trump against hiring flynn  the obama administration fired flynn in  from his position as head of the defense intelligence agency  largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues obama s warning pre dated the concerns inside the government about flynn s contacts with the russian ambassador  one of the officials said  obama passed along a general caution that he believed flynn was not suitable for such a high level post  the official added by all accounts  trump only got more interested in hiring flynn after obama s warning  like many of his republican brethren  trump has long suffered from a knee jerk reaction to do the opposite of anything obama says  if obama says healthcare is good  republicans come out against it  if obama says breathing is good  republicans will hold their breath until they re blue in the face  and apparently if obama says  don t hire this unstable  incompetent nutjob to serve in one of the most important roles in the white house   trump fast tracks his application the irony  of course  is that by deliberately ignoring obama s warning  trump made the bed he s currently sleeping in  the fact that he tried to cover up his mistake by firing sally yates when she  too  warned him about flynn only makes things worse for him  trump is most certainly guilty of many things  but at the forefront is his own rank stupidity and creepy obsession with obama his ugliest traits conspired to undo him how fitting featured image via jack gruber pool getty images
