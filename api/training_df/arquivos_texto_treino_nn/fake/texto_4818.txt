after meeting with mexican president enrique pena nieto  and lying about what was discussed   donald trump flew back to phoenix  arizona to deliver a  point plan on how to fix america s broken immigration system as pointed out by the hillary clinton campaign  the speech was overwhelmingly applauded by the alt right  including white nationalists david duke and richard spencer  and closeted white nationalist ann coulter  who is apparently back on the trump train  in typical trump fashion  the immigration  proposal  was laced with lies  deceit  and rank xenophobia  with outright lies regarding president obama and hillary clinton s determination to tackle the issue of illegal immigration once again  donald trump claimed that illegal immigration is as high as  million  saying   honestly we ve been hearing that number for years  it s always  million  our government has no idea  it could be  million  it could be  million  they have no idea what the number is  considering trump has been fact checked on this claim multiple times  with politifact rating it as pants on fire   one would think the republican nominee would have the sense to stick to what is fact  but then again  it is donald trump  the department of homeland security  along with several independent groups  put the number anywhere between  to  million  give or take  not one serious organization  meaning one with credibility  has published a report showing the number to be anywhere near the bloated  million trump and his surrogates are pushing it s much easier to convince people there s a bigger problem than there really is when you conflate the statistics to suit your political purpose  and no one understands this better than trump   he conflates the statistics on america s tax rates  crime rate  terrorism rate  and unemployment rate if there s one thing trump is better at than inflating statistics  it s letting his supporters know that he  and only he  cares and can fix it  at the phoenix rally  trump used the opportunity to slam his opponents  saying  president obama and hillary clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the american people to open borders ah  yes  the  obama doesn t care about america  shtick  a popular and sometimes effective rallying call of the right  trump and his surrogates certainly know how to play into the hands of their rabid base  and they certainly knows how to play into the hands of their latent racial hatred of the president if only it were true though see  if the obama administration  which included hillary clinton his first term  really had a gross dereliction of duty of the kind trump speaks of  it wouldn t have overseen the largest deportation force in decades  while simultaneously seeing illegal immigration numbers fall  very dramatically perhaps trump should answer for the illegal immigrants he s hired to work here in the united states before he accuses anyone of  dereliction  in a speech that was really rhetoric and not all that much fact  trump managed to get even that wrong when trump claimed president obama said climate change was a bigger threat than isis  china  russia  which is ironic   and the  million illegal immigrants first off  it was senator bernie sanders who said climate change is the biggest threat to american security  second  while president obama has said that tackling climate change was an urgent threat to the united states  fighting terrorism and keeping americans safe was the top priority in fact  president obama said  verbatim   i ve got a lot of things of my plate  but my top priority is to defeat isil  what say you  donald wednesday s speech in phoenix was classic trump   fluff  lies and fear mongering  a trip to mexico that ended up being an embarrassment turned into a speech that fell on deaf ears  except for the white nationalists   this is the man coulter compared to churchill republicans have themselves a real winner featured image john freso getty images
