donald trump met with the other members of nato and it did not go well  from the moment he arrived  trump appeared eager to take the spotlight and never give it up  the need to have attention reached a natural climax when trump actually shoved the prime minister of montenegro out of the way so he could take center stage in a photo op trump appears to shove montenegro pm so he could be in front of nato group https   t co cjyjjapahy pic twitter com   amanda wills   amandawills  may    was an embarrassing capstone to trump s rocky first trip abroad  treated like royalty in saudi arabia   a strongarm theocracy which restricts the press and women from public engagement   trump seemed the mark the country as the high point of his travels  things went down hill from there  implicating himself in a classified intelligence leak while in israel and then getting repeatedly upstaged by the pope in the vatican  and yet his final leg  a meeting with nato  looks to be the one he s least comfortable in after spending the  campaign bashing his european counterparts and promising his supporters that he would be the bold  tough leader that republicans insisted obama was not  trump arrived to the event only to find that he was the dullest tool in the shed  making matters worse  everybody seemed to know it  nobody was taking him seriously during his speech  trump slammed the member states of the organization for not paying what he considers their  fair share   the looks on their faces ranged from mortified to embarrassed to on the verge of laughter german chancellor angela merkel  whose disdain for trump is well known  seemed to barely be able to contain her expression of sorrow that this is what america s presidency had been reduced to clearly rattled  trump s power move was to shove the pm of montenegro and stand at the front for pictures  appearance was everything  unfortunately  watching the man some say has a much too comfortable relationship with russia physically bully the head of state for a country that putin is actively signalling aggression towards was not a good look watch trump s speech below trump just tried to shake down the other nato leaders  the looks on their faces  he doesn t even get what nato is  pic twitter com   jamil smith   jamilsmith  may    image via twitter
