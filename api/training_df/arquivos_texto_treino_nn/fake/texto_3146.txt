house republicans have taken their first step towards repealing obamacare  and that step opens the door for them to work toward full repeal within months  they say they ve built a fail safe in to protect those who may otherwise lose their insurance while they continue dilly dallying on coming up with an actual replacement   delaying implementation of the repeal so they have time to develop their replacement  because the last six years apparently wasn t enough time  here s a secret  those people will probably lose their insurance anyway and not just for the reasons we already know  one massive problem that s not really getting discussed is that republicans   repeal and delay  tactic creates too much market uncertainty for risk based insurance  republicans have been sowing the seeds of uncertainty for a long time  and they re one of the big reasons insurers like united healthcare began pulling out of the exchanges despite still raking in billions in net profits j b  silvers  a former health insurance ceo  first explains this while describing the  risk corridor  program  which was supposed to help offset the risks insurers took when enrolling high risk people in their programs  he then says  but when the time came to pay up for risk reduction in the obamacare exchanges  congress reneged and paid only  percent of what was owed to the insurers  so  on top of the fact that the companies had to bear the risk of unknown costs and utilization in the start up years  which turned out to be higher than they expected  insurers had to absorb legislative uncertainty of whether the rules would be rewritten  he s talking about the payments that were supposed to go out for   after republicans regained control of both houses of congress  insurers risk corridor claims were much higher than their contributions  for   congress stipulated that risk corridor payments under obamacare could not exceed the amount that insurers owed to the program  thus  they only got  percent of what they believe they were promised or  to put it another way  they were playing by one set of rules  and then congress abruptly changed those rules now  we can argue till we re blue in the face whether insurers  congress  obamacare  or all of them  are responsible for that problem  it won t change the cold  hard fact that republicans have been working hard on creating uncertainty in the market  and their repeal with no replacement plan just makes that uncertainty much worse it s worth noting that that s a big reason for why premiums are going up this year  too so  as silvers says  and now comes the reality of the  repeal and replace  initiatives from the republicans  if the uncertainty of this market was large before with the aca  it is almost unknowable under whatever comes next  thus the initial exit of some latecomers  including united healthcare  and undercapitalized minor entrants  such as nonprofit co ops  is almost certain to become a flood of firms leaving the exchanges  they have little choice since the risks are too large and the actuarially appropriate rates are still not obvious given the political turmoil and changing rules if we want them to continue to do the good things required by the aca  we can t make it so uncertain  what this means is that the mechanisms designed to reduce risk and a stable set of operating arrangements must be reaffirmed as core principles of all reform and replace efforts  this shouldn t be hard for market oriented republicans  if they can leave behind their political baggage  blind talk of repeal with no clear way to build confidence among the private insurers  which will be needed in the replace phase  leads to market failure  in short  their idea of a fool proof repeal is going to backfire horrifically on them  while that might seem like something we can laugh at  it isn t  because millions of americans will become collateral damage in this mess  good job  gop featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
