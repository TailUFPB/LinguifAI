trump s biggest champion on the other side of the pond   mr  brexit  himself  made a joke about trump that s just a taste of how much the world is already laughing at us for electing him  nigel farage is reportedly meeting with trump at some point very soon  but before he does that  he decided to go there  don t touch her  for god s sake  of course  he s referring to the access hollywood tape where trump bragged about kissing women without their permission  and boasted that his star power allows him to do anything he wants  even  grab them by the pussy   that tape should have sunk his candidacy and probably would have in every other civilized nation  it didn t here  the world got a huge shock  and now the world sees just how ridiculous we really can be if that weren t true  farage wouldn t have made that joke in a radio interview earlier this week  he wants to be the go between for trump and theresa may  the u k  s new prime minister  although he d really like to be trump s ambassador to the e u   what could possibly go wrong there    don t touch her   isn t all farage said  he went on with  if it comes to it  i could be there as the responsible adult role  to make sure everything s ok  oh holy hell  farage has already been branded as the u k  s donald trump  but this is ridiculous  a national leader joking about the sexual assault another national leader committed  joking about playing the  responsible adult  when trump meets with theresa may  or maybe any other female leader  we just threw up a little in our mouths what farage did  besides help trump solidify our position as the world s biggest punch line  is marginalize and objectify his own prime minister  but that doesn t matter  because of course it doesn t  if there s any doubt  though  that the world is starting to whisper  cast furtive glances  chuckle  and then burst out with pointing and loud guffawing  it s this snippet from the guardian  farage could literally curl up on trump s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers  if they widened his frottage combating duties it could be a fulltime job   trump will be in the presence of many females a day  and you have to remember he is a man whose sole  frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they re related  so farage could be kept in the oval office as an anti grope jeeves  congratulations  trumpkins  one of the things you claimed obama had done has now come true for real  and trump hasn t even taken office yet featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
