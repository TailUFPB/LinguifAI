alabama s republican runoff election for jeff sessions  vacant senate seat has come to its end  and the candidate that will go up against democrat doug jones in december s general election is none other than roy moore  moore is the former chief justice of alabama s state supreme court  and he s the one who ordered all of alabama s probate judges to defy the u s  supreme court s ruling on same sex marriage in  but moore wasn t donald trump s candidate  luther strange  who has been holding sessions  seat  was the man backed by trump  in fact  trump was at a political rally for strange last friday when he called for nfl players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired  the president s endorsement usually helps a candidate  yet it s moore who just won  here s a little background on moore  he was yanked from the alabama supreme court s bench in  for refusing to remove a massive monument to the bible s  commandments from the grounds of the courthouse  that s considered a violation of the first amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion in   moore won his job back  then called same sex relationships  sodomy   and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the supreme court legalizing same sex marriage across all  states  he wanted to bar democratic rep  keith ellison from serving in office because he s a muslim  and he accused obama of using our military for social experiments  including wiping out  don t ask  don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve  he has also defended putin because putin seems to agree with him on the issue of lgbtq rights  one might think that would earn him trump s endorsement  but somehow  it didn t all of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of trump  but it didn t  moore was polling ahead of strange pretty much the entire time  why well  trump  for starters  that buffoon endorsed luther strange and bragged about it all over twitter  up to and including through today  he boasted that strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement  but according to nbc news  trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards moore  trump won alabama by double digits last year  but it seems they re souring towards him now that makes this trump s fault  at least partly  voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another  but those who were influenced by trump said he pushed them away from strange  what that means is that some republican voters chose moore because trump backed the other candidate that s a massive blow to trump  maybe alabama voters are ashamed of trump  and they d have good reason to feel that way  for instance  speaking on the  rick and bubba  radio show  which is based out of birmingham  trump said  luther strange is going to be a great senator  he loves alabama  he loves the states and he loves the country  he will absolutely win against the democrat ray will have a hard time  if luther wins  the democrats will hardly fight  if ray wins   will pour in   million  moore s first name is roy  when rick burgess  one of the show s hosts  pointed out that he d gotten roy s name wrong  trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name  then he said  i don t know that much about roy moore  roy moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the democrat against luther they won t even fight  when news of moore s win came out  trump tweeted the following as noted above  the general election is december   that tweet has since been deleted  and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general where is trump s influence  then  rosie gray of the atlantic said  the outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with trump s base  trump himself  or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting moore  well  it seems that trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does  especially given that strange was likely a far better candidate for senate than moore ever could be  moore is an absolute disaster  he s a danger to the u s   and in deep red alabama  there s very little chance that a democrat can win sessions  senate seat  and trump s endorsement of strange is partly responsible for this  he s a blight on the gop and a blight on the nation as a whole  he s dangerous  and moore s election is evidence of that featured image via alex wong getty images
