you ve probably seen the headlines that aetna  one of the largest providers in the affordable care act exchanges  has pulled out  critics of obamacare had nothing but schadenfreude  they told us obamacare was doomed and this was proof  as it turns out  aetna s move was less about the viability of obamacare  as they claimed  than about a personal and political vendetta against the president  whose administration denied a merger between aetna and humana the ceo of one of the largest providers in the network thinks aetna is completely wrong  bernard tyson of kaiser permanente thinks obamacare has been great for his bottom line and that if aetna was in fact losing money  it was because they were bad at managing it tyson does understand that it s a tough market  people have been sicker than anticipated  which makes sense  if you give millions of people who haven t been able to afford medical care medical care  it will take a few years to bring their health up to that of people who have had insurance  congress hasn t helped either  republicans have blocked the assistance that was being offered to the insurance companies to help with the transition but  according to tyson  that does not mean that obamacare is a failure  the idea that i would turn my back on a segment of the american population who really needs the coverage and the care i m in for the long haul   tyson said   and i m cautiously optimistic that at some point  we begin to make sure we have the right regulations  meaning oversight  to make sure the market is behaving like it was intended  kaiser has made a  slight margin  overall on its aca plans  tyson said  centene corp   molina healthcare and blue cross and blue shield of florida similarly have found ways to make money on the exchanges  narrow networks of hospital and doctors  as well as high deductibles  have worked for medicaid plans like centene and molina  florida blue has relied on higher premiums than its peers source  modern health care  blockquote another problem is that the insurers themselves may be pricing themselves out of the market because of the  drum roll  free market  there were conscious decisions made in the pricing of the product when it first started that did not hold logic to the marketplace   tyson said   this is not rocket science  there s a pool of people to take care of  there s an underwriting process  and there were decisions made that   i m going to consciously underprice  and what i m going to do is gain market share and over time it s going to work itself out  here s the full interview  it s quite interesting  and if you live in a kaiser market  it might be worth supporting them featured image via video screen capture
