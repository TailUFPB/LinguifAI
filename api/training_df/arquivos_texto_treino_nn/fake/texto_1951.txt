mike pence is a devout evangelical christian  there s nothing wrong with that  after all  that s what the first amendment is for  however  it seems that trump s vice president takes his piety to a whole new  incredibly creepy level  first  there is the way he treats his wife reports of a dinner pence had with state senators while he was still governor of indiana are most alarming  apparently  during the dinner  it was revealed that pence actually calls his wife  mother   it seems that at first  people thought it was a cute joke or something  but then came to realize that he was completely serious  pence reportedly yelled down the table at his wife repeatedly during the meal  from rolling stone gov  pence shouted to his wife  karen  his closest adviser  at the other end of the table  mother  mother  who prepared our meal this evening  the legislators looked at one another  speaking with their eyes  he just called his wife  mother  maybe it was a joke  the legislator reasoned  but a few minutes later  pence shouted again  mother  mother  whose china are we eating on  mother pence went on a long discourse about where the china was from  a little later  the legislators stumbled out  wondering what was weirder  pence s inability to make conversation  or calling his wife  mother  in the second decade of the  century as if that weren t bad enough  it seems that there are even creepier rules with regards to how pence treats women other than his wife  in fact  according to new york magazine  pence is not allowed to dine alone with any woman who is not his wife  karen pence  supposedly  karen pence is her husband s  gut check  and  prayer warrior   and is therefore rarely away from her husband  unsurprisingly  though  we never hear her speak  perhaps she is not allowed to  hell  pence won t even go to any sort of gathering where there is booze on the menu unless karen is right there so  if pence is not allowed to be in a room with any woman who is not his wife  then how on earth does he do government business if the adviser happens to be a woman  does his wife get to be in the situation room  does she get top level clearances  are they allowed to use  religious liberty  as the reason for such accommodations  time will only tell  what we do know is that mike pence and his wife get creepier by the day  and that is very bad for america the only consolation is that it sure as hell explains a lot   but the more we learn about these creepy people  the scarier america s situation becomes featured image via alex wong getty images
