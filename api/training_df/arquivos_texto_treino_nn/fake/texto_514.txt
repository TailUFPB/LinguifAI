white supremacists have been emboldened by donald trump from the moment he came down the escalator in trump tower and announced his bid for the white house by branding all immigrants of mexican descent rapists and criminals  that travesty of a campaign continued in that vein  as has this sorry excuse of a  presidency   trump knows that these people think they have a friend in him  and they do  honestly   so he refuses to disavow them the latest debacle in that direction is  of course  trump s disgraceful equivocation between neo nazis and their counter protesters during the violent white nationalist gathering in charlottesville  virginia  of course  that gathering claimed the life of heather heyer  a brave activist standing up against hate after trump s remarks  former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke was alight with praise  it turns out there s a reason for that  and it is much more sinister than those of us who are not within the white power movement to really comprehend  there is one person who does  though  derek black  a former white nationalist and the son of don black  the founder of the infamous neo nazi website stormfront the younger black warns that trump s heightened flirtation with nazis and his legitimizing of their message via equivocation with counter protesters is really making things much worse  at first  the white nationalists  message wasn t getting out due to the news being focused on all of the violence  according to black  though  that all changed with trump  speaking to new york times writer michael barbaro  black said of trump s response to charlottesville  he salvaged their message  the message that they were trying to get out was that tearing down robert e lee s statue is an assault on white culture  so if you think that tearing down rel s statue is the wrong choice then these are your guys  but then amidst all the violence and the chaos  i think that got lost   you re not going to follow those people even if you believe that  but then in  message  saying these are good people because they re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in  he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread  which is that if you believe this too and maybe you re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not  donald trump thinks we re fine  and that is just yet  it is why they are wearing khakis and polos now instead of hoods  it is why they are re branding themselves the so called  alt right   it is why they are even telling people who come to their rallies to look  sexy    so that they can disassociate from uneducated  mouthbreathing rednecks who everyone mocks and no one takes seriously  they want to make sure this is someone who could be your cookie cutter suburban family  just living next door  and you d be none the wiser  that s why it is so important to keep this a fringe group in the minds of everyone  regardless of whether their politics are left wing or right wing  black further explains  it s just impossible to say what will happen in the future  maybe nothing  but the point of that rally was to try to recruit people  to try to grow  and if you were on the fence about whether you should get involved in that stuff or not  the president s ok is the biggest thing that s ever happened  that s why what trump is doing here is so dangerous  it s why we all need to make sure that white supremacy  no matter how it is dressed up  is never normalized  ever  that will be the job of all of us  because clearly  that messaging will never come from the white house thank you  derek black  for denouncing your family s hateful beliefs  and speaking out in a unique way to counter this kind of hate featured image via twitter
