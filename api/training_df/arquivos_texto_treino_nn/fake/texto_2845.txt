in a play right out of vladimir putin s rules for dictators  donald trump is in the process of locking up journalists who don t paint a rosy picture of the trump administration and his popularity  or lack thereof so far  six journalists  first amendment be damned  have been arrested for covering last saturday s protests that followed donald trump s inauguration  if convicted  each of the six could face up to  years in prison and a    fine a documentary producer  a photojournalist  a live streamer and a freelance reporter were each charged with the most serious level of offense under washington dc s law against rioting  after being caught up in the police action against demonstrators the guardian learned of their arrests after reporting on monday that the journalists evan engel of vocativ and alex rubinstein of rt america had also been arrested and charged with felonies while covering the same unrest on friday morning source  the guardianclearly  this is a direct violation of the first amendment  even if they weren t journalists  it s still legal to protest in this country  but journalists should be assigned even more protection  all they were doing were their jobs  they were recording the protest  not instigating  these charges are clearly inappropriate  and we are concerned that they could send a chilling message to journalists covering future protests   said carlos laur a  the cpj s senior americas program coordinator   we call on authorities in washington to drop these charges immediately  trump s apparent role model  vladimir putin  has a long and abusive history with journalists in his own country  about a year ago  when republicans still hated russia  the conservative blog  the daily caller  talked about how in russia  not only are journalists censored  they far too often end up dead a  investigation by the international federation of journalists reported  killings of journalists between  and   by far the highest number among the  richest countries in the world we aren t saying trump is there  we desperately hope he never goes that far  but his disdain for journalism is public knowledge and his attempts at censorship become more blatant every day  arresting journalists for simply doing their job is an unacceptable precedent  please let everyone know featured image via scott olson getty images
