in the week since donald trump s complete collapse in his head to head debate with hillary clinton  nearly every national poll has shown the republican nominee taking a complete nosedive  polls have begun emerging showing trump down   percent  and by as much in some polls as  percent against clinton and it might even be worse than it appears  internal polls   which have a tendency to show the candidate paying for them in a better position than public polls   are reportedly showing a massive collapse for trump mr  trump has already slipped perceptibly in public polls  trailing widely this week in pennsylvania and by smaller margins in florida and north carolina   three states he cannot afford to lose  but private polling by both parties shows an even more precipitous drop  especially among independent voters  moderate republicans and women  according to a dozen strategists from both parties who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the data was confidential liesl hickey  a republican strategist involved in several house races in swing states  said she was dismayed by a sudden exodus of independent voters in more diverse parts of the country  they are really starting to pull away from trump   said ms  hickey  describing his soaring unpopularity with independents as entering  uncharted territory  these voters are not responding well to trump s unhinged attacks on former miss universe alicia machado  who has become a symbol of the nominee s bias against women and latinos  they also don t like the way he is engaging in gutter politics  by promising to bring up president bill clinton s marital infidelity yet trump seems undeterred by the negative reception he s received for these proposals  surrounded by a phalanx of  yes  men and women  trump seems to believe that these lines of attack will work for him and expand his support beyond the uneducated older white males that are the bulk of his supporter that probably isn t a good bet featured image via flickr
