other than the wall and maybe the muslim ban  the signature issue for donald trump the presidential candidate was repealing and replacing obamacare  which he sold to his voters under the guise that it was about to implode   this year  as a matter of fact we are making great progress with healthcare  obamacare is imploding and will only get worse  republicans coming together to get job done   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    while the congressional budget office was scoring trumpcare  and declared it a complete disaster which would result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance  they completely put to bed the idea that obamacare is about to implode the paragraph isn t the easiest thing to read  especially if you have donald trump level reading skills  but here it is under current law  most subsidized enrollees purchasing health insurance coverage in the nongroup market are largely insulated from increases in premiums because their out of pocket payments for premiums are based on a percentage of their income  the government pays the difference  the subsidies to purchase coverage combined with the penalties paid by uninsured people stemming from the individual mandate are anticipated to cause sufficient demand for insurance by people with low health care expenditures for the market to be stable vox translated it this way translating from wonk ese  the subsidies offered to lower income people under aca are scaled both to income and to the local price of health insurance  which means that for heavily subsidized customers  the higher premiums don t drive people out of the marketplace  and there are enough young and healthy people who qualify for generous subsidies to ensure a stable long term risk pool despite the report  trump is still going along with the idea that obamacare is set to implode  on fox news on monday  he said   it s a disaster if we let it go for another year  it ll totally implode  here s that video   potus on  obamacare   it s a disaster    if we let it go for another year  it ll totally implode   pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  march     that s not the least clever strategy in the world  if you tell people they are going to lose their healthcare anyway  they might be more amenable to eating the shit sandwich the gop is trying to feed them in place of healthcare  we can t let the nation fall for it  obamacare is not about to implode  we have time to make it better featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
