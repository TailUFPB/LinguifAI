the republican jewish coalition finally caught on to donald trump s extreme views after his latest remarks in defense of the nazis marching in charlottesville  virginia in his name while shouting  blood and soil  and  jews will not replace us   the former reality show star turned amateur president lashed out at the media during his press conference while blaming what he called the  alt left  for the violence which besieged charlottesville and rocked the nation  there were people in that rally  and i looked the night before   trump said   if you look  they were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of robert e lee  i m sure in that group there were some bad ones   but  the night before  which he mentioned  was when the nazis took tiki torches and stormed down the street shouting nazi era slogans  obviously  the republican jewish coalition noticed that  too first  they sent out a tweet to honor heather heyer    the woman murdered by a trump supporting nazi  but this fell on deaf ears because they still support trump pic twitter com   rjc   rjc  august    they released a statement to explain  and this shouldn t have to be explained  that  the nazis  the kkk  and white supremacists are dangerous anti semites  there are no good nazis and no good members of the klan  but then the statement reads that  thankfully  in modern america  the kkk and nazis are small fringe groups that have never been welcome in the gop   except those  fringe groups  helped to elevate trump into power so maybe they haven t been paying attention  the name of the group responsible for the hate rally is called  unite the right  so that s another clue the statement calls on trump to  provide greater moral clarity in rejecting racism  bigotry  and anti semitism   the statement references abraham lincoln   who is spinning in his grave   as the founder of the republican party   we state unequivocally our rejection of these hate mongers   you can expect no less from the republican jewish coalition   the statement says statement by rjc national chairman senator norm coleman and rjc executive director matt brooks on behalf of the republican jewish coalition pic twitter com   rjc   rjc  august    statement on their site reads we mourn the loss of life at charlottesville this weekend  and will continue to pray for all those impacted  anti semitism and all forms of hate are anti american  anti jewish  and antithetical to any sense of decency  we regret that we continue to be faced with these issues  but the rjc will never shy away from our role of standing up to racists  fascists  and nazis that s nice but if the coalition rejects hate then they should start with the leader of their party who defended nazis that marched on american soil  we ll take the group seriously when they finally realize that trump needs to be ejected from office  he s emboldening the worst in society  and as for vice president pastor pence  he said today that he supports his boss s language during the presser  that should tell them that the whole damned administration is complicit featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
