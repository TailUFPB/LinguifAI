here s something you might want to send to your nearest trump supporting family member the next time you hear them say trump is  draining the swamp   when it came time to hire the person who would control the multi billion dollar new york new jersey housing department  he went with his son s wedding planner   a woman with zero experience in housing and who is currently mixed up in eric trump s charity fraud scandal with the exception of trump s golf caddie  who now runs his social media presence from the white house   it s safe to say that nobody has gained as much by trump s rise as lynne patton  prior to trump winning  the election  patton was an event planner responsible for organizing parties from rich people  she helped the trumps host golf tournaments  organized upscale events  and planned eric trump s wedding she has shown zero interest in public service  nor does she have any experience in housing or urban development  her only qualification is that she is loyal to trump  it appeared that was enough  trump appointed her to  head up the u s  department of housing and urban development s region ii  which includes new york and new jersey  where she ll oversee distribution of billions of taxpayer dollars   according to the new york daily news overseers should probably keep a close eye on the billions she s about to get her hands on  patton is involved in the  charity  golf tournaments that investigators say eric trump and his father used to skim    million from for their own personal gains  at the time  eric bragged about hosting the event for charity at his father s golf course by saying it was great because the trumps had donated the course for the day   in reality  according to a detailed investigation by forbes  they were charging their donors major bucks for the  privilege  of using it for charity in reviewing filings from the eric trump foundation and other charities  it s clear that the course wasn t free that the trump organization received payments for its use  part of more than    million that has no documented recipients past the trump organization  golf charity experts say the listed expenses defy any reasonable cost justification for a one day golf tournament additionally  the donald j  trump foundation  which has come under previous scrutiny for self dealing and advancing the interests of its namesake rather than those of charity  apparently used the eric trump foundation to funnel    in donations into revenue for the trump organization making matters worse  patton appears to be a serial liar  in the course of vetting her  reporters discovered she had lied about at least two things on her resume  she falsely claimed she received a juris doctorate from quinnipiac university school of law  she also claimed she went to yale  which  again  appears to be completely fabricated trump s obsession with stocking his administration with  loyalists  means he limits himself to only the yes men  and women   hanger ons  and opportunists who attach themselves to trump and properly inflate his ego  it leaves him with little choice but to pick from among the least qualified and most unethical people in the country to head jobs that would otherwise go to extremely serious and intelligent applicants  the result is this  incompetence mixed with dishonesty mixed with inexperience featured image via win mcnamee getty images
