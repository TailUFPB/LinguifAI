fox news is desperate to sabotage hillary clinton s campaign so they are continuing to launch outrageous lies about her health last week  sean hannity pushed an absurd claim that hillary suffered a seizure on camera because she playfully acted like a bobble head doll while being pulled in different directions by different speakers  when the joke was over she then spoke and smiled  two things that people definitely do not do while having a seizure as newsweek s kurt eichenwald explained to hannity earlier this week  people do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence  there s no smiling because  if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness  the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying  after a seizure  someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation  making jokes  eichenwald should know  he has epilepsy but fox   friends has picked up where hannity left off and made a brand new claim on thursday in an effort to cast doubt on the health of hillary s mind steve doocy  who was named in gretchen carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against roger ailes  suggested that hillary clinton has brain damage because she wears prism eyeglasses  is that the fact that when we saw hillary clinton wearing those prism glasses  a sign of brain damage and other things  and he s worried about the care she s getting so far   doocy said in reference to dr  drew pinsky allegedly expressing concern for hillary s health kilmeade then suggested that clinton s glasses are connected to benghazi  because conservatives will never stop talking about that  and if you want to   or remember  when she was wearing those glasses  remember when she made those famous line to senator ron johnson   what difference at this point does it make   that s when she had those glasses on  here s the video via media matters this kind of speculation is why fox should drop the  news  part of their name just because hillary clinton is wearing prism glasses it does not mean that she has brain damage  it means she has eye problems like  percent of americans do hillary wears fresnel prism glasses to correct double vision resulting from a concussion she sustained in  after she fainted and fell due to dehydration this in no way disqualifies her from being president  she merely has a vision issue that needs correcting and if wearing glasses is a sign of brain damage perhaps fox should have performed a quick search on google for donald trump  because they would have found this so does that mean trump has brain damage  i mean  that would definitely explain trump s crazy behavior over the last year featured image via twitter
