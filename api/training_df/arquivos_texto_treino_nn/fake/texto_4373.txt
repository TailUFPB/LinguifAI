in something you might expect from a video game instead of real life  police in sacramento  california are under fire on monday after a dash cam video was released that showed police trying to run down a black man who reportedly had only a knife  they missed  but they did manage to shoot  year old joseph mann  times  now  the community is calling for the police involved to be charged with murder the incident happened on july   as those on the right will happily point out  the police were called to an apartment complex because mann was reportedly acting erratically and he had a knife  when police ordered mann to drop his weapon and get on the ground  mann instead threw a thermos at the police car that s when officers randy lozoya and john tennis came to the scene  they are the officers in the video in the video  the officers are heard saying   i m gonna hit him  and  okay  go for it   before gunning the engine and aiming for him  mann was able to evade the police cruiser  but the officers stopped the car  got out and during a foot chase  shot mann  times  killing him here it is  mann was standing stationary on a sidewalk with no one in close proximity when the officers unloaded their guns   burris wrote in a letter he said he sent the u s  attorney general loretta lynch the family wants murder charges filed the officers  behaved like big game hunters closing in on an animal   said john burris  a lawyer for the family of  year old joseph mann source  cbs newsthe sacramento police are reserving judgement  of course  spokesman matthew mcphail didn t say whether cars are permitted as weapons  but he did say   our officers are encouraged to assess each circumstance and think critically about the tools at their disposal  the two cops have not been fired  they were placed on paid leave for a whole week after the shooting and now they are on desk duty again  mann wasn t an innocent bystander  methamphetamine was found in his system  the family s lawsuit claims that mann was  displaying obvious signs of mental distress   the police followed no protocol for dealing with a mentally distressed person and they made no attempt to deescalate the situation the bottom line  though  is that the punishment did not fit the crime  if police can t even subdue a man who is armed with only a knife  how are they supposed to deal with a mass shooter or a terrorist  not all crimes are equal and this certainly wasn t a crime that warranted the death penalty  not that police have that authority anyway featured image via video screen capture
