eleven year old marley dias always wanted to be our first woman president so she could work to fix problems in the world  then she realized that she doesn t have to be president to start working on the world s problems  and she founded a book drive known as    she s been looking for stories about young  black girls for nearly the last year marley s now looking at possibly having our first female president before she s even old enough to vote  and she has a few questions for hillary clinton elle printed the interview in full  and hillary replied to marley the exact same way she would reply to anyone else interviewing her  however  she also seemed to try and relate her experiences in a way that will help marley as she grows up for instance  marley asked her about her favorite books  including her favorite black girl book  on that subject  hillary told her  one of my favorite authors is maya angelou  and i love her book i know why the caged bird sings  it tells the story of how maya became such a strong  confident  determined person some parts are painful and hard to read  but of course that s the case in a lot of great books  and because maya became a friend of mine in real life  it meant a lot to be able to read her story and understand her journey better  hillary then quoted part of angelou s  on the pulse of the morning   and finished with  maya led a really difficult life  but she never forgot that each new day presented new opportunities  i m sure she felt afraid sometimes  just like we all do  but she didn t let her fears hold her back  that s a lesson i try to remember each and every day  as a black girl  who appears to already be growing into a strong black woman herself  knowing that hillary has taken the experiences of someone like maya angelou and used them as inspiration to keep pushing forward  day after day  must be huge we re not post gender  and we re not post racial either  marley is growing up in a society that still currently sees her as very much less than  hillary is saying   i was scared  you ll be scared  things will get tough  but you can survive it and come out the other side stronger than you ever thought you could be  here s how i know  along those same lines  marley also asked hillary what advice she d give to her  year old self  hillary said  i would say that when you have a big dream or you re trying to solve a big problem  there will always be people who tell you that you can t  here s my advice  don t listen  keep striving for your goals  and remember that it s good to be ambitious  there s nothing wrong with knowing what you want and going after it and marley  what you ve accomplished already is proof of that  marley started   because she was getting fed up with the books that her schools were having her read   they re classics  sure  but they almost always feature white boys as the main character  black people particularly black girls are never a main character in these books  yet  the books do exist and she was determined to bring them out into the light her book drive has already collected well over   titles a very impressive feat according to hillary featured image by justin sullivan getty images
