this church congregation should be ashamed after all  it was a year ago that watermark community church sent a letter to jason thomas formally rejecting him as a member of the church simply because he is gay  in our attempt to shepherd you  we have recognized a destructive pattern that prohibits us in caring for you and playing the role you desire for us to have in your life   the letter stated   specifically  your desire to actively participate in a same sex relationship with another man  and your unwillingness to heed biblical counsel from your church to turn from that relationship  has made it exceedingly difficult to shepherd you during this time  the church goes on to claim in the letter that they  value the way god has uniquely formed you   but wants him to change by following the church s counsel and to meet a person named brandon who has similar homosexual feelings  notice how the church literally outed brandon anyway  jason clearly was not welcome back to the church unless he agreed to be someone he is not so he stayed far away  one year later  jason is happy and is comfortable with who he is and with his sexuality  so he wrote a reply to watermark community church informing them that their choice to reject him was the best thing that could have happened to him here s is the full letter via pink news dear watermark community church today i celebrate a very interesting anniversary with you  it was exactly one year ago when you told me that i was no longer worthy to serve  be in a community group  and be a member of your church i spent years in your church battling against my homosexuality  i believed with all my heart that god would change me  i prayed for change almost daily  but when i wasn t able to change  you turned your back on me you say our  sin  is not unique  but you treat us in a unique manner  this is unacceptable behaviour  we are actual people that have actual feelings here we are a year later and you are still doing to others what you did to me  you are tarnishing the name of god to christians and non christians alike  you should be ashamed of yourselves  do not forget  jesus was angry with people just like you who said certain groups of people were not worthy to be followers of him thank you for removing yourself from my life  i am who god made me to be  i cannot change my sexual orientation and nor would i want to  i now have internal peace and happiness unlike ever before jason thomasindeed  while this church is busy persecuting people for being gay  there are almost certainly many members of the church who commit adultery or other sins on a daily basis who are not being rejected by the church like jason  even the church elders are not without sin yet they are busy hypocritically casting stones at people who are gay watermark responded to jason by telling the dallas news that   an individual s formal relationship with us as a member is only changed when someone no longer desires to resist sin and refuses our help  care and encouragement  even if someone s formal membership status is removed  they are always welcome to attend watermark and be reminded of the grace and truth of our savior jesus christ  yeah  that s complete bullshit and is exactly why more and more people are no longer attending church  jesus said  love thy neighbor as thyself   but apparently this church isn t a fan of jesus  teachings  which did not include ostracizing gay people featured image  i ytimg com
