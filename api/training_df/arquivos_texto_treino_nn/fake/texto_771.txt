republicans always like to claim they are the party of  family values   as such  they oppose anything they deem to be  sinful   such as abortion  homosexuality  or pre marital sex  they often use their political positions as a weapon against anyone who doesn t adhere to their twisted version of  morality   along with this  though  almost always comes some kind of amazing example of hypocrisy in their ranks these examples pop up pretty regularly  and here we have another one fifty four year old david narromore is a dentist in kingsport  tennessee  he is also the chairman of that state s republican party  narromore has been up to some decidedly un family values like behavior of late  though  and now he might be going to jail for it  in the men s restroom at a belk s department store  a most disturbing incident involving narromore happened  and a store employee contacted police  apparently  mr  narromore was exposing himself to the employee  who just happened to be a loss prevention officer using the restroom in the stall next to narromore narromore went well beyond the usual toe tapping that happens in this case here  too  he decided it would be a good idea to stretch his foot into the unidentified employee s stall and start massaging the other man s foot with his own  as if that weren t bad enough  narromore also whipped his d ck out for the poor innocent employee as well  this is what prompted the call to the cops the employee then kept narromore in the store in his office until police arrived  narromore was taken into custody   but not without a fight  he decided to resist arrest  refusing to comply with orders from police when they attempted to handcuff him  he became physically combative  and they had to tase him  when that didn t work  officers were forced to take narromore to the ground in order to cuff him and take him away  he spent the night in a cell  right where he belonged  despite his efforts to make sure that didn t happen  after posting bail in the amount of     he was let out of the joint the next day  he is charged with resisting arrest and indecent exposure of course  the tennessee gop has relieved narromore of his duties after this embarrassing dust up  tennessee gop communications director trent watson says of the incident  dr  narramore is clearly going through some personal issues  we wish him well as he attempts to deal with  his  personal struggles  ah  yes  in republican circles  being gay is wrong  so that means that when one has a  lapse   it s just  personal issues   maybe if this guy wasn t such a repressed closet case  he wouldn t be committing sex crimes in public restrooms  if you people weren t so archaic and hateful when it comes to lgbtq people  the people in your ranks who are repressed homosexuals wouldn t wind up doing this sort of thing and continuously embarrassing your party maybe the  issues  here have to do with the wrong headed  hateful  and dangerous views of the gop when it comes to homosexuality  not the people who are gay  repress it due to said views  and wind up in the slammer over it then again  this guy  as a professional republican  deserves no sympathy  as his hypocrisy is off the charts with this one  he pushes politicians and laws that harm lgbtq people  then gets caught trolling for gay sex in a public men s room   family values   indeed featured image via ajc com kingsport city jail
