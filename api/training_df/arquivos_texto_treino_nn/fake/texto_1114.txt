donald trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty russian escapades and even went as far as firing fbi director james comey  who just happened to be investigating him  now  sen  dianne feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that trump might try to fire both special counsel robert mueller  who is overseeing the probe into trump s possible collusion with russia and his obstruction of justice  and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein feinstein  who is the top democrat on the judiciary committee  laid out her concerns in a statement on friday  the message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired  that s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office   she wrote citing trump s most recent tweets regarding the russia investigation  which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt   feinstein said trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light  the senate should not let that happen  we re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone  a lesson the president would be wise to learn   feinstein said trump doesn t have the authority to fire mueller  however  he can order rosenstein to fire him  when rosenstein testified before congress  he said that he would only consider firing mueller if there was  good cause   but if trump wanted to  he is able to fire rosenstein and appoint someone who  after senate confirmation  would follow his orders blindly but feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters  if the president thinks he can fire deputy attorney general rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation  he s in for a rude awakening  even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law   she said the similarities between trump and nixon just keep piling up  if he were to go the route feinstein fears  it would be the saturday night massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome  impeachment featured image via win mcnamee getty images
