by now  everyone knows that dylann roof  the south carolina white supremacist who shot up am historic black church in charleston south carolina  did it because the parishioners were black  they invited him to their worship service  and after he sat there with them for more than an hour  he killed them  well  roof has been sentenced to die  and his case is not in the appeals process  like all people  no matter how despicable  roof is entitled  via the law  to a competent defense  since he cannot afford his own team of attorneys  they have been provided for him in the form of public defenders  there s just one problem with that  though  according to dylann roof  his lawyers are the wrong color appointed to represent roof are public defenders alexandra yates and sapna mirchandani  who are jewish and indian  respectively  those facts seem to be the only things that are wrong here  rather than their actual defense of roof  this isn t the first time race has entered into roof s court proceedings  he had similar mishaps with his original attorney during the trial portion of his ordeal  the man representing him during that time  david bruck  is jewish  roof said of the issues there  his ethnicity was a constant source of conflict even with my constant efforts to look past it  trust is a vital component in an attorney client relationship  and is important to the effectiveness of the defense  because of my political views  which are arguably religious  it will be impossible for me to trust two attorneys that are my political and biological enemies  to that end  the racist murderer  who seems to be more or less representing himself at this point  penned a missive from prison  firing his public defenders on the basis of their ethnicity as if all of this weren t bad enough  roof threatened his original lawyer  david bruck  with death if he ever got out of prison luckily  the judge presiding over roof s case sees his racism for what it is  and is denying this so called  motion  in short  if anyone deserves the death penalty  it s this piece of less than human excrement  no sympathy here  despite my usual opposition to the death penalty  if anyone deserves to die for his crimes  it s dylann roof featured image via video screen capture from abc news video
