donald trump s son in law jared kushner has found himself at the focus of the russia scandal which has gripped the administration  it s always the quiet ones you have to worry about  as they say  kushner released an  page statement earlier in which he appeared to throw donald trump jr  under the bus then kush  i can call you kush  right   spoke for two hours in a closed door session with senate intelligence committee staff members investigating russia s interference in the  presidential election  after that  kushner proceeded to talk to reporters  but didn t take any questions  i did not collude with russia and i do not know of anyone else in the campaign who did so   kushner said outside the white house kushner insisted that he has been  fully transparent  which is totally untrue  according to the written statement he issued just hours earlier in that statement  kushner said he had four contacts with russians during the presidential campaign and transition and declared that none of them were improper  even though they were not disclosed previously even most republicans agree that donald trump jr  should not have held that controversial meeting with a russian lawyer  which was attended by kushner and former campaign manager paul manafort according to kushner  it s all cool because he said he did not read emails that showed that junior enthusiastically accepted the meeting with the idea that he would receive damaging information about hillary clinton kushner went on to deny that russians financed some of his business interests in the private sector  however  it s been revealed that trump s son in law bought part of old new york times building from a soviet born oligarch who is allegedly tied to money laundering  there are many other instances we could cite  too  like  for example  kush s meeting with russian banker sergey gorkov  that bank is sanctioned so it s alarming that he would even take the  minute meeting but since kush feigns to be transparent  he can prove that right now usa today reports sen  ron wyden  d ore   called on kushner to testify in public under oath  and said his written statement raised more questions about his relationships with russians  he noted that the white house senior adviser  has repeatedly concealed information about his personal finances and meetings with foreign officials  there should be no presumption that he is telling the whole truth in this statement  at the very least  said sen  joe manchin  d west va   the transcript from kushner s meeting with staff members should be made public   make everything as transparent as possible   manchin told reporters  all of my actions were proper   he said outside the white house  so  the four undisclosed meetings  that we know about so far  were  proper  when kushner sought top secret security clearance which would give him access to some of the nation s most closely guarded secrets  he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years  but he failed to do so  you know  because he s so  transparent  he or she who has not had undisclosed contacts with russian officials  let them cast the first stone photo by chip somodevilla getty images
