donald trump must be forced to resign or be impeached  because this is really bad on monday  trump s delusional alternate reality was shattered into a million tiny pieces when fbi director james comey shot down his accusation that president obama wiretapped him and revealed that trump is under investigation for possible collusion with russia during the  election as comey spoke  one can only imagine that trump was throwing a massive hissy fit as his wall of lies crumbled all around him and on live television no less and we all know how much trump hates being humiliated on national television  his rants about saturday night live have demonstrated that perfectly the american people had a front row seat as trump s credibility was flushed down the toilet into the very swamp he claimed he would drain trump is only  days into his presidency and he is already an unprecedented failure presidential historian douglas brinkley s evaluation of trump s crash and burn is damning and only makes it clear that trump will be the biggest loser in presidential history usually  historians avoid using the word  treason  when they evaluate a president  but trump s case is so far beyond the pale that brinkley pretty much had no choice the fact that trump is under investigation by the fbi right now and has been for months is absolutely astounding  there s a smell of treason in the air   brinkley told the washington post   imagine if j  edgar hoover or any other fbi director would have testified against a sitting president  it would have been a mind  boggling event  indeed  even richard nixon didn t suffer such an embarrassment during his presidency despite being the only president who has resigned the office in disgrace  at this rate  trump is on pace to become the first to ever be ousted via impeachment  this is the most failed first  days of any president   brinkley continued again  trump still has  days to go before his first  days are completed  yet he is already plagued by scandals and the american people despise him  to be as low as he is in the polls  in the   while the fbi director is on television saying they launched an investigation into your ties with russia  i don t know how it can get much worse   brinkley concluded but it will get worse  especially as trump s policies begin to take their toll on our nation  the gop healthcare bill that trump thinks is  wonderful  is set to strip health insurance from tens of millions of americans while causing the price of healthcare to skyrocket trump is gutting environmental protections  education  workplace regulations  food aid programs  the state department  the united nations  and just about anything else that helps or improves the lives of americans  all while seeking huge tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy and it s all to fund his useless border wall and an increase in spending to a military that he uses irresponsibly trump has also strained relations with china  australia  mexico  germany  and great britain as international tensions rise clearly  it can get worse  and it likely will continue to do so until republicans in congress finally recognize that trump is a threat to our republic and our survival as a nation featured image  capitol hill blue
