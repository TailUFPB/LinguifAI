sean spicer might be in a little bit of a trouble after an off camera wednesday press briefing  though president  trump and spicer himself have been pushing the donald s baseless conspiracy theory that president obama tapped the  wires  at trump tower  spicer accidentally admitted they were just making sh t up  there is no reason that we should   that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever   spicy told reporters just minutes after he implied that he was unsure if the president was the  target of a counter intelligence investigation  i think that s what we need to find out  there s obviously a lot of concern   spicer had said  but at the end of the briefing  he was handed a sheet of paper  from which he read his revised answer verbatim the wiretapping allegations  clearly intended to distract from and detract from any ongoing investigations into team trump s connections to russian dictator vladimir putin  have become quite uncomfortable for trump  who demanded that congress waste time  resources  and effort looking into them  as just like everything else our alleged president says they are a lie   one that is quickly getting out of hand last thursday  senators lindsey graham  r sc  and sheldon white house  d ri  sent a letter tp the justice department asking for any evidence of trump s ridiculous claim  we request that the department of justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders   redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure  and to protect any ongoing investigations   related to wiretaps of president trump  the trump campaign  or trump tower  all i can say is that the country needs an answer to this   graham told cnn   the current president has accused the former president of basically wiretapping his campaign  unfortunately  this is the norm for donald trump  whenever things get too uncomfortably close to the truth  he starts a political forest fire that distracts the nation long enough for everyone to forget about it or at least to provide trump sufficient time to figure out how to explain away whatever the current issue is it is imperative that our elected officials stop falling for this and keep their eyes on what really matters   that we have a president whose staff both during the campaign and during his presidency was caught colluding with a hostile foreign power here s the video featured image via screengrab
