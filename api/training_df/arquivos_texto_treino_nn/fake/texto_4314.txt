trump s campaign is continuing its ahem unorthodox methods following revelations that internal polling shows trump s numbers are even worse than they re letting on  less than five weeks before the election  the campaign has actually cancelled    million in ad buys in pennsylvania  ohio  florida and north carolina  as well as new hampshire  maine  iowa and colorado trump only has a couple of paths to the white house  and they all involve most of these states  he doesn t win these states  he doesn t win the election  end of  so why on earth would they do this when we re nearing the home stretch  a senior communications adviser  jason miller  tried to spin it as a strategic move  saying  our data driven campaign is shifting resources from over performing markets to new battlegrounds w in the battlegrounds  buy is growing  outsiders are skeptical  though  dan pfeiffer  who once served as obama s communications director  said  this is what the professionals call horseshit  pfeiffer could have said   total  utter and complete horseshit   but he was probably being diplomatic  the trump campaign claimed they were going to spend   million on ad buys from the beginning of september through the nov   election  they ve spent less than half of that  though  and part of the problem is questions about how the campaign plans to pay for all those ads in fact  it s bad enough that outside groups are starting to pick up the slack  it s not likely going to be enough  however  and republicans are actually expecting trump to write himself another check in order to keep his campaign afloat while it s true that they aren t pulling all the ads from those states and are supposedly keeping them in bigger markets  this smacks of the disarray in the campaign following trump s series of worse than usual weeks  furthermore  there is another debate coming up  and with trump s horrible performance in the last one  the campaign may be rearranging everything it can in anticipation of a repeat performance  to try and mitigate the damage regardless  this could easily backfire on them featured image by spencer platt getty images
