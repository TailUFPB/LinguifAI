after trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the gall to defend blatant trump administration lies as  alternative facts   dan rather  one of the few real journalists left in our country  took to facebook and called for action  these are not normal times   rather said   these are extraordinary times  and extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures  conway wasn t the only person who suffered rather s wrath  but he called her phrase  orwellian   which it was  rather also talked about sean spicer  who  as he said  threatened  bullied and lied to reporters before walking out of the briefing room without even answering a question  he also called out the administration for its lies rather remarked that we ve never seen this before  but he has some suggestions for the media  the first of which is to not be afraid to call a lie a lie  even more than from the press  though  rather wants to see that kind of bravery come from congress there is one group of people who can do a lot   very quickly  and that is republicans in congress  without their support  donald trump s presidency will falter  so here is what i think everyone in the press must do  if you are interviewing a paul ryan  a mitch mcconnell  or any other gop elected official  the first question must be  what will you do to combat the lying from the white house   if they dodge and weave  keep with the follow ups  and if they refuse to give a satisfactory answer  end the interview facts and the truth are not partisan  they are the bedrock of our democracy  and you are either with them  with us  with our constitution  our history  and the future of our nation  or you are against it  everyone must answer that question it s true  if the media does its job  the truth will win out and  alternative fact  will be called simply   lies  featured image via kirk irwin getty images
