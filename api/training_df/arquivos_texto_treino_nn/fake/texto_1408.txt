the latest in a seemingly unending torrent of scandals and toxicity coming from fox news  the network says it was forced to abruptly fire bob beckel after the longtime host of the five made a  racially insensitive remark  to an african american fox news employee  the firing comes just weeks after the conservative channel faced a class action lawsuit that alleged executives would entertain themselves by forcing black female employees to arm wrestle white employees beckel himself had a history with inflammatory  offensive comments  ostensibly the channel s token  liberal   beckel proved himself to be anything but with repeated misogynistic and racist comments  in   beckel was briefly suspended after using the derogatory term  chinamen  while bashing the chinese government his remarks towards an african american employee were apparently the final straw  bob beckel was terminated today for making an insensitive remark to an african american employee   the network said in a statement  fox news  human resources department was made aware of a complaint about what one person familiar with the situation characterized as a  racially insensitive remark  on tuesday evening  executives conducted an internal investigation  this person said  and decided to part ways with beckel friday morning it may be small consolation to the countless people its hurt over the years  but fox news is having an exceptionally bad year  despite their guy winning the election  the network has been plagued by scandals big and small worse still  by refusing to cover trump honestly  the network has seen its ratings plummet  it now consistently loses to rivals cnn and msnbc in primetime viewers  who tune into the other networks to learn about the trump scandals fox refuses to cover and at this point  it s not entirely clear whether fox news can ever fully recover from the culture of misogyny and racism that ailes built  the fact that beckel is still using racial slurs seems to suggest the problems go much deeper than any one host update  the attorneys representing the man verbally harassed by beckel have come forward with the victim s account of beckel s behavior  it s bad  mr  beckel stormed out of his office when our client  a black  it employee came to service his computer  telling our client that he was leaving his office because he is black   the attorneys said in a statement  they also allege that when their client went to lodge a complaint against beckel  fox news chief human resource officer kevin lord tried to intimidate him and convince him to withdraw the complaint it appears that even when ultimately deciding to fire beckel  fox still behaved with characteristic awfulness featured image via fox news
