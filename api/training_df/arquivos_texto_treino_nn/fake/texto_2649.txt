democrats are more pissed off with trump s behavior than republicans  because republicans apparently feel they need to march in lockstep with the president when the president is a republican  trump s behavior on twitter  even though he s taken office and is supposed to be acting presidential  is abominable  and some members of congress are sick of sugarcoating it rep  kathleen rice spoke to wolf blitzer on cnn  where she blasted trump and his immaturity  and his inability to let personal slights go  she actually told blitzer that his behavior was worse than juvenile  it s juvenile  it s actually an insult to actual juveniles to say that it s juvenile   i don t even know what category to put this in  yep  a u s  representative went on national cable news to say that trump is so immature it s insulting to kids to say so  and she s right   he went on a tear against judge james robart  the u s  district judge who blocked trump s muslim ban  and even told his followers to blame robart if something happens  because the decision means that anyone and everyone can just enter the country on a whim he s repeatedly blasted the new york times as being fake news  same with cnn   he blasts saturday night live because they make fun of him  who don t they make fun of    he couldn t let reports that his inauguration numbers were less than stellar go for nearly two weeks  and the list goes on  and on  and on  ad infinitum and ad nauseam  he can t let anything go  and rice touched on that  too  when she said  and i m hoping that he stops with the name calling and the attacking every time someone says   if it s a poll he doesn t like  if it s a comment that he doesn t like  if it s a court decision he doesn t like   that s part of life  exactly  it s part of life and it s a big part of life when you re a public figure  particularly a public political figure  the fact that she felt she had basically had no words for the level of immaturity trump shows  and was willing to say so on national television  is very telling  watch her full comments below rep  kathleen rice on trump s name calling   there s a certain amount of decorum that we expect from our president  https   t co   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  february    more featured image via screen capture from embedded video
