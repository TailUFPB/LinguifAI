infamous donald trump surrogate and supporter scottie nell hughes thought she was going on cnn yesterday to make yet another pathetic attempt to get african american voters to support the donald  even though he is currently polling at zero with black voters    but her plans quickly went astray when political strategist angelia rye called her out for defending trump cooper began the segment by running a few emotional interviews featuring three black women who had lost their children due to gun violence  in making her completely flawed case  hughes told host anderson cooper that trump would be able to bring  hope  to black communities as well as jobs  she said  it s these urban areas   cities  where crime is going up as well as gang violence  so there s an issue that needs to be addressed by those kinds of   those communities  and they need to be supported whether it s through law enforcement or education  rye didn t hesitate to point out everything that was wrong with those comments  and drop a few truth bombs in the process  rye jumped in  pointing out that trump and his supporters are so racist they hardly realize it  a couple of things  one is   gun violence specifically   the overall crime rate has been on a steady decline since the   but i think that it s really important to watch the words that we use  when we say   those communities  those people   who are we talking about  referencing one of the interviews that had prefaced the conversation  rye echoed a woman s doubts that trump could really take on chicago s crime in  a week   like he says he can  rye also reminded hughes that trump has had zero empathy for the black community and those who have been killed by police brutality  racial profiling and gun violence  she said  donald trump was busy calling people who look like me thugs  blaming the victim in these instances of gun violence and police brutality  that is deeply troubling to me and not only to me  but i m sure to several other   i can t speak for all african americans   but to other african americans  you can watch rye lay into hughes below featured image via screenshot
