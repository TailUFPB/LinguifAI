the gop likes to pretend that they have no issue with women  but it couldn t be clearer that this is a bold faced lie  the issue was brought front and center when majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky  invoked an obscure  rarely used senate rule in order to silence senator elizabeth warren when she was reading a letter from the late civil rights icon and wife of martin luther king jr coretta scott king  the letter was entered into the senate record in   when senator jeff sessions  r al  was rejected by the senate for a federal judgeship because he is clearly a racist  now  sessions is on the cusp of becoming the attorney general   the chief law enforcement officer and the person charged with protecting the civil rights of all when rebuking senator warren in the most sexist terms imaginable  mcconnell said  she was warned  she was given an explanation  nevertheless  she persisted  of course  in the age of social media  mcconnell s appalling actions and remarks spread like wildfire   shepersisted immediately went viral on twitter and facebook  as did  letlizspeak   corettascottking trended as well  of course  it is not lost that mcconnell s sexist senate floor behavior comes just a couple of weeks after the women of this nation marched in solidarity in what is perhaps the biggest protest in united states history  surely he didn t mean to  but mcconnell just gave us all an awesome feminist rallying cry  and his own words are already being used against him  and will likely be seen on protest signs around the nation this weekend hell  they are already on t shirts and iphone covers  here are just a few tweets from the  shepersisted hashtag hey  senatemajldr  just wanted to say fuck you before i went to bed  fuck you   shepersisted  travon free   travon  february    for my new lock screen   senatemajldr   shepersisted pic twitter com   shauna   goldengateblond  february    was warned  she was given an explanation  nevertheless   shepersisted malala yousafzai  shot by the taliban   fights for girl s educ  pic twitter com   sarah flourance   bookishfeminist  february    speech you shut down mitch mcconnell  warren has   million views on facebook now  good job   shepersisted  karinchu   karinchu  february    is a rebellion  i rebel  letlizspeak resist shepersisted pic twitter com   oliver willis   owillis  february      shepersisted pic twitter com   ladama   ladama  february    the irony of silencing  warren for reading mlk s wife s letter during black history month wholly lost on r s   letlizspeak  shepersisted  brianna nichols   briannanichols  february     shepersisted  fannielouhamer pic twitter com uthqrsffzt  carey b     february    she persisted   letlizspeak  shepersisted  senwarren  strongwomen  womensmarch pic twitter com   so cal mountain gal   livirichelle  february    mcconnell  i don t think you know what you ve done  but  i suppose  despite your disgusting  bigoted conduct  we should be thanking you  because you just rallied us even harder and exposed your party s bigotry even further vote them out in   folks  this will not be forgotten   resist featured image via justin sullivan getty images
