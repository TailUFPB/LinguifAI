we love ruth bader ginsburg  she s the sweet   but also sharp   liberal justice who sits on the supreme court  she s also no fan of donald trump  one tradition that ginsburg   aka the notorious rbg   has is wearing a special  dissent  collar when she is going against major rulings presented the land s highest court  no such ruling was upon the justices today  but ginsburg wore the collar anyway  it seemed to be her way of showing the nation and world that she disapproves of a donald trump presidency now  this fact is no secret  after all  america s favorite scotus justice came under fire during the heated presidential campaign for remarks she made about the bombastic then gop presidential nominee  she said  he is a faker  he has no consistency about him  he says whatever comes into his head at the moment  he really has an ego    how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns  the press seems to be very gentle with him on that  ginsburg then went on to lament the idea of what a trump presidency will do to our american reality  saying  for the country  it could be four years  for the court  it could be   i don t even want to contemplate that  well  unfortunately  that is now our reality  i have to wonder what is going through justice ginsburg s head right about now  if her  dissent  collar is any indication  it s nothing good regarding president elect trump watch the video below featured image via kevork djansezian getty images
