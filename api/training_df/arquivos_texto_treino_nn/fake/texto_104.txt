the religious right movement is not the same movement anymore and frank schaeffer would know  after all  he helped his father create it the movement originally began as an anti abortion organization specifically designed to bring angry christians to the voting booth  but has since become something even more insidious in recent years  conservative  christians  have become one giant hate group that supports nazism and rape while working to strip women  minorities and gay people of their constitutional rights during an appearance on am joy on saturday  schaeffer roundly condemned the christian right and the republican party in a smack down of biblical proportion taking particular aim at roy moore and donald trump  whom conservatives are supporting despite several sexual abuse and assault allegations against them and trump s own refusal to condemn nazis  back in the day when my dad and me were going around the country establishing the religious right based on our anti abortion stand  one i ve moved a long way from since  the whole idea was bringing america back to some moral stand   schaeffer began  think about the republican party now   schaeffer continued   throw some words out that are associated with them  mass shootings  milo  trump  moore  bannon  rape  child molesting  neo nazis  white supremacy  what the hell is going on with the republican party  i m not shocked by donald trump  he s an ass  i m not shocked by roy moore  he s a loud mouth  a gun toting fool  what i m shocked by is the complicity  we are in a political climate that s built on one lie after another  i just want to say for the record  by the way  i believe a woman who stands up  which is very difficult to do and comes forward with a story like that  she was a trump voter  she s a republican  i believe her  i just want to say that as a father and grandfather and someone that respects women that i believe her  here s the video via youtube conservative  christians  and republicans should pay attention to what schaeffer says  clearly  the movement he helped create has turned into a monster that is far removed from the teachings of jesus and the bible  that is evidenced by the fact that conservatives are perverting the bible to defend moore s predatory behavior it s time for the american people to wake up and put an end to the christian right  they have never represented the values of the american people and they work every day to undermine our nation in an effort to turn it into their perverted and hateful version of a christian utopia  their insanity must be stopped featured image  screenshot
