michelle obama is arguably the strongest weapon hillary clinton s campaign has when it comes to fighting donald trump  and according to president obama  the gop nominee has no one but himself to thank for her presence on the campaign trail speaking at a fundraiser for clinton in california on monday  obama said there is one force driving the first lady to fight tooth and nail for clinton  the possibility of a trump presidency  some of you may be aware of the fact that michelle does not really love politics   obama said   but the passion that she s brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this election is different  the choice is different  obama said that when he was running against sen  john mccain in  and mitt romney in   he disagreed with them about many  many things  but despite that  he still considered them to be  honorable people  i wasn t concerned about the republic if they had won   obama said   and so part of the reason michelle is working the way she is  is because she understands  as i understand  that some more fundamental values are at stake in this election  it has to do with our basic standards of decency   how do we treat people  the president said that for the flotus  the choices we are faced with in the  election can be boiled down to this  do we treat people who are of a different faith as part of the fabric of america  or do we label them as something foreign  not a  real american   and thereby subject to different standards when it comes to how our laws apply  and this   do we think of women as equal and full citizens  capable of doing anything  or do we think of them as objects of either scorn or lust or our own satisfactions  do we think that government is something serious  that we have an obligation to make sure that to the best of our abilities we leave the country a little bit better off than how we found it  or do we think that it s an infomercial or a reality tv show   obama continued all of this has made one thing very clear to the first lady   michelle s conclusion is  is that we can t have  in the oval office   obama said featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
