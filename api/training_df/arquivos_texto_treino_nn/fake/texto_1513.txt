in what may go down in history as one of the greatest fatal mistakes any president has ever made  trump decided to sit down with nbc s lester holt and spill the beans on his decision to fire fbi director james comey mid way through the fbi s investigation into trump s collusion with russia  even casual observers of the law know that when you stand accused of crimes  in this case going all the way up to possible treason  the best thing to do is shut up and get a lawyer  instead trump just gave an unhinged confession of sorts that will be broadcast worldwide the clip that everyone will be talking about came when holt turned to trump s decision to fire comey and the reasons behind it  a visibly angry trump managed to debunk his own administration s lies about the circumstances behind the dismissal and instead incriminated himself by white house versions  trump decided to fire comey after he was given that recommendation by the deputy attorney general and after realizing comey had lost the respect of the american people and those working within the fbi  by trump s telling  he had already made up his mind to fire comey long before any recommendation passed his desk and even went further  i was going to fire comey  my decision  it was not a stunned holt interrupt him to clarify   you had made decision before they had come into the room  trump  not realizing he may as well have been confessing to a bank robbery  nonchalantly responds in the affirmative   i was going to fire comey  there s no good time to do it  by the way  that s huge  because trump is admitting his personal grudge against comey led directly to the fbi director s dismissal  his hand wasn t forced  he just didn t like comey or what he was looking into but trump  oblivious to all of this  marched on and stumbled into an even greater admission of guilt  he also claimed to have directly asked the fbi director for details about his investigation  that s a huge no no  in one case i called him in one case he called me  i actually asked him  i said   if it s possible  will you let me know am i under investigation   according to trump  comey assured him he wasn t   comey  in fact  has testified under oath that trump and his campaign are under investigation meaning trump is lying or comey is  which is more likely   but in either case  what trump is confessing to is a major ethical and perhaps even legal violation  demanding an fbi investigator provide you   the person he s investigating   with up to date details on how the case is proceeding presents all sorts of problems breaking  i was going to fire comey anyway  pres  trump tells  lesterholtnbc in exclusive interview at white house https   t co   nbc nightly news   nbcnightlynews  may     it may have been the fact that comey wouldn t give trump the details on his investigation that led to his dismissal  sources close to trump say the white house was furious when comey refused to unethically hand over his planned remarks before his congressional hearing in the days before his firing if this were a game of clue  trump just confessed to being in the billiard room with the candlestick  on national television featured image via twitter
