just after donald trump was sworn in  his administration dismantled the white house switchboard comment operating system  but now  there s a way to circumvent the alleged president s attempt to stifle dissention  thanks to an anonymous group  there was a time when this wasn t necessary  the public could call to express concerns during the obama administration  but that was then and this is now  the public comments line was shut down and people who want to call in to complain are prompted to send messages through facebook messenger or other forms of social media  the  for all americans  fake president doesn t want to hear your complaints  he is in power to receive adulation and nothing less then  white house comment line   created by an anonymous group  came to the rescue  open communication is the foundation of a good  functioning democracy   a spokesperson for the group explained to the gothamist in a statement   but it s a two way street  right now there s  information  coming out of the white house to the people  but not much the other way around  they may have shut down the comment line  but we the people still have comments  in light of that  we wanted to create one way for the people to be heard  the group released phone numbers of white house staffers but intentionally did not include any they believed had a role in national security the gothamist reports a solid chunk of the numbers were disconnected  probably during the obama to trump transition  but it s possible they ll be put back in use if trump ever gets around to hiring white house staffers  we ve been calling the numbers on the list and have found a few fun ones somewhere in there you ll get a voice mailbox belonging to one  conway  kellyanne   see if you can leave her a message before it s disconnected here are the phone numbers in the list that work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        group hopes told the gothamist that they hope people will let staffers know how they feel about certain policies to  demand fairness and transparency in the policy making process  please call them and be sure to say  heeyyyyy   from addictinginfo photo by drew angerer getty images
