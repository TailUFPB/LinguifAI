now that trump is officially going to be the next president of the united states  his supporters are unapologetically displaying his hateful  divisive rhetoric in their everyday actions  on tuesday  a woman in louisville  kentucky showed everyone how to perfectly follow trump s racist example when she unleashed a racist tirade on a pair of hispanic women in jcpenney video footage of this incident was filmed by renee buckner  who witnessed the event and was completely disgusted  she wrote  this hispanic lady was purchasing items and the transaction was almost complete  then her friend brings up some shirts to be added to her purchase instead of getting in line  and this lady went off    in the video  a senior woman had mistakenly though that one of the hispanic women had cut her in line  and she couldn t control her white privilege and racism  pointing to the end of the line  the older white woman said  it starts back there  and it don t bother me if i say it and i don t care if everybody hears me  i think everybody here probably feels the same damn way i do  the hispanic woman hadn t cut her at all   she was merely adding to the other woman s purchase   but the trump supporter was already on a roll  she said  just go back wherever the f ck you came from  turning to the cashier  the woman said  hey  tell  em to go back where they belong  you know  they come here to live and they act like they re everybody else  get in the back of the line like everybody else does  then she directed her hatred right back to the hispanic women as they tried to remain calm and ignore the blatant bigotry being directed at them  the older woman continued to hurl abusive language at them  you re a nobody  just because you come from another country  it don t make you nobody  nobody  as far as i m concerned  you re probably on welfare  the taxpayers probably paid for all that stuff  speak english  this is america  if you don t know it  learn it  what this woman did is disgusting and humiliating to anyone who was once proud to call themselves an american before trump began unraveling the country  you can watch this trump supporter spread hate below featured image is a screenshot
