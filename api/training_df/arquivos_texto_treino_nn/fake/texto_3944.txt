i am not a psychologist  i don t even play one on tv  but after more than a year of hearing non stop donald trump verbal vomit  it s pretty clear that the man is incapable of not insulting people  even the people this country pretends to revere  like veterans  on thursday  trump  for not the first time  insulted a group of his military veteran supporters by saying that he s just as brave as them because he takes financial risks  he doesn t  but more on that in a bit  he started off right  for literally a fraction of a second with five days to go until election day  we almost had a late breaking campaign first  donald trump being self deprecating  speaking at a rally in north carolina thursday night  trump acknowledged medal of honor recipients in attendance   oh  they re so much more brave than me  i wouldn t have done what they did   trump said  so far so good   i m brave in other ways   trump continued   i m brave   just different brave  same same source  slatewatch it here okay  mr  trump  since you brought up bravery  let s talk about it  you had five draft deferments  officially making you a draft dodger and if your campaign rhetoric is any indication  you re also a chicken hawk  sending other people to die  so you can  bravely  amass your personal fortune is the opposite of bravery  it s cowardly and it s worse as for being  financially brave   hardly  he s  brave  with opm  other people s money  which is not bravery at all it s called opm  i do it all the time in business  it s called other people s money  there s nothing like doing things with other people s money because it takes the risk   you get a good chunk out of it and it takes the risk source  bloombergtrump has also filed bankruptcy numerous times  which means he s really irresponsible with other people s money  why should we expect him to be any different as commander in chief  he will send other people s children to fight wars that could quite easily bankrupt us  to trump  that would be just another day  to the rest of the country  it would be devastating despite all of this  despite the fact that trump has insulted prisoners of war  veterans with ptsd  gold star families  and the very sacrifices of veterans  the military still supports him  although  by and large  the people in charge do not  perhaps the military should be listening to its generals and admirals instead of a bloated draft dodger featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
