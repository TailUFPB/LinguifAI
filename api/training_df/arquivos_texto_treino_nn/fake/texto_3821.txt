republicans are frothing at the mouth with excitement that donald trump could be the rubber stamp president they have been looking for paul ryan has wanted to repeal obamacare ever since it became law  not because it s a bad law as he and others in the gop have claimed  but because it s the signature achievement of america s first black president  and they intend to do so no matter how many millions of americans are harmed one particular group of women who would be harmed is women women benefit from obamacare because the law prevents insurance companies from labeling them as a pre existing condition just for being a woman  women can also keep their children on their insurance plan until they reach the age of  and get easier access to birth control  which insurance companies are required to cover one would think republicans would be all for this last benefit  especially since better access to contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies  therefore reducing the abortion rate but during an interview with cnn s jake tapper  the current speaker of the house literally refused to confirm whether or not the birth control mandate in obamacare is safe  i m not going to get into all the little nitty gritty details of these things   ryan said  which drew a sharp rebuke from tapper  with all due respect   tapper began   i don t know that the average woman of childbearing years out there who relies upon contraception provided by health insurance mandated by the affordable care act  i don t know that she would think that that s just a nitty gritty detail  ryan responded by whining  you re asking me details about legislation that hasn t been written yet   ryan complained   i m not going to get into hypotheticals about legislation that hasn t even been drafted  here s the video via youtube in other words  paul ryan basically just admitted that republicans will kill the obamacare birth control mandate  he s just too much of a coward to say so because he knows women will be pissed off women should be able to have just as much access to birth control as men do  men should not be allowed to legislate what women are allowed to do with their bodies  and that includes the decision to use contraception  but as usual  republicans intend to wage war on women unlike anything we ve ever seen before featured image  screenshot
