a  year old kid is upset about the debate over the u k  s  tampon tax   because he considers tampons to be luxury items  why are tampons luxury items in his world  incredibly enough  it s not because men don t need them  it s because  in this kid s eyes  women should just not bleed until they re able to get to a toilet  because  you know  periods totally work that way it might seem like this is satire  but it s not  this kid actually does think this way  despite having a girlfriend  he said  people are saying tampons shouldn t be taxed because they are a necessity but why can t those women just learn to control their bladders if they are going to bleed then they should wait until they get to the toilet  it s all about self control if you can t control your bladder then that s not the taxpayers  problem  i don t urinate everywhere and expect free nappies  for this nonsense  he earned an awful lot of what he calls hate  and that s not surprising at all  he needs a biology lesson and everyone who s said so is right  despite his obvious deficiencies  ryan fancies himself a politician and  politics expert   and says on his instagram account   making the  meninist movement mainstream once again   the meninist movement is basically the men s rights movement  which is full of poor  put upon guys who think women are oppressing them and are the devil the comments on the picture below  via his instagram account  explain it all bumped into  brooklynbeckham  brooklynbeckhama photo posted by   on sep    at   pdteven that doesn t stop him  though  in response to what he no doubt sees as the preposterous idea that he doesn t know anything about biology here  he said  people have told me that i must have skipped biology lessons but i don t understand how that is relevant  i have even had death threats people are saying it isn t dirty  it s natural but urine and faeces are natural and still dirty  it s utter hypocrisy  he s thrilled that men agree with him on the issue of tampon taxes  because of course they do  and that may have swelled his head because he s as egotistical as he clueless  he actually said on his facebook page   for tv requests  contact me directly  he s also been dumb enough to start what can only be termed a sarcastic gofundme campaign for biology lessons  which he proved he needs because he still can t understand why women can t just hold their bladders  he believes we re all lazy because we don t  and has the most bizarre example of why it s just a matter of self control  my gorgeous toy poodle  castrated when she was a puppy to stop the periods and to prevent any aggression pmt would give her if your bladder is too weak  which clearly it is for most of you  then see a doctor and have the same procedure  what does that even mean  you can t castrate a female   he s suggesting that women get hysterectomies to stop their periods  this guy thinks we actually like bleeding for a week every single month for most of our lives  or  at the very least  that we don t mind it  then again  he also says his girlfriend never bleeds  too bad his gofundme isn t serious  he s in dire need of those biology lessons featured image via screen capture from embedded photo
