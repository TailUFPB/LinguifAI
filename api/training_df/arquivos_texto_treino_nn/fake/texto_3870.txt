right now  it s looking increasingly like hillary clinton is going to win the popular vote  although we won t know for sure for weeks  and it wouldn t be the first time in recent history that the democratic party has lost the election while winning the popular vote  either  for many people  that s incredibly frustrating increasingly  people on both sides of the aisle have agreed that our presidential election process is shockingly undemocratic  after all  when it comes down to it  individual votes only count in swing states  if you re in texas voting democrat  or california voting republican  that doesn t mean anything right now when it comes to presidential politics  a handful of swing states decide national elections  and when the math adds up right  or wrong  depending on how you look at it   it s possible for a candidate with popular support and the majority of ballots cast for them to still lose thanks to gerrymandering  the democratic party couldn t afford a close election  and this was too close the good news is  there s something you can do eleven states have already signed on to the national popular vote bill  which is an interstate compact agreeing to cast the votes of those states   in all  to whoever wins the popular vote in the general election  if more states sign on  specifically  votes  worth  it s decided   the popular vote will determine who wins the general election if you live in california  new york  new jersey  illinois  maryland  washington  massachusetts  rhode island  vermont  hawaii  or dc  your district is already on board with truly democratic elections  although those states are mostly blue  not all of the legislative branches are  so there s hope if you do not live in one of those states  you can pressure your state legislators to pass a bill joining the cause  you can find the progress made in your state already at this link  or find out more behind the movement in general here featured image by alex wong getty images
