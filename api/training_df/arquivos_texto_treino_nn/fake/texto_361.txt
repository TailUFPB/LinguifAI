for nigh on two years now  people have been making the argument that not all trump voters are racist  misogynistic bigots  this could be true  after all  there are people who voted for barack obama twice  but then switched to donald trump  the idea of this makes most of us scratch our heads because obama was everything trump isn t  president obama is dignified  classy  smart  experienced  accepting of all people  trump is bigoted to his core  narcissistic  incompetent  impulsive  undignified  unpresidential  therefore  how could people who voted enthusiastically for barack obama vote for donald trump  i still don t know the answer to that question  what i do know is this  it s time to stop making excuses for trump voters and start shaming them  because that is what they deserve even if someone who voted for donald trump isn t personally a racist  a misogynist  a homophobe  or an islamophobe  they certainly are tolerant of those various bigotries and then some  they were able to look at the access hollywood tape  trump s call to ban all muslims from the nation  his kicking off his campaign by calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals  his promise  and current attempts to carry out that promise  to round up hundreds of thousands of people and kick them out of the nation  his five year long crusade to delegitimize the first black president   all of it   and still vote for him  they were able to realize just what a trump administration and all of its disgusting white supremacist glory would do to every american who is not a straight  white  christian man and still pull the lever for him  these voters are selfish people who took an unconscionably callous position when it comes to the fate of millions of americans  they knew he d do things like stacking the courts   lifetime appointments  by the way   with conspiracy theorists  racists  misogynists  and birthers  and they still voted for trump i could go on  but you get the picture trump voters watched the same campaign the rest of us did  and they saw the abhorrent behavior  the unending stream of bigotry  the dangerous flirtation with authoritarian figures around the world  the clear unfitness  and they voted for him anyway  these are not good people  it s time to stop making excuses for the people who voted for the most bigoted  ignorant  dangerous president in modern history  we have literal nazis working in the white house because of these people  we have  in jeff sessions  a man who was deemed too racist in  to be a federal judge as attorney general  we have birthers on the federal bench  that s all their fault there are no good people who are trump voters  it s time we recognized a hard truth  there s no such thing as a good person who supports donald trump  stop excusing them and start shaming them  it s up to us to recognize the ills in the american populous   starting with the absolute imbeciles who voted for donald trump featured image via daily kos
