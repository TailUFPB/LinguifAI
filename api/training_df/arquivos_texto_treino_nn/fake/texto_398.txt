leave it to donald trump to disrespect both the heroes and victims of a massive hurricane earlier today at the white house  trump spoke with reporters about the devastating effects hurricane irma will have on florida and the surrounding areas  trump also assured everyone that he would be traveling to the damaged areas soon to provide assistance  but what grabbed everyone s attention were trump s comments to the coast guard as he praised them for their efforts everything started well as trump commended the coast guard for their response to the hurricane  however  trump ruined his speech by showing america that he still doesn t know how to be presidential and cannot tell the difference between what is appropriate and what is not in a dire situation  while hurricane irma rages on  trump felt it was the perfect time to talk about the coast guard s branding  yes  really  trump congratulated the agency on raising its image  completely overshadowing any praise about their efforts  trump said  a group that really deserves credit is the united states coast guard  what they ve done   i mean  they ve gone right into that  and you never know  when you go in there  you don t know if you re coming out  they are really   if you talk about branding  no brand has improved more than the united states guard  once again  it s very clear that even in times of great tragedy and danger  all trump cares about or pays attention to is image and ratings  this was totally disrespectful to the coast guard as well as to those suffering due to hurricanes irma and harvey  branding is the last thing we should be concerned about here you can watch trump s ridiculous speech below pres  trump says he will visit florida  soon   will keep an eye on how hurricane irma develops over the next few hours  pic twitter com itatvjyudh  cbs news   cbsnews  september    image via pool getty images
