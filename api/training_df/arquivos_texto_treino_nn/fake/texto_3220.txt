john dean knows something about corruption  he was the white house council for richard nixon during the watergate scandal  he was even prosecuted for his part  that s why we should heed his warnings about donald trump  who the former white house council  accuses of being a liar  and worse dean  who s apparently been paying attention to trump and to trump s overall ignorance of anything when it comes to matter of state  tweeted on thursday that trump is an idiot and a liar  okay  that first word is mine  but the meaning is the same  it is deeply troubling when you realize that the president elect generally does not know what he is talking about   dean tweeted  and when he does he lies  it is deeply troubling when you realize that the president elect generally does not know what he is talking about and when he does he lies   john dean   johnwdean  december    is far from the first person to note that trump is a habitual liar  even his own lawyers say he s a liar  in fact  according to a deposition from   trump s lawyers had to double up during that bankruptcy hearing since trump can t be trusted  we tried to do it with donald always if we could because donald says certain things and then has a lack of memory   attorney patrick mcgahn said during the deposition in transcripts obtained by buzzfeed as mcgahn explained   it s always been our practice to make sure that two people are present  and we don t have a problem of people lying   he added that trump is an  expert at interpreting things  let s put it that way  source  salonin depo for trump plaza bankruptcy case  trump s own lawyer testifies they often met with him in pairs because trump lies so much  pic twitter com   southpaw   nycsouthpaw  october    trump gets closer to january   it s becoming more and more apparent that nixon will be his role model  of sorts  actually  all we have to do is go back a few months for a hint at that  in an interview in the washington post with watergate journalist bob woodword  trump had some misgivings about nixon  but they weren t about his dishonesty nixon failed  i think to a certain extent  because of his personality  you know  it was just that personality  very severe  very exclusive  in other words  people couldn t come in  and people didn t like him  i mean  people didn t like him when pressed about the fact that nixon broke the law  trump shrugged it off  speculating that it was  insecurity   according to trump  it was  hate  that destroyed nixon  not dishonesty  ironically  he sees no lessons in nixon s legacy  trump  along with being a habitual liar  seems to think of himself as someone who s very likable and not at all  swallow your drink before reading this next word  vindictive  and that  according to him  will save him  lies or not featured image via mark wilson getty images
