you know what s adorable  when a white supremacist  christian  attempts to  jesus  his or her way out of trouble after getting caught being him or herself  in this case  we re talking about west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey s now former spokeswoman s participation in an extremely popular white supremacist propaganda video  the  stop white genocide  video  features a bunch of women reciting lines from  the mantra   a sort of ode to whiteness written by popular south carolina racist bob whitaker  the video  which boasts that is has previously been removed from youtube and that it is banned in  countries  features carrie bowe reciting many lines that will surely embarrass everyone she holds dear  one line spoken by bowe lays the groundwork for a string of hate speech even your racist  drunk uncle wouldn t break out at thanksgiving dinner i ve been thinking a lot about a phrase i ve been hearing  that anti racist is a code word for anti white the women  including bowe  complain about the  obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide  against the white race  in fact  the former spokeswoman even has the final speaking line   anti racist is a code word for anti white  bowe  who started working for wv s republican attorney general in january   was fired within hours of the charleston gazette mail exposing her role in the racist video  the employee s conduct and statements  which occurred years before being employed by the attorney general s office  were not previously disclosed until today  which is contrary to the transparency requirements for being a member of this office  do not reflect the opinion or the perspective of the attorney general or this office   morrisey spokesman curtis johnson wrote in a statement regarding the termination bowe inexplicably claims that she didn t know what the finished product would look like despite the horrific phrases she personally spouts off in the white supremacist garbage video  in a post on facebook  she attempts to garner sympathy from her friends by not even mentioning what she did bowe told west virginia public broadcasting that she is embarrassed and heartbroken  because she thought the video was meant to further discussion on race relation from a white perspective  an  assertion easily disproved by the very choice phrases she spoke  growing up  you could not question why some races could talk or behave a certain way and it was seen as ok  whereby if the behavior was repeated by a white person  it was automatically racist   bowe explained   as a child and a teenager  the inability to even question this was confusing and  really  the opposite of the honest dialogue we need to have in order to understand different cultures and their history better  she has not explained how the  final solution to the black problem  she references ties into an open  healthy discussion on race relations one must wonder  was she fired because she spouted off kkk rhetoric  or was it because morissey wants to be re elected  in any case  we re sure there s a spot for her with the trump campaign watch the video below featured image via screengrab
