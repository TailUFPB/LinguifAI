as trump skips out on a planned martin luther king day visit to the new smithsonian african american history museum after a weekend of hate tweeting civil rights legend john lewis  others in the gop are attempting to match  if not surpass  the donald in horribleness a member of georgia s gwinnett county board of commissioners decided that the weekend preceding a holiday celebrating civil rights was exactly the right moment to join trump in layering on the hate against john lewis  this backlash comes in response to lewis  absolutely accurate statement that trump   who is due to be sworn in as grand wizard of the united states of america on friday   is an  illegitimate  president now  most might look at trump   a guy who became president with the helpful input of a hostile foreign dictator s propaganda and fake news campaign  with a sprinkling of hacking of trump s political opponents  and who represents everything we are against in our nation   and at least agree that lewis has a point  but not tommy hunter  like trump  he hopped on social media over the weekend and threw a racist tantrum  john lewis is a racist pig   hunter posted on saturday  eloquently adding that  there ain t one political pundit that didn t say on november  that this would be demonrats exact response to trump winning   hunter explained that  demonrats do not live in reality because the polls failed to predict that  percent of people who lived in the right place at the right time were able to successfully select a president that the majority didn t want   what a bunch of idiots   hunter said  john lewis  district is drawn to keep him in power   he later continued  his wins are all illegitimate  how can other reps be concerned about working with him  john lewis fought  bled  was arrested for  and dedicated his entire life to fighting for the right for all americans to vote  hunter  well  he sits on facebook and whines about politics  spams his friends  news feeds with posts about facebook  and he enjoys fishing gwinnett democratic party  gabe okoye  called hunter a  disgrace to gwinnett county in particular and georgia in general  in response to the posts  calling for the trump fan s resignation hunter deleted the posts along with one demanding to know if there are  any white guys  on the university of alabama s football team and several other miscellaneous posts in response to the inevitable backlash  he also changed his privacy settings so he can continue to post hateful garbage in his circle of friends without anyone else knowing  while i am grateful for what the congressman did in selma and other times during the civil rights movement  you get respect by showing respect   hunter told  the atlanta journal constitution after he got caught being a racist douchebag   he is using his fame as a way to continually divide the races and in this case standing on the very much unsubstantiated claim that the guy i voted for  is racist and only won because of russians hacking the election which  of course  we all know didn t occur  lewis  of course  is doing none of those things   but hunter actually claiming that russia did not hack the election demonstrates his exact mindset  apparently  he is crazy enough to refuse to believe something even trump has now reluctantly admitted is true yet sure enough of himself to spew racist garbage while calling an african american civil rights hero a  racist  featured image via facebook
