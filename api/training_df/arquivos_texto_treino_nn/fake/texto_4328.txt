it took speaker of the house paul ryan quite a while to endorse gop presidential nominee donald trump  this is understandable  after all  the relationship between ryan and trump has been frosty at best  in fact  when the endorsement finally came  it was under cover a huge speech that democratic nominee hillary clinton was giving  further  since said endorsement ryan has yet to appear on stage in public with trump  and has avoided speaking about his party s vulgar  bombastic presidential nominee if at all possible  before trump took the nomination officially  ryan called him out for many of his more inflammatory remarks   particularly his call to ban muslims from entering the united states  and his apparent inability to immediately disavow david duke and the ku klux klan  however  with hillary steadily pulling ahead of trump  ryan is biting the bullet and caving under pressure of the republican national committee and the goons at the trump campaign  and will finally appear in public with trump ryan s office released a document to the press on thursday  saying that ryan would be at an event in his native wisconsin  the memo is called  paul ryan to attend annual fall fest in walworth county   along with ryan  there s a list of other republicans who will be there  and  buried under all the political talk  almost at the very end  the document confirms the worst  trump will be there with bells on  too  here is a screen capture of the document  via the huffington post and pay special attention to the last line  all questions related to mr  trump should be directed to the trump campaign  that right there goes to show that ryan still can t stand the idea of talking about trump  yet he has somehow been bullied into appearing in public with him speaker ryan  you have no spine left  you have handed the battered bits of it that were left to the courier who delivered it on a silver platter to trump tower  it s trump s party now  and you helped make that happen  the gop is dead  and so is your political career  if you had stood up to your travesty of a nominee  if you had put country before party as any real leader would  you might have been able to avoid this situation good riddance  you sniveling  cowardly  eddie munster lookalike  i hope you not only lose your speakership in november  but your seat in congress as well  after all  regardless of political party  real leaders have a spine featured image via mark wilson getty images
