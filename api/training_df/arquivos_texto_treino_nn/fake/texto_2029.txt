the  american health care plan   a k a  ahca or  trumpcare   didn t get the vote thursday that it was supposed to because there are too many republicans in congress that won t vote for it  trump has been trying to bully them into doing so  including threatening the jobs of republicans who vote against it  now  though  he s made what he no doubt thinks is his most terrifying threat yet  except it s really not he s threatened to leave obamacare in place if trumpcare fails in congress if you re sitting there scratching your head  you aren t alone  the aca  also known as the dreaded obamacare  would remain in place and intact regardless of what trump does  the question is who would be responsible for that  politically  and the answer is and has always been republicans  trump seems to think he can hold that over their heads to force a vote mick mulvaney  the white house s budget director  has even told house republicans that trump is done with negotiations and just wants a vote now  he said that if they vote the bill down  then trump will just proceed to work on other parts of his agenda  which  really  is the obvious option one has to ask  does trump really think that he s going to cow intransigent republicans this way  should trumpcare fail  the aca would remain the law of the land regardless of what trump does because he can t repeal it all on his own there are house republicans that aren t part of the intransigent freedom caucus who have said they can t back the modified bill  which is considerably worse than the original bill  there s also the fact that senate republicans have already said they don t have the votes to pass trumpcare to appease one side  such as the freedom caucus  republicans have to alienate another side  like moderates  they re stuck between a rock and a hard place on this   and it s a situation that trump s bullying can t really make worse there s a small chance that the bill will pass the house tomorrow  but with the freedom caucus and moderates being unhappy with the bill  it will probably fail  if it fails  obamacare will remain the law of the land  republicans already know they ll bear the burden of that  trump s threat is ridiculous featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
