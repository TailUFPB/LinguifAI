one by one  donald trump is screwing over everyone he promised to help when he wanted their votes  today  it was our military veterans and their small children who got the shaft  thanks to trump s policies  a memorandum was leaked online explaining to army families with young kids that the early education programs they have come to rely on are coming to an end just one week from today as a result of trump s hiring freeze  the memo announced that united states army garrison  usag  wiesbaden cys part day programs would no longer be available as of march   these programs include the strong beginnings  part day preschool  and part day toddler programs printed on army letterhead  the document clearly states that  this closure is a result of staff shortage due to the federal hiring freeze  this hiring freeze prevents cys from replacing staff who depart for any reason to include normal rotation   because they are unable to hire new teachers  thanks to trump s hiring freeze  they have found themselves with only enough staff to  operate mandatory core programs  according to the memorandum   part day programs are being closed to sustain full day programs that are essential for military readiness  the last day for these part day programs will be february   it is with deep regret that usag wiesbaden cys must take this action  however  mandated core services that support soldier readiness must be maintained and this can only be done by moving staff into the core programs from the part day programs   the memo reads   it is our intention to once again offer these part day programs as soon as we are authorized to hire and have sufficient trained staff on board  on the campaign trail  trump swore up and down that he was going to take care of the men and women who serve in our military  but  like most other things he has said  this has turned out to be just one more broken promise  and now  it is the children of those who are willing to give their lives for this country that are ultimately getting screwed if you don t think  realdonaldtrump s  hiringfreeze hurts our military  and military families  think again  this just leaked online  pic twitter com   votevets   votevets  february    image via christopher furlong getty images
