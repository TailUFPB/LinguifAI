after friday s right wing terror attack in portland  in which two men were stabbed after coming to the aid of a muslim teen  the nation seemed unsure of how to respond  one republican responded  though  he says it s the gop that s at risk and his solution is to hire the right wing extremists as republicans  personal bodyguards it took donald trump three days  but his handlers finally released their official response to the attack  which was far too little too late  but still better than declaring himself the victim the violent attacks in portland on friday are unacceptable  the victims were standing up to hate and intolerance  our prayers are w  them   president trump   potus  may    irony is thick there  since trump has been the leader of the hate and intolerance movement since at least   when he became the leader of the birther movement  which tried to claim that president obama was not born in the united states still  even after the attack  and after trump s less than heartfelt response  james buchal  the chair of the gop party for multnomah county  which is home to portland  said this to the guardian  i am sort of evolving to the point where i think that it is appropriate for republicans to continue to go out there   he said   and if they need to have a security force protecting them  that s an appropriate thing too  asked if this meant republicans making their own security arrangements rather than relying on city or state police  buchal said   yeah  and there are these people arising  like the oath keepers and the three percenters  asked if he was considering such groups as security providers  buchal said   yeah  we re thinking about that  because there are now belligerent  unstable people who are convinced that republicans are like nazis  both the oath keepers and the three percenters are on the southern poverty law center s list of anti government groups  in other words  they are terrorists while it is true that constituents across the country are p ssed at the fact that republicans want to take away their healthcare  that hardly constitutes an existential threat  except perhaps to some careers the fact is  though  that while the oregon stabber supported bernie sanders  he only did so out of sheer hate for hillary clinton  and he s also a racist right wing nut job and perhaps the only thing preventing him from being in one of those militias  was the fact that no one seemed to like him still  for some bizarre reason  snowflake republicans think they are the ones under attack  so naturally  the only way to deal with that is to hire terrorists to protect them
