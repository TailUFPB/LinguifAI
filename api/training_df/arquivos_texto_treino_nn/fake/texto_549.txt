donald trump s weak response to the racially motivated  white supremacist terrorist attack in charlottesville  virginia has been a sombering moment for america  while many americans did not have any high hopes for trump as potus  some at least thought he would be decent enough to condemn violence and bigotry  or at least not publicly defend racism  unfortunately  we have been severely disappointed trump has failed so miserably to denounce hate that even several republicans are disgusted by the lazy tweeter in chief  and while many of them are speaking up  most of them don t have the guts to call trump directly out or make any sort of passionate statement on the matter  however  sen  lindsey graham  r sc  is beyond done with trump  in response to trump s continued failure to respond appropriately to the charlottesville crisis  graham has issued a blistering statement calling trump out by name and accurately accusing the disgraced president of dividing america here s graham s statement  which we hope will inspire many more conservatives to openly criticize our modern day hitler in his statement  graham also brilliantly pointed out that trump is basically welcoming neo nazis and kkk members with open arms by making comments that defend racists graham s statement was much needed  as much of the republican party has not stood up to trump s inaction in a strong enough way  an innocent life was lost in charlottesville  and trump has defended the people who were responsible  that should make gopers across the country ashamed of even being associated with trump condemning racism and white supremacy should be a no brainer  it is extremely odd that the republican party s leader   and many other conservatives   are having a hard time calling this out and taking the strong stance that graham has  now is not the time to be silent and stick to party lines featured image via sean gallup    getty images
