it s crystal clear that nobody can accuse sean hannity of knowing what he s talking about  particularly over twitter  tonight  he got into a heated exchange with conservative writer ben shapiro over the suddenly controversial depiction of trump as julius caesar  because in shakespeare s play  julius caesar gets assassinated hannity seemed to enjoy chants of  liberal hate kills   after another trump loving protester rushed the stage at the play  and shapiro called him out on his hypocrisy over that  hannity responded by calling him stupid in one tweet  and then again with this little bit in which he made a complete fool of himself really  who s the stupid one here  the same theater company that did this play did have an obama lookalike as caesar in   other parallels have been drawn between shakespearean characters and politicians  too  for instance  henry v seemed to depict george w  bush  there wasn t anything like the outcry we re seeing with the trumpian caesar and twitter is busy pointing all of this out with glee                 the manufactured controversy could be due to the right s ongoing persecution complex  they latch onto anything that makes them look like it s them against the world  like the world is out to get them  it s absolutely ridiculous in the face of real persecution this tweet may get deleted and it may stay up  hannity isn t really known for admitting when he screwed something up royally like this  kind of like his hero  trump  he s more trumpian every day featured image via alex wong getty images screenshot
