as you are probably aware  donald trump loves to tweet  he loves it more than he loves vladimir putin which  according to him  is a lot while trump doesn t publicly express regret   ever   he probably has had second thoughts about at least some of his tweets   like this one about leadership leadership  whatever happens  you re responsible  if it doesn t happen  you re responsible   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    trumpcare once again failed to happen because republicans couldn t come up with a workable plan if it saved their lives  like obamacare has for so many   trump said he was just going to let the affordable care act fail   i m not going to own it   he pronounced he also used to criticize republicans for trying to gut medicaid and social security the republicans who want to cut ss   medicaid are wrong  a robust economy will make america great again  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    days  trump is all about doing exactly those things trump probably also isn t too fond of the fact that he sent out this tweet criticizing president obama for  allegedly failing to accomplish things and stuff  after all  he had  full control  for two years   he can never take responsibility   trump said at the time obama s complaints about republicans stopping his agenda are bs since he had full control for two years  he can never take responsibility   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september     almost five years later  he is desperately avoiding taking responsibility for his own failures despite having complete control speaking of control  trump criticized obama s alleged weakness with regard to russia of all places in  putin has shown the world what happens when america has weak leaders  peace through strength   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april     he s rubbing vladimir putin s back in public and engaging in long intimate meetings his own wife can t break up  but he s tough on russia  totally tough  i mean  it s not like he s ever publicly fantasized about vladimir putin being his bestie or anything do you think putin will be going to the miss universe pageant in november in moscow   if so  will he become my new best friend   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    then  of course  there s this one  trump is going out of his way to destroy our relationships with various world leaders and is currently pushing us into a war with north korea  an ally of both russia and china be prepared  there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    one point  speaking of obama s non scandals often promoted by fox news  breitbart  and trump s other trusted media sources  trump posed the question   can we handle another  scandal in d c i wonder what the next scandal will be in d c   can we handle yet another   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may     his administration is plagued by numerous actual scandals  usually involving russia  often reported by the  fake news   sources he doesn t like  media like  um  cnn great move by cnn if they sign jeff zucker  he was responsible for me and the apprentice on nbc became   show   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     that one is probably embarrassing for him given his numerous attacks on the fraud news network or whatever he s calling cnn these days one of those fake news stories he complains about is that he spends a lot of time playing golf   something he used to complain about the president doing we pay for obama s travel so he can fundraise millions so democrats can run on lies  then we pay for his golf   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october     we spend millions so he can go golfing at his own properties on a regular basis trump also used to complain that obama wouldn t release his records to the public   specifically  his birth certificate and college records to prove he wasn t born in kenya  a lie the donald used to push  obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the american public  he can t   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    can t even get the donald to release his taxes  something every other presidential candidate  and indeed president  in recent history has done trump is crazy and incompetent   someone most of the world thinks should not be in charge of our nuclear arsenal  embarrassingly  trump agrees  well  he agreed when the leader in question was not him the global warming we should be worried about is the global warming caused by nuclear weapons in the hands of crazy or incompetent leaders   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    at least mr   is with the rest of us when it comes to the need for a leader who isn t laughed at by the entire world  someone who is  truly great  and knows how to win we need a president who isn t a laughing stock to the entire world  we need a truly great leader  a genius at strategy and winning  respect   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august    someone entirely unlike him featured image via getty images
