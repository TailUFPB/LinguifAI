donald trump was hoping to visit the fbi for a photo op in the wake of firing fbi director james comey  the fbi told trump to f ck off in the days since comey s firing  it has been revealed that trump pulled the trigger in retaliation against the fbi investigation into his russia scandal  trump demanded that comey be loyal to him and comey refused to put trump above the security of the country  trump has even admitted that the russia investigation was in his mind when he fired comey this contradicted the official white house statement on comey s firing  which has sparked national outrage as most americans disapprove of trump s action trump was hoping for applause  instead  he made things worse for himself  now it s clear that he has something to hide but he didn t just anger the american people  he pissed off the fbi  most of whom loved their former boss so when donald trump wanted to visit the fbi on thursday  they told him not to bother  trump then tucked his tail between his legs and had the white house cancel the visit  he likely then threw a temper tantrum like a toddler  the fbi told the white house the optics would not be good   nbc s peter alexander reported as the news came in   fbi officials apparently said the president was unlikely to be greeted warmly after having just unceremoniously fired a very popular director  alexander further explained that while many fbi agents voted for trump  they don t like that he fired comey and are disgusted by how trump did it here s the video via youtube donald trump just turned the fbi into his enemy  and that means they are going to work double time on the investigation into his ties with russia  and i m sure they will be all too happy to slap cuffs on trump and haul his sorry ass to jail when the time comes featured image shawn thew   pool getty images
