donald trump keeps trying and failing to enact a travel ban from many predominantly muslim countries  california is enacting its own travel ban  but this one  unlike trump s  will pass constitutional muster and it s to combat bigotry the state can t tell its citizens that they can t travel to other states  but there is now a ban on state funded and state sponsored travel to states that discriminate against lgbtq people  in other words  states that hate won t get california tax dollars the ban is a reaction to past and recent legislation that would allow people to discriminate against lgbtq people wanting to adopt and foster children among other forms of discrimination  the ban currently encompasses eight states kansas  mississippi  north carolina  and tennessee were the original states banned by ab   but  california attorney general xavier  becerra added alabama  kentucky  south dakota and texas on thursday  citing what he called new discriminatory legislation enacted against the lgbtq community in those states alabama  south dakota  and texas all recently passed legislation that could prevent lgbt parents from adopting or fostering children and kentucky passed a religious freedom bill that would allow students to exclude lgbtq classmates from campus groups  while the california doj works to protect the rights of all our people  discriminatory laws in any part of our country send all of us several steps back   becerra said   that s why when california said we would not tolerate discrimination against lgbtq members of our community  we meant it  source  cnnnot surprisingly  all of these are trump states while the recent spate of hate legislation can t be directly attributed to donald trump  there s no doubt he empowered it  red states are pretty comfortable right now in the knowledge that trump will pick anti gay judges to uphold their bigoted agendas while california in no way prohibits its citizens and even its employees from spending their own money in states like texas  they don t have to encourage it featured image via justin sullivan getty images
