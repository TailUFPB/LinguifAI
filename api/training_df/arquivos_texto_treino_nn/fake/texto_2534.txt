donald trump better watch out because news organizations aren t going to take being called  fake news  anymore if the daily sentinel files a defamation lawsuit against a republican colorado state senator it could trigger an avalanche of lawsuits by news organizations across the country on wednesday  the sentinel published an opinion piece demanding that gop state senator ray scott allow an open records bill to pass the committee he chairs public records laws are important tools for combating misinformation and getting to the truth  but the state has no obligation to provide electronic records in useful formats that easily lend themselves to analysis senate bill  would change that  the bill requires records custodians to provide records in digital forms if kept that way and requested as such  if a government agency keeps records in an excel spreadsheet  for example  it should deliver them via open records request in the same format   not paper copies or pdfs  which aren t searchable  sortable or easy to aggregate but first  has to get past the same senate committee that killed a similar version last year  the state  veterans and military affairs committee was supposed to consider the bill on monday but republican sen  ray scott of grand junction  who chairs the committee  said it wouldn t be heard as scheduled  sb  deserves a fair hearing before the full senate   the sentinel continued   we call on our own sen  scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward  open records shouldn t be a partisan issue  we have a difficult time understanding why anyone would oppose easier access to government data  which belongs to the public  well  scott didn t like being called out so he responded by accusing the sentinel of being  fake news  the very liberal gj sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill   scott wrote   they have no facts  as usual  and tried to call me out on sb  know as the cora bill  they haven t contacted me to get any information on why the bill has been delayed but choose to run a fake news story demanding i run the bill  you may have a barrel of ink but it just splashed in your face  we have our own fake news in grand junction   the very liberal gj sentinel is attempting to apply  more  https   t co     ray scott   scottforcolo  february    again  a republican attacked the media by calling them  fake news  in response to a story they don t like as we have seen on the national level  news outlets have begun directly calling out donald trump whenever he refers to a media outlet as  fake news  but the daily sentinel is going a step further  and if they succeed  donald trump  kellyanne conway  and other republicans should be more careful about what they say  setting aside for the moment the mischaracterizations and mistakes in sen  scott s tweet   though it is true we were not able to reach him about why he canceled the hearing  the concern for me is the allegation that the sentinel peddles  fake news   wrote sentinel publisher jay seaton   his tweet is patently  provably false  worse  he made his false statement knowingly for the purpose of diminishing the only real asset this newspaper has  its credibility  seaton is letting things cool down for the moment  but is planning on filing a defamation lawsuit against scott this would be a huge deal since the sentinel would be the first news outlet to sue a lawmaker for calling them  fake news  keep in mind that donald trump has repeatedly called cnn  the new york times and other mainstream media outlets  fake news  on twitter and during press conferences  so have other members of his administration in response to stories they don t like imagine if all of these news outlets got together and filed a massive defamation lawsuit against trump it would be monumental and trump would be in serious trouble  too  because he would have to prove his  fake news  claims in court  meanwhile  the media has demonstrated on multiple occasions that trump is wrong whenever he accuses them of running  fake news  stories in short  donald trump should really stop calling the media  fake news   they have a case against him and if this lawsuit by the daily sentinel moves forward and succeeds  more lawsuits of this nature could be forthcoming and trump would be the top target featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
