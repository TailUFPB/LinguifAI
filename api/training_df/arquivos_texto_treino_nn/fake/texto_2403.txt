republicans across the country have been doing all they can to avoid town hall meetings where angry constituents are waiting  but rep  louie gohmert  r tx  should win some type of award for his despicable excuse earlier this week  gohmert claimed that he hadn t scheduled a town hall meeting to discuss important issues with the people he represents because with all the angry protesters around he s afraid of a shooting like the one that involved congresswoman gabby giffords  but don t worry  this isn t because he s a coward  it s just that he wants to keep his constituents safe  unfortunately  at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology  some even being paid  who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety  threats are nothing new to me and i have gotten my share as a felony judge  however  the house sergeant at arms advised us after former congresswoman gabby giffords was shot at a public appearance  that civilian attendees at congressional public events stand the most chance of being harmed or killed   just as happened there  in a scathing statement  giffords slammed gohmert for his cowardly comments and basically told him to grow a pair  she pointed out that her offices were open after her shooting  giffords added that the representative who took her place during that difficult time also continued to hold town halls rather than hide from the people  her statement ended by shaming gohmert and telling him  point blank  to  have some courage  i was shot on a saturday morning  by monday morning my offices were open to the public  ron barber   at my side that saturday  who was shot multiple times  then elected to congress in my stead   held town halls  it s what the people deserve in a representative  in the past year  campaigning for gun safety  i have held over  public events  to the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations  i say this  have some courage  face your constituents  hold town halls  giffords followed her statement up with a tweet that shared the same message to the politicians who have abandoned their civic obligations  i say this  have some courage  face your constituents  hold town halls   gabrielle giffords   gabbygiffords  february    is also worth noting that republicans aren t willing to pass legislation that might help control the massive gun problem clutching the united states  they d prefer to continue playing the puppet for the nra and then hide from the people they re supposed to represent because they re scared that they might get shot  unbelievable featured image via spencer platt getty images
