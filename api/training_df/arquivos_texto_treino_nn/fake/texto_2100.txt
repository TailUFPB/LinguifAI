one of the things that makes trumpcare such a blow job for the rich is that it contains a bunch of cuts to taxes that help pay for certain provisions of the affordable care act  some of those taxes were primarily on the wealthy  which we all know is totally unfair one such tax was a   percent tax on  unearned income   including real estate income   something that trump could avoid when he was actively managing his businesses  however  now that he s in the white house and not actively managing those businesses  he s subject to that tax and the gop wants to repeal it it s the biggest tax cut contained within the clusterfuck that is the trumpcare ryancare bill that means there s massive tax break that will help trump line his pockets   while he s still in the white house according to the wall street journal  up until he became president  he would have met the definition of being an active real estate professional   said joe perry  partner in charge at the accounting firm marcum llp  now  as president   he would probably not meet the definition  in terms of his rental income  he would have been largely unaffected by repeal  if he were still a private citizen  said tony nitti  an accountant at withum smith   brown   there s no just practical way he can qualify as a real estate professional now that he s president of the united states  because he doesn t qualify as a real estate professional anymore  he has to pay this tax on his businesses  the tax  however  contains a loophole for people actively managing certain types of businesses  so as a private citizen  he didn t have to pay it repealing this tax will send more income to trump  and up to the top  percent of households in the country while ripping health insurance from people who can t afford it  the whole plan is nothing but cold blooded fuckery intended to help the rich while punishing everyone who has the audacity to not be rich which is something we already knew because that s how republicans roll  but for the man who calls himself the president to personally benefit while he s in office is just beyond the pale featured image by justin sullivan via getty images
