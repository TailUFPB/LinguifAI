in a move that absolutely nobody could have seen coming  president trump has lashed out about the newly appointed special counsel tasked with looking into his campaign s dealings with russian intelligence services  trump told reporters on thursday afternoon   i believe it hurts our country terribly  because it shows we re a divided  mixed up  not unified country  and we have very important things to be doing right now  whether it s trade deals  whether it s military  whether it s stopping nuclear   all of the things that we discussed today  and i think this shows a very divided country  president trump used his time with reporters to attack democrats as well  blaming them for the multiple investigations into his ongoing backroom deals with russia  he said   it also happens to be a pure excuse for the democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the electoral college being slanted so much in their way  that s all this is  president trump s initial reaction to news that a special counsel has been appointed that stands in sharp contrast to the statement that president trump released yesterday  when he learned that a special counsel had been appointed  trump also seemed to be concerned over how investigations into his presidency look to the rest of the world  saying  i think it shows division  and it shows that we re not together as a country  and i think it s a very  very negative thing  and hopefully  this can go quickly  because we have to show unity if we re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world  perhaps the biggest shock is that trump reportedly still wants michael flynn to be a part of his administration  the president is convinced that flynn will be found innocent  despite mounting evidence to the contrary  trump reportedly wants michael flynn back it s hard to imagine that anyone  even trump  could possibly think that rehiring flynn is a good decision  photo by richard ellis via getty images
