trump has wasted absolutely no time letting some of our allies know what he really thinks of them  on a phone call with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull  he went off about a pledge the u s  made to accept   refugees from a detention center in australia  there are also rumors floating around that he threatened to send troops to mexico if they don t get a handle on the border situation while speaking to mexico s president  enrique pena nieto  last friday  he allegedly told nieto to control mexico s  bad hombres   or else we would send troops in to do it for him  the associated press first reported on an excerpt someone in the white house gave them of the phone call s transcript  you have a bunch of bad hombres down there   trump told pena nieto  according to the excerpt given to ap   you aren t doing enough to stop them  i think your military is scared  our military isn t  so i just might send them down to take care of it  both the white house and pena nieto are denying that the call went this way  but a mexican news outlet published something similar to what the ap has  and even said trump was humiliating pena nieto  if it is  indeed  true that trump said these words  then he seriously just cut down and threatened one of our neighbors with military action  or worse  invasion  which would be the next logical step seeing as how he s done everything else he can to piss mexico off with australian prime minister turnbull  who was trying to confirm that we d honor our pledge to accept refugees  trump said   this is the worst deal ever   and accused turnbull of trying to send the  next boston bombers  to us  he also blasted turnbull about how the deal was going to kill him politically  because that s really what matters to him  actually doing his job  meh australia is one of our closest allies and trump not only tore into him  it sounds like he hung up on turnbull  too  well before the call was scheduled to end we ve fought alongside  and received support from  australia in the middle east  they are not an ally we want to alienate  and yet  here trump is  working as hard as he possibly can to do just that until they fall in line with what he wants he also spent part of the call bragging about his inauguration numbers   really  he s still not over that anybody who thought trump would calm the hell down after winning the election  and actually treat foreign leaders with the dignity and respect of everyone else  was sorely mistaken  he uses twitter to berate anyone with whom he has a disagreement   why would he treat foreign leaders any differently when he s finished bullying the entire world  we won t have any allies left  except maybe russia  featured image by drew angerer via getty images
