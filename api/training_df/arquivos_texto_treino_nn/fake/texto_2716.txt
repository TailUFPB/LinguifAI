in what will surely send donald trump into a new twitter tirade  a new poll from public policy polling  ppp  shows the majority americans longing to have president obama back  and overwhelmingly not liking trump according to the poll  less than  weeks into donald trump s tenure as president    of voters already want to impeach him  that s up from   of voters who wanted to impeach him a week ago  only   of voters say that they would be opposed to trump s impeachment beyond a significant percentage of voters already thinking that trump should be removed from office  it hasn t taken long for voters to miss the good old days of barack obama   say they d rather obama was president  to only   who are glad trump is  president obama was loved by the united states  and for as many haters as there were  there were far more that loved and appreciated his true leadership and love of country over himself  the same can t be said of trump check out this tweet that garnered over   million likes it s been the honor of my life to serve you  you made me a better leader and a better man   president obama     january    then this one i won t stop  i ll be right there with you as a citizen  inspired by your voices of truth and justice  good humor  and love   president obama     january    man isn t only loved  he s beloved trump  on the other hand  throws out mean revenge tweets like their going out of style  and most of the responses to his tweets are condemning his actions  to be blunt   the man is not liked much at all  sure  he has he band of merry minions who would likely drink paint if trump told them to  but he lost the popular vote by  million vote to hillary clinton  and the only reason he is president is due to an archaic electoral college that was devised to give power to slave owners who counted their slaves as   of a person  and help those in rural communities have a voice  it s no longer needed and the nation doesn t want trump nor his backhanded style of egomaniacal leadership it seems  if given the opportunity  the united states would have president obama back in a heartbeat  if only that were possible featured photo by alex wong  chip somodevilla getty images
