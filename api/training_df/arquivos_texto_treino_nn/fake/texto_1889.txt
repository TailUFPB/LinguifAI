pennsylvania resident kurt farmer was perfectly fine with building a wall to keep brown people out of the country  banning muslims from entering the united states  and donald trump s other horrifying policies  but he  like the ku klux klan and other hate groups who backed trump during the election  also made the mistake of believing that the donald had his interests as a white man at heart unfortunately  as a recovering heroin addict  farmer is now suffering quite a bit of buyer s remorse after learning that his treatments are going to go bye bye under trump  farmer relies on medicaid to pay for his recovery treatments  and trump is currently in the process of trying to gut healthcare for all those dirty poors in the country who act like the constitution guarantees the right to  life  or something  if i didn t have medicaid  i wouldn t be able to pay for this   farmer told cnn   i would like to say i wouldn t relapse but the chances are from past experience  if i m not going to treatment  in a matter of a few weeks i start getting high  farmer recently learned   like the rest of us   that the white house intends to allow states to opt out of the essential health benefits regulations under obamacare   the very same ones that force private insurers and medicaid to pay for substance abuse recovery farmer is the most recent in trump voters who have lost the faith   but only after learning that they would be hurt by his policies just as much as immigrants  muslims  and others trump and his supporters view as untermensch this is the difference between conservatives and the rest of us  while we realized the donald is bad for america as a whole  they waited until he was bad for them to care watch the cnn segment below featured image via screengrab
