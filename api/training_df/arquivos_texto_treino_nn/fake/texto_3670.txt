several mosques in california have received threatening letters from some of trump s loyal subjects  which boldly proclaim that trump is going to clean up america   starting with muslims  they want him to  in their own words   do to you muslims what hitler did to the jews   the letters were addressed to  the children of satan   and just got worse from there  your day of reckoning has arrived   the letter states  according to cair la   there s a new sheriff in town  president donald trump  he s going to cleanse america and make it shine again  and  he s going to start with you muslims  perhaps they think trump will be happy to deputize them in whatever crusade he launches against muslims  and  well  pretty much everyone who isn t obviously white this group is signing these letters as   americans for a better way   because of course that s what they think they are this is part of the rash of hate incidents and crimes that have occurred at the hands of trumpkins since the nov   election  in fact  the southern poverty law center says that there had been more than  recorded hate incidents and crimes between the election and nov    that s more than seventy such incidents per day  compared to a little more than two anti trump incidents per day  and it s disgusting  it s terrifying the counsel for american islamic relations in l a  came forward with the letters that went to two mosques there after they learned that a mosque in northern california had likewise gotten one  executive director hassam alyoush said   disheartened that anyone would address fellow americans  fellow human beings  in such a hateful  dehumanizing way you always want to trust that most people are good  that your neighbors have been good  and that has been our experience  sadly  for a growing number of people  believing that people are generally good is going to become a relic of the past if this keeps up  while cair and other organizations recognize that trump didn t create racism  and neither did obama   he did normalize it  he made it okay  he vindicated the lunatic fringe and now they re trying to work their way into mainstream dialogue  ayloush said the  irresponsible  hateful rhetoric  of the trump campaign has fueled  a level of vulgarity  vile hatred and anger among many self proclaimed trump supporters   we can expect more mosques to receive letters like this  or worse   even as police in california begin investigating these incidents and stepping up protection where it s needed  trump spends an awful lot of time railing against the media and against democrats and his enemies  but he needs to rail against this  otherwise he s truly the president of hate featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
