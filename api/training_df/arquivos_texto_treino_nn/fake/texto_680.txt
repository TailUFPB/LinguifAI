the roll out of the first version of donald trump s bigoted muslim ban was nothing short of chaotic  people were arriving in america  only to be turned around and sent back  or detained  even green card holders were stopped at ports of entry into the nation  there were even photos of children and elderly and disabled people being handcuffed  it was one of the most horrifically un american moments in this nation s history  now  new reporting from the daily beast shows that that trump administration s plans regarding the implementation of this ban were even more sinister it seems that this was the first trial balloon for trump s intention to bypass a co equal branch of government  as his people at the ports of entry were told to ignore judges and members of congress trying to cut past the chaos created by trump  instead of letting these people do their jobs  border patrol agents were told to ignore them  senator cory booker  d nj  says of these revelations  i m extremely troubled that cbp  employees would be instructed by superiors to ignore congressional representatives trying to do their job  especially under such circumstances  we suspected as much at the time  but it s jarring to see it in black and white  i ll be seeking more information from cbp on this matter  these disturbing developments come via a leaked email from todd owen  of the customs and border patrol commission said to his people at the ports of entry  as stated on the call earlier today  you and your staff are not to engage with the media or congressional representatives at this time  please make sure your subordinate port directors are following this direction  please report any such requests to acting ac from congressional affairs  thank you  further  the border patrol agents were explicitly told to be suspicious of attorneys attempting to help   in other words  this is why people were denied counsel in such a brazenly unconstitutional way if this doesn t tell you how little respect this autocratic administration has for our form of government and way of living  i don t know what will  this is a dictatorship unfolding right before our eyes featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
