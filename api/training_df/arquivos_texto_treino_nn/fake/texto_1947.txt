oh  my  god  the stupid  it burns anybody who actually paid attention in science class in school are going to have a collective wtf moment when they learn what one pennsylvania republican said about the cause of climate change as we all know by now  donald trump signed an executive order reversing every action president obama took to fight and reverse climate change  a move that has horrified scientists around the globe but just as cringe worthy is what scott wagner told a group of county officials on tuesday  wagner is a gop state senator who wants to be pennsylvania s next governor  unlike donald trump  he acknowledges that climate change is real  however  his view on what causes climate change is far different than what any actual scientist has concluded according to wagner  climate change is happening because of two different reasons  first  he claimed that it s happening because of body heat  seriously  we have more people  you know  humans have warm bodies  so is heat coming off  things are changing  but i think we are  as a society  doing the best we can  humans have warm bodies but it s not our body heat that is causing climate change  it s all the pollution we harmful gases we expel into the atmosphere like methane and carbon dioxide  also  reversing climate action is not  doing the best we can   ending the fight against climate change threatens our country  especially our coastlines  which will likely end up under water unless we do something fast to prevent sea level rise caused by climate change but then wagner suggested another cause for climate change and this one makes it clear that republicans need to pick up a f cking science book  i haven t been in a science class in a long time  but the earth moves closer to the sun every year   you know  the rotation of the earth   wagner said   we re moving closer to the sun  again  this is a guy who wants to occupy the top government office in pennsylvania and wagner is absolutely wrong as huffington post reports contrary to what wagner said  the earth rotates on its axis every  hours  not every year  and it may come as a surprise to him that the united states and the rest of the northern hemisphere experience winter when the earth s yearly orbit brings it closest to the sun furthermore  wagner made it sound like the earth s orbit around the sun is decaying  but it definitely is not decaying  if anything  the sun would become a red giant and swallow the earth  and that probably won t happen for millions of years long after climate change kills us all because republicans like donald trump and scott wagner deny climate change and its cause after his embarrassing remarks went viral  wagner released a statement somewhat acknowledging that humans have contributed to climate change  i believe that the climate is changing every day  and some of that change is certainly manmade  i think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards  and i support efforts to do that  however  the real question isn t is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it  i believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy  the problem is that climate change will do more to hurt our economy than the measures employed to stop it ever will  one would think saving the planet would be the number one priority  but as usual  republicans are thinking more about the wallets of billionaires featured image  wikimedia
