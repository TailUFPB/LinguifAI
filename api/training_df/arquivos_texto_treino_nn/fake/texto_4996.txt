republicans are about to lose a huge source of funding as the justice department announces it will phase out its usage of the highly controversial  and highly racist  use of the private prison complex the doj  under the leadership of loretta lynch  made the determination after evidence from the inspector general s office showed private systems were less safe and less effective than state government run facilities  consequently  the doj has instructed all government contractors not to renew contracts with any private prison operations and to  substantially reduce  already existing contracts in a statement  deputy attorney general sally yates highlighting the many faults plaguing the private system  they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services  programs  and resources  they do not save substantially on costs  and as noted in a recent report by the department s office of inspector general  they do not maintain the same level of safety and security  another cause for the discontinuation of the private system was the decline of america s prison population  which once exploded in the late  and early   as recently as  years ago  the department of justice  under the bush administration  began contracting with private prisons to contain a population made up of seemingly petty crimes that disproportionally affected blacks and other minorities in total  these  private prisons across the country will be losing their government contracts  putting a severe dent in their funding  considering the report also detailed higher levels of assault   both by inmates and staff   and higher rates of contraband  this is a perfect example of wasteful spending republicans are always decrying  luckily  the obama administration recognizes this and is taking care of it  all without the help of the gop currently  private prisons account for  percent of the nation s prison population at just over   inmates  according to corrections corporation america  the united states spent   million on private prisons in the   fiscal budget once again  the obama administration is cleaning up a big mess made by president bush a dark stain on modern america is finally breaking apart  private prisons  a staple in the age of modern jim crow  have outlived their use  if they were ever useful in the first place   the justice department s decision to end its contractual obligations is a huge step in the right direction  but it remains to be seen if states like arizona  who put funding for prisons over education  will follow the lead featured image via allison shelley getty images
