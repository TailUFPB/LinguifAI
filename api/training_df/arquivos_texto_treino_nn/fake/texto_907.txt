the last time donald trump went overseas  it was clear that he didn t have the physical or mental stamina to carry out his presidential duties at the level they needed to be performed at  it was widely reported that by just the third day of his trip  trump was utterly exhausted  now that trump is on his second international tour  it seems he s having the same exact issue and his lack of competency is humiliating america in the process on friday  trump made the united states look like a joke once again  when he was caught daydreaming  at a roundtable meeting at the  summit in hamburg  germany  while every other world leader was alert and paying attention to the fact that they were posing to take a photograph  trump was clearly in his own world and didn t even know what the hell was going on as he kept himself turned the opposite way  if it weren t for british prime minister theresa may having the decency to wake him up out of his little fantasy land  trump would have taken the photo with his back turned to the camera   perhaps the perfect symbolic gesture for how he turns his back on america  and the world  you can watch this cringeworthy moment play out below it is insanity that the republican party has elected a man who doesn t even have the attention span   or the intelligence   to perform the role of being potus  trump consistently zones out during important meetings and clearly doesn t have it all together  he is someone who cannot and should not be trusted with the important decisions he has to make  and his complete lack of focus continues to be a danger to our country s future  more than ever  we must question whether or not trump is really fit to be president   and there was far more evidence pointing to his necessary and immediate removal featured image is a screenshot
