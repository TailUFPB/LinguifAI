rex tillerson was right  donald trump is a f cking moron after years of slamming polls as  fake   trump had the nerve to tout a poll on sunday morning after fox   friends reported on it the politico morning consult poll results show that  percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about trump so  of course  the poll sent trump to twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through it is finally sinking through    of people believe major national news orgs fabricate stories about me  fake news  even worse  lost cred   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    s all keep in mind that this is one poll  furthermore  the results were largely split down partisan lines  with  percent of republicans believing that the news media make up stories about trump  that number rises to  percent among trump s most ardent supporters if this poll had the opposite results  trump would be dismissing it as a fake  and we all know it trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass  that s why fox   friends is watched by trump on a daily basis  they not only kiss his ass  they practically give him a blow job every morning back in july  a ppp poll showed that a majority of americans trust the news media more than they trust trump over  percent of americans said they trust nbc  cnn  abc  the new york times  and the washington post more than they trust trump  the percentage of people who said they trust trump more only hovered in the mid  you know what else currently stands in the mid   trump s approval rating  the latest gallup poll shows that only  percent of americans approve of trump s job performance  the politico poll has it at  percent  so you can probably guess which poll trump will call  fake  featured image  spencer platt getty images
