with less than  hours before election day  things are going disastrously for donald trump s campaign team trump s communications director jason miller appeared on cnn with chris cuomo on monday morning and quickly whined about fbi director james comey s decision to once again absolve hillary clinton of any wrongdoing in the long running persecution over her emails  comey did so because the new emails were actually duplicates of ones that had already been investigated but miller refused to accept comey s explanation and demanded that the emails be released for the sake of transparency  no  don t accept it   they should release all the emails  let us have a look before election day   miller said   we think that would be the smart thing to do  cuomo immediately smelled the hypocrisy and jumped all over miller for it  you love transparency when it s not you guys   cuomo said   you don t see any irony in that  why don t you release your emails  why don t you release trump s taxes if you think transparency is such a good thing for the american people  miller repeated the tired old claim that trump will release his taxes when he s not being audited  even though the irs has said that taxes can still be released even when someone is being audited  you think anybody believes the audit thing going to the polls tomorrow   cuomo asked   you have any proof of an audit  miller stumbled a bit while claiming that he does have proof  yeah  you do   cuomo replied   have you seen an audit letter  miller attempted to deflect again by trying to spin the conversation to the clinton foundation  and once he said the word  fact  cuomo pounced again  that is the fact  right   cuomo said   transparency only works one way in this election where trump s involved i ll show you an audit letter i got  here s the video via twitter trump adviser  jasonmillerindc calls for clinton email release   chriscuomo asks about releasing trump s taxes  https   t co   new day   newday  november     whenever a trump surrogate appears on television they go to great lengths to avoid talking about how their candidate is one of the most non transparent candidates in the history of american elections while trying to portray hillary clinton as a liar who has something to hide even though hillary has released her tax returns and medical records to the public  both of which donald trump has refused to do himself using one excuse or another speaking of hypocrisy  jason miller was caught going to a strip club in las vegas the night before the last presidential debate  that wouldn t be a problem for most campaigns  but trump s base of support is comprised of conservatives who think female nudity is evil  so that makes miller s outing fair game but you ve got to hand it to cuomo  he grilled miller to a crisp and we need the media to do more of that as election day approaches featured image via screenshot
