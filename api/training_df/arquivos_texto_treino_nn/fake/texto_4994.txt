trump s appointment of breitbart chief steve bannon  along with his decision to have at least two people at the top of his campaign who will let him run amok  has further frightened and infuriated republicans to the point where they re finally seeing reality about the candidate they put at the top of their ticket  as the layers of their delusions continue to be peeled back  former minnesota rep  vin weber says  look  we are in a terrible position  the republican party has made a mistake of historic proportion and when you do that  you find yourself in a place with no good solutions  trump s idiocy has started to affect down ticket races all across the country  particularly in the senate  senators in tight races saw their numbers drop considerably between august  and august   this is good news for democrats  but the gop s continued insistence that trump will  ultimately  work for them is rapidly becoming a pipe dream it s hard to feel sorry for them over that  though  because they re the ones who stuck themselves with a candidate who can t even run a cohesive campaign  in fact  weber sees conniving manipulation in trump s decision to have three people managing his campaign  we now have a ceo  a campaign chairman and a campaign manager  that tells me that no one is in charge of this campaign  trump is playing these three people against each other  indeed  since the campaign manager is still paul manafort  trump could be playing him against the other two  when manafort replaced corey lewandowski as campaign manager back in june  everyone saw it as a sign that trump was ready to take on the mantle of campaigning for the general election  they expected a pivot  effected in part by manafort but he s not pivoting  and he won t  manafort failed miserably there  since trump s strategy of alienation worked so well during the primaries  he can t see any reason at all to change  i am who i am  it s me  i don t want to change  everyone talks about  oh are you gonna pivot   i don t want to pivot  i mean you have to be you  if you start pivoting  you are not being honest with people  that s a laugh coming from the man who spreads lies as easily as people spread the common cold  it s even sillier coming from someone who s trailing so badly in the polls that he s reduced to tweeting the ones where he s only a couple of points behind hillary his campaign is quickly becoming the only republican entity that s still mired in the delusion that he can win anything at all  hell has frozen over  the gop is starting to admit  outright  that they fucked themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw in nominating donald trump for president featured image via ralph freso getty images
