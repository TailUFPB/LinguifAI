donald trump  knowing that his poll numbers with black voters are abysmal  decided to spend part of his saturday at a black church  detroit s great faith international ministries  however  it could not be more clear that he was in no way wanted there  firstly  protesters showed up in throngs to condemn his visit  and then  the democratic mayor  mike duggan  held a press conference slamming trump s presence in his city  duggan said  i feel like i m watching the next season of  the apprentice   this is the most phony major party nominee that i ve seen in my lifetime  and that s why we re skeptical  trump s visit included a conversation with the church s bishop  wayne jackson  and remarks to the congregation about how he supposedly will help african americans  or perhaps just his way of saying how much he loves  the blacks    duggan  however  saw through the charade  and said of trump s pandering  are you here just to use detroiters as props in a re imaging campaign  or are you here to have a real conversation where you re finally going to give us the specifics on what you re going to do to make american cities better  another local democratic lawmaker  rep  brenda lawrence  joined duggan in his condemnation of trump  she made a point of reminding everyone of the insulting language trump uses when speaking of african americans in his so called  outreach   rep  lawrence said  he said when he sees an african american that i am broke  i am unemployed  i m uneducated  and whenever i walk out my door i m being shot  what do i have to lose   i don t want my grandchild to listen to the rhetoric that she  as a woman and as an african american  is classified and stereotyped as uneducated  of course  both duggan and lawrence are right  trump is absolutely clueless  this visit  like all of his other events that are done anywhere except in front of all white audience where he s shouting about minorities and dog whistling racists  is nothing more than a photo op  a way to gain a few votes from the gullible  and most importantly to make sure that suburban white america thinks he is just not racist enough for them to be able to vote for him with a clear conscience featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
