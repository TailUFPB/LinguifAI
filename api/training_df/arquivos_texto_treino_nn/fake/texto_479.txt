republicans have spent the past two years insisting that donald trump really isn t a complete and utter moron in addition to being a raging bigot   just give him a chance   conservatives have bellowed from the rooftops since he was sworn into office in january  but now  it seems that trump s own party has run out of good things to say about him republican rep  duncan hunter was speaking during a gathering with the riverside county young republicans when the best thing he could come up with to say about trump was that he may indeed be an asshole  but hey  at least he s our asshole  he put his hand near his mouth like when you are going to whisper something   jose guzman told the los angelos times  and then he decided what the hell and told the room how he really feels  he s just like he is on tv   hunter reportedly said to the group   he s an asshole  but he s our asshole  when this is the best thing your own party can manage to say about you  you know your  presidency  is in big trouble  to make it even more pathetic  this isn t even someone who has been against trump in his past  this is one of his supporters  hunter endorsed trump early on in the primaries not long after he won the nevada caucuses let s all hope that conservatives like hunter are as willing to own the messes trump has created for both the country and the republican party  because hunter is right on both counts  trump is an asshole and he is their asshole  trump is most definitely a monster the gop created and they need to own that as well  then  once they get a grip on that reality  they need to grow a pair and do something to stop him before he causes any more damage than he already has featured image via alex wong getty images
