donald trump s approval rating plummeted after his disastrous attempt to get support for his american health care act  trumpcare  crashed and burned  it was a disastrous health care bill to begin with  proving to be higher in cost while stripping millions of americans of life saving health care   and trump paid for it with his lowest approval ratings yet  trump is swimming in bad news  but the latest info about the affordable care act  aka obamacare  is about to make it worse apparently  the gop s effort to do away with obamacare has created quite the opposite effect   obamacare is now more popular than it s ever been  since the bill was signed in   americans are now more in favor of it than ever before a new gallup survey also echoes this monumental change   in the last five months alone  obamacare approval skyrocketed  percentage points  and part of that change has been thanks to the gop s failure to provide a better solution  the gallup survey discovered that   of america now approves of the affordable care act gallup s jim norman states that this has big implications for the law   and directly affects what the republican party may or may not be able to do in the future  norman said  if that majority holds  it would be a significant development  politically  it creates a major obstacle to trump and congress  ongoing efforts to change or replace the law  in future elections  it could turn the gop s opposition to the law from an asset into a liability  more importantly in the daily lives of americans  it might mean that the most sweeping changes to the nation s healthcare system in decades will remain the law of the land for the foreseeable future  another poll from the kaiser family foundation discovered that although there was equal opposition and approval for obamacare    of americans were pleased that trumpcare failed because it was obviously far worse  the majority of americans     are now also holding trump and the gop responsible for the future of america s health care  and strongly believe trump should find a way to improve obamacare  not repeal it this information is sure to set trump on fire  considering how desperate he was to get rid of the bill as soon as he began his role as potus  given the fact that his ideas and agendas are more unpopular than ever  his presidency might be filled with obama s policies and laws for quite a while featured image via win mcnamee getty images
