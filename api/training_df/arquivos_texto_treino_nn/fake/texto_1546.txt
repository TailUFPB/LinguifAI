trump s emotionally unbalanced social media director and close friend dan scavino had what can only be described as a mental break and is now threatening to publish a video of the private concession call she placed to trump  and appears to have been answered by kellyanne conway  to do so would be not only a major ethical violation but would break with the long standing tradition of the winners showing an ounce of graciousness towards their opponents  trump and his team apparently have no qualms with stooping this low  if there is a point of indignity even they will not cross  they have yet to reach it scavino has long relished in his role as trump s nastiest bulldog  his position as white house social media director was handed to him  not due to experience or expertise but because he was trump s golf caddie  in a white house bursting with nepotism and corruption  scavino might be the least qualified person around   an impressive feat  he is also known for his viciousness and an unhinged streak of petty attacks on his or trump s perceived enemies follows wherever he goes  clinton  who won the popular vote by several million  still irritates trump and therefore she is an enemy scavino feels he needs to destroy for his part  scavino claims he is being trolled by hillary supporters  a notable coward  he couldn t take the heat and began melting down on social media   the irony of trump s social media director being unable to handle being on social media should not be lost on anyone  after posting this nonsensical  i m not mad  you re mad   tweet  scavino followed it up with the promise to release hillary s concession phone call love  alexbwall   team clinton trolling me  b c they have nothing else going on   all experts   gurus over there    that simply got owned  pic twitter com   dan scavino jr    danscavino  may    shot via  kellyannepolls cell phone  of huma s call at     months ago  i have on video   will share that in the near future  pic twitter com   dan scavino jr    danscavino  may    s hard to quantify the sheer level of petty vindictiveness going on in the white house  trump s team of enablers and yes men run from one squabble to the next  very little time appears to be spent on actual governance  with a lot of their energy being consumed with in fighting  bannon is fighting with jared kushner  kushner is fighting with priebus  kellyanne conway is missing  mcmasters is fighting with bannon  instead of leading by example  trump is off golfing or wandering around aimlessly with a copy of the election map under his arm  trump ran an experiment  what would happen if i filled the nation s highest office with the least reputable  most angry  insecure people in the country  the answer  this shitshow is exactly what happens the only goal of scavino releasing the private tape of trump and clinton s phone call is to personally humiliate hillary clinton  there is no political  social  or practical reason to do this  even by the admittedly low standards of restraint and goodwill on display by trump s white house  this is disgusting  sadly  with trump consumed by his efforts to smear sally yates  it appears unlikely that he will intervene and save his administration from yet another self inflicted blow to their own dignity i would say this is the foxes running the henhouse but it would be unfair to suggest foxes lack this amount of shame featured image via cnn
