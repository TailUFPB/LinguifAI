in the simplest of terms  one way to describe donald trump supporters would be to call them interesting  however  not interesting in a way where they have profound things to say and should be respected for all the things they do  but rather interesting in a way like when you visit a circus and wonder how so many clowns can fit into one car  that would  in fact  be interesting to find out catching up with a few of these interesting people was none other than jimmy kimmel s team on his late night show  he interviewed a number of them on the street in hollywood and told them that it s hillary clinton s birthday  he then asked if they could say at least one nice thing about her for her birthday  the replies were  let s just say  less than kind one woman said  i can t say anything positive  i d ask her if it s truly her birthday or if she s lying about that too  another guy said  happy birthday  hillary  i hope you get arrested  one woman did muster up the strength to compliment hillary s hair  but she wasn t happy about saying it it definitely seems like there s a lot of anger coming out of the trump campaign and their supporters  along with a lot of false information  here s hoping they will be able to find happiness in life even when hillary becomes president watch the segment and all their weird hatred towards hillary here featured image via video screen capture
