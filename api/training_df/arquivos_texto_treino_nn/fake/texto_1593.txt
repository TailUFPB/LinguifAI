republicans haven t read their own bill  aren t waiting around to see it independently scored  and seem to have only a limited interest in what the devastating effects may be  but they do know one thing  after they vote to strip an estimated  million people of health insurance and bankrupt countless more they plan to get hammered paul ryan once inexplicably boasted that he d been fantasizing about killing medicaid since he was  drinking at a keg  in college  now on the verge of destroying america s healthcare system more completely than fratboy ryan ever dared dream  he seems to be channeling that same impulse  although going on a booze bender hours after signing the literal death warrants for many americans tends to look pretty bad  which is why republicans tried to hide the beers under a sheet  it didn t work cases upon cases of beer just rolled into the capitol on a cart covered in a sheet  spotted bud light peeking out from the sheet  alexandra jaffe   ajjaffe  may    roman emperor nero had enough sense not to be seen pounding bud light while the city burned speaking of historically bad world leaders  the white house is said to be hosting a party for republicans to celebrate tonight beer being rolled into the capitol      lacaldwelldc reports that republicans will also head to white house for a congratulatory celebration https   t co   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  may    republicans were in an equally celebratory mood   and equally tasteless  while congressional aides trickled into the capitol building  someone started blasting the theme from  rocky    the fact that rocky actually doesn t win the fight at the end of the movie was lost on the republicans in the room  handshakes  smiles  and high fives were going around  the celebratory way in which republicans are treating this bill is in stark contrast to reality  the ahca will almost surely mean millions lose health insurance  those americans with so called  pre existing conditions  can expect to either completely lose their coverage or find it so expensive that they may have no choice but to go without  a brand new study found that the aca cut personal bankruptcies in the united states by half   that progress will be erased politically  the bill  likely represents suicide for many republicans  as statistician nate silver pointed out  obamacare was divisive and unpopular when it first passed  but this bill is really  really unpopular   orders of magnitude more so than the aca  and unlike the aca  the republican plan doesn t have the benefit of actually working once it s passed  people won t even be able to  grow to like it  because   as the cbo score on the initial bill found   the legislation is a dumpster fire all of this to say  drink up  republicans  something tells me your hangover is going to last a while featured image via eric thayer getty images
