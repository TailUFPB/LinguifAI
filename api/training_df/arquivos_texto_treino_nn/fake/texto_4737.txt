something big happened in texas  and hillary clinton is going to love it the dallas morning news  a highly conservative publication that has always supported republicans  made the shocking announcement they would not be endorsing republican presidential candidate donald trump  and instead threw their support behind democratic candidate hillary clinton here s why that s a big deal the paper  which made its endorsement wednesday morning  wrote that the decision was not easily reached  but acknowledged the significance this newspaper has not recommended a democrat for the nation s highest office since before world war ii   if you re counting  that s more than  years and nearly  elections  the party s over reliance on government and regulation to remedy the country s ills is at odds with our belief in private sector ingenuity and innovation  our values are more about individual liberty  free markets and a strong national defense we ve been critical of clinton s handling of certain issues in the past  but unlike donald trump  hillary clinton has experience in actual governance  a record of service and a willingness to delve into real policy the only other time the news neglected to endorse a republican was in  when barry goldwater ran   although they did not endorse lyndon b  johnson while the news was not head over heels for clinton  chiding her for her  dodgy  nature and  her willingness to shade the truth   the conclusion was made that her bipartisan approach to governing offered a stark contrast to trump s campaign of  exploiting base instincts of xenophobia  racism and misogyny  flying in the face of typical conservative speak  the news also shot down the ridiculous alt right conspiracy theories that she is treasonous and a murderer  avoiding the unnecessary gobbledygook that comes with republican talking points  they referred to these people as  political hyenas    the news finished with a straightforward appeal to its readers after nearly four decades in the public spotlight   of them on the national stage  clinton is a known quantity  for all her warts  she is the candidate more likely to keep our nation safe  to protect american ideals and to work across the aisle to uphold the vital domestic institutions that rely on a competent  experienced president hillary clinton has spent years in the trenches doing the hard work needed to prepare herself to lead our nation  in this race  at this time  she deserves your vote and just like that  a republican newspaper that never dared to endorse a democrat has endorsed arguably the most famous democratic feminist this country has ever seen  of course the readers were upset with the news  calling the editorial board  sellouts    pathetic    shameful   etc  some even accused dnc operatives of coercing or bribing the board to endorse clinton when republicans feel threatened  they pounce  and the irony is so rich   the same  political hyenas  the news espoused as crazy conspiracy theorists are now flocking to their website  accusing them of being dnc or clinton plants you ve got to love what the republicans have turned into  no wonder the news endorsed clinton  and the timing is great  a recent washington post surverymonkey poll has clinton winning texas by  point over donald trump while not a hillary clinton love fest  the paper did show amazing courage in standing up for what is right  putting country before politics featured image via mark makela getty images
