remember the house intelligence committee s investigation into the trump russia connection  and how chairman devin nunes compromised it by running to trump with documents he should have shown to his fellow committee members first  and how he then had to recuse himself from the investigation for all of that  it seems that those documents do  in fact  contain a bombshell  but it s not the one that trump insisted we d find house republicans and democrats have completed their review of those documents  and they demonstrate that nobody in the obama administration wiretapped trump at any time  nor did they do anything unusual  let alone illegal  with foreign surveillance  even the  scandal  that republicans tried to create around susan rice s request to unmask certain members of trump s campaign turned out to be a big ol  nothingburger one particular congressional source said that rice s requests were both normal and appropriate  and another said that there are  absolutely  no smoking guns present that demonstrate rice and obama did anything wrong  this vindicates rice s assertions that her requests were normal  there were occasions when i would receive a report in which a us person was referred to   name not provided  just a us person   and sometimes in that context  in order to understand the importance of the report  and assess its significance  it was necessary to find out  or request the information as to who the us official was the notion that some people are trying to suggest  is that by asking for the identity of a person is leaking it  is unequivocally false  there is no connection between unmasking and leaking  trump isn t going to like this  it makes him look like a bigger paranoid  narcissistic moron than ever over these tweets terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    it legal for a sitting president to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election  turned down by court earlier  a new low   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october  just prior to election   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    also said he felt  somewhat vindicated  by what was in those reports  but besides that  he thought this was going to be a yuuuuuuuuuuge story  when he was asked whether he thought rice acted illegally  he said   do i think  yes  i think  he also said  i think it s going to be the biggest story  it s such an important story for our country and the world  nunes looks like an idiot too  and now should probably resign his chairmanship  if trump says anything  expect him to double down on his accusations  he doesn t let anything go and he doesn t ever admit he s wrong featured image by alex wong via getty images
