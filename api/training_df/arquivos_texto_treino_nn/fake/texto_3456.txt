donald trump is vladimir putin s puppet  so of course he would defend russia instead of siding with american intelligence agencies  and that did not sit well with john mccain on friday  the cia released an assessment concluding that russia hacked into our election to help trump win  ever since then  trump and his team have been desperately defending russia and insisting that democrats made the whole thing up and that russia would never interfere in our democratic system during an appearance on fox news sunday  chris wallace asked trump about the russian hacking  trump responded by bragging about his victory and claimed that our intelligence agencies can t possibly know that russia hacked anything  i think it s ridiculous   trump said   i don t believe it  i don t know why and i think it s just   you know  they talked about all sorts of things  every week it s another excuse  we had a massive landslide victory as you know in the electoral college  hacking is very interesting   trump continued   once they hack  if you don t catch them in the act  you re not going to catch them  they have no idea if it s russia or china or somebody  it could be somebody sitting in a bed someplace  trump just demonstrated that he knows nothing about how technology works beyond how to use twitter  hacking leaves traces that experts can follow to identify the culprit  but instead of believing the experts  trump tried to pin everything on the democrats  i think the democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country   trump claimed   and frankly  i think they re putting it out  it s ridiculous  trump went on to lecture that the cia should blame other countries or individuals for the hack if they are going to report on what happened  but he couldn t end the interview without bragging again  we had   many people are saying   one of the great victories of all time  here s the video via youtube first of all  trump s  victory  is not even close to being one of greatest of all time  as it turns out  we keep the records of every presidential election and the records show that in the last  years alone  there are  elections in which a candidate did way better than trump  including president obama is  and   so it was not a  landslide  or a  mandate  like trump imagines second  trump is clearly denying the facts again  which is why senator john mccain delivered the hard truth on face the nation mccain said that he wants a bipartisan investigation by congress to confirm the cia assessment and he is totally bewildered by trump s defense of russia despite the evidence  i don t know what to make of it   mccain said of trump s claims   because it s clear the russians interfered  now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate  i think that s a subject of investigation  facts are stubborn things  they did hack into this campaign  here s the video via youtube featured image via screenshot
