it s no secret that russia was behind the election hacks of donald trump s political opponents with the express goal of getting donald trump elected as well as mobilizing a kremlin funded  troll army  to pose as trump supporters and spread propaganda on his behalf  but it s almost inconceivable that vladimir putin actually got his own hands dirty   or is it intelligence official now report that vladimir putin was not only aware of the attacks on our election  and more specifically  hillary clinton   but directly participated in them   and by  participated   we mean that he orchestrated the entire thing  nbc reports two senior officials with direct access to the information say new intelligence shows that putin personally directed how hacked material from democrats was leaked and otherwise used  the intelligence came from diplomatic sources and spies working for u s  allies  the officials said putin s objectives were multifaceted  a high level intelligence source told nbc news  what began as a  vendetta  against hillary clinton morphed into an effort to show corruption in american politics and to  split off key american allies by creating the image that  couldn t depend on the u s  to be a credible global leader anymore   the official said trump has repeatedly denied not only knowledge of the russian operation headed by a man he once said he wanted to be his  new best friend   but denied that they happened at all so here s where we stand  donald trump won the election thanks to the direct interference not only of russia but of vladimir putin himself   after trump personally asked russia to hack his enemies on national u s  television  since  winning   he has appointed numerous pro russia people who will likely cater to putin s whims  including one that a russian political commentator calls  a christmas gift  from trump to russia  or  of course  he could be called a  thank you gift  trump once said he could shoot someone in broad daylight and not lose a single supporter  on december   we learn whether or not he can hand our country over to the enemy and still manage to assume office  electors have a historically hard job   and this will be the truest test of their patriotism imaginable  will they stand up to trump  or will they drive the final nail in our country s coffin watch a cbs report on this newest  most terrifying information  below new  us intelligence sources confirm hacks could not have occurred without putin s blessing   jeffpeguescbs reports https   t co  pic twitter com   cbs news   cbsnews  december    image via getty images  justin sullivan ian walton
