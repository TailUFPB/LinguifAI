this is why no one should vote for a republican ever again  period donald trump becoming president would be one of the scariest times in our history  and that s because democracy itself would be shattered if conservatives like wayne allyn root have their way during an interview with radio host rob schilling on monday  root  who is often the opening speaker and master of ceremonies at trump rallies  openly called for stripping welfare and medicaid recipients of their right to vote and said women who get  free contraception  should be barred from voting as well so that republicans can win every election in this country by a landslide  so if the people who payed the taxes were the only ones allowed to vote  we d have landslide victories   root said   but you re allowing people to vote  this explains everything  people with conflict of interest shouldn t be allowed to vote  if you collect welfare  you have no right to vote  the day you get off welfare  you get your voting rights back  the reality is  why are you allowed to have this conflict of interest that you vote for the politician who wants to keep your welfare checks coming and your food stamps and your aid to dependent children and your free health care and your medicaid  your medicare and your social security and everything else social security should not  medicare should not  because you paid into the system  but all the other stuff  all the other goodies  free obama phones  free contraception  you know what  you can get them but you shouldn t be allowed to vote  it s a conflict of interest  take that away  we d win every single election in this country  here s the audio via right wing watch this is definitive proof that donald trump is too dangerous to be be president  and it is proof that conservatives are hell bent on taking away voting rights so they can gain absolute power but there s a big problem with root s plan  you see  root s idea is based on the premise that minorities and liberals make up most of the people who take federal aid in reality  republicans would be stripping their own constituents of the right to vote if they listen to root according to pew research  the states where the most americans are on welfare are red states  including  wisconsin  missouri  tennessee  texas  south carolina  north carolina  arizona  new mexico  louisiana  mississippi  georgia  alabama  maine  and arkansas  ohio  pennsylvania  and florida  which are considered battleground states but are also run by republicans  are also on this list and why are these states on this list  the answer is because republican economic policies like the one wayne allyn root supports  have swept more and more people into poverty  thus increasing the need for food assistance in other words  root s plan would have the opposite effect because it would keep many conservatives from voting in red states  which would devastate republican majorities in those state legislatures furthermore  as right wing watch points out  women don t actually get  free  birth control  the insurance companies are mandated to cover contraception in their health plans  in short  taxpayers are not paying for it  the women are paying for it every time they pay their premiums  one would think a businessman like root would understand that  but who ever said root was a competent businessman  after all  he s hanging out with donald trump  but the idea that we should strip women of their right to vote just because they get contraception is outrageous  and now we can add another reason why women should never vote for republicans in fact  the idea that we should strip any citizen in this nation of their right to vote is an affront to democracy and should by all rights lead to a landslide victory for hillary clinton in november in other words  it s time to vote like it could be the last time we ever get a chance to do so  because if republicans like root have their way  it will be featured image  ralph freso getty images
