the amount of in fighting that we ve seen in donald trump s administration is like nothing we ve ever seen before  there have been an unprecedented amount of leaks coming from inside the white house  and trump s top staffers routinely throw each other under the bus  proving that trump s  administration  is actually more like  the apprentice  than anything elsewhite house counselor kellyanne conway displayed this perfectly  when she recently argued that white house communication director anthony scaramucci was demoralized because he had to fill out financial disclosure forms before taking up his new position in trump s administration  those very disclosure forms were leaked this week  and scaramucci pretty much blamed white house chief of staff reince priebus for it  as expected  conway couldn t wait to get on fox   friends to make it even worse  trump s most abrasive mouthpiece said  the most important part of anthony s tweet is when he talked about the fbi and the doj  he s making clear that even though these documents are eventually procurable publicly that somebody doesn t want him here  and somebody is trying to get in his way and scare him off from working here  which is a huge mistake  conway complained that administration members like scaramucci have been completely demoralized and i think completely disinclined to do so based on the paperwork that we have to put forward  divesting assets  the different hoops you have to run through  because this white house is transparent and accountable and we all comply with those rules  conway continued to attack priebus  stating  there are leaks  and then there are people using the press to shiv each other in the ribs  that s different than a leak  a leak is   did you see the memo kellyanne put out on this matter  did you hear what jared said in the senior staff meeting   that s a classic leak  fox news host steve doocy stated that the  elephant in the room  was priebus  and whether or not he was  the big leaker   conway was more than happy to issue this ominous warning  leakers are easier to figure out than they may think  the west wing is a very small place  you can watch conway attack her fellow trump staffer below featured image via kevin hagen   getty images
