president donald trump may be known for his catchphrase of  you re fired   on the reality tv series the apprentice  but they don t seem to be the type of words he likes to utter in every day life  that s one of several reasons why trump left it to his former bodyguard  keith schiller  to deliver the news to newly ousted fbi directer james comey  so who is keith schiller schiller  one of the president s most trusted aides  has taken a step up in the world since trump s election victory  earning himself the title of director of oval office operations after almost two decades of watching trump s back  according to corey lewandowski  trump s former campaign manager   the president has exceptional confidence in keith  if he asks him to do something  he knows it will get done  schiller first encountered the trump clan when he was working as a new york city police detective and spotted marla maples  trump s second wife  in the manhattan prosecutor s office back in   schiller was there for a meeting with maples  who was reporting a theft by an employee  not long after he sat down  a man pulled up a seat and introduced himself to schiller as trump s current bodyguard  i looked at him  totally not impressed by his stature  physical stature   schiller recalled in  in a rare videotaped interview   a light goes off  i said   bodyguard  i can do this        i m no stranger to putting my hands on people  his mind was made up and schiller reached out to trump  landing a part time position as a bodyguard  after retiring from the police department in   schiller began working for trump full time  now as the trump organization s director of security  a role which involved following trump on the road during his campaign trail from that point  even providing an extra layer of security after the secret service took over schiller rarely gives interviews  but that hasn t stopped those around him from doing so and michael caputo  a political adviser who worked with trump between  and   probably summed up best what schiller means to the trump organization   keith schiller is not just some bodyguard   says caputo   nobody knows the score among the advisers better than keith schiller         keith s always known what s what among the people who are in donald trump s orbit  never was that level of trust on clearer display than in april when trump s son in law  jared kushner  traveled to iraq  despite the fact that iraq specialist that would usually be present didn t participate after being told there was no room for them on the plane  schiller was given a seat at the table during talks with members of the iraqi government and appeared in official group photographs during the trip before becoming a member of trump s elite inner circle  schiller was renowned among his nypd colleagues for his size and strength   he was strong as an ox   said david chong  who served as schiller s boss for eight years on a new york city police task force on high intensity drug trafficking areas  in fact  on some raids  chong claims that schiller would volunteer to carry the  pound battering ram  anticipating breaking in the door when he reached the top of the stairs schiller was also trump s right hand man during a wwe event  stepping briefly into the spotlight after trump  slapped  world wrestling entertainment chief vince mcmahon in the center of the ring  as part of the bit  mcmahon charged trump  only to be stopped and repeatedly pushed back by schiller before finally getting thrown to the ground by donald trump s head goon naturally  anyone associated with the trump organization isn t going to be without their controversies and keith schiller has more than his fair share  for example  in september  during trump s campaign  schiller took a sign from a protester  unexpectedly  the protester  efrain galicia  lunged at schiller but only received a punch in the face for his efforts  however  galicia and other protesters are currently attempting to sue  during his testimony  schiller acknowledged that at the time of the incident  he did not hold a valid new york state security guard license  on another occasion several days earlier  schiller forcefully removed univision anchor jorge ramos from a trump campaign news conference for repeatedly asking questions about immigration all things considered  it comes as no surprise that donald trump didn t fire the towering james comey himself on tuesday  opting for keith schiller over even a more junior staffer  why would he when he has this type of hired muscle sitting at a desk a few feet away featured image by drew angerer getty images
