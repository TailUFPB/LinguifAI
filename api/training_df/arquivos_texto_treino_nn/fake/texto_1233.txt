at the very beginning of may  trump s department of justice issued an opinion that opened the door for all government agencies to withhold information from congressional democrats  even if those democrats are the ranking members of their respective committees  the opinion was written in such a way that trump and the doj can say   this will apply to regardless of parties   but that will just be an excuse it says  in part  individual members of congress  including ranking minority members  do not have the authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house  committee  or subcommittee  they don t  according to acting assistant attorney general curtis gannon  they don t  his opinion on the matter went on to say  they may request information from the executive branch  which may respond at its discretion  but such requests do not trigger any obligation to accommodate congressional needs and are not legally enforceable through a subpoena or contempt proceedings  wow  they can t even subpoena certain information unless their committee chair does  this is unprecedented  and it s disgusting the problem is that the committees are all chaired by republicans right now  so agencies are required to give info to republicans  but not to democrats  the ranking democrats on congressional committees will have to get their chairpersons to request information because of that  both republicans and democrats believe this will prevent congress from carrying out its duties under the constitution rob portman  r ohio  said that  when he headed the office of management and budget under w   he felt it was his responsibility to provide information to whichever member of congress asked him for it  however  some of trump s nominees are refusing to do so even though they re being pressed on that in their confirmation hearings  claire mccaskill  d missouri  got angry at trump s nominee for the omb  who refused to answer that question elijah cummings  d maryland  said   this is not what democracy looks like  trump can t stand opposition  that s part of what makes him so dangerous to this country  he can t stand opposition and he can t stand criticism  he can t stand people doing their jobs correctly when those jobs involve doing things he doesn t like  if democrats are able to get information just by asking for it  then trump has less control over what happens to it congress is already under sustained fire for how little they work and how much time they spend outside of washington  and trump s doj just made that even worse  one has to wonder if this is his first step in gaining absolute control over the legislative branch featured image via win mcnamee getty images
