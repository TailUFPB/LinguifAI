donald trump s reaction to the london terrorist attack could not have been more disgraceful  not only did he use the incident to promote his extremely unconstitutional muslim ban  but he trashed the london mayor and completely failed to send a message of solidarity or hope thank goodness we still have hillary clinton  the overqualified democratic presidential candidate who won the popular vote by millions  despite losing the election to an undeserving orange man baby  clinton has not abandoned americans or the world  and continues to act far more presidential than the current moron we have in the white house clinton also responded to the london attack  and it was a sharp reminder that we elected the wrong candidate  in her response on twitter  clinton showed everyone just how an american president should act  and just how much trump falls short  she tweeted  after acts of unspeakable cruelty and cowardice  the people of london and the uk choose resolve over fear  your friends in the us stand with you  trump s message was divisive  while clinton sent out a call for unity and peace  at a time when trump currently has a historically low   approval rating  it appears that america is admitting that the wrong person is in the white house this amazing message from clinton is hardly surprising  during trump s abrasive presidential campaign  in which he attacked her nonstop for months  clinton always remained classy  dignified  and focused on the job ahead  she was always there for the american people  and truly believed in the values this country was built on this tweet should be burned into the minds of every american when it comes time to vote in  and   america cannot afford to keep trump in office  or to have another imbecile like him leading the country featured image is a screenshot
