that didn t take long one of trump s oldest campaign backers was hooked up with a job he was blatantly not qualified for and seemingly had no interest in  just two months later  he has already been fired for being a racist nutjob  trump only hires  the best  according to reports first covered by buzzfeed  trump s associate sid bowdidge worked as a massage therapist before riding trump s coattails to a gig at the department of energy according to two employees at the nuclear weapons agency  who asked to remain anonymous  sid bowdidge    began working at the department following president trump s inauguration  an internal department database identified the new hampshire trump campaign worker as  assistant to the secretary   a nebulous title given to political appointees at varied levels of responsibility the move from back rubs to working on nuclear weapons policy was already a scandal  but bowdidge refused to lie low  on his social media accounts  the man had routinely posted about desiring to see all muslims  exterminated  bowdidge is among a growing list of people who got cushy government jobs based on their loyalty to donald trump and not to their qualifications or temperment  many of trump s appointees   even for positions of extreme national importance   were unvetted  in the worst example  trump s national security advisor was actively working as a  foreign agent  of the turkish government at the time he was hired  at various times trump has claimed he knew about it and was totally cool with it and that he didn t know about it  it s not clear which is worse  to be corrupt or incompetent and trump may very well be both an honest and competent administration  for instance  would have seen bowdidge s insane tweets and immediately disqualified him  trump hired him without even checking bowdidge also illustrates the caliber of person attracted to trump  since   he has been one of trump s fiercest supporters  even going on television to defend the former reality tv star from republican and democratic opposition  from his tweets  bowdidge is a xenophobe who believes that president obama was a secret muslim again and again people in trump s orbit are exposed as similarly vile and pathetic  he has been endorsed by kkk leader david duke and is beloved by white nationalist website breitbart  several of his most prominent advisors are birthers  his former campaign manager resigned after covering up his ties to russia  he lost his nominee for communications director to an infidelity scandal  he lost one of his campaign surrogates to the exact same infidelity scandal it s difficult to put into words just how unqualified this administration is  it s rotten to the very core  or as msnbc s chris hayes summed up this particularly sad twist just to recap  the trump admin hired   placed in doe a person w   no relevant experience   who called for all muslims to be exterminated  christopher hayes   chrislhayes  march    image via facebook new york daily news
