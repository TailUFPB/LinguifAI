just last year before the  presidential election  conservative radio host and former colorado republican chairman steve curtis said  it seems to me that virtually every case of voter fraud i can remember in my lifetime was committed by democrats  the state s prosecutors on tuesday accused curtis    of voter fraud for allegedly filling out and mailing in his ex wife s  ballot for president  kdvr reports curtis has been charged with one count of misdemeanor voter fraud and one count of forgery the washington post reports the case is the only voter fraud investigation related to the  election that has resulted in criminal charges in the state  the colorado secretary of state s office told denver s abc affiliate curtis has not entered a plea  if convicted  he could face more than a year of prison time and a    fine watch  his ex wife  kelly curtis  said  i was livid over the whole situation  definitely  curtis said that she left her husband after being married for just nine months  i didn t feel it was an equal partnership  i ll just leave it at that   she said  it was demeaning and presumptuous  and i had no idea what would go on in someone s mind to cast my ballot for me illegally  actually to go to all the trouble to forge my ballot   ms  curtis said the forgery was discovered by weld county prosecutors when kelly curtis called the county s elections office in october to ask how she could vote because she had just moved to south carolina and explained that she was still registered to vote in colorado  kelly was told by an election worker that she had already voted by mail and the elections office already had her ballot  i was just completely stunned  i thought there had to be some kind of mistake   kelly curtis said in   steve curtis oversaw the advisory board for the denver tea party patriots while on the campaign trail  donald trump alleged that the election would be  rigged  and claimed that there was widespread voter fraud  without offering evidence   just as with his recent wiretap claims   trump said after the election that between  to  million votes were cast illegally  trump said that to prove that he really won the popular vote  he did not win the popular vote  following the election  it was found that the few who were charged with voter fraud  were in fact  republican voters as for steve curtis  he certainly excels at projection image via screen capture
