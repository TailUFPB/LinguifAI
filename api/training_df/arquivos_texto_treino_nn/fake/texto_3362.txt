fox news banshee jeanine pirro threw a hissy fit this weekend because first lady michelle obama correctly stated how most people feel since donald trump became president elect on friday  mrs  obama sat down for her final interview as first lady with oprah winfrey and expressed what millions of americans are feeling right now as president obama enter the last month of his presidency  we feel the difference now   she said   see  now  we are feeling what not having hope feels like  hope is necessary  it s a necessary concept and barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes  indeed  the only ones who didn t feel hope in  were conservatives who vowed from day one to sabotage president obama at every turn  hurling racism and hate every step of the way for the last eight years  but even more americans are going to sorely miss him and the optimism he brought to the office  donald trump  however  is no barack obama  as trump continues to hire people who hate the department they have been picked to head and picks fights with foreign nations and is poised to dismantle every program that made this country great already  millions of americans are horrified and living in fear of what this nation is about to become of course  pirro had a problem with michelle obama telling the truth  so she lashed out at her for five minutes by blaming her for everything from beheadings in the middle east to protests against police basically  pirro bitched about michelle obama in every little way and acted like a petulant child  to try and convince america that once you and barack exit the white house  hope is removed for america is an outrage   pirro whined   but i get it  for you hope is gone  you and your family and friends won t be able to fly to another  countries  with security and hair and make up in tow  michelle  you may not realize it  but americans  rejected you and everything you stand for  hope is when people     at a time   stand in line in the cold with their children hoping to get a glimpse of a man they think can change the course of their lives from the downward spiral that you and  mister hope and change  have put them on  here s the video via youtube of course  americans did not  reject  the obamas in this election at all  in fact  obama s approval rating is higher than trump s and millions would have preferred voting for him a third time  also  russia helped trump steal the election and hillary clinton won the popular vote by nearly three million votes  most americans also fear a trump presidency  someone should explain to pirro that fear is the opposite of hope as someone who claims to support women s rights  one would think pirro would also be concerned about trump being in the white house considering the way he has treated women over the years  pirro is also pro choice  which goes against republicans who currently aim to eliminate roe v  wade in the next four years  so women across the country have every reason and right to be losing hope since their freedom could be seriously restricted  but apparently  pirro forgot about women and the plight they are about to face once again  pirro is demonstrating that she s a racist bitch who hates successful women for speaking their minds and telling the truth featured image  screenshot
