if there s one thing donald trump wants  it s positive press about himself and everything that he is doing  clearly knowing that his new travel ban executive order wasn t going to shine him in the best light  or he was simply afraid of reporters asking him questions he d be forced to give an answer to  trump didn t allow the press into the oval office for the signing  the white house did  however  offer a photo of the signing  but cnn refuses to show it cnn s john king explains why they won t show the image of trump holding the executive order  we won t show you the picture of the president signing the executive order that s incredibly important to his administration  it s a very important policy debate in our country   we will not show you the picture because we have a policy that you cannot have canned press release pictures from a white house  you have to let the reporters in  the president is a big boy  he doesn t have to answer questions if they re shouted at him  but they wouldn t let anyone in because of the other issue  that is the president saying he believes his predecessor someone wire tapped him during last year s campaign  hopefully  all news media outlets do the same trump will undoubtedly be upset by this  but honestly   too bad  he needs to own what he s doing  answer questions about it  and be an actual leader  not the elusive dictator he s appearing to become more and more each day watch here featured photo by aude guerrucci pool getty images   ht raw story
