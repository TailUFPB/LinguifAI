what would you do if someone kept track of everything you ever said  most of us aren t in a position to have their every utterance monitored  but if we were  we might actually  you know  watch what we said  especially if we knew that the people keeping track were specifically looking for lies  backtracking  flip flopping  and repetition of all of the above as soon as someone runs for president  however  they have to know that at the very least the media will be tracking their statements  which means two things  donald trump doesn t give a shit about telling the truth  and he knows that his supporters will always think he s telling the truth  no matter how ridiculous his statements are that s the only conclusion i can draw from tuesday s washington post article  in which the running tally of lies has now surpassed a thousand in these first seven months of trump s presidency many of trump s prevarications can be chalked up to repeating debunked claims   the logic  of course  being that even if the president didn t know a thing wasn t true the first time he said it  if it s completely debunked and he repeats it  he s lying  and lying in and of itself speaks volumes to donald trump s character  but the kinds of lies he tells almost say more about who he is than the simple fact that he tells them take for example his many claims of accomplishments  the long and short of it is  he has none  when he touts the economy or jobs or the stock market  not only is he claiming responsibility for things that have nothing to do with his policies  but he s flip flopping on his prior opinions that those things were in a  bubble  under the last president  when he says he s  bringing back jobs   he often cites wal mart  or ford  or exxonmobil  among others   all companies whose plans for expansion predate trump s inauguration some of the lies are more nefarious in nature  it is well documented that there is no evidence of voter fraud or widespread voting by undocumented immigrants  yet he continues to make the claim  it is indisputably untrue that hillary clinton was in any way responsible for a uranium extraction deal with russia that gave the hostile country a significant stake in us rights  why is it untrue  because hillary clinton has never been president  why donald trump or his supporters are stupid enough to think a cabinet member can unilaterally negotiate with a foreign country over us interests is baffling  does trump think rex tillerson has the power to sell our oil drilling rights to russia without his approval the article puts the current number of trump s lies at    notwithstanding any tweets from today  of course  in  days    lies is an average of   lies per day  by this time next year  if his average holds  trump will have lied to america nearly three thousand times but will his supporters care featured image via joe raedle getty images
