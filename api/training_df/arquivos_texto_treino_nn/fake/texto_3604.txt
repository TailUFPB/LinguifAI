donald trump has always shown himself to be impulsive when it comes to his use of technology  he often tweets in the middle of the night  goes on long rants that make no sense  and generally makes an absolute ass of himself in front of the whole world via his twitter account  however  we can block trump from our twitters  once he becomes president  though  we will not be able to block him from our phones you see  this president  and every president thereafter  will be using the same service that sends us severe weather alerts to text everyone in the nation with a cell phone  there s one person who has a platform and is not at all happy about this development  considering what we know about trump   late show host stephen colbert during his thursday night monologue  colbert addressed this grim new reality  he began  here s the deal   you legally don t have to have to follow his tweets  you can un follow trump  delete twitter  go into the world  live your life  but the bad news is  starting january   donald trump can send unblockable mass text messages to the entire nation  the only person i would trust less with that technology is  anthony weiner   yes  feel free to block alerts about floods and missing persons  but if trump wants you to know how he feels about the cast of  hamilton   you will listen  now  it s important to remember that this can only be done via wireless emergency alerts  weas   and they must be approved first  however  given trump s authoritarian tendencies  i m pretty sure whatever safeguards are in place to keep him from blowing up  million phones whenever he feels like it will be decimated in short order  in short  colbert is right   this is bad news watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
