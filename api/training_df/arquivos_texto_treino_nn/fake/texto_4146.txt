several weeks ago  polls and pundits were spelling doom and gloom for hillary clinton  why  support among millennial voters   the biggest voting bloc in the country   were dwindling for the democrat nominee  and were instead attracted to third party candidates gary johnson and jill stein two polls  released within days of each other  showed over a third of millennials backing a third party candidate  severely cutting into clinton s chances of winning over the obama coalition but as the race comes to a close  millennials are finally seeing the big picture  do we elect and accomplished  qualified politico or a racist  sexual predator  luckily  millennials have chosen the former over the latter a new poll just released by usa today   rock the vote  with the help of ipsos  found that hillary clinton holds a  point lead over donald trump when it comes to millennial voters   percent to  percent  johnson nabbed  percent and stein a dismal  percent almost  in  young people now support clinton  to put that into context  president obama won the youth vote with  percent support in   and  percent in   that means that clinton is on track  just barely  to ushering in a historical and unprecedented win among young voters which would propel her to the white house a study conducted by the center for research and information on civic learning and engagement at tufts university found that  when it came to the  election  the youth vote was the decisive factor in who won  the study found that because millennial voters came out in droves to support obama  at least  electoral votes were awarded  all from key swing states   pennsylvania  ohio  florida and virginia  coincidentally  all those states are considered swing states in the  election  with the exception of virginia  if  percent of just half of the millennial population votes for hillary clinton on november   she wins  hands down  and that s not even taking into consideration her gains among white  college educated women and men  who typically vote republican   that s also not taking into consideration her gains made with asian americans and cuban americans clinton has the numbers to win  she has made gains all across the board  and trump is under performing mitt romney in crucial swing states  with typical gop voters  and with those who typically don t vote gop  the only thing that can hold clinton back is democrats not showing up to vote  especially young people this is why this year s get out the vote will be detrimental to results in the coming weeks  with early voting underway  in record numbers   democrats have a real opportunity to start off on strong footing and cruise into the november general election featured image via ethan miller getty images
