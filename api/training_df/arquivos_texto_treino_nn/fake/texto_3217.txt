if it weren t for the electoral college  we would soon be inaugurating president hillary clinton  if it weren t for the inaugural college  we would likely never have had a president george w  bush and all the disasters that followed  no wonder republicans love the electoral college  they haven t won the popular vote for the presidency since   it s also no wonder they want to abolish the popular vote in an oped in the conservative blog  the reason  writer eric boehm argued that only the electors should vote and no one else it s difficult not to agree with some of the argument  boehm suggests that the founding fathers didn t trust americans to think for themselves  and there is some truth to that and they were right  to an extent  in their days  literacy was not for the common man and today  well  we fall for fake news yes  get rid of the popular vote  for all the money  time  and attention paid to the presidential race  the actual votes cast on election day are basically meaningless  in non swing states  votes are literally meaningless  even in states where a small number of votes could change the outcome of the election  your vote and mine are still so insignificant as to be practically worthless  as reason editor in chief katherine mangu ward explained in detail in  the only reason to hold popular votes for president  as the system functions now  is to select the  electors  from each state who will participate in the electoral college here s a better way  hold a national lottery to determine the  electors  drawing an appropriate number from the voter rolls of each state  and then let those people choose the president source  reasonaccording to boehm  this would ensure that people who actually care about the election would be the ones voting  it would also free the rest of us up to do whatever we want to be doing  or whatever we need to do to keeps our lives on track while it might be appealing to take the masses out of the equation  boehm s solution does absolutely nothing to solve the problems created by the electoral college  a vote in wyoming  for example  is worth four times what a vote in california is worth  in other words  the electoral college isn t even representative  let alone democratic the other huge problem with the electoral college is that it s designed to keep white people and people in power in power  it s also designed to suppress the vote and it leaves women and minorities without a voice at all obviously  i can t know what boehm s motives are  but it s clear that the motives of the republican party are to keep minorities from voting  wherever they can  the demographics in this country are changing quickly  if it weren t for the electoral college  it s doubtful we d ever have another republican president  at least unless they dramatically change their platform  as for the lottery he proposes  well  who s to guarantee the lottery would choose engaged voters  we d still have uninformed voters  just a lot fewer of them featured image via sarah rice getty images
