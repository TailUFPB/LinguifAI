trump has repeatedly said that all the ways he avoided paying taxes was legal  and has even shown his ignorance about how our government works to paint hillary as incompetent because she didn t single handedly change these laws during her time in the senate  however  while he was busy avoiding taxes in the   his own lawyers warned him against doing  well  exactly what he did a new report in the new york times explains that  order to avoid total financial ruin  trump didn t report hundreds of millions that was technically income  he didn t just not report it  though   the irs would have seen through that immediately  instead  his first step to avoiding taxes was successfully pushing his various bondholders to cancel the hundreds of millions he owed them to the irs  a dollar of canceled debt is a dollar of taxable income  that could have crippled the self proclaimed master of debt and taxes about as badly as all that debt he couldn t pay  so what did he do  he used what s called a  stock for debt  swap maneuver except congress banned that practice for corporations in   however  trump s real estate holdings in atlantic city the ones that were all in trouble weren t corporations  they were partnerships  so he thought he could still swap what s called  partnership equity  for his debt apparently  this works even if the stocks  or  in trump s case  the equities  are worth considerably less than the canceled debt  the times says that this is as close as anyone can get to making taxes just magically disappear but legally  this is fraught with its own problems and trump s own lawyers actually warned him against doing it  he asked his tax attorneys for formal opinion letters on his plan  which all came back saying  the letters bluntly warned that there was no statute  regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted mr  trump s tax gambit   due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority   his lawyers wrote   substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan   in other words  they felt that his scheme wouldn t stand up to irs scrutiny  we don t know if the irs went after him for this because nobody has the whole story  however  from what we do have  tax expert and former chief tax council for the house ways and means committee  john l  buckley  was able to say  he s getting something for absolutely nothing  buckley also said  he deducted somebody else s losses  he is double dipping big time  buckley means that the only people who should have been able to deduct those losses were the bondholders who canceled his debts  and thus  lost out on their investments this could be one of the bombshells he s hiding in his tax returns  since all of this involved partnerships  profits could go straight to his personal returns  as could other items  with trump refusing to release those  though  we don t know just how badly he stretched the law  if not broke it altogether this scheme quite possibly laid the groundwork for his massive   million loss in   which may have allowed him to avoid paying taxes again for  years  in other words  not only has he possibly sailed along while americans who earn an honest day s pay for an honest day s work dutifully paid their taxes  but he very likely broke the law in all his machinations here in a way that the regular americans he claims to understand would never get away with  hell  we wouldn t even know where to start  most likely  oddly enough  using partnership equity swaps to avoid taxes was banned by congress in   among the senators who voted to close that loophole was hillary clinton featured image by brian blanco via getty images
