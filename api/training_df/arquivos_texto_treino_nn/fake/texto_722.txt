while the gop congress has mostly fallen right in line behind their dear orange leader  there are some signs that the veneer of support is beginning to crack  on thursday  congress sent donald trump a near unanimous bill that will test trump s patriotism and his allegiance to russia the bill would increase sanctions against iran  north korea and russia  it would also prevent trump from easing current sanctions against russia  in the senate  only bernie sanders and rand paul voted against the bill  sanders said it could interfere with the iran nuclear agreement   the house s bill passed by a vote of  to   in other words  even if trump vetoes the bill  congress will easily override it under the bill  the president is required to notify congress before making any alterations to russia sanctions policy  and lawmakers then have  days in which they can block the president from implementing those changes  the procedure  known as  congressional review   is the most sweeping authority congress has given itself to check the president on sanctions policy in decades such matters have traditionally been left to the executive branch once congress authorizes the sanctions at the administration s disposal  even in the case of mandatory sanctions  congress usually steers clear of the president on matters of national security if trump does veto the bill  that s a tacit admission that yes  he is a putin puppet  if he doesn t  it s a signal to russia that trump is no longer living up to the bargain  there is no winning on this one while white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said she doesn t know whether trump will sign the bill  trump s new communications director  anthony scaramucci  hinted that trump might veto the bill  but only to  negotiate an even tougher deal against the russians   if you believe that  i have some trump university diplomas for sale this is an interesting trap  it shows that congress  at least most of them  doesn t trust trump with national security  if that s not an admission of guilt on the part of the republican party  i don t know what is  now if only they would publicly admit that they are worried about the future of this country featured image via alex wong getty images
