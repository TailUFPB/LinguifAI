the washington post  after being repeatedly dragged through the mud at the  tiny  hands of donald trump  not to mention also being labeled  fake news   has decided it owes trump an apology  they ve  sarcastically  conceded that the press has been mean and has hurt trump s feelings  and that they ve even lied through their teeth  and they ve published the  true  unbiased  version of trump s inauguration that he no doubt sincerely believes we should all heed and it s amazing  it s hilarious  its sarcasm is over the top  as it should be because trump s overinflated opinion of himself is over the top  if it wasn t  he wouldn t have told the cia   wait a minute  i made a speech  i looked out  the field was   it looked like a million  million and a half people  the post s story addresses all of this and more with hilarious abandon  written by alexandra petri  it starts off with an abject apology  i apologize to donald trump  as sean spicer so wisely said at his first news conference on monday  it was the first  the one that happened on saturday did not happen at all  and i recognize that    it is unfair to be so mean and negative all the time here is the fair and unbiased story about the inauguration written in compliance with the trump style guidelines that we should have been obeying all along  she also  reports  on the  apology  that all the media gave to trump  which touches on his childish temper tantrums  his inability to let even the tiniest of slights go  and sean spicer s whining that the press hurts trump s feelings the media was there  too  and they were very sorry   donald   the newscasters said   we were mean to you  we used to laugh and call you names  we were no better than all of the other reindeer  how can you ever forgive us  forgive you   donald trump asked   i ve already forgotten   he smiled a big  beautiful smile and she says   nothing that has ever happened or will ever happen was as great as donald trump s inauguration  truth  not  but trump doesn t know that  in his mind  he can do no wrong  his accomplishments are great and many  his failures and faults don t exist  and the press is very  very wrong to not focus on his great accomplishments  he s a legend in his own mind trump  we should all remember  has the best speeches  the best words  the best everything  and petri highlights his incessant  exaggerated bragging with this  everyone liked donald trump s speech and the words that he used  they liked even more the part where he rolled up his sleeve and showed off his bicep  it was a great bicep  it made the rock so upset to see it that he threw something down on the ground and said  darn  however  the true zingers start when petri talks about how trump walked through the crowd  he didn t   touching everyone  in a way that they all thought was welcome and appropriate    ha   and curing diseases  kind of like jesus  so nobody would ever need vaccines again  she then points out a piece of trump s agenda in this gem of sarcasm  it was like the oscars  but also like woodstock  but also like the super bowl  but also like the sermon on the mount  if you were not there  you should just go home and die  because nothing in your life will have purpose or meaning by comparison  not even holding your newborn child in your arms or having health insurance   and finally  she closes with the biggest zinger of all  donald trump is the star  people love him he won the popular vote  too   considering he plans on wasting taxpayer dollars with an investigation to prove he won the popular vote  that s the best of all of them  maybe trump will notice this story  but not its sarcasm  and make an even bigger fool of himself on this featured image by drew angerer via getty images
