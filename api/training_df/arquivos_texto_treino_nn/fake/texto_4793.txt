donald trump likes to brag occasionally that he runs a very frugal campaign  supporters have said this is proof that he ll run a very frugal country  too  how is it that he regularly only spends a fraction of what hillary spends on her campaign  a large part of it is that he doesn t pay his many of his staffers   not even his top ten staffers that s not frugal  that s cheap kellyanne conway  who became trump s campaign manager after paul manafort left  hasn t been paid for her work in july  according to fec filings  paul manafort wasn t paid for his work  michael caputo  trump s former communications director  hasn t been paid  while a legal scholar says that it s unusual for a campaign to have volunteers at such high levels  caputo says he was not a volunteer  sometimes  people at high levels will opt to be unpaid  such as john podesta  who is working on hillary clinton s campaign but caputo wasn t among staffers who may have done that  he just hasn t been paid people at these levels usually draw a six figure salary  so what is up with this  contrary to trump supporters  claims  this is not a good thing  this does not demonstrate that trump will be the fiscal conservative they re praying for  this shows a man who s unwilling to pay people for legitimate work  people really think he s going to fight to bring the good paying jobs back  ha  not bloody likely  not if he won t even take care of his own staff he s become a typical greedy businessman in that regard  to cut costs  hurt the people you depend on to keep your organization running  hey  they re only people  and some people matter while others don t  if their stations are lower  they clearly don t matter of course  this is in addition to the gag orders that trump makes people sign  promising not to say mean things about him upon leaving the campaign  trump will surely treat everyone better once he s elected  though  right  right  all he wants is to  make america great again  or turn america into a cesspool  and then tell us that we ll call it great again and like it campaigns will generally rely on volunteers for low level work  such as working phone banks and knocking on doors  mailing fliers  things of that nature  it s one thing if all of these staffers likewise agreed to be volunteers  but chances are at least some didn t  considering that caputo didn t  that s disgraceful featured image via ralph freso getty images
