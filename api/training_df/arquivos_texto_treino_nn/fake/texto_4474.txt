if you tuned into the first presidential debate last night  you already know that hillary clinton pretty much wiped the floor with donald trump  trump was so nervous and unprepared that he was reduced to constant sniffling  excessive thirstiness and his usual outlandish rants and interruptions  let s just say that everyone noticed trump couldn t take the heat  and he definitely cannot handle the humiliation that is following the debate  while several major media outlets are calling the debate a clear win for clinton  trump is trying to come up with reasons why he bombed so horribly  even though it was perfectly obvious that he would  the best excuse trump has been able to come up with is beyond pathetic and nothing but a move of desperation  the associated press has reported that after the debate  the gop nominee immediately told reporters that he was unable to perform to the best of his ability because there was something wrong with his microphone  and yet despite something being  wrong with it   that mic seemed to work fine as he shouted over hillary every few seconds  ap reported  trump visited the media spin room after the monday night debate and said   they gave me a defective mic  he said he  wonder s   was that on purpose  cbs s sopan deb also happened to be there and gave a little more detail into trump s microphone conspiracy theory twittertrump is seriously trying to claim that someone tried to sabotage the debate on purpose  what a moron  the truth is that trump didn t prepare for the debate like clinton did   and even if he had spent a little more time preparing than tweeting  it wouldn t have mattered much   he s completely unqualified for the white house  last night  hillary showed america that these two shouldn t even be up against each other  there is no comparison  hillary looked like our next president  and trump looked like a fraud and an imposter who should have never made it up on that stage i wouldn t be surprised if trump comes up with more lame stories about why his performance was compromised last night featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
