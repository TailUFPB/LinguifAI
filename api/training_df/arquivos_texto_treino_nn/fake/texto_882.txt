donald trump s tweeting is a source of endless nightmares for republicans and white house staff  they can try to sugarcoat anything trump does  but it s hard to put a positive spin on the ramblings of a clearly troubled man  a typical trump tweet shot off in the early morning may  say  contradict an official statement  or prove a white house talking point is a lie  or contain basic grammar and spelling mistakes  and some have even been used in court to rule against the white house s attempted muslim ban adding to that  trump s tweets are a visual  daily reminder that our president is  at his heart  a complete moron  take this classic two piece of idiocy  for example first trump proudly announces he plans on creating a cyber team with the country that hacked america s last presidential election putin   i discussed forming an impenetrable cyber security unit so that election hacking    many other negative things  will be guarded    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    later  he screams that it isn t happening after americans of all political stripes pointed out how stupid the idea was the fact that president putin and i discussed a cyber security unit doesn t mean i think it can happen  it can t but a ceasefire can   did   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    staff has privately told reporters that they spend a great deal of their time at the white house trying to find ways to get trump to stop binge watching fox news and tweeting about whatever comes up on his favorite show  fox and friends  the struggle has  at times  descended into sheer lunacy   during one of trump s latest twitter meltdowns  a despondent aide sent a reporter a simple message informed of the president s denial that he had recorded his conversations with comey  a senior administration official replied   at least that s behind us   when alerted to his apparent suspicions of oval office surveillance  the official replied in a text message   fml  what does trump think about these attempts to save him from himself  it makes him angry new york times reporter mark leibovich filed a lengthy piece with a simple premise  the white house is a total and unending shitshow and trump is at the epicenter  leibovich was  in fact  in the room  when the idea of trump s twitter self sabotage was brought up to the president  trump s reaction speaks volumes it was    but the president was not eating lunch  he was watching a recording of  fox and friends  from about four hours earlier on a large tv mounted on the wall  this was one of those stretches when trump was tweeting a lot  including attacks on the mayor of london following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend  the tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among republicans  many of whom were urging him to stop  but like most reporters  i found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the white house press office could ever disgorge  i urged him to keep it up trump assured me that he would keep tweeting   it s my voice   trump said of twitter  enumerating how many millions of followers he had   they want to take away my voice   trump said   they re not going to take away my social media  in just two paragraphs  leibovich documented trump s insane fox news viewing habits  the well known patent dishonesty of the white house press office  and trump s own spoiled brat way of looking at his twitter habits  it takes stephen king an entire novel to write anything half as scary as that snapshot of the man who currently controls america s nuclear arsenal featured image via matt cardy getty images
