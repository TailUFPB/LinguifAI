donald trump is the ultimate hypocrite and fox host chris wallace called him out for it on sunday during the campaign  trump repeatedly bashed positive monthly jobs reports by claiming that they were somehow being faked by president obama to make it appear that the economy was improving under his watch  trump dismissed the low unemployment rate as well  claiming that he  heard  that it was much higher  as high as  percent  which is an outrageous lie chris wallace played footage of this while interviewing trump s chief economic adviser and former goldman sachs executive  you know  the same goldman sachs that donald trump repeatedly vilified during the campaign because of hillary clinton s ties to them anyway  wallace pointed out that while trump is touting the recent february jobs report that shows the economy added   jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from   to   percent  he is clearly being a hypocrite because he called previous jobs reports  phony  if that s true  why should we believe these numbers   wallace demanded to know before noting that trump inherited a strengthening economy from the obama administration   and the fact is  did you inherit an economy that has been for the last  months somewhere between   and  percent unemployment  of course  rather than admit that trump is full of shit  cohn ignored the question and made it sound like trump is an economic hero  the economy continues to grow and we are doing out part  cohn said before claiming that ceos are telling trump that they are adding jobs because of him  we are creating these jobs because of you  mr  president  and your policies   which have not  yet  come into any sort of effect here s the video via youtube the bottom line is that the economy is continuing to grow because of president obama s economic policies  many of the investment plans that companies are announcing right now were in motion well before the election in november  but trump has been desperately trying to take credit for the economy so let s all remember how trump is currently taking credit for all the good economic news  because once the economy implodes under his watch  he ll definitely try to blame the black guy for it featured image  screenshot
