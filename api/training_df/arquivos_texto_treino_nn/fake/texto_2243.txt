in what could be the most damning information revealed yet  and what seems to be a remarkable oversight by most of the media  the wall street journal published an article in may  revealing that donald trump himself met with russian ambassador sergey ivanovich kislyak while everyone has been focused on trying to figure out which members of trump s campaign had met with russian representatives  it s printed that trump met with him  and met with him during his presidential campaign  this is a very  very huge deal considering trump has time and time again said that he hadn t been talking to russia according to the wall street journal in an article titled  donald trump goes his own way with vladimir putin  it shows trump saying this  i believe an easing of tensions  and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible  absolutely possible   mr  trump said in a foreign policy speech at washington s mayflower hotel in april   some say the russians won t be reasonable  i intend to find out  wsj then reports  a few minutes before he made those remarks  mr  trump met at a vip reception with russia s ambassador to the u s   sergey ivanovich kislyak  mr  trump warmly greeted mr  kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception  yes  that s the same sergey ivanovich kislyak who met with attorney general jeff sessions  went to the republican national convention  and was in attendance at trump s joint address to congress kislyak seems to be a major player in trump s long game seeing as he is in regular attendance pretty much everywhere  this fact is rather alarming considering  kislyak is considered moscow s  top spy recruiter  in the united states  don t expect the trump russia story to go away anytime soon  if anything  it is just heating up and deserves more scrutiny than any other story around  if trump is connected directly to russia  and russia did  in fact  help trump win the election  that s not only a direct threat to national security and our democratic process but it is a global threat as well the russia connections will continue to present themselves and trump will be seen as the fraud and colluding traitor that he may very well be featured photo by win mcnamee getty images
