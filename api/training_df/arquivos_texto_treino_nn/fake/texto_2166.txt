for a week now  the world has been up in arms about trump accusing former president obama of wiretapping his tower to spy on his white house campaign  the house intelligence committee has demanded trump turn over any and all evidence he s got that supports that accusation  and there s also the possibility that he s committed obstruction of justice just by tweeting about it so  of course  the white house press corps was asking sean spicer about all of this during today s press briefing  he said  the president made very clear in his tweet that it was  wiretapping  those quotation marks above aren t an accident  watch what he did below basically  spicer stood at the podium in the white house press room  in front of the press corps  and put air quotes around the word  wiretapping   air quotes tend to serve the same purpose as scare quotes in writing   they re used to create doubt around a word or phrase  spicer just put doubt around trump s accusation of wiretaps  literally now  it s entirely possible that spicer just thought he was placing emphasis on  wiretapping   or that he s just clueless enough not to know what air quotes like that imply  but it doesn t matter what he thought he was doing  it matters what he did  and he just cemented the doubt surrounding trump s wiretap accusation featured image by mark wilson via getty images
