donald trump is in deep sh t because he refuses to apologize for sexist remarks he made about a miss universe contestant during the presidential debate on monday night  the republican nominee took serious flack for fat shaming miss universe contestant alicia machado just because she didn t conform to trump s beauty standards for women hillary clinton took trump to task  informing him that machado has a name and is going to vote in this election as are millions of other women across the country who also don t appreciate how he has treated women on tuesday  after trump continued to insult machado on fox   friends  the ladies of the view discussed his remarks and refusal to apologize  and even conservative panelist jedediah bila was disgusted by his behavior  now this guy doesn t know how to apologize it seems  because this happened a long time ago and everybody has a past and all of us have said things that maybe we sit and say  i regret it   the fox host began   it s seems though he doesn t regret it  because the comment here  the only acceptable remark is   you know what  that was a long time ago when i was a different man and i m sorry  i m deeply sorry that i said those things  but trump didn t apologize just like he has never apologized for any of the offensive remarks he has made over the years  he couldn t even apologize for his birtherism  that shows character  there s a character flaw here   bila declared before slamming trump s supporters for blaming everyone around trump instead of holding trump responsible for his own personal words and actions   and everybody wants to blame his handlers and say   why isn t he being told   and i say  you know what  you re a grown man running for president  you re responsible for what you said  and you re responsible for owning up  and i don t care who your handlers are   grow up and say   i m sorry  joy behar also summed up trump s message   the message is  don t vote for me   she said here s the video via abc donald trump is not presidential material  he has no courage and zero moral fiber  he thinks he can say whatever he wants without consequence and while that may be the case on a reality show this is the political arena he is in now  women represent more than half of the electorate  which makes pissing them off a very bad idea if the gop hopes to stave off extinction  but his big mouth could have even more serious repercussions if trump pops off at the wrong time to the wrong people he could seriously affect our relations with other nations  especially nations with which we have serious tensions to work out  trump s big mouth could easily sabotage crucial diplomatic negotiations or piss someone off enough to break ties with us  we need international cooperation now more than ever  especially if we hope to defeat isis  insulting countries we need will not help us and since he can t even treat most people in this country with respect  how can we really expect him to actually respect other nations featured image via drew angerer getty images
