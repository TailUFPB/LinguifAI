while the united states and a few european countries seem to be taking a major right hand political turn  pope francis made a stunning announcement in an apostolic letter on monday that is setting conservatives on fire  while he s far short of allowing full reproductive rights among catholics  he s decreed that women who ve had abortions don t have to go to hell in the letter  pope francis granted a special dispensation to priests and bishops that would allow them to absolve the sins of abortion while this dispensation might have thousands  if not more  catholic women breathing sighs of relief  the church isn t inviting abortion  in fact  the pope specifically wrote   i wish to restate as firmly as i can that abortion is a grave sin  since it puts an end to an innocent life  however  in perhaps the church s first acknowledgement that women are people and not just birthing vessels  pope francis also said  in the same way  however  i can and must state that there is no sin that god s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the father   the letter continues   may every priest  therefore  be a guide  support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation  i henceforth grant to all priests  in virtue of their ministry  the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion  this move is incremental  in   pope john paul allowed bishops to lift excommunications to women who ve had abortions  some bishops allowed priests to do the same  but this will be the first time that women around the world will be able to approach their priests  hoping they ll be granted forgiveness  with an actual chance of getting it still  conservatives want none of it  foxnews there has always been forgiveness it doesn t make the sin of killing ones own child less atrocious they she be shunned from society  godblessamerica      brianknewhouse  november    tmchand  foxnews if you followed his sacred heart you would know better may his spirit give you understanding and wisdom    pic twitter com   godblessamerica      brianknewhouse  november    foxnews absolvement of murder  oh christianity  how far you have fallen   thevortexfxt   thevortexfxt  november    drudgereport and people thought we were kidding when we said this pope is not a catholic but a communist in sheeps clothing   brad     november    drudgereport  eugenics and the new world order has more power over this so called pope than god  only god can forgive   prepperagenda   prepperagenda  november    drudgereport this shit head is worse than a borgia pope   comrade strontium   mrstrontium  november    drudgereport  oh you killed a baby  that s ok say  hail marys rub these beads and you ll be just fine     pontifex  bobby lee   bobbyleetn  november    drudgereport once again an activist pope trying to undermine the catholic church with progressive liberal socialist ideas  he is wrong   hosscart   rjnuff  november    with this declaration  the catholic church is still in another century when it comes to a woman s right to choose  but  as conservatives  reactions are showing  this declaration puts the church miles ahead of the american republican party featured image via franco origlia getty images
