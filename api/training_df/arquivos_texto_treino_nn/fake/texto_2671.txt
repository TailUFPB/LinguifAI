while trump is whining up a storm on twitter about how judge james robart has made it so anyone can get into the u s  by halting his muslim ban  there s a conversation between robart and dept  of justice attorney michelle bennett floating around that explains a lot about how robart sees it robart asked bennett the following pointed question  which everyone with any sense has been asking since trump threw the world into chaos last week  how many arrests have there been of foreign nationals from those seven countries since    bennett replied  your honor  i don t have that information  i m from the civil division if that helps get me off the hook  what a thing for a lawyer to say   it almost sounds like bennett felt a little silly defending trump s muslim ban in court  she may have felt even sillier after robart said  let me tell you  the answer to that is none  as best i can tell  so  i mean  you re here arguing on behalf of someone that says  we have to protect the united states from these individuals coming from these countries  and there s no support for that  bennett argued that the rationale behind the order was to protect the u s  from potential terrorists  many people think that makes some sense  but neither trump nor his administration ever weighed that against the possible impact of such a ban  had any terrorists actually come from any of those countries  and attacked us  then the ban might have some merit as it stands  though  it exempts countries that actually do have a history of exporting terrorism robart responded to bennett s statement about protecting the u s  with this  i m also asked to look and determine if the executive order is rationally based  and rationally based  to some extent  means i have to find it grounded in fact instead of fiction  the muslim ban is currently based on the fiction that these countries pose a clear and present threat  they don t  the  threat  that trump sees is vague and rooted in paranoia  not fact  yet trump is all over twitter claiming that now  bad people  can just indiscriminately pour into the country as though u s  customs and border protection was only able to do its job with the ban in effect he claims to have instructed dhs to very carefully look at people coming into the country  because dhs and cbp apparently weren t doing that  chances are he did no such thing  or he made them roll their eyes  he ll take credit if nothing happens  and he ll blame robart if something does while the trump administration is certain that they ll win this case and the ban will be reinstated  others aren t so sure  some think this will go all the way to the supreme court  and if it has to  it has to  the harm the ban causes actually outweighs the dangers of not having it in place below is a video of the feb   hearing  and the relevant portion begins at the   mark featured image via screen capture from embedded video
