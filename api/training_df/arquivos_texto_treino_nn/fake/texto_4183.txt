tom hanks is definitely voting for hillary clinton and he perfectly explained why earlier this week during an interview with the press association to promote his latest film  hanks was asked about donald trump and his remarks about sexually assaulting women  he was at work  man   hanks began   he wasn t in a locker room  he was at work  he was showing up to do a thing on camera  look  i m offended as a man  i m not offended as a husband or a father  i m offended as a guy  that s just not right  i m sorry  it s not right at work  it s not right in the locker room  it s wrong  period  the end  that s all  hanks also talk about why he is voting for hillary clinton by comparing this election to a root canal  it s kind of like if you have a horrible  painful tooth  and you need a root canal  who are you going to see  a guy who says   oh  i think i can figure that out  how to do a root canal for you  lay down   or are you going to see somebody who s done   of them  has a degree on the wall and has a great history and expertise when it comes down to it  here s the video of via youtube but hanks also put it another way after referring to trump as a  self involved gas bag  look  if i have an abscessed tooth  and i need to see an oral surgeon  i m not going to go to the guy who says   you know what  i think i can be a pretty good oral surgeon   i m going to go to someone who has been doing it for  years and has handled it a million times  i am voting for hillary clinton because she is wildly  wildly qualified to be president of the united states at the same time with dealing after one damn thing after the other that the world has handed her  when asked what will happen if donald trump becomes president  hanks said it would be a  dark day for the planet earth  here s the video via youtube either way  donald trump is not the candidate most qualified to be president featured image via screenshot
