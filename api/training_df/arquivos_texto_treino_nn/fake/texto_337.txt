what is it with the trump administration and spending tax dollars on things that are literal luxuries  tom price  secretary of health and human services  just got busted spending taxpayer dollars traveling on private planes   something to the tune of    already  private travel on the taxpayers  dime is apparently the norm for price   he s been doing this since he took the helm over at hhs according to a report from politico  kathleen sebelius and sylvia burwell  both of whom headed up hhs under obama  tended to travel on commercial airlines when flying domestically  price s officials claim that he only uses private jets when commercial travel isn t feasible  but most of these flights are between big u s  cities where many airlines regularly fly  for instance  he took a private jet from washington  d c   to nashville  but there are four nonstop flights per day between those two cities  with fares as low as   even if he insisted on flying first class  that flight would have been considerably cheaper with average ticket prices around     his private jet from d c  to nashville cost    most of his flights are to areas where he speaks about the opioid epidemic  and these engagements are planned well in advance so he could book his flights well in advance  too  it s not like most of his travel is at the last minute due to the nature of his job  or his  demanding schedule   which is another excuse hhs officials are using his spokespeople also claimed that he was taking private jets because he was just so amazingly busy directing recovery efforts in the hurricane ravaged areas of texas and florida  however  politico says that at least  of these private flights happened before hurricane harvey  there s no way he could possibly have been needed for recovery efforts for a hurricane that hadn t happened yet one of those flights was from san diego to the aspen ideas festival in june  that s a swanky festival in the swanky resort town of aspen  co  and he spent taxpayer dollars on that  while it s true that he was speaking during a panel there  he arrived  hours before that panel  so it s really hard for him to claim that he had to book a private jet because this was too last minute  an average of  percent of the flights that go into aspen are scheduled commercial   it s not like it s impossible to fly commercial into aspen pitkin  price s plane could have cost us as much as     commercial flights cost well under half that this administration is all about wasting taxpayer dollars  but cutting needed spending  while pretending to stand for regular americans  it s absolutely sickening featured image via chris kleponis   pool getty images
