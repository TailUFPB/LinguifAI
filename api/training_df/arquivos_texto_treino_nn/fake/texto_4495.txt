the cincinnati enquirer has endorsed republicans for president for nearly a century but donald trump forced the paper to break the streak  despite having reservations about hillary clinton  the longtime newspaper could not justify supporting the republican nominee this time around  trump  despite all of his bluster about wanting to  make america great again   has exploited and expanded our internal divisions   the enquirer noted the enquirer has supported republicans for president for almost a century   a tradition this editorial board doesn t take lightly  but this is not a traditional race  and these are not traditional times  our country needs calm  thoughtful leadership to deal with the challenges we face at home and abroad  we need a leader who will bring out the best in all americans  not the worst that s why there is only one choice when we elect a president in november  hillary clinton the enquirer pointed out that clinton has worked on both sides of the aisle to craft bipartisan legislation and has the experience necessary to be a good president in both domestic and foreign affairs  furthermore  the enquirer appreciates that her campaign is inclusive  noting that she has fought for lgbt rights and supports income equality for women trump  however  only represents national ruin and embarrassment trump is a clear and present danger to our country  he has no history of governance that should engender any confidence from voters  trump has no foreign policy experience  and the fact that he doesn t recognize it   instead insisting that   i know more about isis than the generals do    is even more troubling  his wild threats to blow iranian ships out of the water if they make rude gestures at u s  ships is just the type of reckless  cowboy diplomacy americans should fear from a trump presidency  clinton has been criticized as being hawkish but has shown a measured approach to the world s problems  do we really want someone in charge of our military and nuclear codes who has an impulse control problem  the fact that so many top military and national security officials are not supporting trump speaks volumes the enquirer also noted that trump is aligned with white supremacists and has filed bankruptcy multiple times  which defeats the notion that he is a successful businessman in the end  there is only one real choice for president in   and the enquirer bucked a  year tradition and picked hillary clinton in these uncertain times  america needs a brave leader  not bravado  real solutions  not paper thin promises  a clear eye toward the future  not a cynical appeal to the good old days hillary clinton has her faults  certainly  but she has spent a lifetime working to improve the lives of americans both inside and outside of washington  it s time to elect the first female u s  president   not because she s a woman  but because she s hands down the most qualified choice this endorsement is particularly important because ohio is a swing state that will likely be a close call this november  a newspaper endorsement like this one could help many voters make up their minds and could even change enough minds to make a difference  the fact that this newspaper endorsed a democratic nominee for the first time in about a century is  in the words of joe biden  a  big f cking deal  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
