for the first time  in recent memory at least  the fbi has decided to put its thumb on the scale of the presidential election by releasing maybes  leaks and innuendo against hillary clinton  while a parade of people both on the left and right have railed against the head of the fbi  james comey  the most powerful voice has been from one of the key figures involved in the so called investigation  anthony weiner s alleged teenage victim of sexting according to comey  the fbi has  learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation   comey didn t say clinton is being indicted  he didn t say she was even involved  he hasn t even seen the emails that may or may not implicate clinton  it s guilt by possible association with something that might exist  and all of this bunch of nothin  came out just days before the election the alleged victim of the sexting that is at the center of the controversy wrote an open letter  printed in buzzfeed  that raked comey over the coals  she s upset that she s being re victimized to become a political tool  here are some excerpts in your letter  you chose to use a vague approach  meaning the media had to keep searching to try and find out what evidence you had uncovered and how  every media outlet from local to national has contacted me and my family to get my  story   why couldn t your letter have waited until after the election  so i would not have to be the center of attention the last week of the election cycle in his  cooperation  with you and with his love of the spotlight  anthony weiner has given information that led to the media finding me  you have assisted him in further victimizing me on every news outlet  i can only assume that you saw an opportunity for political propaganda i thought your job as fbi director was to protect me  i thought if i cooperated with your investigation  my identity as a minor would be kept secret  that is no longer the case  my family and i are barraged by reporters  phone calls and emails  i have been even been blamed in a newspaper for causing donald trump to now be leading in some polls and costing hillary the election    the election is important  yes  but what happened to me and how it makes me feel and how others see me  is much more important  it s time that the fbi director puts his victims  rights above political views the girl  who appears to be exceptionally articulate and more informed than the majority of voters on both sides of the aisle  signed the letter   girl that lost her faith in america   she s not alone  this election has been one of the most bitter and contentious and fact free  on the republican side  in our nation s history  we hadn t yet hit rock bottom when comey made his statement  but we re coming closer every single day featured image via win mcnamee getty images
