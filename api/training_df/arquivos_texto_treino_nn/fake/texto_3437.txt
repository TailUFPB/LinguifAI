donald trump has been poking china with a proverbial stick and his provocations haven t gone unnoticed  now  chinese state media is calling trump and his disastrous excuse for foreign policy out trump did his best to kick off a diplomatic crisis with china when he accepted a congratulatory call from taiwanese president tsai ing wen  china views taiwan as a rogue province and the u s  agreed not to recognize their government as part of the  one china  policy  naturally  trump has no f cks to give global times  a state run chinese newspaper  published a scathing editorial on monday slamming trump for his remarks regarding the one china policy  they speculated  that trump may use the policy to force china to make a compromise on trade  the one china policy is not for selling  trump thinks that everything can be valued and  as long as his leverage is strong enough  he can sell or buy  if a price can be put on the us constitution  will the american people sell their country s constitution and implement the political systems of saudi arabia or singapore trump needs to learn to handle foreign affairs modestly  especially the china u s  relationship  more importantly  a hard struggle against trump is needed to let him know that china and other world powers cannot be easily taken advantage of  the piece then lays out the following threat  most likely in reference to north korea   if trump gave up the one china policy  publicly supported taiwan independence and wantonly sold weapons to taiwan  china would have no grounds to partner with washington on international affairs and contain forces hostile to the u s  in response to trump s provocations  beijing could offer support  even military assistance to u s  foes  the one china policy has maintained peace and prosperity in taiwan   notes the article  before adding that the  u s  has no control over the straits  and trump is na ve to think he can use the one china policy as a bargaining chip to win economic benefits from china  the editorial then offers trump an out  because they do realize that he is a babbling idiot  saying   it s very likely that trump may not have put too much thought into it  he is no geopolitical maniac  but just has little experience in diplomacy  he doesn t understand how dangerous it can be when he involves the u s  in such an explosive game  after all  this requires some personal experience  but the piece then ends with a warning to the world  china needs to be fully armed and prepared to take a sino u s  rollercoaster relationship together with trump  and many others in the world will probably also need to fasten their seatbelts  china has filed an official complaint with the u s  government regarding trump s chat fest with the taiwanese leader  they also sent a message on monday by flying a bomber capable of firing long range nuclear weaponry over contested territories located in the south china sea  trump is playing a dangerous game featured image via drew angerer getty images
