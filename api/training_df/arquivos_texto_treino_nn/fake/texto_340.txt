jack links  which is a very popular maker of beef jerky  just released a brand new ad that is absolutely disgusting  it s supposed to give you facts about building muscle  and how beef jerky can aid you in that endeavor  but it does so as a direct appeal to nazis and other white supremacists  seriously the  second spot features green bay packers linebacker clay matthews  who literally says the following  word for word  at the beginning of the ad  i m the product of hard work  superior genetics  norse mythology  and protein  the ad also shows primates putting muscle fibers back together  which could be seen as promoting slavery and anti semitism  since racists and anti semites have traditionally used monkeys to disparage black people and jews  watch below  superior genetics  is what white supremacy and anti semitism are all about  sure  on their planet  people are people  but whites have superior genes and built the whole world  and everyone needs to understand that  adolf hitler s aryan race was all about superior genetics  the white supremacists and nazis in this country push that  so there s no getting away from the fact that the term is a dog whistle to white supremacy what about the  norse mythology  claim  though  most of our nazis and white supremacists want to preserve western european genetics  norse mythology is scandinavian  so what the hell  it turns out that this is also an appeal to a very racist brand of odinism  which  unfortunately  does have a fairly strong history in the u s  among the white supremacist hate groups this brand of odinism was popular in nazi germany  and it s popular among today s white supremacists  including nazis  kkk members  skinheads  and others  the reason for that is  it sings the virtues of the tribe  or folk  strongly emphasizing genetic closeness  and it credits whites with building civilization and an ethic of individual responsibility   according to the southern poverty law center  that s exactly what white supremacists want  no more mixing of races because that s  white genocide   and an acceptance that whites are the superior race above all others odinism is likely more appealing to these people than christianity because christianity  attempts  to emphasize inclusion and love of all  not the racial division they want  it also fits better with the anti semitism these hate groups harbor than christianity does  however  many in these hate groups still call themselves christian and pervert christianity to suit their own needs  which those who actually promote christian ethics say is  a problem   it s possible that particular conflict can drive white supremacists to odinism jack links has a serious problem on its hands with this ad  they just branded themselves as openly white supremacist with a desire to appeal to the worst elements of our society  one might try to claim that they re just ignorant of the current social and political environments  but that s about as likely as trump not knowing who david duke is featured image via video screen capture
