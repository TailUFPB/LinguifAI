when one of donald trump s minions appeared on fox news sunday to sell bullshit  chris wallace was not buying it for months  trump has been launching vicious attacks on the media  even going so far as to call them the  enemy of the american people  and ban several news organizations from white house press briefings trump says outlets like the new york times and cnn are reporting on him inaccurately despite having no proof to support his claims also  whining about things seems to be all trump is capable of doing as he has also attacked the intelligence community  congressmen  businesses  saturday night live  and anyone else who criticizes him so when corey lewandowski appeared on fox on sunday  chris wallace put the screws to him  the reason we invited you on in the first place  i want to talk about the trump agenda with you   wallace began before playing video of steve bannon accusing the media of standing in the way of trump s  economic nationalist  agenda  these last couple of weeks of mr  trump s first days in office have been dominated by attacks on the media and the intelligence community   wallace continued   do all of these attacks on the media and intelligence and opponents  does that get in the way of that message  lewandowski responded by attacking the media  accusing the media of writing   percent factually inaccurate  reports  lewandowski then repeated trump s demand that the media report what he tells them to report instead of investigating and digging for the truth  why not just pursue his agenda   wallace shot back   he may be right on that or he may be wrong  but how many jobs does that create  indeed  attacking the media and the various people and entities that criticize him have not created any jobs for americans  in fact  trump is too busy focusing on his obsession with the media than he is on working on behalf of the american people  and that is causing him to lag in comparison to his predecessors  something wallace was quick to inform lewandowski about after he tried to claim that the media is forcing trump to attack them  he s falling behind where other new presidents have been at the same point in their term   wallace said here s the video via youtube donald trump needs to seriously sort out his priorities and get his lazy ass back to work instead of using his time to whine  it s unpresidential and will only give the media more to criticize him about trump made a promise to create jobs in this country but he is apparently too busy worrying about what the media is saying about him to care about keeping it featured image via screeenshot
