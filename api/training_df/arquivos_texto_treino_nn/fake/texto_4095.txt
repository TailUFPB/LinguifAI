the daily caller is disgusting  any media outlet that isn t disgusting wouldn t have been so cold  callous and cruel to a woman who publicly shared her difficult and tragic story of having to terminate her pregnancy after  weeks  the new york times was kind enough to publish meredith isaakson s story in an op ed  but what reporter rachel stoltzfoos and the daily caller did to it is beyond reprehensible what did they do  in their own words  we edited a new york times op ed on abortion so it reads correctly  edited so it reads correctly   does not describe the evil they just published  isaakson found out her son wasn t likely to survive until birth  let alone after birth  because of a fatal defect in the development of his heart   half of it was missing  it was an abnormality that wasn t detectable until about  weeks gestation  even though his heart had stopped developing correctly at five weeks  she then says  in the days that followed  after the poking and prodding  after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists  cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists  my husband and i decided to terminate our pregnancy  i was  weeks pregnant when they wheeled me into the operating room  two weeks shy of viability in the state of california  here s how the daily caller edited that paragraph  in the days that followed  after the poking and prodding  after the meetings with pediatric cardiologists  cardiothoracic surgeons and geneticists  my husband and i decided to terminate our pregnancy   i was  weeks pregnant when they wheeled me into the operating room  two weeks shy of viability in the state of california    how does anybody do this to a woman who wanted her baby  but learned that his chances for survival were extremely slim  and was left with a choice no parent should ever have to face  how vile can you be  how black is the heart of someone who can so completely disregard what isaakson was going through this way but it gets worse  isaakson goes on to say  for us  the decision was about compassion for our unborn baby  who would face overwhelming and horribly painful obstacles  compassion for our  year old son  who would contend with hours upon hours in a hospital  missing out on invaluable time spent with his parents  and the death of a very real sibling  it was about compassion for our marriage  perhaps most important  it was about our belief that parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams so our children don t have to suffer  here s how the daily caller tore her to shreds for that paragraph  for us  the decision was about compassion for our unborn baby  who would face overwhelming and horribly painful obstacles   compassion for our  year old son  who would contend with hours upon hours in a hospital  missing out on invaluable time spent with his parents  and the death of a very real sibling   it  was about compassion for our marriage  perhaps most important  it  was about our belief that parenthood sometimes means we sacrifice our own dreams  so our  children don t have to suffer   the entire thing just gets worse  and worse  the daily caller has proven themselves to be pro birth  but not pro life  and shown that they don t give a flying rat s ass about the pain the original news caused isaakson and her family  to say nothing of the pain of this decision if this is how the pro birth crowd sees this  then they re bereft of compassion  and they re bereft of love and they are bereft of empathy  their hearts are the darkest of abysses  sure  they say they re speaking for those who can t speak for themselves  but they do so at the horrific expense of those making the decision  there is no regard for isaakson  and what she went through  in this perversion of her op ed this is probably the coldest  most heartless  most sickening thing a media outlet can do to someone  we sincerely hope that rachel stoltzfoos and everyone who was involved in publishing this never face such a terrible  gut wrenching decision themselves  because nobody should ever have to go through this  period  she and the daily caller owe isaakson and every other woman who s had to make this awful decision a heartfelt apology  though  at the bare minimum to read isaakson s story  click here  to read the daily caller s so called  edit   click here  but be careful  there are no words bad enough to describe this image of the daily caller logo by marquis de faux  public domain via wikimedia commons  flame image by littlevisuals co  public doman via pexels
