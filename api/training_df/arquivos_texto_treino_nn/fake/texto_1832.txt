donald trump and his administration seem to be all about austerity  as long as it s the nation suffering and not his family or employees  trump s education secretary  betsy devos isn t suffering  in fact  she s the only cabinet member that requires security from not jut the secret service  but from us marshals  and it s costing the schools she oversees a lot of money no one is telling us why devos needs the extra security  but the marshalls are sending a bill to the education department in the amount of   million to cover about eight months  while that s a drop in the bucket for a department whose budget is about   billion  that money is coming straight from the nation s children s educations the new outlay is a tiny fraction of the department s budget  but comes as the trump administration has proposed slashing the spending plan by   billion  or   percent devos is the only cabinet secretary under the protection of the marshals  law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges  transporting prisoners  apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses  they also guard the deputy attorney general and supreme court justices when they travel source  washington postdevos s security team changed from secret service to the marshalls after some protesters blocked her entry into a school shortly after her confirmation  the protest was completely non violent  other than that  we have no clue why the apparent overreaction note that devos is rich  very rich  even richer than her boss  she and her family are worth about    billion  if we can find a single rationale for putting the super rich in the higher eschelons of government  it should be that they could fray some of they cost  right it seems  though  as if the super rich in government are now just taking their money making skills and using them to bilk the american taxpayers  trump is making the taxpayers pay for a vacation a week and  now  devos s security is coming   literally   from the mouths and brains of children featured image via mark wilson getty images
