baylor university s vice president for senior operations  reagan ramsower  apparently doesn t think much of women who report a rape  in fact  according to a former title ix coordinator for the school  he made possibly the worst observation imaginable  women who report rape are mentally ill baylor official called women who reported sexual assault  mentally ill   ex title ix coordinator says   https   t co  pic twitter com   dallas morning news   dallasnews  november    ramsower denies this  but patty crawford appeared on and episode of   minutes sports on showtime   in which she said  it seemed like it came from the fact that one of the women   was suicidal  i said   no   the incidents themselves have caused traumatic response in these women  they are not mentally ill  someone who s been violated usually suffers from anxiety and depression related to the violation  the condition is not what makes women report being raped  sadly  though  it s extremely common for our society to find ways to blame women for their trauma  rather than placing the blame squarely where it belongs   on the jackass who raped her crawford also said  in the interview  that she was refused access to police reports about rape on baylor s campus  and was shut down in other ways too  crawford told   minutes sports on showtime  that waco police  do not want the actual police reports turned over to title ix   these are things the university and ramsower vehemently deny  despite the problems baylor is known to experience with rape  because of course they do why would they do that  because reasons  all of those reasons have to do with rape culture in general  women may not report rape for months  years  or even never  which discredits them in the eyes of the justice system and society in general  the fact that they often know their rapists just furthers the idea that they were somehow complicit we have no universal legal definition of rape  so whether someone was actually raped often depends on how the justice system wants to define it for that particular case but perhaps worst of all is that universities handle rape cases because of title ix  and not because it s the right thing to do  the department of education can take years to investigate cases themselves  and many universities don t punish or expel the rapists  even when they re found guilty  and  in the case of baylor  stanford  brock turner  and others  athletes are treated as being above the law ramsower did acknowledge a failure on the part of the waco police department to properly handle a case of gang rape  however  doesn t absolve him of claiming that rape victims are mentally ill by pointing to one victim that was suicidal due to her particular trauma featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet
