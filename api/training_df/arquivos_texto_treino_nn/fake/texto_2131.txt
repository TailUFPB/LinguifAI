if you ask any conservative  ferguson police officer darren wilson was completely justified in shooting michael brown under extremely suspicious circumstances because the unarmed african american teenager tried to grab wilson s gun   this  wilson now admits  is a lie in his  testimony  wilson claimed that brown grabbed his gun and said  you are too much of a pussy to shoot me  the gun goes down into my hip and at that point i thought i was getting shot   wilson said   and the right ate it up this self defense claim also allowed the officer to escape without any criminal charges  and was very popular among conservatives  who wanted nothing more than to exonerate their beloved white police officer  but wilson s answer now is very  very different  in a questionnaire related to a civil trial  he now admits it didn t happen wilson now says that not only was the holster designed to prevent the very scenario that he says made him scared enough to shoot the unarmed teen  but that brown did not try to remove the gun from his holster at all  though he does still maintain that brown was a living  breathing weapon of mass destruction  wilson also admits that he used the word  n gger  to refer to african americans  and that he heard other ferguson cops do the same at this point  if it is not clear to you that there was a severe miscarriage of justice in not locking this monster up  there is no help for you featured image via screengrab
