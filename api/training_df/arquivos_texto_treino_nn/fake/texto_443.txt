it has become customary for a president  upon leaving the office to the next holder of the title  to leave a note of encouragement  different presidents  of course  have done it differently  back in   george h  w  bush left bill clinton a note that famously said  i am rooting hard for you  good luck   clinton likewise left one for the elder bush s son  as george w  did for barack obama but when obama quietly folded his letter and placed it in a drawer in the resolute desk  it contained more than just platitudes and well wishes  in addition to being twice as long   obama is a speaker  after all   it was filled with not only an account of how powerful a position it is  but also advice on how to handle the job with grace and humilityalthough trump has never publicly read the letter aloud  he has often spoken of how much he cherishes it  when he s not busy tweeting about what a horrible president barack obama was  now cnn has obtained a copy of the letter from a person that trump once showed it to exclusive  in the letter obama left for trump on inauguration day  he lays out four points of advice  read it here  https   t co nlczjtxyaz pic twitter com   cnn politics   cnnpolitics  september    highlights it s up to us to do everything we can  to  build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard it s up to us  through action and example  to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the cold war  and upon which our own wealth and safety depend e are just temporary occupants of this office  that makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law  separation of powers  equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for  regardless of the push and pull of daily politics  it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them as you can see  president obama left trump with a lot of advice he has definitely not followed  from trump s sustained focus on repealing his predecessor s signature health care bill to his determination to cut social spending in order to fund more tax cuts for the wealthy  he hasn t built any ladders of success  in his constant tweets threatening north korea and belittling china  mexico  and even allies like australia and germany  trump hasn t done much for  international order  but on the last few points  trump has failed spectacularly  he has zero respect for the rule of law or separation of powers  and has proven himself an enemy of equal protection and civil liberties president obama s letter couldn t have surfaced at a more perfect time to highlight the differences between the man we got used to seeing handle disasters  terrorism  tragedies  and diplomacy humbly and the man child who scoffs now at even the most common social norms if only it had been a set of rules featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
