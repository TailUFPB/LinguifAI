if republicans and donald trump really care about our military veterans  they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up ohio gop rep  warren davidson has outraged the veterans of foreign wars and the house veterans affairs committee by referring to veterans as  moochers  who are just pretending to be hurt or sick when they show up to get medical care from the va  just like workers comp out here s got moochers  i wish that there were no vets that were the same sort of problem on our society   davidson said during a town hall event on monday   but part of the problem is there are some vets that are moochers and they re clogging up the system  and we do as taxpayers want to make sure the va filters out these folks that are pretenders  just like we wish there were no people out there with stolen valor  but that s a problem in the vet community  too  davidson  who won a special election to replace john boehner and is a supporter of donald trump  has drawn a shitstorm of criticism ever since veterans of foreign wars spokesman joe davis slammed davidson for insulting the men and women who have served this country  honorably discharged veterans with service connected wounds  illnesses and injuries  or who are indigent due to circumstances beyond their control  are not moochers   he said in a statement house veterans affairs committee chairman jeff miller said he hopes that davidson merely  misspoke  and called upon him to clarify his remarks and davidson s remarks are particularly outrageous because davidson is a veteran himself but when given the chance to back down  davidson did the opposite   any effort to suggest i have anything other than a soldier s passion for providing our veterans with the care they deserve is dishonest   he said before his spokesman presented four case of va fraud to somehow prove his claims that veterans are  moochers  the problem is that these cases involve people who pretend to be veterans  in other words  the people in these cases are not veterans  but davidson called veterans  moochers  anyway it would have been so simple for davidson to just clarify his remarks  but he didn t because  like donald trump  republicans are incapable of admitting when they are wrong  so davidson s insult of veterans stands in the record as a testament to how republicans really feel about the men and women who fought for our country featured image via youtube
