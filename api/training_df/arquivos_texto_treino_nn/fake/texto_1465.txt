a recent opinion poll carried out by nbc news wall street journal showed that  percent of americans  a number that appears to still be growing  would prefer to see an independent commissioner or special prosecutor handle the investigation into russia s interference in the  us presidential election  while a mere  percent believe congress can handle any ongoing probe last week was more than just a turbulent time in washington  president trump fired fbi head james comey on tuesday  the man responsible for the investigation into trump s russian ties  this latest poll was conducted between thursday  may  and saturday  may   just days after comey s ousting  among  adults and has an overall margin of error of plus or minus   percentage points  the firing of the fbi director was a major upheaval in the investigation process  and these poll results reflect the current climate not only around capitol hill  but what is a rapidly growing consensus across the nation since comey s dismissal  trump and several members of his administration have tried to downplay the need for an independent commission to continue what the fbi had begun  looking into questions of russian interference in last year s election  as well as the possibility of members of trump s campaign colluding with moscow  in fact  on saturday the president stated in no uncertain terms that the investigation should continue to progress in the house  the senate  the fbi  according to the same poll  only  percent of americans say they approve of comey s firing  while  percent disapprove  another  percent of respondents don t have enough to say on the matter  yet among those who say they have read  seen or heard  a lot  about the firing   percent say they disapprove  versus  percent who approve  the poll also showed a partisan split when it comes to the topic of the president s decision  with  percent of republicans approving while  percent of democrats disapprove of the move  one thing that is clear  however  is that very few people surveyed had no opinion at all  with low single digit responses as a whole  trump s approval rating has remained steady at  percent since last tuesday  however   percent of those surveyed claimed that their impression of the president is less favorable since his decision to remove james comey  while  percent say the move hasn t impacted their impression of president trump whatsoever featured image via drew angerer getty images
