if jeff sessions really cares about the law and the constitution he ll read his own words about perjury and resign in disgrace during his confirmation hearing to become donald trump s attorney general  sessions took a very clear question from senator al franken and answered it with a very clear answer sessions was asked if he had any communication with russian officials during the  campaign  i have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and i did not have communications with the russians   sessions responded and as we now know  that was a complete and total lie that was told under oath in other words  sessions perjured himself in front of congress so far  sessions has refused to resign  and that makes him a hypocrite considering what he once said about bill clinton in  after republicans failed to impeach the former president according to the new york times  here is what sessions had to say after the acquittal it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that president william jefferson clinton perjured himself before a federal grand jury and has persisted in a continuous pattern of lying and obstructing justice  the chief law enforcement officer of the land  whose oath of office calls on him to preserve  protect and defend the constitution  crossed the line and failed to defend and protect the law and  in fact  attacked the law and the rights of a fellow citizen  under our constitution  equal justice requires that he forfeit his office  for these reasons  i felt compelled to vote to convict and remove the president from office       it is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth  i fear that an acquittal of this president will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in court  whereas the handling of the case against president nixon clearly strengthened the nation s respect for law  justice and truth  the clinton impeachment may unfortunately have the opposite result now the man who called for  equal justice  and said  we demand the truth  just got caught committing perjury and he is refusing to forfeit his office having an extramarital affair is not against the law  but republicans decided to go on a political witch hunt for it back in the  even though several of those lawmakers who voted to impeach clinton were themselves caught cheating on their spouses colluding with the russians during a critical election on behalf of the republican candidate and lying about it under oath is far worse than anything bill clinton ever did by all rights  sessions should be impeached from office  but republicans are only interested in impeaching officials if it helps their agenda  they are hypocrites and the whole lot of them do not deserve to hold office in this country it s time for jeff sessions to look at himself in the mirror and decide if equal justice and the truth are as important to him now as he claimed it was then  because if not  he should not be the attorney general featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
