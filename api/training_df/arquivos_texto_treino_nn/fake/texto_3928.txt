hillary clinton enjoyed a performance by jay z and beyonce at a rally in ohio on friday night and donald trump complained like a hypocrite during the rally  jay z performed uncensored versions of songs  which included the n word and other expletives  of course  that means the republican nominee had to make remarks about it during a rally on saturday  i actually like jay z   trump said in florida   but  you know  the language last night  he used every word in the book  i won t even use the initials  because i ll get in trouble  they ll get me in trouble  the  they  trump is referring to is the media but the problem is that hillary clinton did not use any of those words herself  while donald trump has used words such as  c nt  and  p ssy  and has used curse words on the campaign trail and joy reid reminded trump of his own language during her show on saturday now  donald trump has a problem with jay z s language  okay   a flabbergasted reid began   because jay z is a hip hop guy  i want to remind america  the guy who has a problem with jay z s language  this is his language  what followed was trump s infamous  grab them by the p ssy  remark that has plagued him since the audio was released early last month reid then went for the jugular  jay z has said a lot of things in his songs  but he s never said that  donald trump  we should perhaps talk to melania  who wants to have this campaign against cyber bullying   which she can begin at home at the dinner table  here s the video via vidme once again  a hypocritical donald trump shoots himself in the foot by failing to keep his big mouth shut the bottom line is that hillary clinton did not say those words during her rally  jay z did  trump  on the other hand  has no one to blame for his own words but himself featured image  screenshot
