nobody would have ever said this about any of our previous presidents  nobody but because president obama and his family are black  fox news host sean hannity is trying to get in as much hateful racist talk as possible before the obamas leave the white house in january and when president obama leaves office  hannity is offering to arrange for a one way trip to kenya for him and his family in response to a non response the white house had to a satirical article claiming that obama wants to move to canada if donald trump wins the election on november   remember how democrats insisted last week that we all need to be united behind whoever wins the election   hannity began   well  i guess that only applies if donald trump loses because apparently the president cannot bring himself to say that he ll unite behind the trump presidency  hannity talked about how  a white house aide failed to deny rumors that president barack obama was planning to leave the united states if trump wins the election   and then offered to send president obama  first lady michelle obama  and their two daughters to africa as long as they don t come back  i ll pay   hang on a second  i m offering   i ll even rent a plane as big as air force one   i have an offer for the president  i will charter a plane for you and your family  i will make sure it s as big a plane as air force one  what you have grown accustomed to  in other words  taxpayer funded plane  i don t know where i m going to get  maybe i ll just   maybe i ll ask trump if i can charter his plane for obama  that s what   i will charter donald trump s plane if he ll let me  and i will charter it to the country of your choice  you want to go to canada  i ll pay for you to go to canada  you want to go to kenya  i ll pay for you to go to kenya  jakarta  where you went to school back in the day  you can go back there  anywhere you want to go  i m gonna   i ll put the finest food  caviar  champagne  you name it  i have one stipulation  you can t come back  that s fair  here s the audio via youtube first of all  president obama has already stated that he will peacefully transfer the presidency to donald trump in january should he actually win on election day  in fact  president obama will even attend the inauguration second  every president in the modern era has had full use of air force one no matter where they go during their presidency  and it has always been taxpayer funded  even when george w  bush and ronald reagan took those  days of vacation during their presidencies combined while president obama has only taken  days of vacation  so if hannity wants to pretend that president obama is somehow freeloading off of the taxpayers by using air force one  he should probably get all of the facts first furthermore  president obama was not born in kenya  his father was  but president obama was born in hawaii to an american mother and is a natural born american citizen  his wife michelle and their daughters were also born in the united states hannity s offer is disrespectful and hearkens back to a time when racists wanted to send blacks back to africa just to keep america white fox news should be embarrassed that this jackass is still on their payroll  much less on their airwaves featured image  screenshot
