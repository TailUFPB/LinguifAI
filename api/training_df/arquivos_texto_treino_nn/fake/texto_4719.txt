audience members and viewers watching msnbc s  commander in chief forum  were treated to a rare  once in a lifetime moment last night when donald trump actually told the truth for a few seconds about his  plan  to defeat isis host and moderator matt lauer had been grilling the republican nominee on the insanity he s been spewing about having a secret plan to defeat isis that he can t reveal  supposedly because it would just tip off the terrorist group   while trump has previously been quick to find creative ways to dodge or turn around questions in a way that confuses people and avoids having to actually provide an answer  the donald slipped up this time  by complete accident  trump revealed that regardless of what he s said in the past  there is no plan at all in trying to clarify a contradictory statement that trump had made in a speech earlier that day in which trump had said he d give military leaders  days to devise a plan to defeat isis  lauer asked trump  so  is the plan you ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan  trump stumbled over this question right away  unintentionally showing americans that trump has yet to come up with a strategy  no  but when i do come up with a plan that i like  and that perhaps agrees with mine   or maybe doesn t   i may love what the generals come back with lauer continued to question trump about releasing the plan  and criticized him for taking a plan from  generals    even though trump has previously said that he knows more about isis than they do  this part of the interview was completely bizarre as trump loses his footing and lauer knew the republican nominee was vulnerable   but it was perfect  trump was finally being exposed for the liar he is you can watch this part of the interview below is donald trump s counterterrorism plan to ask for someone else s plan   nbcnewsforumhttps   t co   msnbc   msnbc  september    image via spencer platt   getty images
