during his bizarre  rally  in youngstown  ohio  donald trump did what he does best  campaign for a position he already holds  it s become a distressingly common occurrence to see trump holding giant gatherings that seem to serve no purpose other than to gather crowds of his supporters together in one place  he doesn t generally issue any policy proclamations  but when he does  they are invariably of the sort specifically tooled to please his rabid supporters no matter what he says  though  it s going to get ironic  take youngstown  at the opening of the rally  after his supporters finished chanting  cnn sucks   over and over  trump had a question for the crowd  is there any place that s more fun  more exciting  and safer than a trump rally  i m sure that was reassuring for the protesters in attendance  there are always a few  although i can scarcely fathom how they can stand to be in a room with all that bigotry and hatred  i have no idea how many anti trump protesters were in the crowd in youngstown  but i know this kid was there idiotic protester at trump rally in youngstown ohio gets dealt with       pic twitter com izhbdvcqhh           obielicious  july    actually doesn t look safe at all  that looks  in fact  like a goddamn nightmare for the young man  who was forcibly removed from the rally after standing silently with an old soviet flag  who knows if his protest even lodged with the president or the crowd   that s not the flag of russia  with whom trump colluded to corrupt our democracy  it s a communist flag  a different meaning entirely  note how the crowd s cheering goes up ten decibels as soon as security applied his giant hands to the teenager s throat  safe three days later  trump was in front of another crowd  this time police officers  i wonder if he had the incident with this kid in mind when he told the cops in attendance to not  be too nice  in dealing with suspects  it could be he was thinking of the red flag with the hammer and sickle that triggered him in ohio  or maybe he was thinking about the former police chief there in suffolk county where he was speaking   the chief that s serving just under  years for beating a suspect almost to death the reckless tone the president takes when he speaks is more than carelessness or a lack of empathy  it s dangerous  all of the world leaders that trump looks up to   putin  duterte  erdogan   are of the sort that have their detractors silenced  arrested  or even murdered  how long will it be until his supporters call for the same actions from their hero trump this twitter user laughed until he cried about the violent removal we know they already condone it featured image via justin merriman getty images
