if anybody knows when a president is qualified for impeachment  it s david gergen after all  he worked in the nixon administration donald trump s russia scandal has gotten even bigger over the last week  just a day after firing fbi director james comey  trump met with russian officials in the oval office and leaked highly classified information and compromised the source of that intelligence and our own national security and now  there s a memo written by comey noting that trump asked him to drop the russia investigation interestingly enough  it s the memo that could end up bringing trump down you see  asking the head of a federal agency to drop an investigation and then firing that person later on for refusing to do so is the very definition of obstruction of justice and impeding an investigation as it turns out  obstruction of justice is what led to impeachment proceedings against former president richard nixon during the watergate scandal republican analyst david gergen delivered that explanation during a segment on cnn on tuesday when anderson cooper asked gergen to weigh in  the longtime republican said that trump has entered  impeachment territory  i was in the nixon administration as you know and i thought after watching the clinton impeachment  i thought i would never see another one   gergen began   but i think we re in impeachment territory for the first time  the obstruction of justice was the number one charge against nixon that brought him down  obstruction of justice was the number one charge against bill clinton   gergen continued  it looks like he was trying to impede the investigation  he was using his power to do that  and when james comey didn t go along with him  when he wasn t his boy  he fired him this is of enormous consequence for his presidency  gergen then concluded that all the bombshells dropped over the last week  including comey s firing  sharing classified intelligence with the russians  and the revelation that trump asked comey to drop the investigation are causing trump s presidency to unravel  what we see is a presidency that s starting to come apart   gergen said here s the video via youtube it is now clear that trump fired comey because he refused to drop the investigation  that is obstruction of justice and should result in trump being impeached  of course  republicans in congress have no interest in impeaching trump  that would require having the courage and a soul featured image  screenshot
