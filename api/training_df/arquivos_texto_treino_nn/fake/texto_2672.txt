since donald trump enacted the travel ban from seven majority muslim countries last week  he s spent most of his time on the defensive  that position got worse after trump posted a fake news story on his facebook timeline that was quickly debunked by the country of kuwait  but not before the right wing media ran with it as proof that trump s muslim ban is cool  even in the muslim world the article  which is still on trump s facebook page  said that kuwait enacted a similar ban to trump s syrians  iraqis  iranians  pakistanis and afghans will not be able to obtain visit  tourism or trade kuwaiti visas with the news coming one day after the us slapped its own restrictions on seven muslim majority countries passport holders from the countries will not be allowed to enter the gulf state while the blanket ban is in place and have been told not to apply to visas trump s post has more than   likes and nearly   shares  it was also shared by right wing sites like breitbart and infowars  the only problem is  it didn t happen the foreign ministry of the middle eastern country  categorically denies these claims and affirms that these reported nationalities   have big communities in kuwait and enjoy full rights   according to a sunday morning report in reuters the story shared by trump had alleged that  syrians  iraqis  iranians  pakistanis and afghans will not be able to obtain visit  tourism or trade kuwaiti visas with the news coming one day after the us slapped its own restrictions on seven muslim majority countries   the story in the jordanian news outlet al bawaba did not have an official statement or order from the kuwaiti government nor from any of the countries it said were facing a ban source  the daily beastof course  trump hasn t taken the story down  which shouldn t be a surprise at all  the trump administration is apparently far more comfortable with lies than they are the truth  if they told the truth  they d lose the support of the majority of their followers featured image via joe raedle getty images
