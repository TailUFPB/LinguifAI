by now  we re all familiar with trumpkins  idiotic attempts to show that liberals are hypocrites by claiming that we scream for tolerance  yet we re intolerant of their own hateful  bigoted views  after all  doesn t  tolerance  mean accepting every viewpoint there is  these people are desperate to prove that we are just as hypocritical as they are  but their  tolerance  analogy just flat out doesn t work  john pavlovitz  a true christian pastor from north carolina  of all places   and someone who regularly calls the right wing out  explains why early on in his post  pavlovitz throws this out at conservatives who want liberals to tolerate their hate  the commitment to diversity and equality means demanding that everyone gets a seat at the table  that each person s inherent worth is recognized there  that no one is devalued or excluded based on a fixed and fundamental part of their identity  skin color  gender  nation of origin  sexual orientation  religion  etc this means that we declare every human being equally valuable  it does not mean we treat all opinions and all behavior equally  and then he says this  which should put all the immature conservative trump lovers who are looking for someone to validate their hate into a massive tizzy  if your opinion directly endangers people based on those essential parts of who they are we ll pushback  if you re  worldview permits you to treat someone as less deserving of civil rights or it discards their basic humanity your worldview is a threat to true diversity if your evaluation of another makes you more tolerant of their mistreatment or less outraged by hate crimes against them  that s a fundamental problem discrimination and violence don t get a seat at the table  they don t get proximity to do damage the contention for the past year has been that all political perspectives are valid  but i won t consent to that and it s a matter of personal safety  no individual groups of white people are explicitly  measurably endangered by a progressive platform  they receive the same consideration  but i can illustrate the specific ways people of color  immigrants  muslims  women  and the lgbtq community are less safe and less represented by the coming administration  which is already by its conduct  a movement of exclusion  and that s the difference that our narrow minded  racist  misogynistic right wing does not understand when they cry and whine about tolerance  they don t give a rat s ass about diversity   they just want their viewpoints normalized and accepted  no matter how harmful they may be  when the  tolerance  they want doesn t come  they cry like spoiled toddlers they re full of hate and they are asshats about it  and what they want should never be allowed to stand  if you believe people of color are simply inferior to white people  you re going to have to work hard to stay at the table if you claim lgbtq people to be abominations  you ll have to do better  if you believe muslims are likely terrorists  you probably won t feel welcome at the table for long and so no  it isn t at all hypocritical to champion diversity and to confront injustice simultaneously  they are fully collaborative and integrated movements all people are welcomed at the table but bigotry isn t  so save the allegation that its acceptance is a requirement equality demands deceny  toward humanity s diverse gathering and it s what i demand  it s what we all should demand  what they re demanding of us is a pass for their hate and their discrimination  they aren t demanding anything like tolerance   they wouldn t know what tolerance was if it bit them in the ass read pavlovitz  full opinion here featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
