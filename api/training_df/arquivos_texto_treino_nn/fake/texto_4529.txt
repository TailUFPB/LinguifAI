the season premiere of the hit television drama empire features an amazing song performed by jussie smollett  who plays jamal on the show  the song  entitled  need freedom  has a very clear message  gun violence  senseless killings  and police brutality against people of color must stop  because our nation is ripping itself apart  smollett says of the decisions that inspired him to record  need freedom   i recorded this exactly seven days after philando castile was shot  between the shootings of castile  alton sterling  at the pulse in orlando and the police officers in dallas   not to mention the other numerous killings over the last couple of years   it was like we couldn t breathe  what are we doing as a people  a nation  what messages are we sending to the next generation  then this song came  smollet is right  of course  and what better way to inspire people in an effort to draw peace in such a tense and violent time  where there is such anger  such division  such justified outrage  than by doing so in song  here are just a few of the more inspiring lyrics from smollet s song as i sit and think about all that s goin  on my soul just cries out can you tell me please tell me who s to blame for causing all this pain the one s we call to help us turn they kills us everyday see war is not the answer and love is what we need take the chains off  break the bondage set my people freewe gotta make it better something s gotta change the world needs your voice just to make it through the rain when i think of what s goin  on in this world ohh it gets me to see my sister not breathe my sister  my brother here with meneed freedom our world is cryin   no more silence  with guns and violence need freedom i can t keep dyin   we re way too quiet  no more silence need freedom stop this evil  free my people  we re all equal need freedom our world get s brighter  keep on tryin   keep on fightin  for freedomthese lyrics come on this night  september   as  at this very moment  protests are erupting in charlotte  north carolina  because yet another black man  keith lamont scott  is dead at the hands of the police  already  as per usual  the police are in front of cameras  in damage control mode  spinning the story they want the public to hear  whether it is true matters not to them  they only want to cover their own asses  because black lives simply don t matter to them  this message is one that is definitely needed it is  of course  a message that will likely fall on deaf ears  we live in a nation where people think that the right of every person to have as many guns as they like  anytime they like  no matter what  should supercede the rights of innocent people to live  these are the same people who think that cops can do no wrong  and that the bloodshed at their hands is always justified  these are same people who believe that freedom only applies to certain people  and to hell with everyone else  they re the people who think that every black man shot by police was just another  thug  anyway  and that the void left in the lives of his loved ones is of no importance they re the same people who don t care about what happened in orlando  or oregon  or newtown  or any of the other countless places where people who should have never had firearms carried out massacres  they only care about their guns and their rigid belief that whatever happened was worth their version of  freedom  hopefully  the people who need to hear this message the most will  and the killing will stop  however  i sadly won t be able to hold my breath on that one  it will only continue another day  in another city after another innocent life is lost  or another unbelievably tragic and preventable massacre is carried out  sadly  that is the america we live in today watch the video below featured image via screenshot
