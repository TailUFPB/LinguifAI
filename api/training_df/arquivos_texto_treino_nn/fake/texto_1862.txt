for months now people close to trump have been privately saying the president is consumed by a seething jealousy of his predecessor  barack obama  where trump s approval ratings continue to circle the drain  obama s have seen a post presidency surge  adding to that  obama s signature piece of legislation is not only more popular than ever  but the replacement trump came up with imploded before it even got a vote  in the media and from political observers obama is viewed as smarter  more mature  and more gifted politically than trump  and trump knows it so what is trump to do  imitate hours after he ordered a missile strike in syria  trump s press secretary sean spicer tweeted an image of the situation room wh photo  ed for security    potus receives briefing on  syria military strike fr nat security team  inc  vp   secdef  cjcs via secure vtc pic twitter com   sean spicer   presssec  april    bore a disturbing resemblance to one of the most famous photographs of obama s time in office  the night he ordered the mission to kill osama bin laden however  unlike obama s image   filled with serious people doing serious jobs   trump s version contains a number of unqualified goons  the photograph of obama and his staff signaled strength  trump s imitation serves only to show the world what a clown show trump s white house is trump s attack on syria may have earned praise by right wingers  but it s already escalating tensions in the region and may someday be viewed as the opening shot in a devastating global war  russia  rather than cave to trump s show of  strength  has vowed to arm the syrian regime with more anti aircraft weapons meant to shoot down any u s  plane that crosses the border breaking russian military says it will help syria strengthen its air defenses after us strike   the associated press   ap  april    attack also alienated iran  pushing them further into the sphere of russia and the assad government those are some serious consequences for actions being made by rex tillerson  a former oil executive with ties to russia  steve bannon  the owner of white nationalist website breitbart  and jared kushner  the son of a real estate mogul who married the daughter of a real estate mogul  the fact that those men are even in the room is a disgrace to america s military  who will likely carry the brunt of the consequences but perhaps the biggest joke in the room is that donald trump himself  or put another way two years ago  the man who just ordered a missile strike was deciding whether or not to fire gilbert gottfried from a game show  andrew lawrence   ndrewlawrence  april    image via mark wilson getty images
