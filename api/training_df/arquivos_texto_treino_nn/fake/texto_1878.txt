we all remember the uproar over at fox news a few years back when the idea of a black santa claus came up  in fact  megyn kelly was so upset that she had to insist live on the air to all the little children of the world that santa claus could only be white  well  if they were upset by that  they are going to really blow their stacks over the version of santa claus being rolled out in a new children s book called santa s husband  the harper s design book portrays santa as a black man who is also gay  his husband is a white man  the husband also doubles for santa at malls worldwide  and the book chronicles their happy existence in the north pole  aside from the heaping helping of diversity  even better is the fact that the book s author is daniel kibblesmith  who writes for the late show with stephen colbert kibblesmith says of the concept  and how it all began as a joke with his partner  my fianc e  and i joked privately  and then on twitter  that since every house has its own traditions and lore surrounding christmas  we would tell our child that the black santa claus was the  real  santa  if they saw a white santa at the mall  we d explain that this was his husband  kibblesmith also joked about it on twitter me    jenashleywright have decided our future child will only know about black santa  if they see a white one we ll say  that s his husband   daniel  kibblesmith    kibblesmith  december    then realized that it was something that people were actually interested in  due to the wide interest it generated on twitter and said he saw  there was genuine interest in this book becoming a reality   and voila  santa s husband was born  as for the racists and homophobes who hate the idea  kibblesmith simply says   everything is okay   he goes on to say  some people   not me   even believe that santa claus is just your parents  which would mean that there are as many interpretations of santa claus as there are different kinds of families  but again  this is only a theory  because santa claus is real  and we have written a book about him  lastly  but not least  here is the book s adorable cover via huffington postthank you so much for writing this book  mr  kibblesmith  this is something that has been needed for a very long time  you re right   families come in all kinds of packages  and diversity is a strength  not a weakness for those interested  santa s husband us due out in october  you can follow daniel kibblesmith here on twitter featured image via andrew burton getty images
