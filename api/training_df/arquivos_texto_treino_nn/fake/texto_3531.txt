if anybody besides boeing is going to know the details of the contract they have to deliver two new air force ones  it would be  surprise surprise  the air force  trump  however  is treating this like a simple business thing  because he doesn t know any better and considers himself to be the preeminent genius of the world   and it s not thankfully  air force secretary deborah lee james was only too happy to enlighten trump with some of the nuance behind a contract like this  which trump would do well to learn  air force one  although it is a  platform  is way  way more than what you would think of as a commercial airliner  it really is  in many ways  a flying white house  in terms of the security  there s  countermeasures built in  communications  very high level communications  security of all types  after all  this is carrying the president of the united states  it has to go long distances  it has to survive under difficult circumstances  much more difficulty than a normal civilian airliner  so it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye  and then she dropped this truth bomb on trump  there are professional security people who are in the white house who develop requirements for air force one  they are not political appointees  they are professional security people  those requirements then come to the air force and our job is to build the acquisition strategy around it to deliver those requirements  in other words  we didn t make up all these security factors and communications standards  the price tag on these planes could be lowered  she notes  if you change the requirements on it  since the white house sets the requirements based on what they need to protect the president  and what the president needs to do his job from the air  then neither boeing nor the air force really sets a price  it s a negotiation and the price tag  at   million  not four effing billion  is probably very reasonable  given what all is involved we should also note that these planes won t even be in service for another decade   well after trump is out of office even if he were to win re election in  and yet  here s donald trump  on twitter  acting as though the air force is just shoveling money into the fire willy nilly  and or that boeing is severely overcharging just because they can her entire response can be paraphrased to   with all due respect  sir  you don t get it   in providing a detailed explanation  she was not only clarifying what was going on and allaying any worries that might arise from the cost  but she was also telling trump that he was totally ignorant about the entire process his tweet was dangerous  it sent boeing s stocks tumbling briefly  trump needs to get informed and stop tweeting on his own  or someone needs to take his phone away from him so this doesn t happen again  thankfully there are experts to explain what s really going on here read morephoto of deborah james by alex wong via getty images  photo of donald trump by drew angerer via getty images
