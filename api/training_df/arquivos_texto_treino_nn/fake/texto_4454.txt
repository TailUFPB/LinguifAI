monday night s presidential debate showed a stark contrast between two personalities  one was calm and cool  even under stress and the other was a bloviating braggart who couldn t maintain his temper on top of those  qualities   donald trump is sexist and he proved it monday night when hillary clinton brought up trump s record of fat shaming a former miss universe  president obama  as the father of two girls and the husband of a strong woman  was having none of that  one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest   he loves beauty contests  supporting them and hanging around them   and he called this woman  miss piggy   then he called her  miss housekeeping  because she was latina   clinton said monday toward the end of the debate  as she ran through a list of things trump has said about women   donald  she has a name  her name is alicia machado  and she has become a us citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this november  trump didn t really have an answer for clinton  but the next day  he took to the talk show circuit and he doubled down on the fat shaming  on fox   friends  the morning after the debate  trump said about machado  she was the worst we ever had  the worst   trump said   the absolute worst  she was impossible   he continued   she was the winner and you know she gained a massive amount of weight  and it was a real problem  we had a real problem  not only that her attitude  we had a real problem with her so hillary went back into the years and she found this girl  this was many years ago  and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother teresa and it was not quite that way  but that s ok  hillary has got to do what she has got to do  source  az centralpresident obama had enough  he  like every american should be  was deeply offended at trump s fat shaming  in a telephone interview with steve harvey on wednesday  obama said there s no way he wants that in the oval office  you had somebody who basically insulted women and then doubled down i think this morning in terms of how he talks about them and talks about their weight and talks about  you know  how they look instead of the content of their character and their capabilities   obama said   which is not somebody that i want in the oval office  here s the audio one can only imagine that trump would use a beauty pageant system to choose the women in his cabinet  yes  trump is too sexist to be president featured image of president obama via drew angerer getty images   featured image of donald trump via spencer platt getty images
