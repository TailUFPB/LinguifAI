rudy giuliani threw a hissy fit over louisiana governor john bel edwards  reaction to donald trump visiting the flood damage in his state  and edwards called him out for it on friday  the former new york mayor who now forgets about   posted a statement on twitter whining about bel edwards asking the republican nominee to do something to help the victims of the flooding instead of just showing up to do a photo op instead of following gov  bel edwards s advice  trump proceeded to get that photo op  which consisted of him handing out play doh instead of real supplies such as food and water but giuliani criticized bel edwards for making such a request and said that reaction towards president obama is not the same negative reaction president bush received after hurricane katrina giuliani said that trump showed  true leadership  by going to the flood ravaged state and then plugged his book in the same breath then he bragged about being the mayor of nyc during the september  attacks here s the full post via twitter giuliani statement on louisiana s governor criticizing trump trip   during the september  attacks  i welcomed  pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  august    sunday  bel edwards fired back by telling cnn s dana bash that there is not a double standard here  i believe mayor giuliani got it completely wrong  i have not been critical of mr  trump s visit  i have tried not to comment because i don t want to get tied up in the politics of whether it s the president  whether it s hillary clinton or whether it s donald trump  i have tried not to comment  and the comments that i have made have been very reserved  so i think he was off base there with that comment  so i think he was off base there with that comment  bel edwards went on to point out that the reason president obama has not visited baton rouge yet is because he asked him to come next week instead here s the video via cnn but edwards explained why president obama was right not to visit yet during an interview with rachel maddow on thursday  it is a major ordeal  they free up the interstate for him  we have to take hundreds of local first responders  police officers  sheriffs  deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit  i would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president  so i d ask him to wait  if he would  another couple weeks  so president obama s presence would have been a major distraction and would have kept first responders from doing their jobs to help those in need but that doesn t mean president obama has done nothing like republicans would have us believe  gov  edwards said on that point  i do want you to know  and your viewers to know  that within hours of me making a request for a federal declaration i got it from the president  he called me  i want you to know that i ve been speaking to valerie jarrett just about every day  he dispatched the fema administrator to meet with me for an entire day  today i had the homeland security secretary jeh johnson  we ve also had the four star general who runs all of the guard for the country here today  and that s in addition to fema workers who have been embedded in the state in preparation for the relief effort president bush was not so much criticized for not visiting as much as he was criticized for not being prepared and not doing enough to help the victims in the wake of hurricane katrina  a storm that took the lives of nearly   people  fema was completely disorganized under bush s watch  but president obama has been on top of this latest disaster in louisiana since the beginning so giuliani is out of line for criticizing president obama  and he is out of line for criticizing bel edwards for making a reasonable request of trump  louisiana needs help  not photo ops  trump visited a republican dominated area to make it look like he was universally welcomed in the state when it is clear that he wasn t  president obama s presence would have only hindered the rescue and recovery effort  and you know republicans would have whined about that if he had visited featured image via screen capture
