cnn talked to the man who conducted the study donald trump cited as  proof  that  million people voted illegally in the  election and trump will not like what he said during an interview with wolf blitzer  political science professor brian schaffner absolutely shattered trump s claim that he only lost the popular vote because over  million people voted illegally trump s claim has been debunked multiple times and even many republicans are embarrassed by it enough that they are begging him to stop repeating such a blatant lie blitzer asked schaffner about the data his team collected in a  study which found that   percent of non citizens said they were eligible to vote  schaffner has since called the study unreliable because his team went back to talk to the participants and found that none of them actually voted  as it turns out  they merely clicked the wrong button when answering the question schaffner  well  what the authors did was essentially use a question on our survey that asked people whether or not they were a citizen  what we did was actually go back and ask those people again whether or not they were a citizen  and a lot of people had just basically erroneously clicked on the wrong button  and the people who we could actually confirm were actually noncitizens  they were basically no voters among that group blitzer  either   so  what you re saying  that no non citizens voted as far as your study  your data was concerned  in those elections schaffner  that s right  we could find   of the people who we were sure were noncitizens  we could not find any who had actually cast a vote so trump is literally citing an unreliable study as evidence of his claims  something that schaffner finds absolutely  frustrating  it s very frustrating   schaffner said  the data certainly do not show that  we published a study basically showing that the study that the data   that uses our data to say that  is wrong  that study has been widely cited by news outlets to basically say what the administration is saying is false and the notion that millions of people could vote illegally and no one would have any data to be able to show this is the case is just absurd  it s absurd that millions of people  millions of noncitizens  would have voted in   it s just   it s just not even plausible  schaffner went on to concede that a handful of non citizens may have voted in the election  but the scale of voter fraud donald trump is talking about is impossible here s the video via media matters indeed  trump claimed that massive voter fraud was being committed during the campaign  only to be refuted by ohio s republican secretary of state jon husted  our institutions  like our election system  is one of the bedrocks of american democracy   husted said in october   we should not question it or the legitimacy of it  it works very well  the idea of widespread voter fraud would require some systemic problem in our system  and so if there s a systemic problem  please identify it  don t just make an allegation on twitter  tell me  tell the secretaries of state around the country what the problem is so that we can fix it  but right now we re not aware of any systemic problems in our voting system  are there cases of voter fraud  absolutely  there are cases of voter fraud  but it s rare  and we catch these people  most times we catch them before their vote is even counted  and that goes for every state across the nation  trump should be embarrassed and ashamed  and if he really thinks our election was rigged then we should hold a brand new election immediately and give him something to really cry about when the american people reject him featured image  drew angerer getty images
