by now  we re all sick and tired of hearing donald trump whine about fake news  especially when he s team is a major creator of it earlier today  trump went on one of his routine twitter rants about fake news and unfavorable coverage  targeting  unwatchable  msnbc and cnn for their  conspiracy theories  and  blind hatred   to top it off  trump happily endorsed fox news  which has been proven to be the most dishonest media outlet there is while trump was whining about networks that tell the truth about how awful he is  cnn s chris cuomo hit back and completely shut him down  cuomo pointed out that for someone who hates cnn  trump is one of their most loyal viewers  cuomo said  the president  as we know  watches  new day   we appreciate that viewership  he does not want to talk to us  but he does want to talk about us  and yet  this situation is different  he has said nothing to rebut the facts of this situation  on top of that  cuomo and his colleagues spent the entire morning reporting on the details that trump s senior advisors had been in  constant communication  with russian intelligence during trump s presidential campaign   making trump look like a complete idiot cuomo also pointed out that fact that trump hasn t been able to give an answer regarding russia s involvement in the election or general michael flynn s communications with russia that have now caused him to resign just  days after beginning his role as national security advisor  cuomo said  who knew  the idea that flynn had to resign because he was soloing with this unique agenda with russia that nobody else knew about  nobody had told him to do and nobody participated in is hard to believe and goes without good answer from the white house  cuomo s attack on trump is perfect  and hopefully it ll shut him up for a while so he can actually do his job featured image via screenshot and alex wong   getty images
