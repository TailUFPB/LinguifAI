if you ve spent much time on social media  you might notice that almost regardless of the subject  a string of anti hillary memes seems to just automatically show up  that s not a coincidence  it s all part of a highly coordinated  shitposting  designed by billionaire and oculus founder   year old palmer luckey luckey is best known as a boy genius who invented his version of virtual reality goggles  called the oculus rift  facebook bought luckey s company in  for   billion  forbes estimates that he s worth about   million the epicenter of his trolling seems to come from reddit  where he uses the pseudonym  nimblerichman   luckey is a backer  likely the key backer of a pro trump  c    charitable  social welfare  organization that s dedicated to backing trump  if you think that sounds seriously sketchy  you d be right  according to the irs  a  c    is not supposed to have politics as its primary activity  and any politicking it does is not tax exempt  the daily beast published an expose on thursday  which says in part nimble america says it s dedicated to proving that  shitposting is powerful and meme magic is real   according to the company s introductory statement  and has taken credit for a billboard its founders say was posted outside of pittsburgh with a cartoonishly large image of clinton s face alongside the words  too big to jail  we conquered reddit and drive narrative on social media  conquered the   now it s time to get our most delicious memes in front of americans whether they like it or not   a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on reddit people on reddit aren t happy  in fact  the biggest pro trump subreddit  r thedonald  refused to believe that luckey was nimblerichman  but luckey insisted that he s just the money behind the idea and well  he did it for a lark   because  you know  screwing with the future of the free world is fun  i ve got plenty of money   luckey added   money is not my issue  i thought it sounded like a real jolly good time  he prides himself on putting out memes that are so bad that even the trump campaign wouldn t promote them before you think he s a millennial who is still angry that bernie sanders didn t win  think again  he has zero problems with money in politics  the american revolution was funded by wealthy individuals   nimblerichman wrote on saturday  luckey confirmed to the daily beast he penned the posts under his reddit pseudonym   the same has been true of many movements for freedom in history  you can t fight the american elite without serious firepower  they will outspend you and destroy you by any and all means  luckey isn t just spending money on anti hillary memes  he s spending money to support trump as an early supporter of  oculus this makes me sick to my stomach  this is the org  palmerluckey is backing cc  techcrunch  uploadvr pic twitter com   cody brown   codybrown  september    is a message from  palmerluckey  the founder of  oculus  pic twitter com   cody brown   codybrown  september    has apparently been banned from twitter  but that doesn t mean that nimble america  along with the backing of white supremacist and breitbart propagandist  milo yiannopoulos  they plan on releasing more memes and purchasing billboards it s not clear if luckey has maintained any sort of relationship with facebook or if he has pull with the organization  let s hope not  while   who is responsible for many of the anti hillary paid trolls throughout social media  is also associated with r thedonald  there s no evidence  at this point  that luckey is behind financing that movement  stay tuned  though featured image via bryan steffy getty images
