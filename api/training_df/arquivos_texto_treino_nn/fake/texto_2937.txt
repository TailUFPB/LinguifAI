well  here we are  the last day of eight years that is the obama presidency  for eight years  we all saw a swarm of friends and acquaintances regurgitate the most asinine conspiracy theories about president obama imaginable  whether they came from sarah palin or alex jones  right wing looney tunes were always a far cry from the truth  today we have a new term for it  fake news  but we must always remember what it truly is  conspiracy theories now that the great and honorable president obama leaves office tomorrow  let s remind the  economically anxious  red america congratulations on letting yourself be played for the last  years  it was quite a sight to behold  both sad and funny that teetered on the brink of near insanity  hopefully  this will be a learning experience to turn off the tv  quit with the fake news  and apply some common sense  no considering they just elected the biggest conspiracy theorist around  one shouldn t get their hopes up now that trump has already broken a slew of promises  watch as red state citizens still bitterly cling to their guns and bibles while finding a way to somehow blame obama it is nearly impossible to record how much money  time and brain cells republicans lost being perpetually lied to by the likes of rush limbaugh  glenn beck  sean hannity  ann coulter  alex jones  dinesh d souza  bill o reilly  michele bachmann and the rest of the right wing brigade the fact that republicans allowed their minds to be poisoned for nine years  counting the campaign in   will have long lasting effects for generations to come and will continue to throughout the trump presidency president obama got one thing wrong  there is a blue state america and a red state america  but it goes so much deeper than that  there s an alert america and an easily duped america  there s a truthful america and an untruthful america  luckily  democrats were the former  and sadly republicans allowed themselves to be the latter but it wasn t always like this  in january   as president obama prepared to take office   percent of america came together to support the new incumbent  then the power of talk radio prevailed  and america was to be utterly transformed  never to be the same again president obama will leave office with a  percent approval rating  perhaps a chunk of the gop electorate realizes they have been manipulated going forward  democrats and progressives alike need to be cautious of what they share and believe  allowing our disdain for trump to border on conspiracy is a dangerous route to take be vigilant  but be smart featured image via justin sullivan getty images
