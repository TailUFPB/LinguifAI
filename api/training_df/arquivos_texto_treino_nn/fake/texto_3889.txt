anderson cooper only needed a single sentence to put a trump supporter to shame during a panel discussion at a hillary clinton campaign rally in philadelphia  which featured a performance by bruce springsteen  the cnn host listened as trump minions jeffrey lord and kayleigh mcenany whined and complained lord got the whine party started by claiming that most people in the crowd at hillary s rally are only there to see springsteen while trump s audience is only at his rallies to see trump lord then shifted to talking about michelle obama and how trump s past statements about grabbing women  by the p ssy  caused her to get more involved in the election  which lord claims makes her a hypocrite because she likes jay z and beyonce  one of the things that got her interested in this all of a sudden was that access hollywood tape  in which the p word was mentioned   lord said   and yet there is hillary clinton with jay z who has a song  specifically titled with the p word  cooper responded by pointing out that jay z is not running for president  it should also be noted that jay z was not singing about sexually assaulting women  which is exactly what trump was bragging about on that bus still  lord claimed that michelle obama and hillary clinton are hypocrites  and mcenany agreed  the difference is for jay z to shout these expletives on a stage at a political rally while the democrats are trying to stand on a moral high ground saying we re better than that and hillary clinton is putting out commercials with little girls looking in the mirror   she said but cooper was ready for that and promptly humiliated her by pointing out something that a conservative musician did at a recent trump rally  ted nugent grabbed his package at his concert  didn t he   cooper asked as mcenany sat in stunned silence for a couple seconds here s the video via vidme trump supporters will literally say anything to criticize hillary clinton  their attacks are nothing more than petty jealousy because their candidate is so embarrassingly bad but at least we have anderson cooper to call them out and smack them down when necessary featured image via screenshot
