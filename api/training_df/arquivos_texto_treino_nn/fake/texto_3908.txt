what the f ck is wrong with our country  republicans may say that racism ended with rosa parks  they actually say this   but a lot of people s words and actions seems weirdly racist given the complete lack of it in our society an african american man posted a video of an exchange he had with a white driver after he passed the apparently aggressive caucasian man in traffic  this is a prime example of why you should get out and vote  guy got heated and decided to share w  me what him and his family thinks about me and my people because i didn t allow him to speed up and stop me from changing lanes in traffic  a man identifying himself as skye lev wrote on facebook   i could ve ended up doing  to life over this but instead i decided to show him respect  that he clearly didn t deserve  because i have children to be here for  lord thank you for this patience and self control that you blessed me with  get out and vote people     the video is just horrible  after mr  white man apparently called lev a n gger  the african american gentleman turned on his camera  trump  trump all the way  trump  trump   mr  deplorable says as the video begins  he then informs the gentleman that black lives don t matter  there ain t no proof   the white gentleman claims that lev cut him off in traffic and  made him  slam on his breaks  and that makes you a n gger   mr  cracker says   that proves that black lives don t matter   the white gentleman then explains that he doesn t  have a social media account  because  white lives matter   it probably sounded better in his head  now if you thought that was bad  wait till you hear him  teach  this gentleman about black people  we won t spoil it for you  watch it below featured image via screengrab
