and yet the media wonders why everyone hates them it s understandable that someone might get frustrated doing their job sometimes  especially a job reporting the news  after all  most of the news is typically bad news and that will start to take a toll at some point but that s no excuse for being a racist in one incredibly stupid racist remark to a co worker detroit nbc reporter  lauren podell  ended her own career by whining about how many times she has had to report on murders in the african american community  i m tired of reporting on these n     s killing each other in detroit   she said her racist comment became headline news around the office and podell was forced to resign wdiv confirmed her resignation in an email to the huffington post i wanted to let you know that lauren podell has resigned from wdiv effective immediately  lauren asked me to convey the following   during my time at wdiv i have created many friendships that i will continue to cherish   if you receive any media inquiries please forward them to jamie or me  thanks podell s remarks and the fact that the station tried to cover them up has outraged the black community and demonstrations against systemic racism in the media are being planned it s one thing to have a gripe about your job  maybe podell really is just tired of reporting these kinds of stories  but the way she went about it was completely offensive  especially considering that many of her colleagues are black but this demonstrates that there is systemic racism within the media  which explains why the media has treated black lives matter like shit while treating white cops who shoot unarmed black men with kid gloves this is a teachable moment  and hopefully  other reporters and anchors will learn from it featured image  youtube
