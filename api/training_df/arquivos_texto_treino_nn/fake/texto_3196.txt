donald trump rang in the new year by already making a profit from the public office of the presidency  and he still has over two weeks until he is officially sworn in to the office  trump made the money on new years  eve night through a party at his florida estate hotel  the very gaudily designed mar a lago unlike pretty much every other elected official  trump s property charged admission to their event  and the incoming president was dangled like a shiny object in front of the patrons who pulled out their checkbooks to attend this event according to politico  donald trump s mar a lago resort in florida charged a reported minimum of   per person for a new year s eve celebration that trump and his family were set to attend  on friday  trump s incoming white house press secretary told reporters that the party was  sold out   with over  guests expected at the event  that s more than    made off of dinner  dancing  and access to the incoming president of the united states incoming white house director of strategic communications hope hicks attempted to dismiss concern that the mar a lago s pricy new year s eve party comprised yet another conflict of interest issue for trump   the transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict   she told politico   this is an annual celebratory event at the private club  like others that have continued to occur since the election  additionally  the president cannot and does not have a conflict  so far  the mainstream media has simply allowed trump and his team the leeway to say  there is no conflict of interest   in a manner that has more in common with obi wan kenobi s jedi mind trick from star wars than a truly responsive political team  but very few people outside of die hard trump supporters and his tight inner circle actually believe that this is a credible response to a serious inquiry trump and his squad will have to come up with more credible excuses   or  heaven forbid  stop being so crass and unethical   for inquiries to come from democrats  most of them at least  and the media  maybe   it s  probably a safe bet  though  to assume that his fellow republicans are perfectly fine with rubber stamping his behavior as long as he has an  r  behind his name trump s behavior on this topic also calls into question his repeated assertion that he is a billionaire ten times over  he infamously refused to reveal his tax returns  and now he says and does anything to scrounge up a few hundred or thousand dollars seemingly everywhere he can  that isn t the behavior of a man with billions at his disposal at the drop of a hat  is his quest for cash simply another area of vulnerability that will be exploited by either his own party  or by a foreign entity  we won t know  at least not in the immediate future featured image via flickr
