while donald trump s team  one by one  is being connected to russia in secretive and perhaps illegal ways  a story that s going largely unreported in american media is the fact that seven  yes seven  russian diplomats and businessmen have dropped dead since the american presidential election conspiracy theorists are coming up with a lot of answers  and officially  there are a lot of unanswered questions  especially when you take into account vladimir putin s habit of  allegedly  killing people  some have tried  so far unsuccessfully  to draw the line between the deaths and trump  the latest death  though  is more specifically linked to donald trump the internet found out about the death of alex oronov on saturday  josh marshall at talking points memo has been following the connection since before oronov died  but put simply  oronov is a friend  family member and business associate of donald trump s attorney last week i wrote about michael cohen and his extensive network of personal and business relationships in the ukrainian american emigre community  one of those was a man named alex oronov  who runs a major agribusiness concern in ukraine  oronov was a partner in the ethanol business cohen and cohen s brother bryan set up in ukraine about a decade ago  oronov is bryan cohen s father in law  today we learned that oronov apparently organized that  peace plan  meeting that brought together ukrainian mp artemenko  cohen and felix sater  about four hours ago andrii artemenko  the ukrainian parliamentarian who came to new york with that  peace plan   went on facebook to announce that alex oronov has died cohen  who is describe by marshall as trump s  right hand man   is also involved in business with trump  he and his family have purchases at least  apartments in trump buildings  donald trump jr  admitted in  that a lot of trump s assets came from russia  cohen may be the facilitator we know from public records that in the last decade trump became highly dependent on money from the former soviet union  both to finance mega projects like trump soho but also as a source of buyers of apartment units at trump high rises in new york city  florida and other locales  the cohen brothers and their families are purchasers of at least  apartments in trump buildings     according to a  article in the new york post and one owned by the oronovs  according to florida public records   donald trump  jr  said famously in  that  russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets  we see a lot of money pouring in from russia  cohen and his extended family appear to have been part of that flow of luxury apartment purchases from people from the former soviet union  and cohen himself joined the trump organization in the period when trump s reliance on investment capital from the former soviet union for projects like trump soho moved into high gear as for oronov  he is one of four deaths that are connected to trump  this isn t intended to imply that trump was involved in their deaths  but there s no doubt that things are getting weirder and weirder every single day featured image of vladimir putin via sean gallup getty images   featured image of donald trump via win mcnamee getty images
