much like the incompetent potus they are working under  many members of the trump administration have said things in the past that have come back to haunt them  and now  a new discovery about general michael flynn  who resigned from his position as national security adviser  is likely going to result in the crumbling of the trump administration last night  it was reported that flynn was asking for immunity in exchange for testimony on russia   and a few comments he made last september came to light  which certainly will not be helping his case  or trump s  apparently  last year on meet the press  flynn made some remarks about clinton campaign chair john podesta regarding immunity  which now make him seem incredibly guilty  flynn said  yeah  so a couple things  the very last thing that john podesta just said is no individual too big to jail  that should include people like hillary clinton  i mean  five people around her have had  have been given immunity  to include her former chief of staff  when you are given immunity  that means that you ve probably committed a crime  so you know  i don t know how he can sit there and say something like that with all the  the things that have been going around  just swirling around hillary clinton with her email  yes  he said   when you are given immunity  that means that you ve probably committed a crime  flynn has practically closed the case on himself with that statement  you can watch flynn s past self basically ruin his future below flynn s counsel  robert kelner  has released a statement saying that flynn  has a story to tell  and tried to make a case for why flynn would seek immunity  kelner wrote  he is now the target of unsubstantiated public demands by members of congress and other political critics that he be criminally investigated  no reasonable person  who has the benefit of advice from counsel  would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized  witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution  statement from flynn s atty seems to acknowledge seeking immunity  explaining it s necessary in  highly politicized  witch hunt environment  pic twitter com   kenneth p  vogel   kenvogel  march    the position flynn is in right now  his previous statements certainly seem shady and carry some weight featured image is a screenshot
