on sunday  donald trump s campaign manager kellyanne conway appeared on nbc s meet the press  during her appearance  she was grilled about trump s former birther stance trump recently denounced his birther views after weeks of being hounded by the press  since then  the trump campaign has tried to move past the matter  given that trump was one of the key propagators of the conspiracy theory  they are not going to be able to do that anytime soon the show s host  chuck todd  asked conway what made trump come to the conclusion that president obama was in fact born in the united states  it s a fairly straightforward question that conway did not want to answer  you ll have to ask him that  that s a personal decision   conway replied conway then alleged that it was hillary clinton s aides were the ones that started the birther conspiracy  this stems from the fact that several clinton supporters spread an anonymous chainmail around that pushed the birther conspiracy  however  no one actually knows where the origins of that email  or the conspiracy itself came from  who cares about the clinton incident   todd shot back   donald trump for five years perpetuated this  this has been arguably part of his political identity for the last five years  forget the clinton incident for a minute  why did he perpetuate it for five years  conway then said that  it makes a huge difference who started this  we were reminding people where this started  it was used as a smear against sen  obama by clinton campaign associates   and by the way  not a bunch of summer interns who just got it all wrong and were a little bit too ambitious  i understand why you re deflecting   todd responds   you are deflecting  this was five years of his political identity  it s impossible to know who actually started the birther conspiracy  that s why conway and other republicans have begun using that talking point during interviews  while actually knowing who came up with conspiracy would be interesting for historical reasons  that information will probably never come to light  trump and his campaign are desperate to sidestep the issue because they know that it is a major embarrassment propagating the conspiracy was also trump s first major step into the political arena  the people who believe in it constitute trump s base  every time he speaks out against it  he is at risk of alienating the base you can watch the interview below featured image from video screenshot
