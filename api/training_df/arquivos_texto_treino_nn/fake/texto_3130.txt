president elect donald trump s denial of russia s involvement in the us election is disturbing enough  but it s even more unfortunate that he has republican minions that are willing to back him up and spread his lies trump has recently been protecting his man crush  russian leader vladimir putin  by dismissing the multiple  legitimate  and widely accepted reports from the cia   and conservative jeffrey lord is more than ready to back him up on that  during an interview with anderson cooper and guest robert reich  lord killed everyone s brain cells with his moronic defense of trump lord not only tried to convince everyone that trump hadn t been dismissive to the intelligence community  one only needs to look through trump s twitter feed to know that s false   but he accused the intelligence community of  attacking  trump  as soon as lord stated that trump hasn t been disagreeing with the cia and nsa  reich jumped in and corrected him  reich said  i mean  donald trump has said that he disagrees with the intelligence agencies  the fbi  the cia  the nsa  he has disparaged them publicly  he has also disparaged other sources of facts such as the media and science  scientists who talk about global climate change  donald trump doesn t want to hear anything he doesn t want to hear  and to disparage the intelligence community when he is going to have to rely on the intelligence community  it seems to me is the height of arrogance and very dangerous  where is donald trump getting his facts from if he is not getting them from the intelligence community  does a separate root of facts  a separate source of facts  reich then pointed out   how can you run a government if you re going to be disparaging all your sources of information  lord lied and said trump was  a fan  of the intelligence community  he said  i don t think he is disparaging the men and women who put their lives on the line to do this  that s not donald trump at all  but i think he is right to question the leadership  to be perfectly candid  then  lord said something that was so foolish  reich s brain nearly melted when he heard it  lord said   they re going to attack him anonymously in the press  they ll attack through their allies on capitol hill  reich could hardly find the words  he tried to compose himself as he asked  the cia and nsa are going to attack donald trump  is that what you re alleging  wait a minute  wait a minute  i want to understand something  you re saying that there is a conspiracy of some sort  that you have all the intelligence agencies congress conspiring and they ll try to bring donald trump down  is this the assumption here  lord failed to provide a suitable answer  and reid continued to ask   but why is it appropriate for somebody who is president elect to undercut  disparage  demean the intelligence agencies  just as he does the media  just as he does independent scientists and government scientists  once again  lord was out of answers  he tried to change the subject  and cooper put an end to the interview  you can watch lord destroy everyone s brain cells with his stupidity below featured image is a screenshot
