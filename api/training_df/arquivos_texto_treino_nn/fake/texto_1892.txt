the fbi is doing something with its probe into russia s interference in our election that should terrify trump and anybody in his administration  or who worked on his campaign  that has ties to russia  put simply  they re creating a special unit dedicated to better coordination of investigation efforts  and to give james comey better insight into the probe s details one fbi agent said that  it s meant to surge resources  this looks both like an expansion and streamlining of things  this particular investigation is getting so big that they re starting to have trouble managing it  it s not the first time they ve created a special unit for a high profile   sprawling  investigation of this nature  they did it when looking into wikileaks  release of classified documents  and  because of course  when they were looking into hillary s emails it does signify just how seriously the fbi is taking this there is a growing possibility that trump or at least high level members of his campaign colluded with russia during the election to bring down hillary clinton and elevate trump to the white house  they look so bad that the obama administration created a document numbering system to personally hand over to the senate intelligence committee to make it harder for trump and company to hide documents relating to russia trump was dismissive of the intelligence community s findings on russia s hacking  saying that nobody had any idea who could have done it  it could be russia  but it could also be china  it could also be lots of other people  it also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs  pounds  since then  he s continued to dismiss findings and allegations  refusing to believe either that his buddy putin would do this  or that the intelligence community could possibly get so close to nailing him for collusion either way  the new unit will make the fbi s investigation run more smoothly and efficiently  and it will give director comey better knowledge and understanding of what s going on   things that he may have to present to congress at a later date featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
