president donald trump does not know anything about foreign policy  now  it appears  he knows just as little about trade  this is more troubling as one of his selling points was that he was a successful businessman with a global company  you d think that a person with such a vast empire  there are trump towers all over the planet  would know a thing or two about the subject  this idea was blown out of the water this week by comments from a german official about chancellor angela merkel s recent visit to washington  dc the official told the times of london  ten times trump asked  if he could negotiate a trade deal with germany  every time she replied   you can t do a trade deal with germany  only the eu   on the eleventh refusal  trump finally got the message   oh  we ll do a deal with europe then   for a man who claimed to be able to  make the best deals  for the united states with our trading partners  it helps to know who exactly those partners are as bad as that is  trump s lack of world knowledge is more than just problematic when it comes to problems the country is dealing with on the other side of the world  not only has the trump administration failed to even nominate an ambassador to south korea  up until china president xi jinping visited him at mar a lago  he was under the impression that the only thing that had to happen to contain north korean leader  kim jung un  was have china tell him to behave north korea is looking for trouble  if china decides to help  that would be great  if not  we will solve the problem without them  u s a   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    his visit with xi  trump told the wall street journal   after listening for  minutes  i realized it s not so easy  i felt pretty strongly that they had a tremendous power  north korea    but it s not what you would think  keep in mind  trump spent a lot of time during the campaign  and before  touting   i know china   he claimed that the combination of the work he has done with the chinese and the  hundreds of books  he had read about china made him an expert on the region  all of this is odd  given his comments about that short  ten minutes   conversation  his lack of understanding goes further after his meeting with xi  trump told an interviewer   korea actually used to be a part of china  this did not go over well with the south korean government  south korean foreign spokesman cho june hyuck responded with   it s a clear fact acknowledged by the international community that  for thousands of years in history  korea has never been part of china  but wait  there s more an interview with fox   friends makes it appear that trump really doesn t even know who is running north korea right now  he told them i hope things work out well  i hope there s going to be peace  but you know  they ve been talking with this gentleman for a long time  you read clinton s book  he said   oh we made such a great peace deal   and it was a joke  you look at different things over the years with president obama  everybody s been outplayed  they ve all been outplayed by this gentleman and we ll see what happens  but i just don t telegraph my moves bill clinton never dealt with the current leader  he dealt with his father  kim jung il  getting these facts wrong says a lot  trump doesn t know who to deal with when it comes to trade with germany  he seems to have taken his information about chinese and korean history from xi  he doesn t appear to have a clue as to who the leader of north korean leader  the questions with this president are not  what did he know and when did he know it   but  does he know anything and can he be taught  featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
