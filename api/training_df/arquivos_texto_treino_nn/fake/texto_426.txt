ever since donald trump s rise  some of the most heartless people in positions of power have come out of the woodwork   likely because they are emboldened by trump s being a heartless bastard from the bully pulpit of the white house  case in point   sheriff grady judd of florida s polk county of course  florida is right in the middle of the path of the category  beast known as hurricane irma  therefore  there will be people in need of shelter and safety from the storm  however  instead of trying to help people stay alive during irma  sheriff judd has reminded them that if they have any warrants out and they seek shelter  they will be arrested and taken to jail   hell  they even suggest that to make it easier  you should just turn yourself in to the jail instead  this was  of course  announced via twitter here is a screenshot of the relevant tweets  via cnn s twitter of course  this is incredibly dangerous  this man should be doing everything he can to protect the residents of the county he is sworn to serve and protect  not threatening them with jail time for seeking shelter from what could clearly be a very deadly storm  it s like this sheriff wants people to be afraid to seek help  and ultimately wind up dying in a deadly hurricane  his actions are complete dereliction of duty  and he should be relieved of said duties of course  we all know that won t happen  what is more likely to happen is that more deaths occur than otherwise would have because people are too afraid to come forward for help featured image via cnn twitter
