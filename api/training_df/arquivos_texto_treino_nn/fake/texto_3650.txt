a republican member of the electoral college representing texas  art sisneros  wrote on saturday that he will resign and turn his position over to an alternate elector  sisneros has previously been skeptical of throwing his support behind donald trump but now  he says he would rather resign than to vote against his conscience in august  sisneros thought of participating as a  faithless  elector  but in a largely unnoticed blog post over the weekend he wrote that he cannot bring himself to vote for trump  so he decided to resign from his role as an elector  according to politico  the electoral college was corrupted from its original intent once states started dictating the votes of the electors   he writes  if trump is not qualified and my role  both morally and historically  as an elected official is to vote my conscience  then i can not and will not vote for donald trump for president  i believe voting for trump would bring dishonor to god   sisneros wrote   the reality is trump will be our president  no matter what my decision is  sisneros said that he will  mourn the loss of our republic  since i can t in good conscience vote for donald trump  and yet have sinfully made a pledge that i would  the best option i see at this time is to resign my position as an elector   sisneros continued   this will allow the remaining body of electors to fill my vacancy when they convene on dec  with someone that can vote for trump  the people will get their vote   i will sleep well at night knowing i neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions  i will also mourn the loss of our republic  this sounds similar to what ted cruz demanded people do  vote your conscience  but the texas senator lost his spine  soul and conscience during the eleventh hour  then threw his support behind trump  ted cruz is no art sisneros image via facebook
