donald trump is set to take office as president of the united states in just  days  and one would think he d be making the final appointments to his cabinet and trying to make sure he is prepared to work for the american people on day one  however  this is trump we re talking about here  so of course he isn t  what is he doing instead  why  he s busy calling senate minority leader chuck schumer  d ny  a  clown   well  schumer is clearly a lot smarter than trump  and in the wake of the president elect tweeting insults at him  schumer decided to hit back in a much classier way the newly elected minority leader was speaking with the press  something trump has refused to do since july  regarding the gop s ill advised and partisan plan to immediately repeal the affordable care act  otherwise known as obamacare  with nothing to replace it  when he addressed trump s insults  schumer said  i d say to president elect that this is serious  serious stuff  people s health is at stake  people s lives are at stake  now  we understand that president elect trump is in a difficult spot  that republicans are in a difficult spot  they want to repeal the aca  and they have no idea how to replace it  as for the insults  schumer continued  instead of calling names   president elect should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the  million americans who gained coverage  that will cover students or post college students   to   who want to stay on their parents plan  that will show how we cover people with pre existing conditions  so i d say to the president elect and the republicans that this is not a time for calling names  it s time for them to step up if they want to repeal  and show us what they replace it with  indeed  the gop clearly has no plan to replace obamacare  though they ve had six years to come up with one  instead  the incoming president elect continues to spend his transition time insulting lawmakers  private citizens  and intelligence community instead of doing his damn job good luck  congress  you ve gotta work with a nutcase now  hope you have a mental ward somewhere up there on capitol hill  you ll be needing it with this guy featured image via aaron p  bernstein via getty images
