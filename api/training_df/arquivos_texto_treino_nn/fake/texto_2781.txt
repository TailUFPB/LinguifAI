over the weekend  the trump administration implemented one of their most terrifying campaign promises  the muslim ban  he did it via executive order  and framed it as a  travel ban  from seven supposedly  dangerous  muslim majority countries  when trump s hammer dropped  scores of people were detained and questioned for no good reason in airports and other ports of entry around the nation  many were legal residents  green card holders  those with legal visas and refugee status  and other people who had been thoroughly vetted and had every right to enter this country without incident the backlash was swift  as protests erupted organically and in massive numbers at major airports everywhere  the aclu asked for lawyers to volunteer to help these people  and they did  finally  u s  district court judge ann donelly issued an emergency stay on trump s racist travel ban  but it still took hours to get customs officers and border patrol agents to comply  well  now trump has been hit with another blow to his bigoted order  as secretary of homeland security john kelly has issued a statement saying that those with legal residency will not be kept from entering this nation  the statement reads washington   in applying the provisions of the president s executive order  i hereby deem the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest accordingly  absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare  lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case by case determinations so there  trump  i dare you to try to go around homeland security and reverse this provision  what you and your administration are doing is unconstitutional  and  more importantly  it is un american  now  listen to the homeland security secretary  and to everyone else who is telling you that this is unlawful and wrong  and stop this bullshit hopefully  if the sycophants around trump won t pull the trigger and stop this madness  the constitution will hold  and we can somehow stop this crazy agenda via the law  in the meantime   resist featured image via amanda edwards getty images
