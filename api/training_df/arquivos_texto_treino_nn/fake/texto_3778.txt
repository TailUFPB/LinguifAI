donald trump has his staff working on the logistics of allowing him to stay in his gilded apartment in new york city very frequently during the next four years  that possibility has an awful lot of bad implications  including shutting down sidewalks and parts of streets near trump tower  it seems  though  that we don t even have to wait for him to be sworn in to witness the effects of his selfish plans  new york city is already seeing them his already excessive presence in nyc is actually starting to cripple businesses in the area  the area around trump tower  which is also home to some of the nation s biggest retailers  has been swarming with security  secret service  and protesters  entire sections of  avenue get shut down in order to protect king summer squash from all the baddies who might be out and about around there the retailers in trouble include places like tiffany   co   hollister  polo ralph lauren  and abercrombie   fitch  their  avenue stores aren t just their highest volume locations  they re the flagship stores for all these chains and they depend heavily on the traffic they now aren t getting worse  because trump wants to spend so much time in his grossly ostentatious  gold plated apartment throughout his term  these stores may face this most  if not every single  weekend for the next four years  their weekend traffic is very likely much higher than their weekday traffic  for obvious reasons tiffany   co  s main entrance has been closed since election day because of protests and the security needed to keep trump safe  they wouldn t comment on whether their traffic or sales volumes have been affected  and neither would anybody else  but tiffany doesn t know when or if their  avenue entrance will open again rbc capital markets analyst  brian tunick  mentioned that there s a traffic risk there  along with hollister and abercrombie   fitch  due to the security issues sure  some people might say   oh  these are national chains  so what s the big deal   the big deal is that there are still people who work at these stores who could lose their jobs if these locations see too much of a drop in sales volume  trump is a man who promised to bring back the good jobs and ensure americans have good paying jobs if he was elected while there s no guarantee right now that anybody will lose jobs at these stores  there also isn t any guarantee anymore that they won t  any job losses  or worse  store closures  because of the cheeto king s need to be at home instead of the white house  where he belongs  will be on his head because he cares more about himself and his comfort than what his presence might do to the areas surrounding his homes featured image by spencer platt via getty images
