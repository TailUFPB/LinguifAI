for the first time in my adult life  i m happy with the fact that christmas started in october  last monday  special investigator robert mueller indicted two people closely connected to the donald trump campaign and he revealed that a third had taken a deal  now there s an allegation that hits directly at trump and his family and it s a big one still  for trump  there is plausible deniability  paul manafort was  only  trump s campaign chairman for a few months  before last monday  few outside of washington had heard of manafort s business partner rick gates  and well  george popadopoulos was just a glorified  coffee boy  who happened to have very close connections to the trump administration and to russia not buying those defenses  well  most trumpsters do  but even the most hardcore trump supporter would have a hard time denying this trump russia connection  according to the lawyer that donald jr  met with  in the meeting that promised dirt on hillary clinton  jr  offered up the play to her pay  or perhaps the other way around  he allegedly told her that in exchange for the damning info that never materialized  the trump administration would look at easing sanctions against russia for her part   kremlin linked lawyer natalia  veselnitskaya said the meeting had commenced with high hopes  she began by raising the issue of the obama era sanctions against the russians  known as the magnitsky act  with the hint that veselnitskaya would provide dirt on clinton  trump jr  promised to revisit the sanctions  looking ahead  if we come to power  we can return to this issue and think what to do about it   trump jr  told veselnitskaya   i understand our side may have messed up  but it ll take a long time to get to the bottom of it  source  newsweekveselnitskaya didn t actually have any information for jr   at least not during that meeting  but the intent was pretty clear  and while it s true that intent  even if proven  is not quite the smoking gun mueller is looking for  trump sr  s actions give special emphasis to this alleged promise  trump reluctantly signed a bill increasing sanctions against russia and he s refusing to enforce it in the wake of the indictments and of impending indictments  the fact that veselnitskaya is willing to testify should have trump jr   and sr   shaking in his    boots featured image via pool getty images
