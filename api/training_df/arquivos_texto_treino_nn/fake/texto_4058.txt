trump has been very clear for the last week or so   he will not accept the results of election night if he s not the winner  he even said at a rally in ohio  i would like to promise and pledge  to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the united states  that i will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election   if i win  he also told chris wallace  the moderator of the final presidential debate  that he will keep us all in suspense until election night is over  and he s made noises about contesting the results if hillary wins  presumably because there s no way  crooked hillary  could win in his world he s in for a shocker  though  election law doesn t really allow a candidate to just contest election results because he s butthurt over losing  we have  states that allow losing candidates to call for recounts  and half of those have  trigger margins   where a recount is automatically triggered when the vote is within those margins they re typically very narrow  though  if trump is hoping that automatic recounts will be triggered in some of the battleground states  he will probably be badly disappointed  if he thinks he can just say   i don t like the results in that state  please recount   because he thinks that s what al gore did in   he s got another think coming  despite that  he s actually said  if al gore and george bush had agreed three weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount  then there would be no supreme court case  i m being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters  the truth there is that florida s results were so close that their automatic recount was triggered  that  in turn  led to the longest  most annoying dramatic presidential election imaginable electoral votes are sent on to the senate for certification in early january  and then the senate president  who s actually joe biden  signs off  it s not likely that very many in congress will want to help draw out trump s drama if the election s results are clear in their view  which very well could be different from  clear  in trump s view  trump has taken a ton of flak for his cries of  rigged   and for his statements that he might not accept the results if he loses  that could be true even if he loses bigly  despite his claims of being willing to accept a clear result  he ll no doubt make noises about sending investigators to all the battleground states that went to hillary to check for the widespread fraud he ll be sure gave her the win  he won t concede  which many don t like  even sen  john mccain  who lost to obama in  and had to swallow that loss and give a concession speech  says  i had a duty to concede  and i did so without reluctance  a concession isn t just an exercise in graciousness  it is an act of respect for the will of the american people  a respect that is every american leader s first responsibility  trump isn t a leader  though  he s a narcissistic toddler who plans on screaming and crying and stomping his feet in front of all of america on nov   if he loses  he ll have so much fun watching paul ryan  possibly alongside mitch mcconnell  give his concession speech for him featured image by mark makela via getty images
