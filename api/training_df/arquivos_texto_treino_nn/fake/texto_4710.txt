if you listen to conservatives  big money interests like the banks have been unfairly attacked by progressives like senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren  according to them  the system isn t rigged and progressives are just being conspiracy theorists but now a massive plot inside one of america s biggest banks has been exposed  and the obama administration is going to make them pay for what they ve done   wells fargo employees are going to be fired  after it was exposed that they have been secretly signing up thousands of customers for accounts they didn t ask for  they did it so they could collect fees and add to their earnings  from cnn money the phony accounts earned the bank unwarranted fees and allowed wells fargo employees to boost their sales figures and make more money  wells fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses   richard cordray  director of the consumer financial protection bureau  said in a statement now  the consumer financial protection bureau  cfpb   a government agency created by president obama and in part credited to senator warren  is stepping in to make the bank pay  wells fargo will have to pay full restitution to the victims of its greed  including annual fees  interest charges  and overdraft protection fees that it deceitfully collected the bank has entered into an agreement with cfpb to pay   million in fines  and   million in a refund to its customers it s worth remembering that republicans   backed by donations from the banking and financial industry   have tried repeatedly to attack and defund cfpb  despite the agency being solely dedicated to consumer rights  as opposed to industry concerns  as in other government departments like the notoriously pro industry department of interior   the supposedly populist right has still opposed it to his credit  not only has obama defended cfpb  he has argued again and again that congress should fund it and allow it to stand up for consumers featured image via youtube
