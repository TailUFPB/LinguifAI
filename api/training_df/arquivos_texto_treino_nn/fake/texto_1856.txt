donald trump decided to bomb syria on wednesday in response to a chemical attack on the syrian people  watching the new reports  i couldn t help but think of an article i wrote just last week about a warning from noam chomsky that now looks like more of a prediction in an interview with alternet  chomsky said that if trump s approval ratings continue to plummet we should be ready for  the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act  which can change the country instantly  to be clear  by  staged or alleged terrorist attack   chomsky doesn t necessarily mean fake  speaking to truthout just days later  the noted scholar explained that trump could simply take advantage of the situation should an attack occur and  exploit it  if that happens  we can expect that the trump bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to american security  or if there is one  exploiting it   or  perhaps  scapegoating the most vulnerable  immigrants  muslims  welfare recipients  one of reagan s disgusting techniques   and other available targets   chomsky explained   that could turn very ugly  it could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist bertram gross predicted  years ago  or worse  and then comes syria  while we are still sorting out all the details  one thing is for certain  trump doesn t give a damn about syrian babies  if he was worried about these people  he wouldn t have tried repeatedly to stop all syrian refugees from entering the country as part of his bigoted muslim ban so  if trump didn t decide to bomb syria because he was  heartbroken and outraged  over the deaths of these  beautiful babies   why would he do it  simple  chomsky already answered this question  he did it because nothing galvanizes a country and boosts approval ratings like a war  and it s working naturally  trump s supporters think bombing syria was the greatest way ever to show the world who has the biggest   ahem   hands  but even democrats  including house minority leader nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer  are backing the move  sens  john mccain and lindsey graham  who have both staunchly opposed trump since the very beginning  are applauding trump s retaliation against assad as well trump s actions in syria also provide another golden opportunity  trump and russia get to pretend they re mad at each other  and  of course  that will totally prove that they weren t colluding to steal the presidential election it is also worth noting that trump s airstrikes were largely a publicity stunt  trump warned russia of the impending attack about an hour before the first bombs started flying  and according to abc  russia warned assad  as a result  most of the equipment and personnel held at the target air base were gone by the time the assault actually began this is exactly what chomsky warned us about a week ago  trump looked at the atrocities taking place in syria and saw a way to boost his popularity because he s desperate  it s all so transparent  it s sickening featured image via mario tama getty images
