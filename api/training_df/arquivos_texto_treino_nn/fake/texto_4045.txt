if you ve at all been watching the news coverage of donald trump rallies lately  you ve likely noticed the use of an upbeat pop song from the late   for some reason or another  the trump campaign is using the backstreet boys  i want it that way  well  guess what  just like with pretty much every other artist that has asked trump to stop using their music  so are the backstreet boys  they don t want to be associated  whatsoever  with his campaign according to steven trachtenbroit  a publicist for the group   did not approve this and we are not associated with the trump camp  that statement was issued on october   yet  the trump campaign can still be heard playing that song at rallies  it s become pretty obvious that trump has no respect for the music he s using nor the artists who created it  this pretty much keeps in line with his inability to honor contracts and respect  well  anyone when music is used  it gives the implication that the artist and musicians that created the music approve of the message being delivered by any particular candidate you ll often hear hillary clinton use katy perry or sara bareilles  but they have both openly come out in support of hillary  and clearly don t have a problem with the former secretary of state utilizing their songs unfortunately for trump  he s pretty much left with the music of kid rock and ted nugent if he wants to find music to play at his rallies it comes down to asking permission and or when asked to stop using music  to actually stop using the music  trump is so quick to sue  but doesn t seem to think the same rules apply to him  this is yet another reason he needs to be kept as far away from the white house as possible featured photo by ethan miller  joe raedle getty images
