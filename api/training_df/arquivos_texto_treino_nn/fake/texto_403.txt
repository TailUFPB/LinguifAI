it s   and lynchings of black people still happen  just as they did during jim crow  case in point  how an  year old boy in new hampshire nearly lost his life because of some racist white teens who hung him from a tree with a rope  luckily  the child was able to remove the rope himself and make it home the whole incident started when the victim  a claremont  new hampshire resident was playing outside  the teens in question allegedly hurled racist slurs at the child  who is biracial in a   white town  and threw rocks and sticks at him  things escalated when they all stood on a picnic table and took turns putting the rope of a tire swing around their necks  then  they took the child and  according to lorrie slattery  a grandmother of one of the kids present  took the child and said  the  teenagers  said   look at this   supposedly putting the rope around their necks   slattery said   one boy said to  her grandson    let s do this   and then pushed him off the picnic table and hung him  he swung three times before he was able to get down  and wound up having to be flown to a hospital for life saving treatment  what is most appalling is how little national media attention this is getting  further  claremont police chief mark chase wants to make sure these horrific little racists are  protected  due to their  mistakes   he won t even say whether or not there will be criminal charges  and certainly is not releasing their names  in fact  the only reason this is getting any attention at all is because the boy s mother  cassandra merlin  posted the following images on social media this is a story that needs to blow up nationwide until this child receives justice  these attempted murdering racists need to be thrown in jail for the foreseeable future and charged with a hate crime  i won t hold my breath on it  but spread it far and wide  make it go national until they have no choice but to act it s the least we can all do featured image via screen capture from the root
