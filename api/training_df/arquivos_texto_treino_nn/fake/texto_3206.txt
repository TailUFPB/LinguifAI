donald trump is now saying that he knows more about computer hacking than the experts at the cia and our other intelligence agencies during an interview with the new york times prior to a new year s eve party at mar a lago  trump once again defended russia and putin by questioning the validity of an assessment by the intelligence community concluding that russia meddled with our political process  i just want them to be sure because it s a pretty serious charge   trump said before invoking the lack of weapons of mass destruction in iraq   if you look at the weapons of mass destruction  that was a disaster  and they were wrong  so i want them to be sure  i think it s unfair if they don t know  but that s not exactly true  former cia official tyler drumheller said in  that the bush administration ignored intelligence concluding that iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction  when presented with the assessment  bush and his team refused to believe it and went to war in iraq anyway so when trump blames the intelligence community for getting wmds in iraq wrong  it s inaccurate  they actually got it right  bush was the one who was wrong by ignoring them trump didn t stop there  however  just like when he claimed to know more about isis than our generals  trump claimed to know more about hacking than the experts at our intelligence agencies  and i know a lot about hacking   trup continued   and hacking is a very hard thing to prove  so it could be somebody else  and i also know things that other people don t know  and so they cannot be sure of the situation  he basically said the same thing on twitter in december unless you catch  hackers  in the act  it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking  why wasn t this brought up before election   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    apparently  trump fancies himself a military genius and a computer expert seriously  trump needs to stop pretending he knows things that he doesn t really know  the reality is that he has never served in our military  he s an expert at draft dodging but he is certainly no expert on isis  and while he clearly knows how to use social media  trump definitely does not know how to hack a computer  hour intelligence agencies know how to trace hacks because hacking leaves traces and signatures that can be used to determine where the hack originated that s how we know russia hacked us  it s incredibly dangerous for trump to claim that he knows all this stuff and that he knows more than the experts  because then he can undermine the experts all the time and his gullible supporters will believe him instead of the facts  which is what trump has been doing for over a year and a half now  if trump knows more about something  it s being a con artist  he s been doing that for decades so he s total pro featured image via drew angerer getty images
