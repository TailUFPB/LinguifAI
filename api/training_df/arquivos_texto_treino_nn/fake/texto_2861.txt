andrew puzder  trump s nominee for secretary of labor  hasn t had his confirmation hearing yet  but he ll probably end up getting confirmed despite opposition from pro worker democrats and labor groups  that s unfortunate  because he was once a part of a group with a ridiculous name  the job creators network  this group is anything but pro job creation  as they push all sorts of right wing  anti worker propaganda that s been shown to harm the economy and jobs according to a report in the nation  jcn pushes employers to pepper their employees with anti government  pro big business ideology  and while they don t specifically have their employers hold guns to their workers  heads to force them to pay attention to this stuff  they encourage employers to send out  government policy  emails  stuff paycheck envelopes with flyers  run their videos during team building meetings and other company exercises  and post notices and infographics around the workplace  where they can easily see it and read it in other words  this group that puzder belonged to until just recently works to ensure employees don t have much of a choice but to pay attention to at least some of their stuff and their stuff is insidious  for instance  their website  informationstation org  has a film that ominously depicts cartoon workers disappearing into thin air and getting replaced with robots  it talks about how minimum wage hikes in california and new york could kill   jobs and   jobs  respectively  it also says that   million jobs could disappear if we raise the federal minimum wage to   per hour what it doesn t say is that the   million number is the uppermost number in a range derived by the right wing american action forum  and that the low end is   million it certainly doesn t mention anything whatsoever about higher minimum wages having a positive effect on jobs  like what the ceo of wetzel s pretzels noticed in california after their minimum wage went up watch the spin below jcn also paints minimum wage earners as less than deserving of a living wage  an infographic neatly informs workers that over half of minimum wage earners are ages    that  percent of them are part time workers  that   percent have never been married  and   percent have not graduated high school  these statistics are true  but they re using them in very deceptive ways to push an anti minimum wage message and that message is quite clear  minimum wage earners don t deserve a living wage  and since all raising it will do is destroy your job  you should vote for people who don t want to raise the minimum wage they paint the new overtime rule as a job killer  too  and on and on it goes   all of this is stuff that employees at many companies are forced to watch or read  according to the nation s report  this propaganda effort has actually effected dramatic changes in the way workers see these issues  which  in turn  affects how they vote this bullshit is why we have such terrible income inequality  jcn is selling the very myths that have created such a problem with income inequality and stagnant wages  and harms the workers they claim they want to protect  if any of this was going to actually work  it would have worked by now  it s had over  years to work and puzder belonged to this group until at least december  although jcn claims he never belonged  we re about to have a secretary of labor who isn t just in favor of these policies  but appears to have supported forcing workers to view propaganda  and outright lies  for the purpose of brainwashing them so the so called  job creators  can continue to fatten their wallets  and for the purpose of getting them to vote republican featured image by jason kempin via getty images for dream foundation
