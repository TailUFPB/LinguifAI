when donald trump pulled a terror attack in sweden out of his ass at a florida rally over the weekend  he tried to cover his lie by saying he was referencing a documentary about rising crime in sweden  that documentary blames sweden s immigrant and refugee population for the crime  and fox news  tucker carlson ran a portion of an interview between filmmaker ami horowitz and a couple of swedish police officers from that documentary and what horowitz did with it has these two officers in complete shock  horowitz says that muslim refugees are responsible for a sharp increase in gun violence and rape  which is the basis of his documentary  one officer says that the interview was about areas with high rates of crime  but there was no focus on migration or immigration  we don t stand behind it  it shocked us  he has edited the answers  we were answering completely different questions in the interview  this is bad journalism  paranoia and racism generally make for bad journalism  but fear mongering conservatives don t seem to care  tucker carlson should have known better than to air a segment to push the right s anti immigrant agenda  but he didn t  and horowitz is trying to defend his  investigation  despite the horror his own interview subjects have expressed over the editing  he even claims he told them this would be about migrants and immigrants but horowitz also claims that the officers are the ones who used the term  no go zones  to describe communities that have large muslim immigrant populations  for the record   no go zones  has been a rumor circulating around conservative media for quite some time   they like to claim that these zones are only open to muslims  and some of them are so strict that any non muslim caught there faces punishment under sharia law  and outside of the country s law  local police are said to avoid these areas entirely it s also a flat out lie but horowitz tried to reclaim some credibility by saying his  record stands for itself  i ve never had a subject claim  and certainly not prove  that i ever misled them or ever doctored the footage  it s never happened before  so  my record stands for itself  and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself  the big question is  what possible motive would these two officers have to discredit horowitz and fox news  horowitz says their bosses pressured them to disavow the interviews so they wouldn t be labeled racists  that s not likely true because  if nothing else  the data shows that despite the spike in migrants in sweden over the last several years  crime has not similarly risen  let alone skyrocketed you have a problem when your interview subjects say   that s not what we said  that s not what we meant  that s not even what we were asked about   horowitz and carlson owe the world an apology  but it seems that conservative personalities increasingly believe personal responsibility only applies to other people featured image by mark wilson via getty images
