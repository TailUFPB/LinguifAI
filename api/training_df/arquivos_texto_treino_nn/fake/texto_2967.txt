presidential commutations and pardons are not at all uncommon  however  they can sometimes be controversial  president obama s commutations and pardons are no different  case in point   his commutation of former army soldier chelsea manning s  year prison sentence for her activities regarding leaking secrets to wikileaks manning was charged and prosecuted as bradley manning  and then  after a great struggle  underwent gender reassignment surgery in prison and changed her name to chelsea manning  there was plenty of evidence that  like many transgender people  manning was treated inhumanely in the military prison  she has attempted suicide on two occasions  and it is reported that she did not receive proper care after her surgery  she has also been subjected to solitary confinement with president obama s action  the cruel and unusual punishment manning has been subjected to will come to an end on may     manning will have been in jail for roughly seven years at that time this also may help bring wikileaks founder julian assange to justice  as last week wikileaks tweeted the following  if obama grants manning clemency assange will agree to us extradition despite clear unconstitutionality of doj case  while there is no way of knowing if this is true or not  considering who julian assange is  it would certainly be a step in the right direction of course  conservatives are hating on the president s decision  senate majority whip john cornyn of texas tried to say that president obama s using his power in this way is bad for the cause of criminal justice reform  i think on the larger issue of criminal justice reform  the president is really undermining our political capital by granting clemency at an unprecedented rate  people say  well why should we change the sentencing rules in criminal justice reform if the president can just do it with a flick of his pen  this is  of course  a load of bs  but facts and republicans don t mix very well these days  anyone with a brain knows that an overhaul of the so called  justice  system is needed  full stop  a few commutations and pardons here and there will not change that fact good on you  mr  president  for doing the right thing  we sure will miss you featured image via flickr
