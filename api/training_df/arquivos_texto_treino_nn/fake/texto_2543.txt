donald trump has just come up with a new way to make his failing administration even worse  and it s going to make most americans sick to their stomachs trump is not only seeking to hire more horrible people to work for him  but what he wants these sought after employees to do is even worse   he wants them to solely focus on his social media promotion  cnn s jim acosta reported this horrifying new addition to the trump administration on twitter seriously  the last thing this country needs is more people tweeting and posting from trump s accounts  most of us have already had more than we can stand  while dan scavino has been almost singlehandedly managing trump s tweets as the narcissistic potus comes up with them  having staffers to help him out will certainly allow him to cover more ground  acosta reported even more staffing decisions up ahead  the white house is expected to make more high profile hiring decisions soon as a search is under way for a new communications director  white house press secretary sean spicer is currently handling both jobs  roles that are typically carried out by two staffers  while more visibility and transparency isn t a bad thing under normal circumstances  most of us know that this is a horrible idea for trump s administration  trump has already been extremely reckless in his social media use   just take a look below at some of trump s security gaffes from this weekend alone clearly  giving trump more exposure is far from a good thing as he s sure to turn the highest office in the country into a circus  if anything  having more hands in his social media operations is only going to allow him to destroy america s future faster than ever  making us all look incredibly stupid at the same time featured image via matthew cavanaugh   getty images
