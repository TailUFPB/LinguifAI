donald trump accused the media of covering up terrorist attacks and promptly got his ass handed to him by anderson cooper on cnn on monday during remarks to u s  central command  trump claimed that terrorist attacks are happening all over europe all the time but the media is allegedly not reporting on them just to keep americans in the dark  all over europe it s happening   trump said   it s gotten to a point where it s not even being reported  and in many cases  the very  very dishonest press doesn t want to report it  they have their reasons and you understand that  however  when trump released a list of terrorist attacks that the media has supposedly ignored  news agencies everywhere laughed the list of  attacks includes those that occurred in san bernardino  paris  orlando  and nice  just to name a few  the problem is that the media covered these attacks thoroughly on a daily basis for quite some time  and there is video tape to prove it during his show on monday night  cooper played a montage of himself covering many of these attacks and he blasted trump for lying  not only did we cover many of the attacks on that list  we covered them heavily  i know  because i was on the ground reporting a number of them  cnn was on the ground in ottawa  canada  when a gunman killed someone at the tomb of the unknown soldier  i was in orlando  i flew there right after the news broke  december   that was on the list  san bernardino  i was there   people killed and  wounded in coordinated attacks  this was just a month after i reported on the carnage in paris  where terrorists killed  people and wounded many others  to be sure  this program did not cover each and every incident on the list  however other programs  as well as cnn international  covered most if not all of them  most of them exhaustively  here s the video via youtube donald trump has told lie after lie after lie since taking over the white house and his attacks against the media are childish  there is literally thousands of hours of video of news reporters and anchors covering all of the attacks trump put on the list  at this point  the media really should take action against trump  his attacks constitute slander and the media definitely has a strong case trump is trying to hype up terrorist attacks in order to scare americans into supporting his unconstitutional muslim ban  and he is trying to make it sound like the media is helping the terrorists  if anyone is helping terrorists it s donald trump  his muslim ban is literally being used as propaganda by terrorist organizations as a recruiting tool  he should be ashamed of himself  and if and when a terrorist attack does occur against this country  trump will be to blame featured image  screenshot
