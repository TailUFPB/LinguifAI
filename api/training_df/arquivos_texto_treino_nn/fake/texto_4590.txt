steve cortes  an avid trump supporter  appeared on am joy where he claimed that donald trump s campaign is  an incredibly non racist campaign   well  any fan of the show s host joy reid knows that she is not going to just accept a claim like that on her show  what you seem to be saying  is that it is okay to laugh at this idea of people who are outright racists who are part of the coalition of donald trump   reid said   you seem to be saying  we don t care  we want to ridicule the idea that this is bad  and we don t care if it grows our coalition  cortes upset that reid brought up david duke support s for trump s campaign because trump has renounced duke s endorsement  cortes apparently doesn t seem to understand that duke s endorsement itself does not necessarily matter  the fact that the white supremacist movement in the united states supports trump because of his policy proposals and rhetoric  the only true way to actually denounce these people would be to scrap trump s entire platform and adopt one that racists would not be fond of  that  or drop out of the race altogether cortes then says that compared to previous republican elections  trump s campaign is incredibly non racist  i would remind you that donald trump  particularly compared to past republican presidential candidates  is running an incredibly non racist campaign   cortes said   he s gone into the barrio and he is going into the inner city and you can laugh  but we are appealing directly to people of color  the rest of the panelists on the show laughed at cortes  assertion  then why is it that donald trump is the most disliked and despised republican candidate among people of color that we have had  probably in a generation   reid asked  people who say that racism is not central to this campaign  let me explain this to you   wrtiter and journalist tour  stated   this is a campaign that started with birtherism  continues with the wall  we re going to ban all muslims and we re at war economically with the chinese  is there any person of color who the campaign is not at war with  i can t find one  studies have shown that roughly half of the republican party s membership is racist  there is no getting around that fact  trump s campaign has appealed to that base throughout his campaign with vile  even hateful rhetoric  no matter what trump s supporters say those are the facts you can watch the segment below featured image from video screenshot
