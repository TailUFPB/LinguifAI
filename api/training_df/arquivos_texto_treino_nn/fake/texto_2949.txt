a former evangelical christian is ripping conservatives for repealing the affordable care act bruce horst knows what it is like to have pre existing conditions while trying to purchase health insurance  prior to obamacare  insurance companies refused to cover him  leaving him and his family vulnerable if a health crisis ever arose  but because of obamacare  people with pre existing conditions can no longer be denied health insurance obamacare literally saved horst and his family from the threat of bankruptcy over a medical issue but last week during a late night vote  republicans in the senate and house voted to repeal the healthcare law that covers over  million americans and conservatives cheered well  that didn t sit well with horst  who despite being an atheist  probably knows the bible better than most of these so called evangelical  christians  do so horst took these fake christians to the woodshed on facebook for applauding the death sentence republicans just handed to millions of human beings  i have the simple conviction that it is immoral to give a person medical help according to how much they can pay   horst wrote   or maybe it s because of what i ve read in the bible  in  i had been a conservative evangelical christian for all of my adult life  i began to realize that others around me despised the thought of allowing people like me the benefit of affordable health insurance  for some reason  all of the christians that i knew thought that offering health insurance to people like me would put them at some kind of a disadvantage that they were not willing to accept  frankly  they had been lied to so they believed those  others  were going to get healthcare and make their own healthcare inadequate as a christian  i believed that i would be judged on the final judgment day on how i took care of the  least of these  as described in the bible book of matthew  chapter   i came to the sober realization that christians around me had no such convictions  if they didn t believe jesus  words as recorded in the bible  why should i  then one day i discovered i could no longer believe any of it while conservatives complain that not as many people are attending church anymore  it turns out their hypocrisy and heartlessness is one of the reasons why people such as horst have stopped believing  stripping millions of americans of the healthcare they need just further proved that horst was right to leave the church when he did horst went on to call out republicans in congress and blasted how the hypocritical conservatives are when they claim to be  pro life  i understand that congress is about to take away the healthcare coverage of about  million of our fellow americans  and they are doing this at the insistence of conservative evangelical christians  i have friends who are alive today because of obamacare  probably all of us do  to me  this proves my christian friends are not pro life  but instead they ve been told they are as a matter of manipulation  probably to keep them putting money in the offering plate  or voting for the  right  candidate  one thing is clear to me  they are not really pro life i don t know what congress is going to do with healthcare in the next few days  i would love to be surprised to find that president trump has convinced congress to extend healthcare coverage to all  and i would be among the first to be grateful for this  while even if this does occur  if my christian friends insist that healthcare only be given to people based on their ability to pay for such care  i would have to believe that the jesus of the bible would say to them   depart from me  i never knew you   just like he did in matthew  in other words  conservatives are going to hell for condemning millions of americans to suffer  it s not what jesus would do and any conservative who says otherwise is only pretending to be a christian featured image  i ytimg com
