former national security adviser michael flynn gave donald trump something to worry about last night  when he announced that he would testify on the trump campaign s possible ties to russia in exchange for immunity  as more experts weigh in on this  it s not looking good for trump at all  according to a former top intelligence official  the only way flynn will get the immunity he s seeking is if he gives up trump jeremy bash  former counsel to the house intelligence committee and the ex chief of staff for both the cia and department of defense  weighed in on flynn in an interview for msnbc  for the justice department to agree to give somebody like him immunity  it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain  who is higher up in the food chain  higher than the national security adviser  there s really only one person  and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top  as of right now  flynn s offer to testify for immunity has not been accepted by investigators  which makes bash wonder  immunity from what  what is he in jeopardy of being prosecuted for   bash advised that flynn could be prosecuted under the espionage act for getting classified briefings for the trump campaign  bash said  that is a major felony  and that is essentially treason  it would not surprise me at all if what the prosecutors said to flynn s lawyers is   we haven t reached any conclusions on the russian matter  but we have your guy dead to rights for not registering under the laws requiring registration as a foreign agent and second of conspiring to engage in kidnapping   you better come in and make a deal   bash made sure to reiterate that investigators will not accept flynn s offer unless he gave up information about crimes trump had committed  bash said  you can only give somebody immunity  full immunity  if it s worth it  they have to believe it s worth it in this case  you can watch this interview  which is terrible news for trump  below featured image via scott olson   getty images
