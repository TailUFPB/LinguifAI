it s no secret that speaker of the house paul ryan is spineless   that s a reputation he s earned for himself throughout his entire career  but thanks to an audio clip from october  that has just resurfaced  everyone is now being reminded how unreliable and weak ryan truly is when it comes to holding to his beliefs coming at a time when ryan is receiving tons of negative criticism due to his celebration that the cbo report on the american health care act is going to cost millions of americans to lose their health insurance  this looks pretty bad for the house speaker  the footage from october  was posted by none other than breitbart  and it shows ryan distancing himself from trump after the corrupt businessman s misogynistic comments on the infamous access hollywood footage  ryan can be heard saying  i am not going to defend donald trump  not now  not in the future  i m not going to be campaigning with him for the next  days  i m doing what i think is best for you  the members  not what s best for me  i m going to focus my time on campaigning for house republicans  ryan then trashed trump  suggesting that he was an awful nominee that pretty much had no chance  he stated the only way the gop might survive would be to preserve a house majority  it s amazing how easily she could be beaten  we need a check on hillary clinton  if donald trump and mike pence don t win the presidency  you can listen to ryan trash trump below in response to the leaked audio  ryan spokesman brendan buck said  the world is well aware of this history  and obviously a lot has happened since then  yes  a lot has happened since then   but ryan is still spineless as ever and is now kissing trump s ass  the gop should be ashamed of him featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
