the trouble with quotes on the internet is that you don t know if they re genuine  or something  today is abraham lincoln s birthday  and to honor him  the gop tweeted out an image of the statue in the lincoln memorial with a quote what a respectable way to commemorate one of the greatest presidents this country ever saw  there s just one problem  the quote isn t lincoln s  it s most likely from a  ad for a book by edward j  stieglitz  he  in turn  was given credit for the phrase in  former illinois governor adlai stevenson also used that quote  but there s no evidence that lincoln ever said it  and the gop looks really stupid the funny thing is that one could assume the general population wouldn t know whether the quote is lincoln s or not  in the age of google  however  one has to be far more careful about attributing quotes and anything else  because someone will inevitably look it up and make you look stupid if it s wrong so twitter decided to make the gop look really stupid  and what they came up with has us rolling                             stop making fools of yourselves  guys  we re going to bust our ribs laughing at you for the rest of eternity give or take an eon featured image via screen captures
