buckle up  elizabeth warren  continuing her crusade for the little guy  wrote a letter to fbi director james comey over their transparency with hillary s emails  because they didn t have that same transparency when investigating the big banks  in fact  they usually don t release anything when there s no indictment  they changed their standards for releasing information with hillary  and warren wants to know why that same standard can t be used on wall street executives  your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former secretary of state hillary clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis these new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the fcic referrals  if secretary clinton s email server was of sufficient  interest  to establish a new fbi standard of transparency  then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the  financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency  she s more than right  if hillary s emails are of sufficient interest to release as much information as possible  then why isn t the information on those who have been proven to cause harm to millions of americans by crashing the economy of the same interest  it should actually be of bigger interest than the witch hunt against hillary the fbi initially released information in response to several foia requests from the press  and sent more material to congress  however  they didn t send over every last  little  tiny bit  the chairman of the house oversight committee  jason chaffetz  r ut   incensed that they d spurn him like that  subpoenaed the full file earlier this week republicans all over congress are pitching a hell of a tantrum over the fbi not releasing every last scrap of paper  but they really couldn t care less that the fbi didn t release anything after the department of justice decided not to prosecute eleven bankers that had a hand in destroying the economy  why simple  when it s hillary clinton  everything has to be changed  she must be guilty of something  republicans and hillary haters know things  when it s people who actually harmed america  though  meh  not that important why nobody was prosecuted  here s hoping that warren s letter has an impact on comey  because we deserve to know exactly why bankers weren t prosecuted featured image by jessica kourkounis getty images
