former mexican president vicente fox has never been a fan of donald trump  during the  presidential campaign  he routinely went after trump s disparaging remarks about mexican immigrants  and infamously said that mexico would not  pay for that f  king wall  now  president fox is using trump s own favorite platform   twitter   to troll him over the absolute incompetence coming out of the white house and indeed from trump himself   fox  like anyone who has paid attention to donald trump during the campaign and since his ascent to the white house  knows that this presidential run wasn t about running the nation  it was about donald trump s insatiable ego  his insecurity  and his constant quest for more money and power that has been a lifelong pattern  running for president was the only thing left  president fox tweeted   realdonaldtrump  don t go all weepy on me  you ve got what you wanted  you re the center of attention  but not the kind you wanted  right   vicente fox quesada   vicentefoxque  may     it seems that trump thought that if he got to be president  he wouldn t have to  well  govern  he likely thought he d be busy putting gold toilets in the white house  taunting democrats  and telling big crowds of supporters how great he is largely  that is what trump is doing  after all  he held a victory tour of rallies  and held a dueling event the night of the white house correspondents  dinner so that he could mock the so called  washington elite   and  of course  we all see his twitter feed  which is full of mockery and ridicule however  during all of this  we see a white house riddled with scandal after scandal of trump s own making  the russia investigation is heating up  and no matter how many times trump and his supporters say it is  fake news   it isn t going away  even members of trump s own republican party are floating the idea of impeachment  president fox is right   trump is getting attention  but definitely not the kind he wanted featured image via mark wilson getty images
