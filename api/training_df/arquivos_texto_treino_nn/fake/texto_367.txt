a firefighter in ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty   a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for trump  about rescuing black people if it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n ggers   franklin township firefighter tyler roysdon says he would save the dog  which is  more important than  all those african americans he hates according to roysdon s facebook  likes   he is a fan of donald trump  duck dynasty  and far right facebook group  uncle sam s misguided children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post  which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things  it s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials  recently  a franklin township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media   upon gaining knowledge of this information  fire chief steve bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed   the firefighter was suspended without pay until the board of township trustees could meet to determine a course of action   chief bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees   termination of any township employee requires a vote by the board of trustees  it s unclear if roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die  but this is absolutely something that should be investigated featured image via screengrab
