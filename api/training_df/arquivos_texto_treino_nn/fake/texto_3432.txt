does anyone remember when trump  at the republican national convention  asked russia if they could possibly find the   or so emails that hillary supposedly deleted from her private server  many republicans who wish that the sane world would drop the whole  russian hack  thing don t  but the rest of us who are grounded in reality do  and tonight  on  the daily show   obama directly accused trump of being responsible for russia s interference obama spent some time talking about the aca and why it shouldn t be repealed  but that s not really what makes this episode a must see  obama went so far as to blame trump s request to russia however much his sycophantic dick blowers were when they claimed he was joking at the rnc for the results of our election noah asked obama about the intelligence on russia  and the rush to get it out  and obama said  hen the dnc got hacked  we immediately assigned our intelligence community  our law enforcement  to investigate what had happened  and we determined and announced in october that it was the consensus of the all the intelligence agencies and law enforcement that organizations affiliated with russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the dnc materials that were being leaked so that was a month before the election  this was not a secret  and the reason that i have called for a review is really just to gather all the threads of the investigations  the intelligence work that has been done over many months so that the public and our elected representatives  going forward  can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future  he went on to explain how this wasn t a big surprise  whatever trump decides to tweet about it  during the rnc  it was like king cheeto assumed that russia already had the   emails the conspiracy asshats claimed were missing from hillary s server  and was blatantly asking them for assistance in bringing those to light so he could win our election in fact  if nothing else  there s an extremely good chance that fbi director james comey s letter to congress about whether to re open the investigation into hillary s emails  or not  decided the election not the american people  as we are supposed to do watch obama tell it like it is below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
