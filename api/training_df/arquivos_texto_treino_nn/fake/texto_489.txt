donald trump just threw a match on this tinder box of a nation when he decided to pardon former maricopa county  arizona sheriff joe arpaio  this guy is a racist who was convicted in court of contempt for refusing to follow an order to stop racially profiling and detaining people  arpaio terrorized that county for years with impunity and without consequence  and now it seems that he will be able to carry on being awful now  there is even more nefarious news out there regarding this  it seems that trump tried to get jeff sessions  department of justice to let arpaio off the hook by dropping the case against him altogether  it seems that sessions told trump that such an action would not be the appropriate thing to do  having no other choice  trump waited until arpaio was convicted  and then decided to wait for the perfect time to issue a pardon  one white house official says of trump s thinking on the arpaio matter  we knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come  of course  we mustn t forget that arpaio and trump have been political partners in crime ever since they started the birtherism nonsense  in which they promoted the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states  they both doggedly tried to prove that the nation s first black president was not a legitimate commander in chief   all because he s black in short  they are two racist peas in a pod  so of course trump wasn t going to let his man go to jail  even though if there was ever someone who deserves to rot in jail  it s this racist  abusive former sheriff one good thing came out of this  though  it showed that when trump is willing to do something truly egregious  the department of justice has maintained at least a little independence and is willing to push back  however  in this instance  said pushback had no real effect come on  congress  mueller  whomever   please get rid of this lawless president while we still have a nation left featured image via ralph freso getty images
