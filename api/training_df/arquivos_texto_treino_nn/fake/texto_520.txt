according to republican lawmaker from idaho  it is  completely plausible  that former president barack obama was responsible for staging the racist mayhem to took over the streets of charlottesville  virginia  because  of course it s obama s fault  everything is always obama s fault  i m not saying it is true  but i am suggesting that it is completely plausible  bryan zollinger  a state representative for idaho falls  wrote on social media  we know that many protesters were soros funded and we also know that donald trump is not a racist  the man was in the public spotlight for   years with zero allegations of racism   zollinger continued  clearly ignoring the reality and hanging onto alternative facts  he then blamed the media for choosing to  push this narrative  zollinger s facebook post linked to an article published by the american thinker entitled charlottesville and its aftermath  what if it was a setup  which claimed that obama  george soros and the mayor of charlottesville were responsible for staging the violent chaos we saw play out in charlottesville  the conflagration in charlottesville is beginning to feel like a set up  perhaps weeks or months in the planning   the author of the article wrote   we know that obama and his inner circle have set up a war room in his d c  home to plan and execute resistance to the trump administration and his legislative agenda  the idaho statesman contacted zollinger to see just what he had to say for himself and his response was just as pathetic as you d expect  in hindsight  maybe it was a mistake to post it   he said   i didn t mean for it to ruffle any feathers   zoros said before reiterating that the absurd theory was indeed a  plausible  theory we all knew it was just a matter of time before republicans found a way to try to blame president obama for the stampede of hatred we saw in virginia  but we also know that it is the gop and their bigoted  president  that has inspired the new wave of white supremacists with nazi ideologies we are seeing today  conservatives are the ones who built this  but naturally  it s obama s fault  because its always  obama s fault  always image via the idaho statesmanfeatured image via scott olson getty images
