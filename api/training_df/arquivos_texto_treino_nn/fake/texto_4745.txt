a new poll released from the washington post and surveymonkey has people scratching their heads  for the first time in four months  donald trump is leading hillary clinton   to  percent  while simultaneously losing all swing states and the red states of texas and arizona the poll  which was done from august  to september   and had close to   respondents  shows trump losing wisconsin  florida  colorado  michigan and arizona by two points to clinton  with all of them being within  points of each other    percent  texas  the reddest of all red states in the union  was nabbed by clinton with  point over trump how is that  people really  really hate donald trump a comparison of the current survey with the  texas exit poll  there was no exit poll there in   points to reasons the race appears close right now  trump is performing worse than  gop nominee john mccain among both whites and hispanics  while clinton is doing slightly better than obama so in a national poll  clinton is losing overall  but in all the states that matter  swing  and states never thought possible  texas   she s winning although trump is leading  the post  which says the poll actually shows why clinton has a clear advantage over trump  has clinton solidifying  electoral votes to trump s  with  being tossups  of those tossups  which includes  states  clinton leads in six  ties with trump in two  and trump leads in two while trump supporters may be giddy and clinton supporters worried  the post actually contends that trump is the one who should be worried overall  the results reflect trump s strategy of maximizing support in older  whiter midwestern states where his anti free trade message and appeals to national identity generally find more fertile ground  but his struggles elsewhere  including places that have long supported republicans  illustrate the challenges of that strategy in more diverse states where his stances on immigration and some other positions have turned off democrats  independents and many republicans  to win the election  trump must quickly consolidate the republican vote  with prominent republicans declaring they will not support trump and some even announcing they will back clinton  this represents a major challenge for the gop nominee  in the post surveymonkey poll  clinton is winning  percent or more of the democratic vote in  states  while trump is at or above that level in just  it s not hispanic  latino  black  or even female voters that are hurting trump s chances   it s republicans  the obama coalition  which delivered two victories to president obama in  and   have coalesced around clinton in larger numbers  but now this election has offered something unique  republicans are starting to come around to clinton with trump losing the traditional coalition and now with republicans  chances of him overtaking her are slim featured image via justin sullivan getty images
