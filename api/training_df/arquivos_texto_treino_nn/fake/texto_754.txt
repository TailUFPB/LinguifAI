when donald trump kicked off  made in america week  a few days ago  a good majority of americans pretty much rolled their eyes in disbelief  it s common knowledge that trump and his daughter ivanka manufacture a good portion of their products overseas and even use foreign workers   but when has blatant hypocrisy ever stopped trump from doing something  during the week s patriotic theme  trump decided to get in a fire truck and say  i want to make a pledge to each and every one of you  no longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules  steal our jobs  and drain our wealth   it didn t take long for someone to ridicule trump for not abiding by his own rules  democratic national committee spokesperson daniel wessel called trump out  trump is putting his own interests and profits ahead of those of american businesses and workers  instead of lecturing us  trump should try setting an example  wessel was absolutely right  most people are aware that trump almost never sticks to his word or takes his own advice in the public eye  what goes on behind the scenes is far  far worse  trump s clothing line alone is manufactured in china  bangladesh  honduras  vietnam  and india  the trump home collection has furniture made in china  turkey  and germany  ivanka s brand is made in several others  according to the daily dot  not even trump s official products can claim that they re sold using only american resources trump s official online store states that his products are   proudly made in the u s   however  what the daily dot discovered is that these products are actually sold using canadian e commerce company shopify  which was founded by two germans  once again  trump has been caught deceiving his gullible fan base  unfortunately  none of trump s fans will probably believe that their beloved  make america great again  hat was made possible only because of a company in canada featured image via ralph freso   getty images
