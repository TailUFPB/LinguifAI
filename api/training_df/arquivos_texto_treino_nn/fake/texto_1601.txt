there has long been speculation that melania trump cannot stand her husband  after all  donald trump is a bloviating  compulsive bully  if he bullies the rest of the world  chances are he does the same to his wife  what s to stop him  he likely controls her money and her access to her son  if she tried to speak out against him or leave him  she d lose both  hell  he might even be able to get her deported there s plenty of evidence out there that melania is terrified of the donald  but it seems she may be getting bolder  there is  thus far  absolutely no sign that she and her son  barron  are planning to move to the white house  the only time we see them is at a few photo ops  and when the family travels to mar a lago  she never says a word to the press  and has not executed any of the usual duties of a first lady  therefore  it should come as no surprise that melania s official twitter account liked a tweet that mocks trump s border wall plan  saying that the only wall he s been able to build is between himself and his wife  here is a screenshot of that particular like  in case someone pulls it down now  this is a pretty bold move for melania  and kudos to her or whoever had the guts to do it  as much as trump is on twitter  it s likely he d see it  especially as it gets spread around the interwebs  hopefully  he s too busy attacking political opponents  the free press  and anyone else who dares to criticize him to attack his own wife  then again  knowing trump  he won t be able to restrain himself melania  i hope you ve got good security after this one  but thanks for confirming what we already knew  you hate that man as much as we do featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
