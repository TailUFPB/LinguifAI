trump is not the only u s  leader in europe right now  former president obama is also there  and he met with german chancellor angela merkel before the big nato summit  merkel is up for re election  and obama gave her a strong endorsement  which made her christian democratic base happy  unlike trump  obama remains very popular in germany and politico  in covering this particular story  decided to throw a bit of shade in trump s direction over obama s meeting  their headline for the story reads   merkel meets popular us president before seeing trump  that was the caption on their tweet of the story as well merkel meets popular u s  president   before seeing  realdonaldtrump https   t co  via  politicoeurope pic twitter com   politico   politico  may     politico did that  and it s hilarious in light of the fact that merkel and obama continue to have a very strong relationship  while she really just can t stand donald trump  obama received a warm welcome  and the two of them discussed the lessons of the berlin wall while in front of tens of thousands of cheering germans at the  year old brandenburg gate  trump  however  was greeted curtly and coolly in brussels barely two hours later against the backdrop of the brandenburg gate  which survived wwii despite much of the rest of berlin being destroyed  obama himself threw a little shade at trump over his isolationist   america first  ideas  in this new world we live in  we can t isolate ourselves  we can t hide behind a wall  he also took aim at trump for being a narcissistic prick  if i become so convinced that  i m always right   the logical conclusion of that often ends up being great cruelty and great violence  in brussels  trump yelled at our allies again  claiming they aren t paying their fair share of defense expenses for nato  trump believes that our nato allies are shoving their expenses off on us  and doesn t understand the treaty well enough to know that s not how it works so politico decided to demonstrate what germany or at least angela merkel thinks about obama versus what she thinks about trump  trump is ridiculous  and it s clear that at least some of our allies wish we still had obama in office featured image by stefan rousseau pool via getty images
