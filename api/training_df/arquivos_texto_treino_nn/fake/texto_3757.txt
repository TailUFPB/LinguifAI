neil degrasse tyson is generally hesitates before weighing in on political matters  but when it comes to anti science politicians  he has little patience  that was evidenced on friday morning when tyson tweeted something fairly uncharacteristic about donald trump  when i meet president trump   tyson tweeted   i may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss science with him  when i meet president trump  i may first grab his crotch   to get his attention   then discuss science with him   neil degrasse tyson   neiltyson  november     that s a reference to two things  the fact that trump was caught on video bragging that women even let him grab their  pussies  because he s famous  the second  and probably most significant to tyson  is that trump seems to be anti science  tyson s not the only one to share that concern scientific researchers across the nation are concerned about the fact that trump  who s a climate change denier and has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines  will do some serious damage to scientific progress in the coming years  more than anything  scientists are concerned with trump s stated desire to cut funding to agencies like the national institute of health  the environmental protection agency  the department of education  which helps train future scientists  and the department of energy while it s doubtful tyson would actually grab trump s crotch  it s even more doubtful that our nation s most famous astrophysicist would ever get an audience with the new president elect  most of tyson s followers were all for it  but some  as captured by new century times  were not the tweet has since been removed from twitter  instead  tyson said this actually  were i to meet president trump i d discuss with him what science is and how   why it workshttps   t co   neil degrasse tyson   neiltyson  november    followers  though  were happy with his first idea  neiltyson while holding him firmly by the testicles  stonekettle   stonekettle  november    neiltyson yeah  good luck with that  at least the grabbing would ve got his attention     cathy diaz     cathyofto  november    image via dimitrios kambouris getty images
