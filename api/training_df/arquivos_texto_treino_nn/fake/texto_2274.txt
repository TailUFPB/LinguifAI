one of the house of representatives  more crazy members  steve king  is fully on board trump s train no matter how outlandish or insane he gets  in fact  steve king thinks the government needs to be  purged of all dissenters    by which he means anybody who deviates from trump s  often changing  beliefs  an article appeared on the conservative review about this  and it s obvious that king believes the only way we can move forward is to purge everyone from the white house who doesn t likewise march in lockstep with the trump train the first paragraph of that ridiculous story says  at this point in the obama administration  the newly minted messiah had full control over every nook and cranny of the executive branch  there was not one morsel of dissent  much less sabotage percolating through the ranks of former gop presidential appointees within the deep state of the various departments  fast forward eight years and president trump is at the cusp of losing control over his presidency if he doesn t immediately fire all of the obama appointees  this is evidently something on which steve king  an actual u s  representative  believes too  otherwise why would he tweet the following  realdonaldtrump needs to purge leftists from executive branch before disloyal  illegal   treasonist acts sink us  https   t co   steve king   stevekingia  march    are disloyal why  congressman king  because they don t march in lockstep with trump like you do  with vladimir putin  despite the fact that russia is our enemy  and here we thought republicans actually believed in freedom  including the freedom to  you know  have different ideas about stuff  first off  the obama administration had plenty of dissent within its ranks  for instance  congressional democrats held obama s former chief of staff  rahm emanuel  responsible for certain parts of the aca that didn t pass congress others strongly disagreed with how obama was handling syria  so   not one morsel of dissent   oh please  obama was not the dictator conservatives tried to brainwash into thinking he was as evidence of that  we have steve king  who s one of the worst right wingers we ever elected to congress  republicans are supposed to support freedom  including freedom of anyone and everyone to disagree with the  president   in this case  it s trump  who lost the popular vote  king s ideas are the opposite of freedom   in fact  the support fascism  dictatorships  and even monarchies based on the antithesis of american freedom trump should welcome dissent   it would prevent tunnel vision and help him determine a course of action that s truly beneficial to the entire country  instead  he s a dictator who only cares about how many agree with him and are willing to puff him up  king is one of those who would rather puff trump up than do what s right for freedom and the country  if nothing else  calling for a purge of dissenters from the white house should disqualify him from every government job he ll ever hold featured image via scott olson getty images
