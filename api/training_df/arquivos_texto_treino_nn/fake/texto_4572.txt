hillary clinton has had a bad two weeks  whereas it may not be her fault  rather  the fault of a bloodthirsty  spineless media   she s still suffering at the polls  her chances of winning  all across the board  have declined  the new york times currently gives clinton a  percent chance of winning the election  down from a near  percent chance at the beginning of the month  nate silver s fivethirtyeight gives her a dismal  percent chance  down from a soaring  percent just one month ago  hillary has taken a nose dive   points  in just one week alone florida  ohio  nevada and iowa  all crucial swing states  were once comfortably in clinton s camp  now  they are all in trump s camp  and continue to head in his right wing direction as nate silver puts it  democrats should panic  if polls look like this in a week  why  states that are also considered  safe  for democrats are becoming highly competitive that s not to imply the events of the weekend were necessarily catastrophic for clinton  in the grand scheme of things  they might not matter all that much  although polling from yougov suggests that clinton s health is in fact a concern to voters   but when you re only ahead by  or  points  and when some sequence of events causes you to lose another  or  points  the electoral college probabilities can shift pretty rapidly  a lot of light blue states on our map have turned pink  meaning that trump is now a narrow favorite there instead of clinton look at it this way  also  democrats rely heavily on early voter turnout  with the media overwhelmingly slamming hillary unfairly  and giving trump unprecedented bias   that could spell trouble for early voting gains for democrats because the atmosphere is more unfavorable to hillary than it is to trump illinois  michigan  minnesota  south dakota  vermont and wyoming all begin early voting in september  with  other states  including thee swing state of ohio  conducting early voting within a month  so in the next month  a third of the states will be heading to the polls already  and this election  early voting will play a key factor into how the nation will decide historically  early voting has favored the democrats in some key states  and in   percent of votes are cast before the election according to the associated press  that s up from  percent in  this election is expected to see an uptick in early voting  considering the gop is beating democrats at the registration game  democrats need to mobilize  and quickly  take for example in pennsylvania   where democrats  registration advantage has fallen by a fifth since the  election  to   voters   more than   former democrats have become republicans this year  almost three times the number of voters who made the opposite switch if hillary wants to win the election  she ll need to win pennsylvania  as it s a safeguard if she loses florida  pennsylvania is one of fourteen states that doesn t allow early voting  and hillary is holding her own due largely in part to metropolitan philadelphia and pittsburgh  however  one crucial demographic is becoming problematic  white  working class blue dogs who reside in the mid and western part of the state  with republicans gaining ground in registration  democrats should be on high alert and working diligently to register not just democrats in the metropolitan areas  but the rust belt towns and counties that usually lean democratic but are turning red then there s the enthusiasm gap  democrats were elated and fired up for president obama s candidacy  and sadly  due to the media and gop smear tactics  have turned off many of those in the obama coalition from excitement regarding hillary clinton  as president obama told black voters  he would be personally insulted if they did not show up for hillary  who polls in the mid  with black voters but like gop registrants  there is a glimmer of hope for democrats  hispanic voters  who traditionally lag  points behind whites in voter turnout  may see an opportunity to be enthusiastic and get out to vote hispanics are a part of the democratic coalition and their turnout rates have been low  about  points lower than whites or blacks in presidential elections  there is speculation that trump s rhetoric could entice hispanics to vote against him  and there is some evidence in polls that hispanic voting enthusiasm is running higher than normal  in georgia  florida and north carolina race and ethnicity are tracked on these states  voter files  so it is possible to look at the individual level data to see if hispanics are showing up at unusually higher numbers than the past democrats have the chance to get out and bring back the obama coalition to deliver a win for hillary  but they need to act fast  early voting is paramount to democrats having an early lead  and mobilizing to push back against the unfair treatment of hillary will help alleviate a bad taste in the voter s mouths heading into the november election  having  a strong lead will also inspire democrats to not give up and continue to push for a major blow out on november   but like everything else  democrats have to want it democrats  do not get discouraged  do not give up when the polling is bad  do not waste your vote on a  protest  candidate  get out  mobilize  work together  and vote for hillary clinton featured image via justin sullivan getty images
