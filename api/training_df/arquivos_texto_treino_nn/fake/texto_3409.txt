donald trump once bragged that he had  the best words  but researchers found that his speeches were at an average of about a  grade reading level  trump generally scored the lowest of all of his rivals  but  trump being trump  he s doing it again and bragging about his  beautiful flowing sentences  this week  trump canceled a much anticipated press conference on his private business dealings  saying he was too busy nominating cabinet members  but he was seen meeting with kanye west  trump promised to address his conflicts of interest but we suppose meeting with a rapper is more of a priority for the president elect  trump has not held a press conference since july  even though he blasted hillary clinton for not meeting with the press during the campaign vox reports that trump now has a different excuse for not meeting with the press for interviews the press mangles his  beautiful  sentences  and he has had enough of it  trump told a crowd in west allis  wisconsin  at one of his victory tour rallies trump literally said that   for the last month i decided not to do interviews  because they give interviews and they chop up your sentences and cut them short   he said   you will have this beautiful flowing sentence where the back of the sentence reverts to the front and they cut the back of the sentence off  and i say i never said that  so  i said  you know what  i am not going to deal with them  they are very dishonest people  i said  vox had linguists weigh in on trump s speeches  his speeches are full of non sequiturs   says kristin kobes du mez  a calvin college historian who has done a comparative study of trump and clinton s speaking styles  it s a completely different style from nearly any other politician you normally see on a big stage what s even more peculiar about his remark is that after each incendiary statement he made during his campaign  it was as if his defenders felt the need to step in to say what he really meant  in march  the new york post said that trump speaks at a fourth grade level and suggested he might do that intentionally  we wonder what speaking level trump is in russian photo by scott olson via getty
