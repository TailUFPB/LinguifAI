fbi director james comey could very likely be the reason we have a president trump  just shy of two weeks prior to the  election  comey sent a letter to congress that essentially said that his investigation into then democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton s private email server could potentially be re opened  despite his open condemnation of hillary s activities  comey kept mum on the investigations   the much more serious inquires   on the other side  which would be those into the possible collusion between russia and the trump campaign into the election s eventual outcome well  all of that is now coming to a head  trump s team has been repeatedly caught being linked to russia and lying about it  his national security adviser  michael flynn  was forced to resign for his lies to mike pence about his russia ties  and has since registered with the united states government as a foreign agent  it has also been found that the newly confirmed attorney general  jeff sessions  has been forced to recuse himself from any russia trump investigations due to his lying to senator al franken during his confirmation hearings regarding his own conversations with the ambassador to russia now  it seems that there is a firm way to bring this to an end  senator lindsey graham  r sc  and senator sheldon whitehouse  d ri  seem to have had a meeting with fbi director comey on march   according to whitehouse  during that meeting  comey promised him and his gop counterpart that they would have the answer we ve all been waiting for by this coming wednesday   which is whether or not the federal bureau of investigation is actively probing the activities of the trump campaign with regards to russia and the  election whitehouse says that not only will comey tell them whether or not he and his agency are investigating trump s russia ties  but he will also go into  the scope of their russia trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one  well  this should definitely be interesting  after all  comey was more than willing to throw the election to trump by screwing hillary clinton with nonsense that amounted to nothing  while vladimir putin installed a russian agent and his cronies as head of the united states government  hopefully  once comey is under oath  whatever is revealed will take trump down once and for all featured image via drew angerer getty images
