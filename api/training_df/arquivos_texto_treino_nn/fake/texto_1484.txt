donald trump may spend his time furiously tweeting that the russia investigation   the one over which he fired fbi director james comey after he requested additional resources   is fake news  while simultaneously complaining about leaks of classified information that is simultaneously fake news and real information  but the rest of us see through his actions that not only is our alleged president hiding about a billion skeletons in his closet  but he has sold out our nation  this is  at this point  something that can be considered a truth   because even fox news can t avoid commenting on the donald and his administration s shady practices  when i heard that exchange today between jeff mason  white house reporter  and sean spicer speaking from the podium in the briefing room for the president of the united states  it took my breath away   wallace told fellow fox host shep smith on friday  adding that was what in watergate they called a non denial denial  he was asked specifically  is there a recording device in the oval office of the president of the united states  he said   i have nothing for you on that   he could have said no  he could have said yes  he said i have nothing for you on that  that is a non denial denial  look  it may just be that the president is trolling the press corps and saying work yourself into a frenzy about this and turns out it nothing  but why would he do that  why would he want to decrease the credibility which is already in question of this white house and comments that are made from that podium  it seems to me that you re playing a very dangerous game with the currency of the credibility of the president of the united states  every step he s taken this week has cut into the credibility of this white house  the trust of the people inside the white house   wallace said   and clearly i think the trust that the american people pay to this president and to his white house staff  i ve never seen anything like it and i find it very troubling and troubled  i just don t understand the game that they re playing   he added   cause it isn t a game  watch wallace tear trump limb from stupid limb below featured image via screengrab
