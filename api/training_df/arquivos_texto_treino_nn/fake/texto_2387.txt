while trump and his loyal subjects keep bleating about the mess obama left for them to clean up  and insist that the world laughed at us for the entire eight years of his administration  a growing movement in france is proving them to be completely out of their gourds  france s presidential election is coming up in april  and these people  fed up with marine le pen and her trump like attitudes and policies  want obama to come be france s president seriously  they ve got a petition going that s asking obama to run  and they re hoping they can get at least one million signatures on it  they ve also put up  posters around paris and have an actual campaign organization going oui on peut          streetsofparis pic twitter com   romuald coustre   rcoustre  february    obama want to be president of france  probably not  and the truth is that this is a bit of a joke  but it s not a joke on obama or the u s  it s a  joke  in that this group knows he s not going to come run for president there  and they re using this campaign to send a very serious message  we are so fed up with what marine le pen is doing  and with the fact that we weren t able to find a candidate to vote for  only one to vote against  we started talking about that and it came up that obama is free   so why not hire him  in other words  they see obama as someone who still represents hope and something to fight for in a world where we increasingly just vote and fight against things people have actually been getting in touch with the campaign to offer ideas for how to get around the fact that obama isn t french  even some lawyers have contacted them with advice on how to make it possible  like making him a naturalized citizen of france  but nobody knows if obama is even aware of this yet  if he is  and he answers  then the campaign believes there will be a huge reaction featured image by scott olson via getty images
