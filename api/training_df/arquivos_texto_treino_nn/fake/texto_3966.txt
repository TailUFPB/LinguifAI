donald trump s deplorable supporters aren t waiting for the election results to start spilling blood they ve been threatening bloody violence ever since trump began claiming that the election is  rigged  in favor of hillary clinton  and trump has called for them to intimidate voters at polling places in texas last week  a trump supporter was arrested for electioneering at a polling place because he was wearing one of trump s stupid hats and a  deplorables  t shirt to vote election code prohibits any person from electioneering within  feet of a polling place of course  trump supporters threw a temper tantrum because they think the rules don t apply to them well  now it looks like they have retaliated by setting up a booby trapped trump sign at a polling place knowing that an official or volunteer would have to take the sign down at collin college in plano  texas a trump sign was discovered zip tied to an official polling location sign in direct violation of the election code that forbids electioneering at polling places but when a volunteer went out to remove the sign they got a nasty surprise in the form of box cutter blades that were strategically hidden inside  the blades sliced into the volunteer s hands and drew blood  requiring medical attention and prompting officials to order that signs be checked thoroughly before removal  it just shows how far we have come in politics where people want to be so mean and so hateful to try and injure somebody who s probably not got any political party persuasion one way or the other   local democratic party campaign chair steve spainhouer said in response    i think most people have already made their minds up at this point how they re going to vote and so there s nothing to gain by being mean spirited or hateful  here s the video via ktvt frankly  this should be considered an act of domestic terrorism  trump s supporters have gone too far and it could get worse as election day approaches  and if trump loses  his supporters have already threatened to try to overthrow the federal government in a bloody coup clearly  these people are deranged and the safety of voters and election officials are in danger  but you won t hear donald trump condemning this act of violence  after all  he is the one inciting it featured image  darren mccollester getty images
