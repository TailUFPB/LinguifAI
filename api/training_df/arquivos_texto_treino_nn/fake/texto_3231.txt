the liberal billionaire donor just called out donald trump for being a  con artist  who threatens democracy conservatives fear george soros  for decades they have painted him as the bad guy who somehow controls the government behind the scenes it s a right wing tall tale  of course  meant to scare other conservatives into staying in line rather than using their brains to decide who to vote for it s not often that soros speaks out  but when he does it is powerful because his experience as a jewish child in nazi occupied hungary continues to resonate  i am an  year old hungarian jew who became a us citizen after the end of world war ii   soros wrote in an op ed on wednesday   i learned at an early age how important it is what kind of political regime prevails  the formative experience of my life was the occupation of hungary by hitler s germany in   i probably would have perished had my father not understood the gravity of the situation  he arranged false identities for his family and for many other jews  with his help  most survived  soros  story is especially important now as countries across europe move to the extreme right wing as white nationalists once again aim to grab absolute power  they ve even managed to grab power in the united states through donald trump  and soros warns that democracy is in danger i find the current moment in history very painful  open societies are in crisis  and various forms of closed societies   from fascist dictatorships to mafia states   are on the rise democracy is now in crisis  even the us  the world s leading democracy  elected a con artist and would be dictator as its president  although trump has toned down his rhetoric since he was elected  he has changed neither his behavior nor his advisers  his cabinet comprises incompetent extremists and retired generals he then predicted what the united states faces under trump s regime he us will be preoccupied with internal struggles in the near future  and targeted minorities will suffer  the us will be unable to protect and promote democracy in the rest of the world  on the contrary  trump will have greater affinity with dictators  that will allow some of them to reach an accommodation with the us  and others to carry on without interference  trump will prefer making deals to defending principles  unfortunately  that will be popular with his core constituency in short  dictators around the world  especially vladimir putin  will have more freedom to pursue their evil agendas without being challenged by america  our leadership on the world stage will be greatly diminished as nations like russia and china take advantage of trump s ineptness america faces a four year long disaster that could become permanent if republicans have their way of course  conservatives are lashing out at soros in response because his name is a trigger for them  georgesoros jan  comes around the search warrant is going to be issued   enjoy russia   putin dick in your mouth  realdonaldtrump  jimmy taouil   jimmytaouil  december    georgesoros  opensociety happy to see your petulant rant  hope trump is the nail in the coffin for your failed socialist globalist nwo pic twitter com   ggirl   ourtownu  december    georgesoros ha  how dare you post anything  you are a criminal a hater an enemy of freedom democracy   and we in the republic of the usa  antony donavan   donavanantony  december    georgesoros  opensociety everything george soros says he means the opposite he s the definition of evil and he s proud of it   who s next   thomasyarduk  december    georgesoros  opensociety just go to a hospice home  george  we are onto your one world govt plans   maga  jon  maga      december    georgesoros  opensociety finally soros will get what he deserves from trump admin  jail for you george   ben dover   bkossucare  december     soros hit paranoid conspiracy theory obsessed conservatives with the truth where it hurts the most so they are now whining about it  now we only have to wait for donald trump to throw a tantrum featured image  wikimedia
