remember when donald trump claimed that ford was moving jobs and production to mexico  well  we all knew he was lying then  but he s admitting it now by bragging about it in september  trump accused the american car manufacturer of intending to take jobs from workers in kentucky and take them to mexico but that was blatantly false because of a labor contract between the company and the worker s union  and ford was quick to call out trump for lying as it turns out  ford is only moving production of certain vehicles to mexico but keeping the same workforce in the united states busy producing other vehicles  and kentucky was never going to lose production of the lincoln mkc suv  even if trump had never entered the presidential race at all well  trump decided to take credit for something that wasn t going to happen anyway by bragging on twitter that he single handedly stopped ford from moving the kentucky plant to mexico just got a call from my friend bill ford  chairman of ford  who advised me that he will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky   no mexico  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky  i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    s make something clear  trump doesn t get credit for stopping something that was not going to happen anyway  he is not the great savior of auto workers in kentucky  that credit should go to the labor union responsible for negotiating the contract that prevented ford from moving the plant out of kentucky in the first place but by bragging about it anyway  trump basically just admitted that he lied when he claimed ford was moving the factory to mexico  he flat out lied  and now he is pretending that he achieved some great victory it s quite pathetic featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
