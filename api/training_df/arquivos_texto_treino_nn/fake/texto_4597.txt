donald trump is a liar  this is pretty well established by now  but on friday he stopped telling the big lie  the one that allowed him to rise to political prominence and the one upon which so much of his initial support was based  barack obama is not a u s  citizen for years  trump has harangued the president over his birth certificate  passport  college transcripts  and anything else the billionaire could use to delegitimize the first black president of the united states  the  nominee was  in effect  the leader of the  birthers   a movement he did not start but gladly latched onto  fueled  and drove forward as he and his cohorts ineffectively but annoyingly attacked obama trump offered no apology  in fact  he spent only about  seconds admitting that president obama was born in the united states   period  that was one lie  but what if trump were to retract a lie per day  could he do it  would he even live long enough to do so  msnbc s lawrence o donnell tackled the issue on friday  pointing out that trump  via his doctor s shady letter the donald allowed  dr  oz  to look at  was willing to lie about a single inch   adding one inch to his actual height to narrowly avoid being classified as medically obese  let s just assume donald trump is much healthier than he looks  let s even assume he s taller and thinner than he really is   o donnell says  deciding to estimate that trump would live longer than his father  if trump lived until  years old  he will be around for  another   days  if trump were to retract one lie per day for the rest of his life   he can retract   lies   o donnell points out  but there s a problem  in retracting the big lie  he told two more  that hillary clinton started the  birther  rumors  and that trump stopped them through his racist badgering of president obama  if he does it the way he did it today  the lies of donald trump will live after him because as he retracted one lie today he told two more   o donnell says   i think we know that donald trump isn t going to retract a lie every day  i think we know that donald trump is going to continue to lie every day   then he brought it home  i think we know that there is nothing too small for donald trump to lie about  including that extra inch of height he decided he needed this week  he will lie about an inch  i think we know there s nothing too big for donald trump to lie about  nothing too big  nothing too solemn he will lie about anything  and so i think we know that long after he s gone  long after his name has disappeared from buildings  the lies of donald trump will live after him  watch it below featured image via screengrab
