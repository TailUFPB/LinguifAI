unwilling to do the right thing himself  the united states office of government ethics just sent trump a letter asking him to punish kellyanne conway for her clear violation of the law in promoting ivanka s clothing line conway told a giddy fox news morning crew that she loves ivanka s clothing and urged viewers to rush out to buy more of the merchandise   all while standing in the white house briefing room the oge  like many independent lawyers  pointed out that this was a blatant violation of conflict of interest laws  even more infuriating  the white house appears to have made no effort to discipline conway for a violation that many assumed would end in her termination although press secretary sean spicer stated during a press conference on february     that   kellyanne has been counseled  and that s all we re going to go with   oge has not yet received notification of any disciplinary or other corrective ation against ms  conway  when ofge has reason to believe that an employee may have violated the standards of ethical conduct for employees of the executive branch  oge is authorized to recommend that the employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action against the employee the oge again reiterated that  given conway s shameless plug on national television  the evidence is plain to see and that  disciplinary action is warranted  meanwhile  trump is busy throwing his national security advisor under the bus after the washington post proved that michael flynn did  in fact  illegally discuss russian sanctions with russia s ambassador to the u s  before trump was inaugurated  conway would represent the second high profile advisor that trump would have to jettison for separate ethics violations in a single week   surely some kind of record so far  trump has refused to do anything to punish conway  in fact  he  too  used his station as president to promote his daughter s clothing line  tweeting a hit job on the nordstrom retail chain for dropping her brand from its stores featured image via mark wilson getty images
