donald trump has constantly involved himself in one silly feud after another  going ballistic on a series of individuals and institutions in a childish tantrum style  often about topics that have absolutely nothing to do with being elected president trump has done this so often  hillary clinton referenced the behavior in her speech accepting the democratic nomination in philadelphia this summer  noting   imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis  a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons  the current occupant of the white house  president obama  recently showed off the stark difference in temperament between himself and someone like trump in how he responded to poor treatment by chinese authorities the chinese prevented a set of stairs from being used to allow obama to walk off of air force one  forcing the white house to eventually scrap the process even though it is a key element in the imagery of the president arriving for a diplomatic event like the   obama could have chosen to complain and whine and moan about it  instead mr  obama played down the incident  saying it was part of the normal give and take over security and media access that the united states has with many foreign countries he noted that foreign delegations often feel bruised by their treatment when they visit the united states  and he acknowledged that the white house places a lot of demands on countries he visits because of the size of his entourage and his security demands can you imagine donald trump letting a violation of protocol or   more importantly in his egocentric eyes   allowing an opportunity for a photo op to pass him by  no doubt a raft of chinese officials  including the stair operator  would be subject to aggressive trump tweets  he might even come up with one of his childish nicknames instead  obama let it slide  going on to sign a major agreement with the chinese president in order to fight global climate change   a real problem  not an optics one that s a big difference featured image via flickr
