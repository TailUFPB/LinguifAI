it has just come to light that stanislav petrov  a former soviet lieutenant colonel  passed away on may  this year in his apartment in the small town of fryazino  northeast of moscow  you have probably never heard of him  but if it weren t for petrov s actions  or lack thereof   there is a good chance you wouldn t be here to read this today if you have seen the  film the man who saved the world  staring kevin costner  then you might have some sort of an idea of who petrov is  as that movie was based how he prevented a nuclear crisis between the us and the ussr  as well as averting the potential for world war iii  back in the  by essentially doing nothing at all  that could be a part of the reason petrov never considered himself a hero  at first when people started telling me that these tv reports had started calling me a hero  i was surprised  i never thought of myself as one   after all  i was literally just doing my job   he once said in an interview later in life the date was september    and petrov was on duty in a bunker near moscow  in charge of an early warning radar system  it wasn t long after midnight when petrov noticed a single missile on the screen  launched from the us and heading toward the soviet union  when i first saw the alert message  i got up from my chair  all my subordinates were confused  so i started shouting orders at them to avoid panic  i knew my decision would have a lot of consequences   petrov recalled in a  interview  the siren went off for a second time  giant blood red letters appeared on our main screen  saying  start   it said that four more missiles had been launched  this left the kremlin only  minutes from when the warheads were initially fired to decide whether retaliation with nuclear weapons of their own was necessary and petrov just  minutes to determine if the threat was indeed real  my cozy armchair felt like a red hot frying pan and my legs went limp  i felt like i couldn t even stand up  that s how nervous i was when i was taking this decision  fortunately for all of mankind  petrov recalled from his training that  if the us were to attack  they would do so on an all out offensive  as opposed to simply firing a couple of missiles here and there  petrov took this into account and declined to tell his superior officers  figuring that a system malfunction must be responsible for the alarm and it turned out he was right  the soviet satellites had actually picked up sunlight reflected from clouds and mistaken it for nuclear warheads  although petrov s decision to keep the information from his superiors was a severe infraction of soviet military rules the incident was kept as a highly classified secret for years  even at the time of her death in   petrov s own wife  raisa  wasn t aware of what he had done and it was only made public when colonel general yury votintsev  petrov s superintendent  decided in  that his deed should be commended and told the story to bild  a german tabloid  german political activist karl schumacher was so affected by the article that he traveled to russia to find petrov and invited him back to germany in order to give his version  of how he had saved the world from nuclear war  something that had been a very real threat for decades in   the association of world citizens presented petrov with an award in the un headquarters in new york  which reads   to the man who averted nuclear war   in   petrov was also honored with the german media prize  which has previously been awarded to nelson mandela  the dalai lama and kofi annan stanislav petrov was  years old  watch the story of stanislav petrov s actions unfold here
