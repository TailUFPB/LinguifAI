the congressional black caucus  like most democrats and reasonable people everywhere  have never had very warm feelings toward donald trump   to put it mildly  after all  this is a section of the house of representatives dedicated to protecting the interests and rights of black americans  and trump is a lifelong open and avowed racist  however  they have  for the most part  seemed to stop short of calling for trump s removal   with the exception of rep  maxine waters  who is  of course  in a league all her own this level of restraint being exercised by the majority of this powerful group of lawmakers has definitely changed as of late  though  ever since trump s disgraceful response to the horrific events in charlottesville at a rally of neo nazis that resulted in countless injuries and the death of a brave young woman  it seems that the black caucus is done playing  they want trump out of office  posthaste  during a conference call held with the press on monday  rep  cedric richmond  d la  said of trump  you can make an argument based on pure competency and fitness to serve  and that s the conversation the caucus will have  am i concerned about high crimes and misdemeanors  absolutely  am i concerned about this president s fitness to serve  absolutely  richmond also indicated that charlottesville was the last straw when it came to giving trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether or not he really has the concerns of black america at heart  granted  all of this is a pipe dream for now  the gop will criticize trump until the cows come home  but they sure as hell won t do anything about him  they won t even formally censure him  much less move to remove him from office all of that could change  however  if the house is returned to democratic control in   folks  if we want to save our republic  we ll give the congressional power to the democrats next year while we still have a country to save featured image via law officer
