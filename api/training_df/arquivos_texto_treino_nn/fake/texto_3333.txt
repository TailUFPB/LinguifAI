this is despicable and morbid donald trump has clearly chosen a piece of human excrement as his secretary of treasury former goldman sachs executive and hedge fund manager steven mnuchin has been heavily and rightfully criticized ever since trump made the announcement  not only did mnuchin s onewest bank fail to disperse desperately needed hurricane sandy to people affected by the disaster  it tried to take a  year old woman s home away from her over a  cent bill now another firm owned by mnuchin is coming under fire for betting on when elderly people would die yeah  you read that right mnuchin firm dune capitol management bought life insurance policies through a third party from elderly people who needed the cash  betting that they would die soon so they could collect the payout  seriously according to the new york times dune had plans to package the insurance policies   called life settlements   into bonds that could be sold to investors  life settlements represent one of the most macabre actuarial bets that wall street has dreamed up  it s a wager that the elderly person selling the policy will die sooner rather than later  meaning the hedge fund does not have to make many premium payments to keep the insurance policy in force and collect the payout upon that person s death that s pretty f cked up and proves that trump picked a terrible and greedy human being to be treasury secretary  a guy who is all sorts of shady who would stab you in a back or sell his own mother into the sex trade if he could profit from it trump s selection of mnuchin is so bad that many of his supporters now regret voting for himin fact  one woman who voted for trump now regrets doing so because he picked mnuchin  who foreclosed on her house a few years ago clearly  the senate should protect the american people from such a predator  but they re already protecting trump and he s an economic predator n addition to being a sexual predator  so they probably won t have a problem confirming mnuchin featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
