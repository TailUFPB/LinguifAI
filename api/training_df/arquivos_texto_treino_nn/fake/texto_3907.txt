how this didn t happen sooner  i do not know  but on sunday  ted nugent appeared at a campaign rally with donald trump and it went just about how you d expect  nugent played a little guitar  spewed some profanity and groped himself on the stage taking the stage at a trump rally in michigan  nugent struggled with his amp before pumping out the national anthem in the style of jimi hendricks  who decided to give the man a microphone  i don t know  but the controversial rockstar took the opportunity to rant about  shit kickers  and ass kickers  i ve got your blue state right here  baby   nugent yelled at one point while grabbing his crotch and giving it a squeeze  black and blue  trump came out to give his speech after nugent s antics but didn t mention them at all  he did  however  brag that he doesn t need guitars at his rallies  apparently  it escaped his attention that ted effing nugent had just spent the past half hour playing guitar at his rally  there s no guitar  to draw a crowd for his rallies  trump says  minutes after ted nugent played his guitar for a half hour or so   nicole hemmer   pastpunditry  november    is a michigan native  born in detroit  but it isn t likely that his support will help trump win the state  besides the fact that nugent is a washed up rockstar turned raving right wing lunatic who sh t his own pants because he was too scared to serve in the military  polling shows that trump is way behind hillary clinton in michigan it is pretty ironic  though  that trump has been trying to point attention to literally anything besides crotch grabbing and nugent just felt himself up onstage at his rally  but hey  should we really have expected that trump would finish up the final days of his campaign any other way you can watch ted nugent grope himself while stumping for trump  here nugent   i ve got your blue state right here  baby   trump rallies are just as crude   disgusting as you might expect at this point  pic twitter com   correct the record   correctrecord  november    image via video screen capture
