a man almost lost his life on a flight out of detroit because of a racist flight crew member who apparently forgot that it s  and black women are allowed to be doctors  i know  it seems shocking to someone with that mindset  but we re pretty much over the who  not allowing someone to follow their dreams and live up to their potential because of their skin color  thing  unfortunately  the crew of delta flight  didn t get the memo when a passenger became unresponsive during the flight  the crew leaped into action looking for a doctor   and dr  tamika cross would have done so as well  if they thought someone with her dark complexion was capable of being a medical professional  on facebook  cross vented her frustration with representatives of the airline when cross initially attempted to inform the crew she was a doctor by raising her hand as she was asked  she was flatly told her silly dark skinned medical knowledge was useless to them   even though a man was dying  oh no sweetie put ur hand down  we are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel  we don t have time to talk to you   cross says a flight attendant informed her  overtalking her attempts to explain that she is a licensed medical professional with condescension  any physician on board please press your button  the crew urged  as no one but cross had responded  she pushed her button   oh wow you re an actual physician   the flabbergasted crew member asked before demanding to see cross s credentials and asking a series of questions that should not be asked when a man is dying and time is of the essence    what type of doctor are you  where do you work  why were you in detroit  fortunately  a white man stepped forward to save the day because the crew obviously was having a tough time finding a doctor who met their qualifications  apparently white skin being the qualification   cross was told  thanks for your help but he can help us  and he has his credentials   he did not  in fact  show the crew anything  cross points out in her post after mr  white doctor saved the day  the same crew member had the nerve to come to cross with questions about treatment before ultimately  apologizing  for her blatantly racist behavior and trying to bribe cross with skymiles  cross refused unfortunately  while we have made great progress  we still have a long way to go in terms of race relations in america   and delta is not going to have a very good week trying to make this problem go away featured image via facebook
