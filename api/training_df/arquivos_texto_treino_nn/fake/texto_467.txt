donald trump is a horrible president  everyone knew in the run up to the election that he was in no way qualified for this job  now that he is in the oval office  these facts are magnified on an hourly basis a thousandfold  however  there seems to be one unlikely person who  at least secretly  shares these opinions in part  donald trump himself a source close to trump says that he is miserable  for one thing  he is angry that members of his cabinet  such as secretary of state rex tillerson  are refusing to walk in lockstep on some of trump s more controversial public statements   the comments after the violent white supremacist rally in charlottesville that left a woman dead is a particular source of trump s ire  further  what really seems to get him is that there will no firings of top level cabinet officials  because no qualified person would take those jobs now  the source says of how trump is feeling on his cabinet secretaries  public thrashings  i think that cuts him to the quick  the same source says of the laughable idea of trump being able to replace tillerson or any other high level member of the cabinet  i couldn t name you a guy who would take the job or get confirmed  also  the last of the alt right   trump s fellow travelers in bigotry   are pretty much gone from the white house  thanks to trump s new chief of staff  general john kelly  it seems that the disciplined adult in the room has zero intention of replacing literal nazis like trump s ousted chief strategist stephen k  bannon and key adviser sebastion gorka  the source says of these developments  general kelly has come in and done a look see on what everyone s been working on for the first six or seven months heresome people were ready  and some people were not  as for trump himself  well  he s flippin  miserable  the source says of the poor old donald s feelings as of late  he feels like this is not what he signed up for  and his accomplishments are being underplayed  he just looks around and says   when is this going to get better  the source goes on to say that trump s emotional state is  the worst it s ever been   well  what did he expect  sure  when you re president  you re the most powerful person on earth  but it s also the hardest job in the world  it s hard even when the occupant is actually qualified  trump is not  he has that attention span of a gnat on crystal meth  does not read books  can t even use basic modern technology such as email  has dangerous authoritarian instincts  no impulse control  and no respect for the rule of law  further  he is bigoted  petulant  vindictive  and petty  he s also an admitted serial sexual assaulter and adulterer  in short   trump is everything we don t want in a president  from his character  to his knowledge  read  lack thereof   to his ignorance and bigotry it seems that the donald thought he d be able to rule over the nation like some kind of mad king  it s obvious that he got a very rude awakening  oh  if only we lived in an alternate universe where he could have seen what this would be like  and had decided against running for president featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
