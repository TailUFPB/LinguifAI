if you still don t think trump supporters aren t nazis  just remember that liberals aren t the ones calling for genocide during a  march for trump  rally in arizona last weekend  real news network s dan cohen went to maricopa county to engage with the rallygoers  and what he heard should horrify every american across the country the trump supporters were heard chanting in favor of imprisoning hillary clinton  even though clinton was cleared by the fbi and investigations by republicans have gone nowhere  the chants were also despite the fact that mike pence used a private email to conduct public business and was hacked so there were definitely a bunch of hypocrites at the trump rally but that s not all when asked about muslims in america  a couple of trump supporters has strong racist feelings about them  if you don t like it here  go to syria  go to someplace else   one trump supporter yelled another racist trump supporter called for deporting them   i don t want  em  as a veteran i don t want  em  let  em go back home   the trump supporter said   if they ve got a problem  let saudi arabia take care of  em  the problem with saudi arabia is that it doesn t have the kind of religious freedom that we hold so dear  just as there are different sects of christianity  there are different sects of islam  and not everyone is able to practice their religious beliefs freely in many nations in the middle east the replies from trump supporters then took a scarier turn as attendees called for deporting jews the hate against jews has apparently even spread to the children of right wingers  for instance  this is what a  year old said  if she is jewish  she should go back to her country  seriously and then a trump supporter called for imprisoning and committing genocide against liberals so that america can be a true conservative hell hole  i just want to let them know that i can t wait for the liberal genocide to begin   he said   that s the way to make america great again  liberals are destroying the country  so if trump supporters had their way  freedom of religion would only apply to christians  anti semitism would sweep across the country  muslims would be persecuted  and liberals would all be put in internment camps and killed in what would be a holocaust in america here s the video via youtube the next time someone tells you it s wrong to compare trump and his supporters to the nazis  show them this featured image  jim lo   pool getty images
