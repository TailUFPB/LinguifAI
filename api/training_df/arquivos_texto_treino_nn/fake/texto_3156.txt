abortion became a legal procedure in   according to the supreme court  it s about a woman s right to privacy  more than  years later  a republican judge put a new spin on the abortion debate  he ruled that it s fine for a doctor to discriminate against a woman who s ever had an abortion  they can discriminate against men too  but only if the man was born with female body parts the affordable care act  obamacare  forbids discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity  it also forbids discrimination based on whether a woman has had an abortion  in other words  the federal government has applied a fairly broad definition to sex discrimination  as they should u s  justice reed o connor has a different vision  though  he ruled that sex discrimination has only one meaning   discrimination against a woman for being a woman or a man for being a man  as slate points out  though  who is to determine who is a man or who is a woman but o connor recognizes only one kind of sex discrimination  hostility against a man or woman for being a man or a woman  this belief directly contradicts supreme court authority  it also doesn t make much sense  since it only raises the key question of who decides whether an individual is a man or a woman   is discrimination against an intersex person not sex discrimination  what about a person with ambiguous genitalia who identifies as male   still  o connor got away with this blinkered understanding of sex in blocking federal guidelines on bathroom access for transgender students  and naturally he pulled the same trick here  holding that the hhs rule does not build upon  sex discrimination  and is therefore unlawful clearly  this ruling was based on the ludicrous idea that religious people are being discriminated against when they are being told they can t discriminate  much like the hobby lobby ruling  which allowed businesses to discriminate against women by not offering birth control with their company insurance plans  ironically  they don t have to offer paid maternity leave or help out with any of the consequences from not having access to birth control  still  o connor tried to rationalize it  calling insuring transgender people a  burden  that fear is now an undeniable reality  o connor held that treating transgender patients and even insuring transgender patients substantially burdens  insurance companies and hospitals   exercise of religion   as a result  under rfra  the hhs rule must be  the least restrictive means of furthering  compelling government interest   o connor decided that the rule did not constitute  the least restrictive means  of preventing discrimination  why not  because  the government  assume the cost  of transgender related treatment  and  assist transgender individuals in finding  a doctor who will treat them  the judge then goes on to suggest that protecting transgender people from discrimination isn t actually a  compelling government interest  in the first place as for the abortion part of the ruling  well  doctors are not  and have never been  required to perform abortions  this  though  would allow a doctor to not treat a  year old woman for  let s say cancer  just because she had an abortion at  the most bizarre part of the ruling  though  had nothing to do with the law and everything to do with  century thinking  the christian medical associations who brought the suit argued that treating either transgender patients or women who ve had abortions is tantamount to  material cooperation with evil   what century are we in again this ruling  though  would open the doors to other types of discrimination  essentially against anything a religious doctor might find yucky  like treating lgbt people or the children of lgbt people many will shrug their shoulders and argue that it s no big deal  that the majority of doctors will still treat all patients  while it s hard to say that s true right now  in some parts of the country  it s not that simple  in many parts of the south  for example  it might be difficult to find a doctor who s willing to treat either a woman who s had an abortion or a transgender person  funny  though  that doctors are still not allowed to discriminate against people born male or christians featured image via joe readle getty images
