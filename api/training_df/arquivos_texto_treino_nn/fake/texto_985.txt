yesterday  after senate majority leader sen  mitch mcconnell  r ky  called for the vote on the gop s health care bill to be delayed until after the july  recess  donald trump met with gop senators in a closed door meeting to discuss how the failing bill might be saved  there s just one major problem  trump doesn t know what the f ck he s talking about  in fact  he probably doesn t even know what is in the bill the new york times recapped the meeting  and hidden in the report was a certain gem from an anonymous senate staffer who was present in the meeting  the account from this staffer truly proves that trump is running the country blind and has no idea what s going on  the staffer said  a senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the white house with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy  this senate staffer also said that trump seemed oblivious to the fact that the health care bill had tax implications  because in the meeting the potus said he would handle tax reform at a later time  considering that trump doesn t read and is incapable of focusing his attention on anything besides tweets  it s highly possible that trump hasn t even looked at this health care bill to make matters even worse  trump demonstrated a delusional sense of comfort when he declared the meeting a success on twitter  trump tweeted  i just finished a great meeting with the republican senators concerning healthcare  they really want to get it right  unlike ocare  this proves that trump is absolutely insane  and his incompetency has become a major threat to the well being of all americans  he doesn t even know what s in his own legislation featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
