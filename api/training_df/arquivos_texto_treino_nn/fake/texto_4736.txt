in what s being compared to the infamous  daisy  commercial from the  election  a pro clinton group released a devastating new ad targeting donald trump and his love for war and nuclear destruction priorities america  which has been supporting democratic nominee hillary clinton and other down ballot democrats  released the ad earlier this month  and will pour more than   million into broadcasting the ad on friday in six key battleground states  florida  ohio  north carolina  new hampshire  nevada and iowa painting trump as a temperamental  impulsive hawk has been a cornerstone in the clinton defense strategy  and this ad  though not affiliated with her campaign  seeks to solidify that  earlier in the summer  the clinton campaign began running ads showcasing trump s impulsive and dangerous rhetoric  saying that one wrong move could be the difference between peace and world war iii this ad  however  is different  like the   daisy  ad  this one showcased the infamous mushroom cloud explosion and its destructive consequences  appropriately titled  i love war   the crux of the ad stems from trump s comment made back in november during the republican primary  while speaking to a crowd in fort dodge  iowa  trump reassured his hawkish and loyal followers that he loved and was  good  at war  i m good at war  i ve had a lot of wars of my own  i m really good at war  i love war in a certain way  but only when we win  also shown was trump s affinity for nuclear devastation  in which he told cnn   nuclear  just the power  the devastation  is very important to me  so priorities america laid it out  we have a candidate who loves war  and is very good at it  so when the mushroom cloud strikes  don t be surprised of course the trump campaign responded  and pathetically tried to put his  i love war  quote into context  but ended up using the opportunity to blast the media and hillary clinton s poll numbers  which are better than trump s  might i add  and  surprise  brought up benghazi  so they actually didn t clarify what he meant  rather they deflected by pointing the finger at hillary and avoiding the problem altogether typical trump campaign watch the brutal ad here  featured image via alex wong getty images
