many republicans in congressional leadership are touting their idiotic  repeal and delay  plan as the perfect way to repeal the aca without kicking millions off their insurance plans  people like mitch mcconnell are already acting like it s done deal  people like paul ryan think things like tax free health savings accounts are the answer to our healthcare woes  trump himself has said he wants the repeal to happen as soon as possible  so it should be a foregone conclusion that all of this is happening in the very near future except it might not republicans need  votes in the senate to pass their repeal  they have  seats  if they lose three votes  they ll have  with just  votes  the repeal effort fails but which three  the truth is that not every republican is happy with the idea of repealing the law now and working on a replacement later  they ve had six years to come up with a replacement  as sen  bob corker  r tn  acknowledges  they haven t done so  the idea that they can now come up with a good replacement before millions lose their healthcare coverage is laughable at best  but really  it s cold blooded fuckery corker  along with sen  rand paul  r ky  and sen  lamar alexander  r tn   strongly oppose passing any repeals without simultaneously passing their replacement plan these are the three who are likely to derail the repeal effort even better  worse   is that corker  along with sens  rob portman  r oh   susan collins  r me   bill cassidy  r la  and lisa murkowski  r ak  have introduced an amendment to the repeal bill that would push the vote back a month five gop senators offer an amendment to extend the obamacare repeal reconciliation deadline by more than a month  pic twitter com   sahil kapur   sahilkapur  january    goes directly against mitch mcconnell s insistence that they ll repeal the law soon  and then come up with a replacement  rapidly   which happened over the weekend in an interview on cbs   face the nation   however  he couldn t give us anything like a timetable for the replacement  even though he was pressed hard let s also not forget all the republican governors who are currently trying to pressure congress into holding off repealing the aca  these are governors who ve seen massive benefits to their states from the medicaid expansion in the aca  a full repeal means all states that expanded medicaid will lose their federal funding for it  governors  regardless of party  hate that democrats will block repeal efforts as best they can not just because they oppose republicans  but because what paltry fragments of plans the republicans do have rob from the poor to give to the rich  for instance  they want to greatly expand the use of health savings accounts  which helps absolutely no one who can t afford to put any money away for anything  like retirement  their children s college  their own savings  etc    sure  the accounts are tax free  but they re a way to force us to pay even more for our healthcare than we already do neither mcconnell nor ryan will be happy with their own turning against them on something they and their handlers insist must be done now  and fuck the people who will end up as collateral damage while they dicker over a full replacement plan  but it s true that if corker  paul and alexander block the repeal bill because there s no replacement to go with it  then the effort fails featured image by drew angerer via getty images
