donald trump jr  may have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth  but he seems to be lacking the  superior genes  his father claims as a birthright  on tuesday morning  while in the middle of being a focus of the scandal that will rock his father s administration  he tweeted the email chain that very literally implicates him in colluding with the russians  yes  it s that bad the chain was from june     and it was about setting up the meeting between trump jr  paul manafort  trump s campaign manager at the time  and jared kushner here s my statement and the full email chain pic twitter com   donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  july    smoking gun came in this one here is page   which did not post due to space constraints   pic twitter com   donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  july    users were stunned  especially over this part  which explicitly states that trump jr  attended the meeting with the intention of getting dirt on clinton  which he said he would  love  the documents  would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father   read the email  written by a trusted intermediary  who added   this is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of russia and its government s support for mr  trump  if the future president s elder son was surprised or disturbed by the provenance of the promised material   or the notion that it was part of an ongoing effort by the russian government to aid his father s campaign   he gave no indication he replied within minutes   if it s what you say i love it especially later in the summer  source  ny timesso i think this is the part people will focus on as showing knowledge he was getting something of value from foreign source pic twitter com   rick hasen   rickhasen  july    this about the  thing of value  itself pic twitter com   rick hasen   rickhasen  july    as to proving  solicitation  or  coordination  under campaign laws  trump jr  says  if it s what you say i love it  pic twitter com hvmlsyzdlb  rick hasen   rickhasen  july    lied about the meeting  twice  why are we supposed to believe you now  like every other trump  you re a fraud  pic twitter com qyyihmnkwr  josh s nchez   jnsanchez  july    junior doesn t realize how incriminating this is   merrill lynch   merrilllynched  july    i love the poorly educated   pic twitter com        july    prison romper to match daddy s  pic twitter com esohczuass  mike denison     july    only explanation for this apparent suicide tactic is to get out ahead of a new york times story  they already had the emails trump senior has been trying to distance himself from his son since the story broke on monday  but as the new york times notes  the meeting took place just three floors below his office  even if trump argues that jr  and kushner weren t officially part of his campaign  he can t make that claim about manafort this is serious stuff  trump jr  asked to see the information  solicitation   and such information would be considered to be a  thing of value   it s both illegal to solicit and it s illegal for a campaign to accept a things of value from foreign entity  and it s hard to dispute that such  dirt  on an opponent wouldn t be a thing of value a foreign national shall not  directly or indirectly  make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value  or expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation  in connection with any federal  state  or local election this won t be the final shoe to drop  though  rep  adam schiff  d california  says that the congressional intel committee has a lot more damaging information than the public knows  thankfully  though  the trump family keeps inching so much closer to hanging themselves featured image via drew angerer getty images
