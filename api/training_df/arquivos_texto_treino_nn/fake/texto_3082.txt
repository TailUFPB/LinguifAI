donald trump has chosen the worst of the worst to serve in his cabinet and republicans are trying to rush his nominees through before they have even been properly vetted  four of the nine nominees with confirmation hearings scheduled for this week have yet to complete the ethics review last week  the office of government ethics warned that several of trump s cabinet picks have yet to complete the vetting process  leaving the door wide open for  potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues   but republicans don t give a damn  at least not now  a few years ago  though  they cared a lot senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  in particular  used to have very strong feelings about the process nominees are to go through to be confirmed  in   when he was just a senator  he wrote a letter to then senate majority leader harry reid which included a list of certain  standards  that must be met before a confirmation hearing could even be scheduled go figure  number three on this list dealt with financial disclosures  the very issue trump s picks are having such a hard time with  taxes are examined because they reveal potential conflicts of interest  but following trump s lead  his nominees don t want to come up off their financial records when it was obama s nominees in question  mcconnell wanted them vetted to the fullest  however  now that trump is the one making the nominations  he is ready to push them through without question senate minority leader chuck schumer knew just how to deal with mcconnell s jaw dropping hypocrisy  schumer read mcconnell s letter on the senate floor monday afternoon  i only ask  respectfully  that the republican majority follow the same set of standards they had in  when the shoe was on the other foot   schumer said on the floor schumer presented mcconnell with a copy of the letter  but with a few minor changes  and successfully smacked him down with his very own words  while the original was addressed to reid  schumer scratched out his name and replaced it with mcconnell s  he also scratched out mcconnell s original signature and signed his own name instead  you can see the changes below image via huffington postrepublicans think they can change the rules whenever it suits them  way to go schumer  i can t think of a more fitting response to this hypocritical bullsh t featured image via drew angerer getty images
