since donald trump s november  election victory  there has been a significant rise in hate based threats and attacks in the united states  with the southern poverty law center  splc  documenting   such incidents between then and april  at least  of which took place on college campuses  in fact  in the  days following the election  there was an average of  incidents per day at the peak of these occurrences immediately following the election  there was a  percent spike in bias based incidents when compared to daily hate crimes reported by the fbi for all of   to be completely honest  these types of incidents have decreased slightly in recent months  but the most troubling part of this whole situation is the increase in the severity of the attacks what makes these incidents even more frightening is the sheer amount that occur on college campuses  thanks mostly to an upsurge in white supremacists campaigning and recruiting in american colleges  it is getting so bad that the splc has documented more than  incidents of white supremacist and nationalist recruitment efforts on us campuses since the commencement of the  academic year  it s a definite uptick  and they ve been making a concerted effort to flyer and paper as many campuses as they possibly can   says lecia brooks  the splc s outreach director  adding that the campaigning has notably increased since trump s presidential victory  it shouldn t be hidden   brooks said in reference to incidents documented at schools across the entire country   the  administrations should always issue a strong statement of condemnation clearly stating who they  are and what they represent  encouraging students to disregard their recruitment  and disavow their message  the result of these recruitment efforts is a huge escalation in hate based incidents on college campuses  including tommy curry  an african american philosophy professor at texas a m university  constantly receiving death threats via email and voice messages  the stabbing death of richard w collins  an african american bowie state university student  while visiting the university of maryland and the election of taylor dumpson  american university in washington dc s first african american  female student government president  being met with nooses tied around the campus with bananas labeled  harambe bait   and those are only the tip of the iceberg  i think the most threatening part is that we re beginning to see this rise up again because people feel comfortable and they feel empowered to have these kinds of beliefs  and that s terrifying   dumpson said featured image via scott olson getty images
