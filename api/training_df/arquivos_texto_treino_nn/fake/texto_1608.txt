donald trump s self congratulatory ad to celebrate his first  days in the white house is gross enough to make you want to shudder and vomit  it s full of trump s  accomplishments   there aren t many  and portray trump in a light that is clearly not in line with his true character and behavior if you ve been fortunate enough not to see this ad yet  you can watch it below if you want to ruin your whole day one network has already rejected the ad and refused to air it  after cnn reviewed the ad  they decided not to accept it because of the way trump s team portrayed the media as  fake news  and as usual  trump s team responded in the most childish way  in a statement on trump s campaign website  titled  fake news station refuses to run ad highlighting the president s first  days   his team wrote this  it is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that president trump is trying to share with the country  it s clear that cnn is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesn t fit their narrative   said michael glassner  executive director cnn takes issue with the ad s message calling out the mainstream media for peddling fake news and not reporting on the fact that president trump is making america great again cnn has struck back  explaining their decision to keep the ad off of the network until the  fake news  graphic was taken off  trump s attack on the media is absolutely disgusting  and it s only helped them  it s been proven that americans trust the mainstream media far more than the president   and this is exactly why  we hope that more networks will follow in cnn s footsteps  because no one should have to look at trump s lies featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
