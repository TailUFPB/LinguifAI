the republican party and the trump white house just suffered a humiliating defeat as their signature campaign promise   to repeal and replace the affordable care act immediately   couldn t even pass a vote on the house floor with a large gop majority of course  this is a major victory for democrats  and a political disaster for republicans  senate minority leader chuck schumer wasted no time in blasting the republicans  inability to govern  and the trump white house in particular  in a press conference shortly after the bill failed  schumer said  the trumpcare bill failed because of two traits that have plagued the trump presidency since he took office  incompetence and broken promises   i have never seen an administration as incompetent as the one occupying the white house  schumer went on to openly mock trump s own claim to fame   deal making  he snarked   so much for the art of the deal   referencing trump s famous book  schumer went on to say that trumpcare should be abandoned in favor of fixing obamacare  they should depart the field  cut their losses and abandon their quixotic attempt to pass trumpcare once and for all  schumer then reminded republicans that he is willing to work with them on a fix for obamacare  but will not be helping them to repeal anything to do with the affordable care act  what we said  we stand by  if they would denounce repeal  then we ll work with them on improving  and making it better  but they can t continue to want to repeal  schumer went on to remind everyone of a truth that we see every time republicans are in power  they are very good at criticizing  they re not very good at governing  schumer also waved away trump s pathetic attempt to blame democrats for the bill s failure  and even went so far as to essentially call him a liar  it s another one of his big tall tales  he couldn t get enough republican votes  he never tried to reach out to democrats in any way  so the blame falls with president trump and with the republicans  indeed  they know how to be against things  how to try and pass draconian laws that are way outside the mainstream opinion of the american people  but when it comes to actually making lives better and making government work  they haven t a clue thanks for your candor  senator schumer  we need voices like yours right now featured image by alex wong via getty images
