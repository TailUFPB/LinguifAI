ever since donald trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women  trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever following in the republican nominee s footsteps  their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton s husband  former president bill clinton  for the rape allegations against him hillary is taking this all in stride  and is completely shutting down any trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving america forward  during a rally with al gore in florida today  clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist  here s a video of one such supporter  who obviously refuses to acknowledge the fact that his own candidate has several rape cases against him  one involving a minor  for  day in a row  a protester has interrupted hrc by yelling   bill clinton is a rapist   today in miami  holding wjc image  rape  sign  pic twitter com   monica alba   albamonica  october    clip of footage reveals a trump supporter doing the same thing  and hillary s supporters rush to drown him out as he is removed from the venue  hillary handled the whole thing like a pro  and laughed as she urged everyone to  focus on the issues that matter  you can watch clinton shut down this unfortunate trump supporter below protester in a shirt with  billclinton s face and the word  rape  escorted from  hillaryclinton rally pic twitter com   politico   politico  october    the way  these trump supporters aren t actually going to hillary s rallies and disrupting them because they truly care about justice for sexual assault victims  or believe trump is more innocent than bill clinton  they re doing it because radio host alex jones is offering to give anyone who can get on camera and call bill clinton a rapist     so basically  these people are just trying to get paid   much like trump himself on the upside  it looks like hillary can t be rattled by anything trump and his pathetic trump supporters do at this point featured image via joe raedle   getty images
