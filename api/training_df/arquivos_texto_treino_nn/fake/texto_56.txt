donald trump s twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy  unfortunately  since the orange overlord is now squatting in the oval office  those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives  and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world  case in point   the fact that he insisted upon attacking democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling  the children s health insurance program  the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca   and other important domestic policy initiatives  apparently  trump saw fit to take to twitter to accuse his old pals  chuck and nancy  of not being strong enough on crime and immigration  and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them meeting with  chuck and nancy  today about keeping government open and working  problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked  are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes  i don t see a deal   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    this out of the blue attack  democratic minority leaders nancy pelosi  d ca  and chuck schumer  d ny  released a joint statement promptly pulling out of the meeting  which reads  given that the president doesn t see a deal between democrats and the white house  we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our republican counterparts in congress instead  leader pelosi then took to twitter herself to take trump on given that the president doesn t see a deal between democrats and the white house  we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our republican counterparts in congress instead   nancy pelosi   nancypelosi  november    than going to the white house for a show meeting that won t result in an agreement  we ve asked  senatemajldr    speakerryan to meet this afternoon  read my full statement w   senschumer here  https   t co   nancy pelosi   nancypelosi  november    s likely best that the democrats don t go meet with trump anyway  he is clearly becoming more and more unhinged by the day  there was absolutely no reason for him to attack these leaders who had set up a time to meet with him in good faith  then again  we re led by a crazy man  and there s not much sense in anything at all anymore look for that government shutdown  folks  it s coming watch a video on the situation  below featured image via zach gibson   pool getty images
