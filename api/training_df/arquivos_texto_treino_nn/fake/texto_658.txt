donald trump is terrified of special counsel robert mueller  this is especially true since it has been revealed that mueller has now impaneled a grand jury in washington d c  in the russian probe  now  according to a former fbi agent  trump is right to be very  very worried asha rangappa is now a national security analyst for cnn  she also is the associate dean of yale law school  before that  though  she worked for the fbi  on saturday  she had a warning for trump  and hopeful news for the american people  first  she talked about disgraced national security adviser michael flynn  and the mueller team s request that the white house hand over all documents relating to flynn s short and troubled time in the white house  they probably honed in on a crime or some set of crimes that they want to get more information on  they re probably looking for any kind of communications  of course  this is likely related to foreign payments that flynn received but did not immediately disclose  then  rangappa went on to say that the grand jury is definitely bad news for trump and the people in his orbit  the new grand jury is an indication that this is expanding  this is probably still in the early stages  it would be normal at this point to collect more evidence  so they want possibly financial records  they want people to come in and testify under oath to get more information and they re going to use that to proceed  so this is going to be one stage of many as i explained to some people  if this were a tv drama  this might be episode   so  stay tuned  there s more coming  this is getting hotter by the day  and no amount of trump s going on unhinged twitter rants about how the russia story is  fake news   a  witch hunt   or a  hoax  will stop robert mueller from getting to the bottom of what happened between team trump and the russians  we will be staying tuned for sure  ms  rangappa  you can bet on that watch the video below featured image via ann heisenfelt getty images
