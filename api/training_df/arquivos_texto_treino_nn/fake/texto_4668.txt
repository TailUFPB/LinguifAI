marine corps veteran frank biggio appreciates your recognition of his services  but he doesn t want it anymore  this year is far too important  instead  he says  he wants you to vote and he wants you to vote for hillary clinton in an op ed in cleveland com  biggio outlined strong differences between the two major party candidates  and for him  trump is unacceptable one of our options includes a man who has glibly spoken about using nuclear weapons in europe and the middle east and seems unconcerned about nuclear proliferation by other countries simply because it is  going to happen anyway   who fails to comprehend the deterrent effect of u s  troops in south korea against increasingly belligerent threats by north korea  who would allow nato member states on russia s western border to fall to kremlin aggressions unless they  pay up   and who has denigrated the family of an army captain killed in action while serving his country this is a mercurial man who will have almost unchecked authority to put uniformed men and women in harm s way  but whose understanding of foreign affairs and military strategy is based almost solely on his instincts rather than analysis biggio goes on to say that he has served under many commanders and none of them have resorted to  primitive and distracting antics like belligerent shouting or chest thumping   he also wrote about how every commander he s served under is humble with victories and takes responsibility for failures  trump  he said  would never credit his team for success and he d never take blame for failure  instead  biggio compared trump to the fictional captain queeg in  the caine mutiny  trump is no eisenhower  he s more like the fictional captain queeg played by humphrey bogart in  the caine mutiny    paranoid  erratic  condescending and ultimately incompetent  there are many other apt analogies  but each is equally frightening when thinking of trump directing the deployment of our military to today s ambiguous front lines  perhaps just to prove that he can biggio is concerned for the   million members of the military if trump is elected will we elect a man who  without offering any clarity  boasts that he  will be so good at the military  your head will spin   as if his high school graduation from a military academy validates that claim  and hopes that the electorate will simply trust that will be so  whose behavior and public comments cause a collective group of  foreign policy experts  most of whom are from the republican party and have at one time sat in the white house situation room and contemplated the implications   and repercussions   of deploying our military  to publicly denounce him and the security and foreign policy positions he has proposed biggio agrees with many that clinton is not without flaws  who is    but he admires and respects her experience  her pragmatism and the fact that she knows when to be decisive and when to exhibit restraint this election day  please thank me for my service by voting for hillary clinton as our president and commander in chief we will  major biggio featured image via cherie cullen getty images
