if someone had said just four months ago that our relationship with australia would suddenly become precarious  the world would have laughed in their face  then  somehow  we got donald trump and our relationship with the land down under suddenly became contentious  on thursday  for the second time in his short presidency  donald trump screwed over the australian prime minister   all so he could celebrate the house s healthcare vote the weird feud  for lack of a better word  began very soon after trump took office  trump hung up on australian prime minister malcolm turnbull over a dispute about refugees after bragging about his win  trump called the call  which was reportedly his fourth with a world leader that day   the worst call by far  it got worse on thursday when trump and the prime minister were supposed to hash out  or at least cool their differences  you can bet that turnbull is feeling anything but warm toward the united states after trump once again snubbed him  just so he could celebrate half a legislative victory the white house had initially set aside a chunk of time early thursday evening for the two leaders to hold a bilateral meeting ahead of their joint commemoration of the  anniversary of the battle of the coral sea at a dinner later that night instead  trump is now scheduled to spend  minutes with turnbull ahead of the ceremony  according to an updated schedule released by the white house source  washington postthis insult was on top of the fact that trump was already treating turnbull like a second class leader  trump hosts most foreign leaders in washington or at mar a lago  where they are treated like royalty  the meeting with turnbull  even in its planned form  was going to be held at the peninsula hotel in manhattan  with little fanfare australia  of course  is treating the incident with far more class than they ve been shown by trump  the delegation does not feel snubbed at all   said a senior australian official   it certainly understands the significant legislative achievement  the program was always on the understanding of fluidity  it s doubtful they re that understanding  they  after all  come from a country that cares about its people s health  plus  this was only half a victory  the disastrous trumpcare still needs to pass the senate featured image via cameron spencer getty images and mark wilson getty images
