donald trump has decided to throw out  years  worth of tradition for his inauguration by replacing the man who s done the announcing for presidential inaugurations since eisenhower s in   charlie brotman  that might not seem like a big deal  but given that his voice is so familiar for this  it s hard to understand why they would make such a move and it s not like it s a relief for brotman  he s heartbroken about it  he had already started preparing for his role in the ceremonies  saying he was told he wouldn t be involved in an email   at first i was destroyed   he said  according to d c  s abc affiliate  wjla   i ve been doing this for  years  that s eleven inaugurations for which he s worked  at   he might be old  but he s still healthy and apparently still perfectly able to do this  given that he was already preparing the presidential inauguration committee issued a statement that said  since   millions of americans and countless entertainers have come to recognize charlie brotman as the voice of the inaugural parade  the presidential inaugural committee will be proud to honor charlie as announcer chairman emeritus on january   we are thrilled for steve ray to be introducing a new generation of americans to the grand traditions of the inaugural parade  that s not the same as having him actually do it  and he s weighing whether to even accept that  or the vip seat he s been offered  this is something that would be more appropriate had brotman said he was retiring  or was otherwise unable to do it again steve ray is a freelance announcer who has done a lot of work  including promotional spots for the washington nationals  but one fishy point about this is that he helped with for trump s campaign trump has been working hard to grant favors to people who worked on his campaign  giving many of them high positions within his transition team  did he tell the inauguration committee to find someone who had worked for him  did he tell them that he knew ray and that ray should do the announcing brotman believes it s more likely ageism at work  maybe they re afraid i might drop dead at the mic  right now  nobody s really explaining this decision  regardless  unlike trump  who s petty and childish as all fuck and would scream about betrayal on twitter while wishing for his replacement to fall flat on their face  brotman wishes ray no ill will  in fact  he s flat said that he wants ray to  do spectacular   and that he wishes ray luck in this featured image by ethan miller via getty images
