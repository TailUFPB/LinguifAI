house republicans are spending much of their time and the taxpayers  money persecuting hillary clinton in order to sabotage her presidential campaign  and rep  elijah cummings is sick of it over the last four days  republicans have called three  emergency  hearings of the house oversight committee to investigate hillary clinton s emails despite the fact that fbi director james comey has already completely debunked gop claims that she intentionally destroyed emails to hide something during the third hearing on tuesday  ranking committee member rep  elijah cummings took republicans and committee chairman rep  jason chaffetz to the woodshed  or engaging in these political witch hunts  today is the third  emergency  hearing in four business days  third emergency hearing about secretary clinton s e mails in four business days   cummings began   third in four days  emergency  i believe this committee is abusing taxpayer dollars and authority of congress in an astonishing onslaught of political attacks to damage secretary clinton s campaign for president of the united states of america   cummings continued  this is the first time in my  years in congress that i have personally witnessed the oversight power of this committee abused in such a transparently political manner to directly influence a presidential campaign the point of today s hearing is to investigate baseless republican accusations that secretary clinton  or her aides  ordered destruction of emails to conceal them from investigators  the most important fact for the day s hearing is that the fbi already investigated these accusations and thoroughly debunked them  they interviewed witnesses  examined forensic evidence and concluded that these accusations have no merit  fbi director  james  comey stated  and i quote   we found no evidence that any of the additional work related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them   end of quote  he went on to say  and i quote   we did not find any evidence of evil intent  intent to obstruct justice  cummings then described the strategy republicans are using in order to continue to attack hillary even though their charges have been proved to be untrue  of course  republicans did not like the answers that the fbi director gave  so they simply manufactured today s hearing out of thin air  this entire hearing is a contrived campaign photo op step one  publicly accuse the witnesses of criminal activity  no matter how ludicrous  then refer them to attorney s office for investigation step two  the next day invite the same witnesses to an emergency hearing on those criminal accusations and rush to issue a flurry of unilateral subpoenas demanding they testify  no debate  no vote step three  express false outrage when these witnesses   this is a playbook   express false outrage when these witnesses  who you just accused of criminal activity take advice from their counsel to assert their fifth amendment right to not testify  there you have it   presto  instant photo op  here s the video via youtube republicans should pay a heavy price for relentlessly attacking hillary clinton in congress like they have been doing over the years with their never ending investigations into benghazi and her emails  it s a total waste of money and time  but they would rather spend it on political persecution and character assassination instead of on dealing with real problems facing our nation featured image via screen capture
