by now  you have probably heard that the fbi and five other intelligence agencies have  for months  been investigating ties between many of trump s top level people and russia  on thursday  the new york times told us who it is the counterintelligence investigation centers at least in part on the business dealings that some of the president elect s past and present advisers have had with russia  mr  manafort has done business in ukraine and russia  some of his contacts there were under surveillance by the national security agency for suspected links to russia s federal security service  one of the officials said mr  manafort is among at least three trump campaign advisers whose possible links to russia are under scrutiny  two others are carter page  a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign  and roger stone  a longtime republican operative the f b i  is leading the investigations  aided by the national security agency  the c i a  and the treasury department s financial crimes unit  the investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing  the officials said  one official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the white house counterintelligence investigations examine the connections between american citizens and foreign governments  those connections can involve efforts to steal state or corporate secrets  curry favor with american government leaders or influence policy  it is unclear which russian officials are under investigation  or what particular conversations caught the attention of american eavesdroppers  the legal standard for opening these investigations is low  and prosecutions are rare in short  it s unlikely that anyone will be charged  but we as americans have every reason to be concerned with the people with whom trump surrounds himself  manafort  naturally  calls the allegations a democrat party dirty trick and completely false  i have never had any relationship with the russian government or any russian officials  i was never in contact with anyone  or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone   he adds  on the  russian hacking of the d n c    my only knowledge of it is what i have read in the papers   politifact confirmed last year that manafort has many relationships with pro putin politicians in ukraine at minimum while trump will attempt to connect this to the  page  pee pee dossier  published by buzzfeed   the one handed to trump and obama by intelligence agencies   the fbi says that the decision to open the investigation was not based on those in the least the f b i  investigation into mr  manafort began last spring  and was an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro russian political party in ukraine and for the country s former president  viktor f  yanukovych  in august  the times reported that mr  manafort s name had surfaced in a secret ledger that showed he had been paid millions in undisclosed cash payments  the associated press has reported that his work for ukraine included a secret lobbying effort in washington aimed at influencing american news organizations and government officials mr  stone  a longtime friend of mr  trump s  said in a speech in florida last summer that he had communicated with julian assange  the founder of wikileaks  the anti secrecy group that published the hacked democratic emails  during the speech  mr  stone predicted further leaks of documents  a prediction that came true within weeks in a brief interview on thursday  mr  stone said he had never visited russia and had no russian clients  he said that he had worked in ukraine for a pro western party  but that any assertion that he had ties to russian intelligence was  nonsense  and  totally false  the whole thing is a canard   he said   i have no russian influences  the senate intelligence committee has started its own investigation into russia s purported attempts to disrupt the election  the committee s inquiry is broad  and will include an examination of russian hacking and possible ties between people associated with mr  trump s campaign and russia investigators are also scrutinizing people on the periphery of mr  trump s campaign  such as mr  page  a former merrill lynch banker who founded global energy capital  an investment firm in new york that has done business with russia in an interview on thursday  mr  page expressed bewilderment about why he might be under investigation  he blamed a smear campaign   that he said was orchestrated by mrs  clinton   for media speculation about the nature of his ties to russia  i did nothing wrong  for the   time   he said  his adversaries  he added  are  pulling a page out of the watergate playbook  what further details will the investigation reveal  only time will tell   but donald trump is now our president  and his cozy relationship with vladimir putin is terrifyingly clear  all you have to do is look at his twitter account featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla win mcnamee spencer platt
