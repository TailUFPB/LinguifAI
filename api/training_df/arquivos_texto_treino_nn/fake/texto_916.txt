donald trump simply cannot seem to stop embarrassing himself   and thus america   on the world stage  right now  he is in europe for the incredibly important g  summit  in which he is sharing a stage with people who are  well  qualified to be world leaders  whereas he clearly is not  it s also no secret that all of those leaders think he is a fool and a buffoon  as if that wasn t bad enough  trump also spent his time bashing the american free press in a joint press conference with the polish president  he also went after the intelligence community  and of course  couldn t resist taking a few shots at president obama now  those things are already seriously problematic  however  the real  visible shocker came as trump finished his speech on the stage in poland   in front of a crowd the polish government had bussed in to cheer for trump because they are aware of how fragile his ego is  when he was done speaking  trump walked from behind the bullet proof barrier that was there to protect his life  but instead of walking off the stage or going toward his security detail  he just wandered around looking confused  clearly unsure of what to do next  finally  he just stood there like a deer in headlights now  i am no doctor  and far be it from me to diagnose the man with anything  i won t do that  but something seems to be seriously wrong there  that s not just trump s rank incompetence  that s clear confusion  he literally had no clue what was going on around him or what he was supposed to be doing  i guess we should be grateful he managed to read from a teleprompter for a bit before whatever is going on with him reared its ugly head and this is the guy with the nuclear codes  think about that and fear for the future of the world watch this amazing video below trump gets lost in poland  pic twitter com mlszswdwaz  vic berger iv   vicbergeriv  july    image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
