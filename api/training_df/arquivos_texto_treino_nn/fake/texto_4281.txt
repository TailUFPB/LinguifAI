at the second presidential debate  donald trump had a chance to address the controversy surrounding his claim that he greets seemingly every woman he meets by grabbing them  by the pussy   to trump  this was  locker room talk   though i can t say i have ever been in a locker room in which anyone has bragged about sexually assaulting women  to the rest of us  it was a horrific reminder that the  gop nominee is exactly the sort of person to make creepy sexual remarks about his own daughter   a man who has been sued for  grabbing someone by the pussy   the woman was branded a liar   who is being sued for the sexual assault of a  year old girl  and who admitted he was attracted to  year old paris hilton asked if the donald had actually sexually assaulted women  he repeated that it was  locker room talk   whatever that means   but was reticent to admit that he doesn t walk about grabbing women by the pussy   largely because  one can safely assume  he can not honestly say that he has not sexually assaulted a woman   sniffles  deflected to isis for a while before explaining that  it s just one of those things  asked if he has ever kissed or groped a woman without her consent  trump replied that he  has great respect for women  and that  nobody has more respect for women than he does  for the record  you re saying you never did that   anderson cooper said  fishing for clarification  i ve said things  you hear these things i ve said  and i was embarrassed by it but i have tremendous respect for women and they have respect for me   trump said  once again evading the question  have you ever done those things   cooper pressed  finally earning an offhanded  no i have not  from trump before he went on to call bill clinton a rapist watch it below
