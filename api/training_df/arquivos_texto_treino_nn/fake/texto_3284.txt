if donald trump wanted people to think he isn t joined at the hip to russian president vladimir putin  this is a strange way to do it  apparently not satisfied with his own attacks on hillary clinton  trump has now resorted to citing putin to somehow add extra venom to his catty remarks about the former democratic presidential nominee president elect donald trump agreed with vladimir putin s assessment of the hillary clinton s loss in the  presidential election in a friday night tweet the russian president said democrats were  losing on all fronts and looking elsewhere for things to blame  and said that the loss  degrades their own dignity   according to the washington post  outstanding figures in american history from the ranks of the democratic party would likely be turning in their graves  roosevelt certainly would be   putin told a group of journalists in moscow  according to the paper putin is celebrating the results of the election going his way  as he has had something of a vendetta against clinton for years after she opposed him while serving as secretary of state the double edged attack comes on the heels of revelations that putin allegedly directed hackers to go after clinton  stealing emails from democratic officials including her campaign chairman john podesta  later delivering those emails to wikileaks who published them for the world to see trump has denied that russia stole the emails  instead arguing that it is unknown who did the hacking  but trump has actually received intelligence briefings indicating russian guilt  which he has chosen to ignore in his public statements the attacks on clinton also highlight that trump is still sore about the fact that while he won the election via the electoral college  he was still the recipient of less raw votes than clinton  for all time the historical record will show that nearly  million more people voted for clinton over him featured image via flickr
