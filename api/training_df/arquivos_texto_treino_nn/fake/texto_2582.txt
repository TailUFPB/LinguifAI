did you know that people who support donald trump s unconstitutional muslim ban are idiots  this isn t just a flippant remark about them  there s evidence   like the fact that most of them think the bowling green massacre  which did not happen  completely justifies trump s executive order a new report from public policy polling found that most americans    to  percent   view the  travel ban  as targeting muslims   and only  percent of americans support that position  in fact  the phrase  one would have to be an idiot to support the muslim ban  is now more true than ever  do you agree or disagree with the following statement   the bowling green massacre shows why we need donald trump s executive order on immigration   respondents were asked  with  percent disagreeing and only  percent backing that position the low number of americans who still somehow think the bowling green massacre is real is positive   but when ppp looked at numbers among trump supporters  they found that more than half view the massacre that didn t happen as justification for trump s ban   of americans consider the united states to be a safe country  to only   who consider it unsafe  perhaps as an outgrowth of that sentiment only   of voters support trump s executive order on immigration  to   who are opposed to it  among those who do support it you have to wonder how well thought out their position is  by a   margin trump voters say that the bowling green massacre shows why trump s immigration policy is needed  by a   spread  voters do think that the intent of the executive order is to be a muslim ban  and just   support a muslim ban  to   who are opposed trump is likely sweating bullets  as the poll also reveals that almost half    percent of americans   want to see him impeached  his henchmen and women are growing steadily more unpopular too   percent of americans  compared to  percent who like her  find kellyanne conway to be detestable   percent    like him  are dissatisfied with sean spicer s performance  a whopping  percent  compared to  percent  don t like education secretary betsy devos  and  percent hate trump s best friend vladimir putin  in fact   a sign of how desperate things have gotten   more americans   percent to  percent  say they would rather see mike pence as president than trump  hillary clinton still wins in that regard   percent to  percent even worse for trump is the demographics of those polled  only  percent of respondents identify as democrats while  percent say they are republicans or independents  the exact groups trump courted when he was running for president  in other words  there s no claiming that this poll was loaded with democrats for trump fans donald trump said during the election that he loves the  poorly educated   but he might as well have said stupid  though kellyanne conway has used the bowling green massacre in her scaremongering numerous time and ultimately admitted she lied about its existence  the donald s supporters still take it as gospel  they ve gone from  alternative facts  to  alternative reality  featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla  screengrab
