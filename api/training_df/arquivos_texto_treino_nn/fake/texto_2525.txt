on tuesday afternoon  legendary journalist dan rather weighed in on the trump administration s latest scandal involving former national security advisor michael flynn s collusion with russia  watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime  until maybe now  it was the closest we came to a debilitating constitutional crisis  until maybe now   rather began  he explained that while he rates watergate as a   and the flynn scandal is only at a  or  right now  the situation  is cascading in intensity seemingly by the hour   in hindsight  he said  we may one day see that  this is at least as big as watergate   this  is chilling   rather said  when we look back at watergate  we remember the end of the nixon presidency  it came with an avalanche   rather continued  but up until then  things had  rumbled along with a low grade intensity   things are different this time around   this russia story started out with an avalanche and where we go from here no one really knows   he explained we are still less than a month into the trump presidency  and many are asking that question made famous by tennessee senator howard baker those many years ago   what did the president know  and when did he know it  rather noted that recent reports indicate that trump has been aware of flynn s treasonous conversations for weeks  this leads him to ask   how far does this go  the white house has no credibility on this issue  their spigot of lies   can t we finally all agree to call them lies   long ago lost them any semblance of credibility  i would also extend that to the republican congress  who has excused away the trump administration s assertions for far too long  we need an independent investigation  damn the lies  full throttle forward on the truth   declared the famed journalist  he added that truth is definitely proving to be stranger than fiction when it comes to trump s scandal ridden presidency  if a scriptwriter had approached hollywood with what we are witnessing  he or she would probably have been told it was way too far fetched for even a summer blockbuster  but this is not fiction   rather said   it is real and it is serious  deadly serious  we deserve answers and those who are complicit in this scandal need to feel the full force of justice  you can read rather s post in its entirety here  featured image by robin marchant via getty images for awxi
