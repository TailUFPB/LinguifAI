trump just will not stop hammering his border wall as the solution to every problem we ve ever had  in addition to the u s  government sending  notices of taking  to texans living along the u s  mexico border  the white house has now released its requirements for the wall  fox news posted the list to twitter  and it s just ridiculous border wall requirements  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  march    first it looks like this could be a joke  until you see the blue checkmark next to fox news  twitter name  these three requirements are hilarious because they re so vague they say absolutely nothing  it s like fox called trump up out of the blue  said   what are the requirements for the border wall   and trump replied with   oh  um  yes  the wall  yes  um  requirements nothing about a better pricing estimate  what materials they think they need where  how they plan to keep it from interrupting migration patterns or diverting floodwaters  or anything that might actually tell us what the true requirements for this wall are  just three vague things that demonstrate the trump administration is more about touting the wall than they are about actually planning for it the last two are especially odd   look good from u s  side   it must also look  imposing  from the mexican side  aside from the fact that this looks like a toddler wrote it  we do know that nobody wants an eyesore in their backyard but a  ft wall may well be an eyesore anyway no matter how  tasteful  they try and make it look  for instance  those living along the rio grande  where their view is of a river and they re closely intertwined with sister cities in mexico  are likely to suffer both from the eyesore that is a giant wall  are they going to build it out of plexiglas to avoid interrupting views  no  it has to look  imposing  from the far side in reality  some communities might benefit from rising property values  while others would suffer grievously when their local economies crash as people from their sister cities can t come across to shop anymore  the way it looks won t help the communities that are going to suffer regardless  difficult to climb or cut through   well duh  really  they ve been saying the entire time that the whole point of having a wall is to keep people from being able to climb over it or cut through it like they can in places along the existing fence  but people will still climb it  people will still tunnel under it  and some might find ways around them via the oceans when you consider the fact that most undocumented immigrants entered the u s  legally on a visitor visa  and then just never left  it makes  difficult to climb or cut through  seem even more absurd  it would be nice to know what the administration believes this wall will truly require in terms of  well  everything  since we re the ones who are going to pay for it  but it would be even nicer if they d drop it altogether  since our tax dollars are going towards a massive waste of time  money and resources featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
