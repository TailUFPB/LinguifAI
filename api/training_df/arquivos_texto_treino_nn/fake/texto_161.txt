sean hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on monday night in defense of donald trump the fox news host went off on a seriously delusional rant about hillary clinton  even referring to her as  president clinton  on two occasions hannity whined about the indictments against paul manafort and rick gates  and just like donald trump  attempted to shift the focus from trump s russia collusion to hillary clinton  this is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable   hannity whined   hillary clinton  bill clinton  the obama administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story  major crimes were committed  they knew about it  they did nothing before the deal  hannity is referring to the uranium one deal the obama administration made with russia back in   trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes basically  the deal gave a russian company no more than a  percent stake in a canadian based mining company and ownership of   percent of the currently licensed uranium in situ recovery production capacity in the u s  this deal does not harm our national security as hannity claims  nor did hillary clinton personally approve of the deal  factcheck org recently gave a run down of the deal and thoroughly debunked trump and hannity s claims  as we ve written before  there is no evidence that donations to the clinton foundation from people with ties to uranium one or bill clinton s speaking fee influenced hillary clinton s official actions   factcheck org wrote   that s still the case  in fact  not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees  only  percent of overall u s  production of uranium comes from uranium one  and that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors  basically  the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if uranium one was not held by a russian company  this deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through  and was even publicly announced  but hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened of course  hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and trump are full of shit and that trump committed treason to steal an election  we are at a major crisis point in america tonight  do we have equal justice under the law in this country today  if you or i or anybody in this room with me now or watching tv with you  if we ever did anything close to what the clintons  the dnc  and others did  we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file  the only difference between trump russia collusion is that we have the evidence  and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories  they have none  and just like we have the evidence  when it comes to clinton and her email server scandal  why hasn t she been charged  here s the video via youtube hillary clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is zero evidence that she did  trump  on the other hand  is about to go down for collusion clearly  nobody gives trump a blowjob like sean hannity  and frankly  he and fox news should be sued for slander featured image  screenshot
