donald trump likes feuds  he cannot  for any reason  take criticism  so the second someone says something less than a million percent complimentary about him  trump has to lash out  his latest target is a union leader for carrier  the company that trump has been boasting about all over the place because he supposedly saved bunches of jobs  however  trump inflated the numbers  and  worst of all  left out the problematic nature of the deal  which included   million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the united states chuck jones  the leader of the union for the workers at that indiana plant  said that trump  quote   lied his ass off  about the deal  including the number of jobs saved  well  this led trump to attack jones via twitter  and voila  a new trump feud is born  now  as if it weren t bad enough that trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president elect  republican national committee spokesman sean spicer is also joining in the dog piling on jones  on thursday  spicer went on fox news and said the following of jones  he should be grateful for mr  trump and  gov   pence s efforts to save those jobs  here you have a guy that talked about carrier and the importance of keeping jobs  he picks up the phone and closes a deal  you ve got a   people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs  they get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits  that s something that should be celebrated  no  trump s lies should not be celebrated  mr  spicer  were some jobs saved  sure  but the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one  and it is costing indiana taxpayers   you know  the folks trump keeps promising to help   millions  further  it s not chuck jones who lied  it s donald trump  splicer insisted that it was jones lying about trump  though  and then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason  i think mr  trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding  this is the problem with trump cronies and mouthpieces  they swallow every outrage  every lie  as if none of it matters  they refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their cheeto jesus  and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes look forward to four years of not just trump acting like a whiny  narcissistic baby  but  apparently  he ll have the might of the entire gop behind him doing the same featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
