corey lewandowski is still beating the trump drum on cnn  including defending trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game  there s just one tiny problem   he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to john kerry s shakeup in  and we all remember how that election turned out the comments came just after now former campaign chair paul manafort resigned from the campaign  which just strengthened all the talk that trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does  lewandowski tried to counter that by saying  this campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes  if you look at john kerry s campaign  when he was running  he was making changes as late as labor day  and don t forget we re still in august  no  i understand  but the change in  that john kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing  so  kerry still lost  there is no getting around that fact  kerry lost by about  million votes and  electoral votes  yes  it was a close election  but really  he still lost and we still got four more years of george w  bush  it s hard to imagine that anybody of lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that this is the kind of ignorance that s pervading trump s campaign  things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge  tens of millions don t attend his rallies  and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased lewandowski is a perfect trump proxy with his head full of cotton  the main difference between him and those currently on trump s staff is that the cotton filling their heads is a little more coarse  watch him completely screw up history below featured image via drew angerer getty images
