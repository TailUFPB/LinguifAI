a trump loving white shopper had a racist meltdown of  babytrump proportions last week  all because she was asked to purchase a   reusable bag to make carrying all her items easier the woman had been shopping at arts and crafts store michael s in chicago on thanksgiving eve  when the offer to buy the bag apparently put her over the edge  claiming that she was being discriminated against because she was white  the unidentified shopper exploded with rage and began shouting  i voted for trump   so there  you want to kick me out for that  and look who won  her rant continued as she started to attack the african american employees which prompted jessie grady  another customer  to pull out her cell phone and start recording the verbal abuse  grady said the trump loving woman went into a   minute racist rant complete with yelling and cursing and repeated references to the fact that both employees were african american  eventually  the enraged shopper realized she was being recorded and also became confrontational with grady  she got closer to grady and said then  the woman accused grady s baby of stealing before returning to her original plan  attacking the store s black employees  she yelled  you re a liar  i don t care  because i m a consumer  i m a customer  this is ten minutes of the shopper s meltdown  and an absolute sorry excuse for an american  see for yourself since this video has been uploaded to youtube  it has gone viral  grady said the reason she recorded the video was protect the store s employees and  keep them from getting in trouble for no reason  because  the customer is always right   grady was so disgusted by this shopper s actions that she started a gofundme campaign to help the store manager who suffered most of the attack by this racist  she said  i d like to do something to try to make it up to the employee who was the main target of this racist attack  i d like to show her that many people are horrified by how this woman treated her  and that we stand with her and appreciate her hard work  she inspired me because despite the hateful words that were being hurled in her direction  she stood in that entrance way calm and unmoving to protect her staff and customers   in the current climate i believe it s very important that we go out of our way to treat each other with dignity  kindness and politeness  and that we stand up for each other when we see people being mistreated  the gofundme account has already reached a few thousand dollars  but there is no amount of money that can erase abuse and racism  these attacks are becoming more and more common  as we re seeing trump supporters embracing their white privilege and feeling less inhibited to express blatant racism  the trump effect is ruining our country  and quickly featured image via screenshots
