donald trump has seriously insulted our intelligence community and his continuing refusal to listen to them is putting america at risk just ask j c  carleson  a former covert cia officer who has been on the ground in hot spots around the world  including iraq and afghanistan  and understands that facts are the difference between life and death in an article for fortune  carleson warned that trump s obsession with twitter while ignoring his intelligence briefings are more serious than many americans believe  in a world where breitbart headlines can create lurid stories out of thin air  the daily brief s stubborn reliance on facts and expert analysis might seem positively archaic   carleson began so far  trump has ignored most of his daily briefings  a trait that proved disastrous in  when terrorists brought down the world trade center with airplanes on september   months prior to the attack  bush ignored a memo that al qaeda was determined to strike the united states using airplanes the bottom line is that if trump does not take intelligence briefings seriously and refuses to listen to them because he thinks he is smarter than the people who have been doing this work for decades  we re going to see real consequences and it will start with the people on the ground like carleson  who risk their lives to gain intelligence to pass on to policymakers in order to prevent terrorist attacks and wars  to a person  every asset i ever recruited or worked with genuinely believed that  in providing information to the united states government  he or she was doing something that in the long run would help right wrongs  improve circumstances both locally and globally  and possibly avert large scale tragedies   carleson wrote   i fear that trump s rejection of both the content and the conclusions offered to him by the intelligence community will have a profound chilling effect on the recruitment of new assets  and the willingness of existing assets to continue to provide information  this disregard has consequences beyond trump s own dearth of information  because once again  it serves to erode the motivation of those who might provide us with information we desperately need information that may include details of threats to american lives and infrastructure  for example small and  yes  sometimes repetitive details that cumulatively inform us of impending terrorist attacks  progress on covert weapons programs  cyberthreats  and countless other plots and dangers faced by our nation every day  but why should either potential assets or foreign intelligence services trust the cia if our own president does not and carleson is absolutely right  why should foreign assets trust the cia with information that trump is going to ignore because if the united states is not going to act because trump writes off everything the cia says as lies  assets would probably rather take the information elsewhere or simply let the united states be attacked and become the victim of our own refusal to accept facts  and that will only help nations like russia and china and other nations that would love to watch our country burn the world knows that  in the incoming administration  facts will be ignored  and reasoned analysis will be rejected  if trump continues to publicly scorn the cia s briefings and conclusions  assets and cooperative foreign intelligence services will become increasingly disinclined to provide sensitive information  without confidence that their cooperation will have any kind of positive effect  the risks quickly outweigh the results  on an individual level  the why determines the what  and without the motivation of knowing that their sacrifices will ultimately make a difference  cia sources may choose  in trump s parlance  to walk away from the deal this is exactly why trump should never have been allowed to become president  and it s why conservatives are unfit to have any power within our government  facts do not matter to them  and we live in a time when facts matter most  if america is attacked or our enemies walk all over us  it will be trump s fault  he will be to blame along with all the republicans who kissed his ass  and then the american people will have a choice to make  do we allow trump to continue putting our nation and our lives at risk  or do we do something about it featured image  drew angerer getty images
