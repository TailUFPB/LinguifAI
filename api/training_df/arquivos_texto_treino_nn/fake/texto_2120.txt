funny how this just keeps happening yet another trump advisor has been caught having ties to a shady  fascist linked group in europe  no it wasn t trump s former campaign manager who had ties to pro russian ukrainian separatists  or his former national security advisor who was secretly working on behalf of the turkey during trump s campaign  or his former advisor who has ties to both russia and the hacker responsible for stealing the dnc s emails this time it is sebastian gorka  a top national security advisor who was just outed as being a member of a nazi allied hungarian group  oh  and he also violated immigration laws when he moved to the united states and didn t mention that he was  in fact  a friend of nazis   being a friend of nazis is sort of something the american government frowns upon   at least it was until january  of this year  gorka was first outed by the forward and things quickly came tumbling down the elite order  known as the vit zi rend  was established as a loyalist group by admiral miklos horthy  who ruled hungary as a staunch nationalist from  to october   a self confessed anti semite  horthy imposed restrictive jewish laws prior to world war ii and collaborated with hitler during the conflict  his cooperation with the nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of jews into nazi hands gorka s membership in the organization   if these vit zi rend leaders are correct  and if gorka did not disclose this when he entered the united states as an immigrant   could have implications for his immigration status  the state department s foreign affairs manual specifies that members of the vit zi rend  are presumed to be inadmissible  to the country under the immigration and nationality act first he  stonewalled  when asked about his ties to the nazi allied group  then the leaders of vit zi rend verified that he was a member of their organization which included taking what they call a  lifelong oath of loyalty to their group   and finally gorka refused to confirm or deny that he was a member of the group  as many have noted  being asked  are you a member of a pro nazi group   shouldn t be hard to answer  for most people it would be easy to say  no  or more colorfully  are you crazy  of course not  gorka instead told reporters to  send a request to white house press   sean spicer is about to have a really bad day the stonewalling by gorka comes at a time when the trump administration is already having trouble condemning anti semitism  trump s pathetic lack of moral fiber when it comes to intolerance coupled with the revelation that one of his closest advisors is a member of a group that handed  hundreds of thousands of jews into nazi hands  prompted the anne frank center to   once again   condemn the trump administration steven goldstein  executive director of the  annefrankcenter gave this statement  pic twitter com   talal ansari   talalnansari  march    what point do all these dots finally become connected  at what point is it too obvious a pattern to shrug off as coincidence  how many more nazis will it take featured image via alex wong getty images
