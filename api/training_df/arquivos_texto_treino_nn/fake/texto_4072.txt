donald trump will probably want to dump his new favorite slogan now the republican nominee has for talking for weeks about how he should be elected so he can  drain the swamp  in reference to the lawmakers and federal employees who work in washington d c   which was a swamp prior to being drained and used as the site of our nation s capital the phrase has become the centerpiece of trump s effort to persuade voters to support him on election day but trump s slogan alienates members of his own party since republicans control the senate and the house  and trump s own running mate mike pence was a congressman for  years  which doubles the number of years trump says he wants to limit members of congress to serving yep  donald trump is literally turning the old conservative line that government needs to be cleaned out against them and tharon johnson couldn t help but point that out during an appearance on cnn on sunday along with trump supporter paris dennard   a running mate who spent  years in the congress  was one of the most divisive members of congress   johnson began before referencing trump s gettysburg speech  this guy was the sole person who led a crusade to try to defund planned parenthood  as my friend paris said  before donald trump attempted to make a presidential statesman like policy speech  he spent the first fifteen minutes attacking his accusers  so when he makes comments about how we should enforce term limits  term limits are left up to the voters  that s why most members of the house and senate have elections two and six years  if someone is not effective then members will vote them out  and then johnson took trump s favorite new slogan and crushed it  let me respond to this really comical comment about draining the swamp  it s so laughable to me  if you drain that swamp what you would find at the bottom of that swamp would be donald trump  you would see to the side of him his playbook of his campaign showing you how not to run a campaign to become president of the united states  here s the video via youtube sorry  donald  but you just got owned featured image  spencer platt getty images
