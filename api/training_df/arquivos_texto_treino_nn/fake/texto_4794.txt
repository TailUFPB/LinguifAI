donald trump recently gave a speech to the american legion about the plans he has in mind for the children of america  and if he got his way it would affect every single one of them  but it would also break the law trump  playing to an audience with obvious military ties  brought up the idea of enforcing patriotism on children as part of the school curriculum republican presidential candidate donald trump signaled thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of  promoting american pride and patriotism in america s schools  in a trump administration  i plan to work directly with the american legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to america s children   trump said  speaking at the american legion s annual convention in cincinnati while the candidate argued that  we want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of america s history  its institutions and its heroes   doing so from the presidency would  in fact  break the law military times  in their coverage of trump s remarks  points this fact out the comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools  which is prohibited under federal law the comment is also ironic  as trump has repeatedly claimed that he is opposed to common core because it supposedly imposes a top down federal program in schools  in reality  the common core seeks to raise educational standards by rewarding local schools for improvements in their curriculum devised in the way they see fit  not as a top down federal mandate it is also unclear what brand of patriotism trump would decide to enforce on american children  throughout the campaign  he has advocated the idea that in his view certain races and faiths   particularly the latino race and muslim religion   are inferior and not worthy of constitutional protections  when the actual constitution makes no such distinctions  how could someone with that view seriously define patriotism for american children in all  states featured image via flickr
