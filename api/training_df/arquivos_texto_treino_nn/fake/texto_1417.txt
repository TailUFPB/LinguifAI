word has gone out through the white house that anyone caught speaking with reporters is as good as gone  according to reports that have come out today  staffers are making themselves scarce  not answering their phones  and keeping their heads down  according to senior aides  some staffers are literally hiding in their offices and refusing to come out while the white house press corp is around  this comes in the wake of startling revelations that president trump leaked israeli intelligence to the russians during a closed door meeting last week   do not ask me about how this looks  we all know how this looks   a senior white house aide told the daily beast earlier this week asked a longtime house gop staffer where things are headed   this is like reservoir dogs  everyone ends up dead on the floor    molly ball   mollyesque  may    sentiments  implying that trump is obviously guilty of collusion and mishandling classified information  have driven morale even lower  it s especially ironic  given how vocal president trump was during the campaign  hammering secretary clinton over and over again for her allegedly poor handling of classified emails  now that the tables have turned  white house staffers are losing faith in the administration part of the problem with morale stems from trump s leadership  or lack thereof  he s notorious for shifting blame and firing whoever sticks their heads up at the wrong time  in part  because trump doesn t seem to be able to take responsibility for his own actions none of that will surprise anyone paying attention to his disastrous administration  and it s not news to white house staffers either  they re waiting for the fallout  to see who will be blamed for trump s latest mess and whose head will roll in response to the latest news  until it becomes apparent which way the wind is blowing  smart staffers are in hiding that speaks to huge problems within the administration  the lack of trust  and fear of raising the ire of president trump sounds more like an abusive household than a presidential administration photo by win mcnamee via getty images
