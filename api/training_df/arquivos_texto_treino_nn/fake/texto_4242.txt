for the last year and a half  observers have wondered what donald trump would have to say or do in order to shake the confidence of his most diehard supporters they have stuck with him for almost the entire race  and while there are not enough of them for him to win the election  they provide a definite floor of support for his campaign as well congressman blake farenthold  r tx  appeared on msnbc s all in and gave a jaw dropping response for the type of behavior he would excuse from trump msnbc s chris hayes tested the limits of his allegiance  in an interview tuesday night  hayes asked farenthold if he would continue to support trump  if a tape came out with donald trump saying  i really like to rape women  farenthold s answer  maybe the congressman said  i like to rape women  could be a form of  locker room talk  depending on the  context  hayes went on to ask farenthold to elaborate on his answer  and he would only go so far as to say such a statement would  be bad  and that he would  consider  pulling his support here s the video the answer gives yet another real world example of the cult of personality surrounding trump and his presidential campaign  and the devotion his small but dedicated supporters have to the former reality tv star  trump himself acknowledged this bubble around his campaign some months ago  when he pointed out that he could shoot someone on fifth avenue in new york city and still retain their support but this devotion is also a major turnoff to everyone outside of the inner circle of support  while progressives have expressed frustration that nothing makes these supporters waver  it also comes off as creepy and strange to those looking in from the outside   just as happens with most cults  like the church of scientology or heaven s gate or jim jones  people s temple for a political campaign  it isn t a good look featured image via screen capture
