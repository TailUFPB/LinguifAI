here s a new low for america  during the unfolding tragedy in england  nbc announced that it would not be displaying the messages of donald trump  the president of the united states  because his tweets were spreading potential lies pres  trump has used twitter to share news report on london incident we aren t relaying president s retweet  as the info is unconfirmed   nbc nightly news   nbcnightlynews  june    decided the minutes after a possible terror incident in london would be a good time to retweet fear mongering speculation from the right wing conspiracy site drudge report  his action may have done one of two equally disgusting things  he either amplified the terror being spread by a terror attack  thereby doing the work of the terrorist  or he spread misinformation and rumors thereby needlessly scaring people because of his eagerness to exploit a tragedy either way  people were appalled but trump wasn t done rather than wait for the facts to come in  trump immediately seized on the moment to renew his push for a muslim ban in the united states  british officials hadn t even confirmed the number of dead and wounded  and trump was busy using the tragedy to promote his own bigoted policies an ocean away  it would take him three tweets before he got around to expressing concern for the victims trump has been increasingly relying on unreliable right wing conspiracy sites to get his information  as president  he regularly receives extremely detailed information about world events from experts in the intelligence community  but his animosity towards the officials in the fbi and cia  and his general dislike of reading makes him often ignore the valuable intel  instead  he chooses to get his information from drudge  fox news  and infowars  the right wing media sites are notoriously unscrupulous  infowars  for example  endorsed the theory that the sandy hook school shooting was staged by obama as a pretext to taking people s guns  drudge routinely gets facts wrong in its rush to promote fear and intolerance in its extremely right wing audience two hours later  trump finally deleted the drudge report tweet   which puts him in an awkward position because it technically violates federal law to do so  his advisers might want to tell him that the best way to avoid that is by not spreading drudge report tweets in the first place briefed by top national security officials in the nation retweets drudge unretweets it unpresidented  pic twitter com   karen daltonbeninato   kbeninato  june    image via chip somodevilla getty images
