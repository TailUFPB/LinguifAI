a mere four days after trump got exactly what he claimed he wanted  his transition team is plagued with infighting  shake ups and general chaos  just like his campaign  chris christie was heading up the transition team  but now that job has gone to mike pence  there s also little evidence that trump himself is even working all that much he couldn t run a campaign  now he can t run his transition team  so how can anybody expect him to run a country  already  reports are coming out that he s hinting he d rather stay in his gilded castle at the top of trump tower  or down at mar a lago in florida  trump s terror at the drastic change his life is about to undergo  along with his general incompetence at  well  pretty much everything  mean he could easily become an absentee president those reports are also alleging that trump wants to spend a lot of time doing exactly what he did on the campaign trail  holding huge rallies  he needs the applause  he needs the adoration  he needs to be seen and heralded and worshiped like the god he s not  some are trying to spin this as a good thing  i think trump has discovered that these rallies are tremendous opportunities for him to get his message out   said christopher ruddy  chief executive of newsmax media  a conservative website   it s actually sort of old fashioned  that you want to actually meet people and press the flesh with him  we re sure that s the reason  what about the actual work of being president  though  that s possibly not even on his radar right now he s already an absentee president elect   the only contact he s had with his transition team has been through christie  fissures are appearing between new yorkers who worked on the campaign and think of themselves as outsiders and washington team builders who ve been quietly laying the groundwork for an actual administration the new yorkers view those people as nothing more than pencil pushers  while the washington group views the new yorkers as interlopers there s a rift emerging between corey lewandowski and reince priebus over who s going to head the rnc  lewandowski s allies also see priebus  who s up for white house chief of staff  as the very establishment insider they supposedly don t want social and fiscal conservatives from places like the heritage foundation find themselves annoyed with chris christie and his allies  whom they view as not conservative enough to even be there then there are his kids  who are playing pivotal roles in the transition and raising eyebrows about how they re going to manage a blind trust while working directly with or even leading the transition team and administration  their involvement with the transition is creating some serious problems  that s a fight you can t win   one of the people said   the christie people are from new jersey  they act like they re in charge  and jared kushner is like   you re not really in charge   trump has praised some of his closest allies from the campaign  but the transition is shaping up to look like his campaign  actually  it will be multiplied by about a billion since this team is responsible for several thousand hires and placements within the administration  and trump can t run a bare bones administration while still doing whatever he wants and trump has quietly retreated  like he always does  seemingly under the assumption that since he s the boss  he just has to stand around  look pretty  and listen to the loudly cheering crowds  and doesn t have to be around and actually do any real work featured image by zach gibson via getty images
