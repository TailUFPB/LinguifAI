republicans in maine tolerated governor paul lepage and his offensive words and actions for a long time  but now they are finally sick of him lepage has constantly characterized blacks and hispanics as drug dealers and  the enemy  but it was a voicemail message he left for democratic state rep  drew gattine that finally caused republicans to say enough is enough  i would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist  you cocksucker   lepage said   i want to talk to you  i want you to prove that i m a racist  i ve spent my life helping black people and you little son of a bitch  socialist cocksucker  you   i need you to  just friggin    i want you to record this and make it public because i am after you  thank you  clearly  lepage lost his sh t in this message and actually threatened a member of the state legislature that s a line too far  says republican state senator amy volk volk is so disgusted with lepage that she is seeking a censure  which is a formal resolution expressing severe disapproval that will be on the record  up until this point  i have refrained from publicly criticizing any of the governor s behavior both out of respect for the office and a desire to preserve a working relationship with him and his staff   volk explained   but this latest and the unwelcome attention it has brought to our state is a bridge too far  my understanding is that it would be by a vote of the legislature that it s sort of an official reprimand entered into the record so you know some sort of displeasure with the governor s behavior   she added a censure is a pretty big deal  especially when it s being called for by a member of the governor s own party frankly  lepage should have been censured and impeached a long time ago after all  his outbursts and damaging decisions have embarrassed the state so much that maine s largest newspaper actually apologized to the nation for him ever being elected to begin with  dear america  maine here   the portland press herald began  please forgive us   we made a terrible mistake  we managed to elect and re elect a governor who is unfit for high office  he has a gruff exterior and blunt way of talking that some of us find refreshing  but he has shown again and again that he governs by grudge  and uses his power to beat up on people who cannot fight back  unfortunately for maine  unless republicans grow a spine and impeach their inflammatory governor they will be stuck with him until   giving him plenty of time to humiliate himself and the state even more than he has already featured image via flickr
