there were a lot of memorable moments where donald trump looked like a moron during the presidential debate on monday  but one of the greatest was definitely when hillary clinton zinged him for being so unprepared  her exact words were   i think donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate  and yes  i did  and you know what else i prepared for  i prepared to be president  if one thing was completely apparent during that debate  it s that trump didn t invest any time in debate prep  and apparently  trump s advisers have just confirmed that  according to the new york times  several trump advisers have come forward to say they d tried to get him to prepare for the debate  but trump would get too bored and start talking about other things  the times wrote  mr  trump s debate preparation was unconventional  aides have introduced a podium and encouraged him to participate in mock debates  but he has not embraced them  focusing mostly on conversations and discussions with advisers  there were early efforts to run a more standard form of general election debate prep camp  led by roger ailes  the ousted fox news chief  at mr  trump s golf course in bedminster  n j  but mr  trump found it hard to focus during those meetings  according to multiple people briefed on the process who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations  twittertwittertwittertwittertrump had apparently been so difficult to keep on track that ailes abandoned the whole thing and instead began  discussing his own problems  as well as recounting political war stories  according to two people present for the sessions   basically   prep  became a therapy session for ailes because trump doesn t have the ability to focus on more important things  like getting ready to lead a country trump s debate performance has been disappointing for his advisers  who say they spent time giving trump responses to the attacks clinton might make during the face off  they d given him several talking points and suggestions  but trump didn t use any of it   something that his advisers say hurt him tremendously so there you have it  america  a man who wants to be president of the united states doesn t even have the attention span or interest to prepare for such a critical position  we all know how undeserving trump is of the white house  but this news should scare you  trump is a ticking time bomb that has no idea what he s doing   and he s not going to learn featured image via spencer platt   getty images
