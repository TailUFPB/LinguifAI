trump s first few days in the white house have been tumultuous  and not just because he s so upset about his inauguration numbers being less than record setting that he had his press secretary flat out lie about them  his aides have revealed that his thin skin is making things difficult  and because of that  presidential historian douglas brinkley has weighed in with something rather embarrassing for a man obsessed with numbers and image  e can never let go and stop watching cable tv  now he s off to the worst start of a presidency in a very long time   the worst  in a very long time  those are words trump won t want to hear  seeing as how he thinks he is the best and has the best of absolutely everything  an expert calling him the worst at anything just burns brinkley believes trump had a successful inauguration despite his numbers being lower than expected  and he should have built on that  however  given that he s so quick to anger when someone anyone makes him look bad to the world  he fixates on that instead of real issues and real work  and it s causing huge problems  sources within the white house revealed that his aides have to control what information he s exposed to  one person who frequently talks to trump said aides have to push back privately against his worst impulses in the white house  like the news conference idea  and have to control information that may infuriate him  he gets bored and likes to watch tv  this person said  so it is important to minimize that  really  we have someone in our nation s highest office who gets bored easily and so he watches tv to  what  look for reports about how great he is  and then tv doesn t deliver  which pisses him off  and he goes off on tangents and people get frustrated  even members of the gop are floored by his behavior  like the news conference about his inaugural audience  it s surreal  we finally have the white house  and it s this  yes  it s quite surreal that we have a narcissistic toddler in the white house the washington post s ashley parker  philip rucker and matea gold said that  when he came back from his final inaugural event on saturday  he turned on the tv  saw the women s marches  saw them protesting his presidency  and worst of all  saw that the protesting crowds appeared bigger than his own audience  so he got increasingly pissed off  and  seemingly on a whim  had spicer give that press conference that was one lie after another  and culminated in kellyanne conway s  alternate facts  bullshit and then trump was unhappy with spicer s  visuals    meaning he didn t like how spicer appeared nervous  flubbed some of his words  wore a badly fitting suit  and was apparently not forceful enough with the  lying press  besides that  there are all the power struggles plaguing trump s administration that are very reminiscent of the power struggles that plagued his campaign  some are upset with his son in law  jared kushner  trying to shove anyone he sees as a threat to his position as a close adviser aside  aides are unhappy that kellyanne conway can do what she wants  when she wants  because she s outside the official communications department  and the list goes on the word  worst  is not in trump s vocabulary when he s talking about himself  brinkley  however  knows what s what and is apparently not afraid to say it featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
