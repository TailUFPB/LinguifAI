family guy creator seth mcfarlane just couldn t resist having a bit of fun with kellyanne conway s absolutely batsh t insane claim regarding trump s unfounded allegation that president obama spied on the donald through his microwave  on monday  the legendary comedy figure tweeted his own theory about what conway meant   and to him  it sounds a lot like the sort of thing you d expect from the furniture at peewee s playhouse  those sneaky little bastards  so basically  kellyannepolls  you re saying this is how obama spied on trump  pic twitter com   seth macfarlane   sethmacfarlane  march    there was an article this week that talked about how you can surveil someone through their phones  through their certainly through their television sets  any number of different ways   conway said over the weekend as she attempted to defend trump s claim that obama tapped his  wires  at trump tower   and microwaves that turn into cameras  et cetera  so we know that that is just a fact of modern life  tech publication wired explains that it is  contrary to her assertion  impossible to use a microwave oven to spy on someone  unless  of course  it really is the worst transformer ever  first  let s take conway s assertion literally  microwaves  the waves  can be used for certain types of imaging  as in radar  but a microwave oven can t be used as a camera unless it literally has an outward facing webcam onboard  no such microwave appears to exist  that s in contrast to the case of the spying samsung tvs  referenced by conway  that each come with a built in  internet connected microphone but what if we were to take conway not literally  but seriously  asked whether a microwave could be turned into not a camera  specifically  but a listening device  stephen frasier  a microwave imaging and radar researcher at the university of massachusetts amherst  let out several seconds of sustained laughter  unless it s a voice activated microwave oven connected to the internet i can t think of a way   says frasier  outside of a failed smart microwave kickstarter  no microphone equipped microwaves appear to exist  in fact  a quick check of major appliance manufacturers including ge  lg  and samsung shows that internet connected microwaves are a rarity  even those that might exist in early adopting kitchens would be far more likely to be conscripted into a botnet than used as a listening device to date  the trump administration has not produced a shred of evidence to back trump s claim   though they did secure additional time to stall as they desperately search for something   anything   that will at least convince the most stupid among us that it happened featured image via getty images  michael tran  screengrab
