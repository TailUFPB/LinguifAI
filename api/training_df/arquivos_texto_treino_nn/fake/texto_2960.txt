you ve seen the tweets and facebook comments from conservatives who prefer the affordable care act over obamacare   which are totally the same thing  what conservatives really want is for president obama s name to not be attached to his signature legislation  trump is discussing  insurance for everyone  which sounds a lot like single payer  something we might have had except that conservatives kept yelling for the gubbermint to keep their socialist hands off their medicare  whatever  so  we ended up with a watered down version of health care late night host jimmy kimmel again used his  man on the street  segment to interview  mock  those who do not know there is no difference between obamacare and the aca  it s a straight up partisan issue with supporters of the president who preferred obamacare and trump fans who preferred the affordable care act kimmel wanted to see if people had learned anything since the time he did a similar segment three years ago  we decided to ask this question again to see if americans had learned everything over the last three years   kimmel said  and unfortunately  nothing has changed a woman the interviewer approached said she  doesn t support obama so i don t support the obama things he s got going on  so  you don t like anything obama does and you prefer the affordable care act   he asked the woman   she said   absolutely  one man said he supports the affordable care act because his girlfriend is a trump supporter another man said the difference between the two is that  one you pay and the other obama pays for you  i believe with obamacare the premiums are too high  so i believe in the affordable care act   another man who was interviewed said  so  the affordable care act is more affordable than obamacare   the interviewer asked  correct   the man said   which is obvious because it s in the name  the interviewer told one woman who admitted she doesn t like obama   what if i told you obamacare and the affordable care act are the same thing  she just stood there like a deer caught in the headlights one guy was just too stoned to grasp the question watch this is why we can t have nice things image via screen capture
