the depths of republican cruelty is on full display this week after the house passed the disastrous unread unscored bill that we will forever call trumpcare  it seems though  that even some republicans are admitting that single payer or at least some form of actual universal healthcare is ideal  but  at least according to ex congressman and deadbeat dad joe walsh  we can t have nice things because we have black people walsh  who for some unfathomable reason  is an msnbc contributor  sparred with host ali velshi  who told the ex congressman that our healthcare system ranks last among the  wealthiest nations  all the others have universal healthcare  that s when things turned ugly  you can t compare the rest of the world to us   walsh replied   they do not have the big diverse populations that we have  they do not have the inner city populations that we have  later  when velshi brought up the point again   that the united states ranks poorly in life expectancy  access to care and a variety of other measures   walsh again brought up diversity  i love you  my friend  but you cannot   sweden does not have our inner city population   he said   norway  these countries do not have   you re talking about countries the size of india with homogenous populations  ali  you can t compare them to what we have  source  talking points memovelshi  to his credit  didn t back down  he mentioned canada  which is actually more ethnically diverse than the united states and has better health care here s the video walsh  of course  has the entire issue completely backwards  yes  people of color  and in particular african americans and hispanics  do have a lower life expectancy  although that is improving  but that s not because they are black  as walsh implies  it s because they are more likely to live in poverty and they are less likely to have insurance while a plurality     of the uninsured are non hispanic whites  people of color are at higher risk of being uninsured than whites  people of color make up   of the nonelderly u s  population but account for over half of the total nonelderly uninsured population  figure    the disparity in insurance coverage is especially high for hispanics  who account for   of the nonelderly population but nearly a third     of the nonelderly uninsured population  hispanics and blacks have significantly higher uninsured rates     and     respectively  than whites      source  kff orginstead of addressing poverty and lack of healthcare availability  republicans like walsh would rather use this totally fixable disparity to deepen the racial divide in this country and to foster hate  as for walsh  he might as well wear that hood you know he owns in public  he s not even pretending anymore featured image via alex wong getty images
