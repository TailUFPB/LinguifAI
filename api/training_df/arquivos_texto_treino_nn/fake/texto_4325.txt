florida s republican governor rick scott is not allowing the impending pressure of hurricane matthew to interrupt his partisan push on behalf of donald trump in his state  the storm is expected to disrupt day to day operations in the state at multiple levels  with multiple state and county agencies  as well as hundreds of private businesses  shutting down to ride out the weather event the storm is sure to affect the impending deadline for voter registration on october   but when democrats asked governor scott to extend the deadline as the population digs out from the storm  he decided to refuse republican florida governor rick scott on thursday evening said the state will not extend an october  voter registration deadline  i m not going to extend it   scott said at a news conference on the storm   everybody has had plenty of time to register  i don t intend to make any changes  scott is not a disinterested third party by any stretch  in addition to being a fellow republican  scott currently serves as the national chairman of a super pac helping the trump campaign  rebuilding america now the governor s behavior is part of a long standing election year pattern amongst many republican officials  where they do whatever is in their power   often as secretary of state or governor   to ensure that as few democrats as possible are eligibile to vote  in the south  particularly  a lot of these actions are targeted at counties with large black populations the government of north carolina was recently rebuked for designing a voter id system that was designed from the ground up to exclude voters from areas with black populations that were more likely to vote democratic hurricane matthew is expected to hit somewhere along the northern part of palm beach county and above  along florida s east coast  that is an area of the state that leans more democratic  and as such the storm path would impact that demographic and it becomes very clear why the governor made the decision he has featured image via flickr
