donald trump has again made a huge mistake while referring to life experienced by many black americans every day  the screw up in question came as trump seriously argued that the lives of blacks today are worse than they were during slavery and in the jim crow segregation era speaking at a rally in kenansville  north carolina  trump again stumbled in an apparent attempt to endear himself to black voters  we re going to make our country safe again  we re going to rebuild our inner cities because our african american communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they ve ever been in before   he said   ever  ever  ever  the comment  made in a city named for a slave owner  is objectively untrue  and completely ignores that black people were once subjected to slavery and jim crow laws while the media has largely viewed trump s weird racial comments as a sign that he is  reaching out  to black voters  polls have actually shown that he is poised to do worse with that group than mitt romney or john mccain black voters have had an inherent distrust of trump  which has been amplified thanks to his promotion of the racist  birther  conspiracy there for years trump also called for the death penalty for the central park   long after it had been proven that the young black men involved with the case had been proven innocent lately  trump has argued that the black community in america is a desperate  infantile mess  relying on government welfare in order to simply get by  the image trump has been spreading has not been for black audiences  but instead have been targeted to a conservative base  high on the idea that ethnic minorities always have their hands out black voters have found trump s description of them insulting  particularly coming as the community has made huge strides forward featured image via screen capture
