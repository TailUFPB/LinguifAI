according to a new report  former british spy christopher steele has finally opened up to the fbi about the sources of what he calls his prurient  dossier  on donald trump and his ties to the kremlin  sources that were only identified by letters throughout the document the  page document was authored by steele  an ex  agent  and first published on buzzfeed in january  but although the report is unsubstantiated  it alleged that the russian government had material that they could use to blackmail trump  allowing the kremlin to impede in the  united states presidential election steele initially went into hiding after publishing his dossier  but investigators looking into russia s election meddling have been trying to reach out to him since the document went public  with the washington post reporting earlier this year that the fbi was even planning on paying him for more information on trump s potential ties with russia  this apparently occurred when an intermediary brought steele s findings to the fbi following the release of hacked democratic national committee emails  a move later found to be part of russia s effort to sway the election and a notion the president has repeatedly slammed as  fake news  now it has come to light that steele has told investigators about the identities of his sources  however  it is still unknown what  if any  other information he gave  this reported meeting between steele and the agency could be a potential deal breaker for the commander in chief  as it comes at a time when the fbi  the house  the senate  and special counsel robert mueller are all simultaneously investigating russia s role in last year s election furthermore  aleksej gubarev  a russian businessman named in the document  has filed a defamation suit in florida  however  steele is currently fighting a federal court request for him to testify  claiming his thoughts on the matter are for his ears only featured image via leon neal getty images
