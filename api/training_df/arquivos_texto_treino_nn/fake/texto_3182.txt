house republicans just made it clear that they are for sale and intend to put ethics aside during donald trump s reign in the white house on monday night  republicans voted   to cripple the independent office of congressional ethics  which has been an outside watchdog working to root out corruption by members of congress ever since a string of lobbying scandals rocked capitol hill  under speaker nancy pelosi s leadership  the panel was created as a non partisan entity and has done a good job but republicans are gutting it because the panel has done its job too well so they passed an amendment which basically gives them direct oversight of the panel and the power to kill investigations they don t like  so if the panel is investigating a republicans  they can kill it and then turn around and allow an investigation against a democrat according to cnn the proposal would bar the panel from reviewing any violation of criminal law by members of congress  requiring that it turn over any complaint to the house ethics committee or refer the matter to an appropriate federal law enforcement agency  the house ethics committee would also have the power to stop an investigation at any point and bars the ethics office from making any public statements about any matters or hiring any communications staff and the ethics office would no longer be able to accept or investigate any anonymous reports of alleged wrongdoing by members of congress republicans claim that the ethics panel abused its power and that it  falsely accused  members of congress of committing ethics violations  these members allegedly had to  spend a fortune  to defend themselves  frankly  it sounds like republicans are just mad because they got caught putting their hand in the cookie jar and they are attacking the panel to make sure they can t be caught again by gutting the independent panel and placing it under their supervision  republicans just paved the way for their members to commit crimes at will  they could a take a bribe from a lobbyist and then vote to kill any investigation that arises  it will create a free for all for lobbyists at a time when republicans intend to consider infrastructure spending  tax cuts  and massive defense spending this especially concerns norman eisen and richard painter  who served as ethics attorneys under president obama and president bush  because the  congress  is setting itself up to be dogged by scandals and ethics issues for years and is returning the house to dark days when ethics violations were rampant and far too often tolerated  so not only will the white house be corrupt under donald trump  republicans just guaranteed that the house of representatives is going to be corrupt as well  proving once again that republicans only care about using government to enrich themselves instead of helping the american people featured image via zach gibson getty images
