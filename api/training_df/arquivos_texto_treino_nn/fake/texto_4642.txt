sunday night  an abc news affiliate in new york began their show with a startling breaking news announcement from weekend anchor joe torres  hillary clinton was dead  we begin with the breaking news about hillary clinton s death they were talking about her health  and dove right on into her leaving a   memorial on sunday after feeling light headed  then her campaign released the news that she was battling pneumonia  and then this happened  that has since been edited out  but remains up on youtube for now  watch the original report below wabc  clarified the mistake later on  they told tvspy that torres had misspoken and meant to say  health   which anyone with more than two brain cells  who watched the whole report  would have figured out  during a live introduction to a story about the health of hillary clinton  joe torres inadvertently said  death  when he meant to say  health    a station spokesperson said   it was clear from the context of the story  the reporters  information and graphics on the screen that secretary clinton was alive and recovering   both the original story and the edit have tripped the conspiracy loons  sensors anyway  though  because why let reason get in the way of a good hillary conspiracy  so now they re going nuts  some are convinced that abc edited that out to cover up the fact that she did actually die  and that the campaign is using a body double to cover it up  a video clip of wabc tv channel   eyewitness news  in new york city opened last night with anchorman joe torre saying  more on hillary clinton s death   the opening line  however  seems edited out of the video archive did hillary die after leaving the   ceremony in new york       and the information is being concealed  a whole slew of irregularities have cropped up indicating that may actually be the case body double a short time later  a person alleged to be hillary  is seen leaving the east  street home of chelsea clinton  but there are problems with this person   the conspiracy baloney never ends with this crowd  does it  here s another that s just certain she really died  now it looks like the story has gotten even worse  based on rogue reports  it is now our understanding that hillary rodham clinton may in fact be dead yes  you read that correct  after airing on abc news in new york for merely seconds  it was pulled from the air this isn t a random report  don t believe it  we didn t believe it at first either  until we saw an additional report of the same exact occurrence  at this point  we don t have all the news all we know for sure is that hillary clinton may have actually died at a local hospital in new york city  it doesn t help that david shuster tweeted that dnc operatives were informing him that the committee would hold an emergency meeting to discuss hillary s replacement  that tweet was later deleted and replaced with one saying that they were considering a meeting to discuss replacing her furthermore  all the heretofore unknown doctors across the internet who are coming out of the woodwork to loudly proclaim that her pneumonia means she s at death s door don t seem to know some basic facts    pneumonia is fluid in the lungs  and    there are eleventy billion things that can cause it  some are serious  some are very serious  some are not so serious donna brazile  the interim dnc chair  said that they re looking forward to hillary s speedy recovery and return to the campaign trail  essentially destroying shuster s tweets and the stories of those who piled on to that  it also destroys the absurd notion that she actually died  but hey  conspiracy nuts will think what they want  despite what the hillary haters are hoping  she is alive and well and recovering  she s not at death s door  and she s certainly not dead featured image via screen capture from embedded video
