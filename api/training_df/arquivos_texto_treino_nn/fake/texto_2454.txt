trump likes trying to bully mexico  even claiming that he will force them to pay for his stupid wall by making the  rapists  and  drug dealers  down there pay a  percent tax on goods exported to the united states  mexico has been very clear that there is no interest in engaging in donald trump s ridiculous plan   but the government recently sent trump a very clear message about what he  and america  has to lose if he persists with this madness  the globe and mail reports that a mexican cabinet minister has revealed mexico s plan to stop the donald  if you tax that    at  percent of imports   which is by the way a practice that  other countries do   right now our country s policy is to tax exports and let imports flow freely in  which is ridiculous  by doing it that way we can do   a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone  that s really going to provide the funding   trump s mouthpiece sean spicer said in january while explaining how the wall would be funded  there is so much at stake for the interest of the u s  as a country   mexico s economy minister ildefonso guajardo said in an interview  adding that the country could stop cooperating on security and intelligence  migration control  and drug enforcement  we have been a great ally to fight problems with migration  narcotics   if at some point in time things become so badly managed in the relationship  the incentives for the mexican people to keep on co operating in things that are at the heart of  national security issues will be diminished you cannot ask me to  conditions in terms of trade and then request my help to manage migration issues from other nations or   the prosecution of criminal activities and narcotics  right now there are many more mexicans coming back than there are leaving and the great challenge is the flows of every other nationality coming through mexico   guajardo says  noting that mexico detained   central americans in the last two years alone and would likely be very willing to stop helping in that regard if a certain orange someone gave them a reason  the globe notes that the program  has been criticized by mexican human rights organizations because it has little or no security benefit for mexico  and contravenes obligations mexico has as a signatory to international convention on the rights of migrants and refugees  simply put  guajardo seems to be perfectly happy to  allow the migrants to proceed north on the train and bus routes they used to take unhindered to the northern border   in addiction  mexico could stop allowing our agents to screen migrants  which would damage our national security  so there are many things at stake that cannot be undervalued or undermined   mr  guajardo said  and that s why my president  with the principles that he gave us for these bilateral dealings  he was very clear in saying that this negotiation has to be figured out with all items considered   he adds that trump s rhetoric  can have a damaging consequence  and  it will be very foolish to continue  featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla  screengrab
