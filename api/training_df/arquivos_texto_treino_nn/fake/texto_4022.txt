libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson isn t doing too well in the polls  and a recently released interview is not going to help him  apparently  johnson is beginning to feel the pressure and he s taking it out on the press by giving unpredictable interviews   unless he s just trying to take a page out of donald trump s book by acting erratic when johnson was interviewed by the guardian s paul lewis  there were several tense  uncomfortable moments   such as when he yelled at lewis for mentioning his dwindling poll numbers or questioning his tax policy the interview begins on an awfully uneasy note when johnson flat out admits to lewis that he s stupid while sporting a very creepy smile   and it s clear that lewis doesn t understand if johnson s being serious or not  the interview is confusing from the start  as johnson doesn t seem focused or able to control his mood the worst part was toward the end of the interview when lewis corrected johnson that his support in the polls was now only    not the   that johnson claimed  johnson responded by blowing up and yelling  why are you even interviewing me  i don t get it  if i m doing so poorly  is this to preside over a funeral here  it s not a funeral  it s a celebration  another horrible moment came when lewis asked johnson to explain his tax plan  lewis brought up the fact that most economists disagree with johnson s approach to nix federal income tax and enforce nationwide consumption tax   which made johnson unravel right in front of the camera  johnson admitted that congress wouldn t approve of his tax plan  and then fired back with a weird detour about legalized marijuana  look  i don t want to argue  i don t want to argue  really  look  i came out for the legalization of marijuana  let me just use that as an example  and i will tell you  i had people in my face for years and years and years talking about how stupid and idiotic it was that we should allow marijuana to be legal  lewis was understandably shocked  and he had to ask johnson why he d bring up marijuana when they d been talking about taxes  johnson yelled   it s leadership  as we ve seen with the aleppo situation  johnson just doesn t do very well with interviews   and this video should be a clear sign that voting for johnson won t get america very far  especially when that vote could have been used against republican nominee donald trump  you can watch this bizarre exchange below featured image is a screenshot
