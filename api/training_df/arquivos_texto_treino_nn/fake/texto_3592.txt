before donald trump pulled off winning the presidency  which no one saw coming   there were reports that the billionaire mogul was preparing to potentially launch a tv news network that would be even more outrageous than fox news   hence why he ran for president  he needed to build an audience but now he s going to be president of the united states  so that won t be happening however  there is one person who may be eyeing a career in media   president obama according to multiple sources that spoke to mic  president obama is looking into launching a digital media company  and that media will be the  focus  of the next chapter of his life mic is also reporting   albeit another anonymous source   that president obama and facebook founder mark zuckerberg talked about the post presidency prospects at a meeting in lima  peru during the apec summit white house communications director told mic that the president  as of now  has no plans to get into the media industry while the president will remain actively engaged in inspiring young people and he is interested in the changing ways people consume information  he has no plans to get into the media business after he leaves office when rolling stone had asked president obama what his post presidential plans would entail  he gave the american people the first clue that could actually tie into a media launch against right wing b s  how do we rethink our storytelling  the messaging and the use of technology and digital media  so that we can make a persuasive case across the country there s an easy answer to that question  obama tv  or the obama news network now that the world is creeping up on a trump presidency  who better to reach out and offer sanity to the public than president obama  who has pledged he will not keep quiet on the sidelines having bill o reilly and the other right wing blowhards like tomi lahren compete against president obama and his people for ratings would be a marvelous sight to behold with millennials constantly being turned off by the political process  and always on social media   a network launch from one of greatest presidents this country has ever seen may not be such a bad idea  perhaps jon stewart and stephen colbert could come onboard with democrats taking over the conversation from the noise at fox news  the possibilities are endless featured image via sean gallup getty images
