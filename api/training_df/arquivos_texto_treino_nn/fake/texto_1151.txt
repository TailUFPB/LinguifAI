attorney general jeff sessions appeared before the senate intelligence committee on tuesday afternoon and not surprisingly  there were a lot of things he really didn t want to talk about  when he refused to answer the questions of sen  martin heinrich  the democrat from new mexico went the f ck off sessions repeatedly said that he couldn t talk about this or that because it would be  inappropriate  to reveal his private conversations with donald trump  but heinrich was not satisfied with any of this nonsense  attorney general sessions  has the president ever expressed his frustration to you regarding your decision to recuse yourself   heinrich asked sessions began to say that he was  not able to share  this information with the committee when heinrich cut him off  you re invoking executive privilege   the senator asked  i m not able to invoke executive privilege  that s the president s prerogative   sessions replied at this point  heinrich unleashed his wrath my understanding is that you took an oath  you raised your right hand here today and you said that you would solemnly tell the truth  the whole truth and nothing but the truth  and now you re not answering questions you re impeding this investigation  so my understanding of the legal standard is that you either answer the question  that s the best outcome you say this is classified  can t answer it here  i ll answer it in closed session  that s bucket number two  bucket number three is to say i m invoking executive privilege  there is no appropriateness bucket  it is not a legal standard  can you tell me why what are these long standing doj rules that protect conversations made in the executive without invoking executive privilege sessions insisted that he was just  protecting the president s constitutional right by not giving it away before he has a chance to review it   but heinrich told him that  he couldn t have it both ways  the attorney general continued to argue that his silence was consistent with the policies of the department of justice  but when heinrich asked to see those policies  sessions ended up saying that it was his  judgment that it would be inappropriate  to share this information  there are also other privileges that could be invoked  one of the things deals with the investigation of the special counsel as other   sessions began to say when heinrich interrupted him again to remind him that there are multiple investigations going on we re not asking questions about that investigation  if i wanted to ask questions about that investigation  i d ask those of rod rosenstein  i m asking about your personal knowledge from this committee which has a constitutional obligation to get to the bottom of this there are two investigations here  there is a special counsel investigation  there is also a congressional investigation  and you are obstructing that congressional delegation   investigation by not answering these questions  and i think your silence  like the silence of director coats  like the silence of admiral rogers speaks volumes sessions never did provide a satisfactory to heinrich s question  but heinrich just became one of my favorite senators today  you can watch sen  heinrich wipe the floor with jeff sessions below featured image via video screen capture
