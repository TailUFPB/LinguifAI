a conservative organization whose sole purpose is to spend money helping promote trump s talking points just wasted    in a single day the pac  america first policies  recently announced that they would be publicly attacking republican senator dean heller after he announced he would not be supporting the gop s bill to strip healthcare away from tens of millions of people  including many of his constituents   the senate bill carries a slightly different name than the house version   better care reconciliation act   it s almost identical only slightly  meaner  than the original   he s one of only a few republican senators to stand up to the bill  and it made him the target of trump s ire in response  america first policies paid twitter to put their hashtag   hellervoteyes  onto the social media platform s  trending  section  presumably they figured the exposure would increase pressure on heller to change his vote and fall in line with the other gop senators  it backfired spectacularly first  almost immediately the   hellervoteyes  hashtag was taken over by people hopping in to call out the gop for supporting the atrocious healthcare bill  many users demanded republicans work to help obamacare survive rather than strip away healthcare from people  conservatives who support the republican healthcare bill were either too ashamed to jump in or were nonexistent to begin with shortly after the trending hashtag was derailed  a new hashtag went viral   hellervoteno  supported by celebrities and average americans alike  the new hashtag has become a rallying cry to encourage all republicans  not just heller  to drop their support of the bill  as of this writing it is receiving at least twice the number of tweets as the original one and is placed directly below the promoted version making matters worse  on mobile devices  the  hellervoteyes hashtag was directly below a trending story about a small boy with a major heart defect who will lose his health insurance if republicans pass their legislation   you can find that heartbreaking story here  america first policies spent a massive amount of money on this campaign  according to digital marketing blog penna powers  the cost to trend a hashtag for a single day comes with a    price tag  as of this writing  it s unclear if america first policies had purchased a single  hours or if they plan on wasting more money in the days to come  according to a recent politico article featuring america first policies  the pac is estimated to have around a million dollars in cash the barrage  which will be orchestrated by america first policies  a group run by many of president donald trump s top campaign advisers  is backed by more than a million dollars  according to multiple sources familiar with the planning  digital ads are set to begin running on friday  and television and radio spots are set to launch early next week  so they just blew a fifth of their entire budget on this scheme which blew up in their faces nice work  team trump  keep it coming featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
