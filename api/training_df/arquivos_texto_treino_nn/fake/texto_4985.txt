donald trump has made it a point of his campaign to never apologize for anything  but he poorly tried to do exactly that on thursday and hillary clinton nailed him for it  sometimes  in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues  you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing   trump told an audience in north carolina   i have done that  and i regret it  particularly where it may have caused personal pain  too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues  but then he turned around and wiped that apology away by claiming that he will never lie to his supporters and that he will will always put their interests first  in this journey  i will never lie to you  i will never tell you something i do not believe myself  i will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours  but hillary clinton did not let the republican nominee get away with making a false apology her campaign issued a statement in response and it s absolutely perfect  donald trump literally started his campaign by insulting people   the statement reads  he has continued to do so through each of the  days from then until now  without shame or regret  we learned tonight that his speechwriter and teleprompter knows he has much for which he should apologize  but that apology tonight is simply a well written phrase until he tells us which of his many offensive  bullying and divisive comments he regrets and changes his tune altogether  the statement then goes on give a list of examples of all the groups trump has insulted complete with citations  then it lists trump  past record of regret  on attacking the khans  a gold star family  i don t regret anything  on assailing the ethics and motives of judge curiel asked if he regretted making his criticism of the judge personal trump said his side had been treated very unfairly on calling immigrants rapists  no  i don t apologize  on mocking a reporter with a disability trump denied he had mocked the reporter and demanded his own apology this is a fake apology by trump  he s had more than a year s worth of opportunities to sincerely apologize for the horrible things he has said but he has only doubled down  he cannot possibly expect that this one sorry excuse for an apology will cover all of the harmful words he has vomited over the last year and two months since his campaign began  nor should he expect it to be blindly accepted it is said that it is  better late than never  but in this case it is too late  this slate cannot be wiped clean  trump owes a personal apology to all the people he has demeaned  threatened  and mocked the republican party needs to be held accountable for making trump their leader and trump needs to face actual consequences for all the bullshit he has spewed  that punishment and accountability can only come in one way  americans need to vote on election day in november and send a clear message to trump and the gop  and that means a landslide victory for democrats featured image via getty images
