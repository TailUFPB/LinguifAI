donald trump may be realizing that there s something to the sage advice of not working with family  on tuesday  trump joked that his son in law jared kushner is becoming more famous than him  for kushner  who is becoming an albatross around the neck of the administration  that  joke  could be the kiss of political death trump has made a similar joke before  then it was directed toward fbi director james comey  months later  comey was gone  jared has actually become much more famous than me   i m a little upset at that   trump said  prompting the room to erupt in laughter house majority whip steve scalise  r la   turned to kushner and said   that s a badge of honor   kushner smiled but did not respond  according to a reporter in the room source  the hillthe joke came after kushner made the cover of time magazine  it doesn t matter that the portrayal wasn t completely flattering or that kushner s implications in the russian election scandal are front and center in the article  what matters to trump is that kushner  who s perhaps best known as a man of few words  is beginning to eclipse trump in the media  except that he s not  most news stories are still about trump and not kushner trump doesn t see that  though  when a member of his administration  any member of his administration  becomes a focus of the media  that means at least a little attention is being taken off of him  trump can t deal with that two days after his inauguration  trump joked that james comey had  become more famous than me   then as now  trump still dominated most headlines  but for trump  it wasn t enough  comey was soon gone trump s white house advisors are a hodgepodge of people whose only qualifications are their ability to boost trump s ego  once they ve outlived that purpose  they ve outlived their usefulness to trump  even if they are family featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
