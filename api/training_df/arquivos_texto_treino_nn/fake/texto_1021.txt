a fayetteville woman has just learned that under north carolina law a person can t be charged with rape even if the other person revokes consent during sex thanks to a decades old law in a fayetteville observer article published this week   year old aaliyah palmer says she was the victim of a sex crime in january  a man pulled her into the bathroom for sex  for which she was willing  when the sex turned violent  she told the man to stop  he didn t listen local abc  shares that back in   the north carolina supreme court ruled a person can t be charged with rape if the partner initially consented to sex  but revoke consent after sexual intercourse begins  in state vs  way  the court determined  if the actual penetration is accomplished with the woman s consent  the accused is not guilty of rape  although he may be guilty of another crime because of his subsequent actions  it s really stupid   palmer said of the law   if i tell you no and you kept going  that s rape  it s not just stupid   it s totally backward sonya desai  client services coordinator with the guilford county family justice center says it best   as far as no means no  it is an absolute  we believe it to be an absolute  so when someone says no to sex that means no  while you might be nodding your head at this simple concept  there are people that just can t wrap their heads around such a concept  how people can t wrap their heads around this is beyond me to help  a bill in the north carolina senate s rules committee would change that old  ridiculous law  under senate bill   sponsored by sen  jeff jackson  d mecklenburg   anyone who failed to stop intercourse when a woman who had originally consented changed her mind  would be charged  this would give power back to women to say no at whatever point she is at and justice to prevail when the savage doesn t listen at the moment  however  this proposed bill is currently stalled  the bill is stopped in the committee and jackson added it will likely be dead for the rest of the legislative session  i wonder why that is  congressmen probably don t find this bill important and or probably don t care to change a law for the greater good despite this standstill  jackson wants the law changed jackson says several women have consulted with him about having experiences similar to palmer s  legislators are hearing more and more about women who have been raped and are being denied justice because of this crazy loophole   jackson said   north carolina is the only state in u s  where no doesn t mean no  hopefully  we will make progress  it s just a shame that it s going to be a very slow process to get there featured image via carol m  highsmith buyenlarge getty images
