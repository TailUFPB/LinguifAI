people have long speculated about donald trump s mental state  while it was once seen as unseemly to suggest that a public figure may be crazy  trump s alarming behavior warrants an exception   especially since he has the nuclear codes  well  it s not our imagination   and that s not just because we can see with every wild statement and unhinged twitter rant that something is wrong with trump  it s because  according to former republican congressman and current host of msnbc s morning joe reported on thursday that several of trump s allies confided to him that trump has dementia then  scarborough went all in  and called for the use of the  amendment to remove trump  and in doing so  decided to list many of trump s infamous incidences of con artistry in the process  if this is not what the  amendment was drafted for  i would like the cabinet members serving america   not the president   you serve america  and you know it  you know you don t serve donald j  trump  scam developer  scam trump university proprietor  reality tv show host  you don t represent him  you represent  million people whose lives are literally in your hands  and we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power  you have somebody inside the white house that the new york daily news says is mentally unfit  that people close to him say is mentally unfit  that people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia  this is astounding  joe scarborough is no liberal  i disagree with a lot of what he says  but he s definitely putting his country before his party  and doing the right thing  it s time for republicans to stop being cowards and remove trump featured image via win mcnamee getty images
