it seems the trump administration will stop at nothing to codify the religious right s insanely narrow beliefs into law  after backing off an earlier executive order that would have legalized all manner of discrimination against lgbtq individuals  it appears there s a draft of a new order out that s far broader  and far scarier a copy of the draft order was obtained by the nation and other outlets  and would do the following  the draft order seeks to create wholesale exemptions for people and organizations who claim religious or moral objections to same sex marriage  premarital sex  abortion  and trans identity  and it seeks to curtail women s access to contraception and abortion through the affordable care act  the order refrains from specifically mentioning christianity  and the administration no doubt thinks that makes it constitutional  under this order   religious exercise  applies to  any act or refusal to act that is motivated by a sincerely held religious belief  whether or not the act is required by  or central to  a system of religious belief  as such  it would prohibit the government from denying tax exempt status  or financially punishing  religious organizations that are involved in politics that  in turn  makes it clear that it would reward people who discriminate against lgbtq individuals  oppress and control women  and even reward people who seek to stop things like comprehensive sex ed because it supposedly encourages pre marital sex  and more  just because of their religious beliefs it could even open the floodgates for so called  gay conversion therapy   despite its dangers  and despite its being condemned by every medical and psychological organization out there but wait  that s not all  this order requires the secretary of health and human services to exempt anyone who objects even to preventive medical care on religious grounds  it does not specify what types of preventive care  but it s not hard to see that they re targeting women s healthcare here  including hormonal birth control  as well as vaccines the preventive care mandate within the aca actually has a separate section for women s care  including screening for stds  breast cancer  utis  hpv and cervical cancer  as well as well woman visits  which covers pap smears and other routine exams  the mandate also requires health insurers to cover vaccines for children from birth to age   as well as cervical dysplasia screenings for sexually active adolescent girls  and hiv screenings for sexually active adolescents should the preventive care mandate go away  the ones who will be hurt the worst will be women and girls  and that s intentional since the religious right is all about controlling women and their behavior according to the nation s story  a professor at georgetown university s law center  and expert on church state separation and religious freedom  says  this executive order would appear to require agencies to provide extensive exemptions from a staggering number of federal laws without regard to whether such laws substantially burden religious exercise  moreover  the exemptions would raise serious first amendment questions  as well  because they would go far beyond what the supreme court has identified as the limits of permissive religious accommodations  he would be extremely surprised if the office of legal counsel were to certify this order in part because it greatly expands the definition of  religious exercise  to mean anything for anyone  it seems perhaps worst of all is that it would cover federal employees  which could lead to discrimination including denying people care at the va or denying them social security benefits  simply because they have a stated  sincerely held  belief against enabling whatever if this order is signed  lgbtq individuals will be subject to hideous discrimination  women will lose access to preventive care and birth control  and without court intervention  it will likely lead to making christianity the law of the land  trump and his administration are way out of control with unconstitutional executive orders featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
