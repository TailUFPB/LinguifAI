elizabeth warren went on the attack against donald trump again on sunday and you can bet that the republican nominee is fuming about it during a rally in colorado  the massachusetts senator called out the alleged billionaire for bragging about sexual assault  being a failed businessman  and for being too scared to release his tax returns  in this election  i am proud to be a democrat   warren began   i am proud that we are a party that doesn t debate who has the smallest hands  warren talked about the years between  and  when the economy worked for all americans before ronald reagan became president and helped republicans push through an agenda that reversed that prosperity and gave it to the wealthy then she turned her ire back on to trump  calling him a  small insecure moneygrubber  who only cares about himself because when the housing crash happened he rooted for it because he wanted to  swoop in  like a vulture and buy the properties on the cheap warren then took aim at trump for stiffing the people he made contracts with to build his resorts  people like plumbers and painters who didn t get paid because trump is  a pathetic cheapskate  who screws over the little guy when it suits him then she brought up trump s refusal to release his tax returns  which could confirm that he paid no federal income taxes for  years   the big brave donald trump is too chicken to release his tax returns   she said before clucking like a chicken daring trump to not be a coward but she saved most of her anger for the way trump has treated women and how he has bragged about sexually assaulting women  some people say it makes them sick to hear donald trump talk like that   warren told the crowd   well not me  donald trump s words don t make me sick anymore  they make me furious  here s the full speech via youtube donald trump has never been able to pick a fight with elizabeth warren and win so it would be inadvisable for him to attack her on social media again  but because trump is so thin skinned  we should be expecting a temper tantrum any time featured image via screencap
