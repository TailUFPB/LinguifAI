donald trump has the maturity of a toddler  and he certainly put it on full display early wednesday morning completely ruining the tone he was trying to set after traveling to texas with first lady melania to visit the devastation the area was left in after hurricane harvey  trump decided to go back to his childish antics and reignite his ongoing feud with the media  attacking  dying magazines   trump said  after reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines  it makes me wonder  why  all i want to do is  maga  of course  let s for a second just ignore the fact that trump loves painting himself as a victim  or the fact that several mainstream media networks are actually soaring and doing better than ever thanks to their anti trump reporting and coverage  it was the last line of trump s ridiculous  whiny tweet where he stated  all i want to do is  maga  that gained the most attention   and the reactions were pretty damn hilarious  here are just some of the best responses    apparently  twitter users had a field day  as they often do whenever trump displays how undeserving he is to be the leader of the free world  trump never fails to humiliate america with his blatantly unprofessional behavior  and his twitter account alone is a major source of anxiety and embarrassment for americans throughout the country  as long as trump has access to social media  he could humiliate or endanger the country at any moment and unfortunately  this behavior has become so common that we just expect this insanity from trump on a daily basis now trump has done nothing to  maga  and shows no real genuine interest in improving the country beyond his own personal gain and that of his rich privileged friends featured image via alex wong getty images
