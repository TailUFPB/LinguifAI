there were many notable moments from last night s presidential debate thanks to republican nominee donald trump  who made it a debate to remember  not necessarily a good thing  in his case   not only did trump imply that he would not accept the election s results if he was defeated by hillary clinton  but he once again proved that he has zero respect for women when he insulted her on the debate stage ironically  this attack came after trump insisted that  no one has more respect for women than i do   clinton had been talking about social security and medicare  and trump jumped in to interrupt so he could call her  such a nasty woman   it was a completely random attack  and the perfect display of trump s lack of self control and misogyny in action as soon as it happened  social media exploded with rage as americans rushed to criticize trump s blatant disrespect of not only the former secretary of state  but women everywhere  it wasn t long before the hashtag  nastywoman was being used far and wide  slamming the business mogul for his sexist outburst  one response  however  has trump particularly p ssed off  rep  jim himes  d conn   said it best when he tweeted  women who disagree with you aren t  nasty   in this case  they are what is known as  right   twitterhell yes  and we all know how much fragile donald hates being proven wrong  more politicians jumped into the conversation on trump s dangerous attitude toward women while watching the debate  sen  barbara boxer  d calif   also came forward to point out how dishonest trump s remarks about respecting women were  her attack was flawless twitterif you look at any interview  footage  etc  of trump talking about women before or during his presidential campaign  it is extremely rare that you ll find him saying something nice about them   much less respecting them  trump has a horrifying long history of degrading  objectifying  insulting and belittling women  as well as a track record of sexually assaulting them  this man is dangerous for women and he is dangerous for america   everything he says and does proves that he cannot and should not be our next president featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
