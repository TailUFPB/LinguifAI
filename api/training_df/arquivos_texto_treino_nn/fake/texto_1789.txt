if there s one thing donald trump has an extremely hard time accepting  it s evidence and facts  it doesn t matter how much proven  scientifically backed data you put in front of the undeserving potus   his first impulse is to whine about how biased and dishonest the information is  even when it comes to something as serious and common sense as climate change on friday  cnn s jake tapper tore trump a new one by making fun of his denial of what is happening to our environment  in a segment on australia s great barrier reef  tapper mocked trump for previously calling global warming a hoax invented by the chinese  as tapper spoke about coral bleaching and the effects that the rising temperatures have had on the great barrier reef  tapper stated that coral bleaching was  proof that climate change  at least partially man made  is destroying the planet   noting that  once colorful coral reefs off the coast of australia are now being bleached white  then tapper made sure that no one forgot that the current president of the united states is an absolute moron  perfectly explaining why trump s climate change denial is devastating  tapper said  this news comes at a time at a time president trump has proposed cutting billions of dollars from programs to study and help combat the effects of climate change which in the past he s called a  chinese hoax   it is  of course  not a chinese hoax  it s seriously depressing to know that the man in the white house has called climate change a hoax  at a time when we cannot trust our president to make decent decisions on behalf of our country  let alone the planet   we re lucky to have reporters like tapper reminding us that denying facts has serious consequences  you can watch tapper take trump to the woodshed below featured image is a screenshot
