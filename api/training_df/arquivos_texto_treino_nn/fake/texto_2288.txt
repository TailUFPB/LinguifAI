is there some specific reason we have someone in the white house who s willing to let the military do what it wants in terms of strikes  on friday  it was discovered that trump literally granted our military commanders permission to order attacks in countries that don t have much of an american military presence very shortly after he took over the white house  this means that they can carry out strikes without first having to get approval from the white house  which supposedly has military strategists who know what s going on the first units to carry out attacks without approval from the white house were  of course  in yemen  yemen is where we botched a raid that yielded absolutely nothing and resulted in the death of a navy seal  while that raid didn t fall under this new authority  subsequent operations could result in similar disasters  the new authority  according to the hill  is intended to accelerate the fight against al qaeda in the arabian peninsula  a k a  aqap  navy captain jeff davis says he doesn t want to telegraph future operations in explaining how this works  but  in short   this is part of a plan to go after a very real threat  to ensure they are defeated and denied the opportunity to plot and carry out terrorist attacks from ungoverned spaces  like yemen  is trump allowing them to just do what they want or do they still have to have solid intelligence before they strike  the reason the yemen raid was such a disaster is because the white house didn t have solid intelligence and they didn t have a solid plan  while it sounds good to turn that authority over to military commanders in the regions we supposedly want to control  the question is  do they have the knowledge they need to succeed in any attacks they decide to carry out the kicker here is that trump has given this overarching authority to military commanders in areas where we don t have much of a presence  and therefore  probably don t have much in the way of the intelligence we need to make successful strikes  that means we have to be more careful  trump doesn t want to be careful  he wants to abdicate a responsibility so he can what play golf and not think about it it s not that our military commanders are incompetent  far from it  the problem is letting them act on  well  pretty much anything  despite limited information  it could get us in a ton of trouble with the rest of the world featured image by olivier douliery via getty images
