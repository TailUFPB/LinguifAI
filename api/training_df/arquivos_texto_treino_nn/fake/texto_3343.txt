despite all efforts to stop this from happening  donald trump  cruised to victory  today in the electoral college  according to the associated press  now  unless something really bizarre happens when congress certifies the vote  trump is officially the  president of the united states iowa s electors cast all six of their votes for trump  montana cast all three of theirs for trump  michigan cast its  for trump and florida its   and missouri and arizona put him up to  when their votes came in it was apparently texas that put trump over the  vote threshold  texas said earlier today that they might replace three electors who supposedly were ineligible to hold federal jobs  and there was a fourth who resigned  election officials would have made sure that any replacements made would be solidly in trump s camp  and that s exactly what happened other than that  though  there was little sign of defection from republicans  even though there were people who insisted that as many as  would  go rogue  and vote for someone else now that he s solidified his win  what s going to happen  well  for one thing  we can probably expect him to continue using his position to make himself richer  the trump organization has been pressuring foreign diplomats to hold their events at his hotel in d c  trump also canceled a press conference slated for dec    in which he was supposed to tell us how he was going to divest himself of his businesses there s a chance he ll be impeached fairly quickly after assuming office because of that  depending on whether there s a case over the emoluments clause of the constitution aside from that  though  trump is now the president  we re probably in for a wild ride  and not in a good way photo of donald trump by bill pugliano getty images  photo of hillary clinton by chip somodevilla getty images
