cnn s jim acosta is not especially well liked by the white house  he tells it like it is in harsh  blunt terms  and of course  they don t like that  the growing feud continued today when trump gave a supposed press conference after a full weekend of promising a big press conference  but at a true press conference  reporters are able to ask questions  donald trump wouldn t allow questions at this  press conference   acosta wanted to ask him about his responses to charlottesville  because trump s initial response to it was weak and pathetic  and one in which he wouldn t condemn the nazis and other white supremacists  and puffed himself up rather than saying something heartfelt and inspirational like a real president would have getting no answer to that  acosta asked him about the lack of a proper presser  trump said that they d just had one  apparently  in trumpland  an egotistical speech that barely touches on anything and doesn t allow for questions from reporters qualifies as a press conference simply because the press is there  trump s reply to acosta  it doesn t bother me at all  but i like real news  not fake news  you re fake news  it s absolutely amazing that trump calls anyone  fake news  when he s essentially the liar of liars who s spread more than his fair share of fake news  acosta knows this  and threw a question at trump that we ve all wanted to hear in response to the latest  fake news  accusation  watch below cnn s  acosta to trump  can we ask you more questions  trump   i like real news  not fake news  you re fake news   https   t co   cnn   cnn  august    went into full toddler mode and took his ball and went home without another word it s all part of a pattern with him   if it s good  he claims credit for it and hypes it up  even if he couldn t possibly have had anything to do with it  if it s bad  it s  fake news    fake polls   etc   and it s high time someone confronted him about it sometimes  it seems as if acosta is the only one willing to do so  but our illegitimate president doesn t like looking bad  let alone doing the right thing featured image via video screen capture
