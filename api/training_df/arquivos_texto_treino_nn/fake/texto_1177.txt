over the last nine years or so  there has been one cardinal rule in republican politics  never  ever say anything good about president barack obama  in a sign that things may be changing  that things might soon start looking a little less partisan  one major republican   one whose career ambitions were thwarted by obama in    has made a stunning admission  sen  jon mccain said america was better off under obama than it is under trump  no  you aren t dreaming mccain  once blamed the shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando on obama barack obama is directly responsible for it  because when he pulled everybody out of iraq  al qaeda went to syria  became isis  and isis is what it is today thanks to barack obama s failures  utter failures  by pulling everybody out of iraq  so the responsibility for it lies with president barack obama and his failed policies  source  la timesthe orlando shooter was american born and raised  but why let an inconvenient fact get in the way mccain seems to have had a change of heart about obama s foreign policies  though  at least after five months under donald trump  in an interview with the guardian  mccain was asked about trump s foreign policy  specifically in relation to the united kingdom  as you recall  after a deadly terrorist attack in london  trump  rather than offering condolences and assistance to one of our greatest allies  took to twitter to pick a fight with the city s mayor  who happens to be muslim after mayor sadiq khan said after the attack that londoners need not be alarmed by the increased police presence  trump took the words out of context to make it sound as if he wasn t taking the attack seriously at least  dead and  wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is  no reason to be alarmed   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    when khan responded  trump said this pathetic excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his  no reason to be alarmed  statement  msm is working hard to sell it   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    trump hasn t exactly been disinvited from his scheduled state visit  he disinvited himself over concerns that there might be protests  in other words  trump seems to be choosing to ignore whatever parts of the world aren t nice to him  so far  we have saudi arabia and russia when the guardian asked mccain about trump and great britain  he said this senator john mccain  a prominent republican voice on foreign policy  was visibly irked when asked by the guardian what message trump had sent to the united kingdom  one of america s most enduring allies  what do you think the message is  the message is that america doesn t want to lead   mccain said  while adding of the rest of the world   they are not sure of american leadership  whether it be in siberia or whether it be in antarctica  asked if america s standing on the global stage was better under barack obama  mccain  a fervent critic of the previous administration s foreign policy  responded   as far as american leadership is concerned  yes  while mccain isn t always in lock step with his party  he has become increasingly partisan in recent years  he endorsed donald trump during the election and in last week s senate hearing for fired fbi director james comey  mccain focused only on hillary clinton s emails  completely ignoring possible trump russia connections  still  this could be the sign of a changing tide  it only takes a handful of republicans to realize that trump is sending the nation on a dangerous course and it needs to stop
