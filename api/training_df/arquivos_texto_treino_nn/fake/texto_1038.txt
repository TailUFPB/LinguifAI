there are people currently being turned down for jobs at applebee s with better resumes than william bradford  the obscure attorney general of the chiricahua apache nation was recently catapulted to a job in the federal government when trump announced he was appointing bradford to run the energy department s office of indian energy  like many of trump s hires  bradford has almost zero in the way of experience at the job he was just hired for  his only tweets relating to energy are those that call climate scientists  cultists  if he wasn t hired for his experience  he certainly wasn t hired for the content of his character  either  bradford has forceful opinions on nearly every person  race  ethnicity  and lifestyle under the sun   and all of them are bigoted on his now deleted twitter and facebook accounts  bradford documented his bigotry like a man checking boxes on the list of qualities the biggest asshole in the world might have  he is himself jewish  but it didn t stop him from once calling mark zuckerberg a  self hating jew  for the  crime  of writing an essay opposing trump  adding that he hoped zuckerberg  gets what he deserves  he pushed birther conspiracies about obama  while also promoting an even more obscure right wing conspiracy that suggested obama is secretly gay as the above tweet suggests  bradford is also big on bashing muslims  a major obsession of his was to float theories that obama was coordinating with muslims in iran to destroy america bradford also called japanese internment camps in world war ii  necessary   parroting trump s on again  off again relationship with creating internment camps for muslims for simplicity  let s go over the list  bradford is and now he s working  as the washington post put it  to help  native americans and alaska native tribes and villages obtain electricity and reduce energy costs  a job he has no experience in and no apparent desire to do  the position is final because it s a job that does not require congressional approval in no uncertain terms  william bradford would be unemployable in any other administration  his legacy of toxic  violent and unbalanced comments on social media would be enough to send up all kinds of alarm bells for any white house that cared  even slightly  about staffing government roles with people who could actually perform with competently  instead  trump is stuffing positions seemingly at a whim  he has taken to hiring the wives of his political critics to curry favor  and watching newt gingrich and mitch mcconnell  both of whom have spouses owing their careers to trump  bend to his will shows how effective this has been   he has no problem hiring people who plagiarized or lied about their education  and he has no issues with a person s mental stability either the result is nothing short of a disaster featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
