kellyanne conway whined about the media again and chuck todd smacked her down donald trump has serious conflicts of interest that he should have to resolve before he is allowed to set one foot in the white house it s pretty clear that trump intends to intermingle his business with politics over the next four years and that s a major problem the country does not need that s why the wall street journal is calling for him to liquidate his assets and focus entirely on running the country  because running it part time just simply won t do but kellyanne conway  trump s former campaign manager who must have problems looking at herself in the mirror every morning knowing that she sold her fucking soul to help install a dictator into the highest office in the land  complained on meet the press on sunday morning that doing so would rob trump s kids of controlling the business of course  that s bullshit  we all know that trump s kids get their marching orders from their daddy  and the fact that ivanka trump has been sitting in on meetings with foreign leaders makes it clear that the conflict of interest will continue to exist even if trump hands the company over to them conway argued that trump has already put the country first by running for president and winning  and then she started to attack the media for not treating donald trump like a cool guy we can all trust  you know  chuck  he has put the country ahead of everything else just by running and  indeed  winning and becoming president of the united states  i went and looked back at what all the press clips and conversations on shows like this were eight years ago  it was basically just debating on how cool barack obama is  so  we should at least   if we re not going to do that about president elect trump   we should at the very least trust him to do the right thing  except that donald trump is not cool  he s a creep who sexually assaults women and brags about it  he s a selfish wealthy prick who sticks it to the taxpayers any chance he gets  and  like conway  he s a thin skinned whiner who can t handle criticism or the truth  which is why chuck todd called conway out  i understand every knee jerk push back is going to be to blame the media   todd said   it s a crutch  i get it and i m used to it  not by me   conway insisted   that s not fair  here s the video via youtube oh  but it is fair  kellyanne  and it s about time someone in the press called you out for it  in virtually every media appearance she makes  blaming the media is  indeed  the crutch conway uses when having to deal with tough legitimate questions from journalists  she did it throughout the campaign and she is still doing it now  it s pathetic featured image  screenshot
