remember when jon stewart humiliated tucker carlson on his own show many years ago  well  this time it was teen vogue writer lauren duca doing the humiliating during an appearance on fox news on friday  duca refused to let carlson talk over her and misrepresent what she has said earlier this week  a man confronted ivanka trump on a jetblue flight and yelled at her  the man was removed from the plane and trump supporters immediately threw a hissy fit because someone dared criticize trump s daughter in public despite conservative whining  a majority of people sided with ivanka in the moment because it s pretty damn rude to approach someone  especially a mother who is with her kids  and yell at them duca is also against yelling on airplanes but warned people not to let ivanka off the hook because of this rude incident ivanka trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world  don t let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good   lauren duca   laurenduca  december     of course  fox host tucker carlson took that tweet the wrong way he accused duca of supporting what the man did to ivanka  but that s not what she said at all and let carlson know it duca conceded that many of ivanka trump s qualities are admirable but the fact that she enable her racist sexist father despite appearing to be a feminist is concerning tucker carlson was unable to grasp what duca was calmly explaining to him  apparently  she needed to speak more slowly but the interview grew more contentious as carlson acted smug and repeatedly tried to prevent duca from speaking to defend herself  causing her to refer to him as a  partisan hack  carlson even repeatedly focused on ivanka being accosted on the plane  which forced duca to once again explain to carlson that she is firmly against yelling at people on planes once that issue was settled  carlson moved on to mocking duca for being a writer at teen vogue  that didn t go down so well for carlson either and once he finally stopped being an asshole about where duca works  he attacked her for defending religious freedom  telling her that  she should stick the thigh high boots  all while laughing at her before cutting her off before she could respond here s the video via youtube seriously  tucker carlson was rude and out of line and he owes duca an apology but duca responded later on twitter   tuckercarlson is an enemy of rational discourse  in this fraught moment  his bully tactics are profoundly damaging  and achieve nothing   lauren duca   laurenduca  december    not only did duca completely own carlson throughout the interview  carlson embarrassed himself by acting like a douchebag featured image via screenshot
