republicans apparently have no idea what they believe anymore  the only constant in the gop universe these days is believing whatever it is trump wants them to believe that s the only explanation i can think of for the results of the following polls  this one  from politico  shows overwhelming numbers of republican supporting direct federal negotiation with individual businesses  tax breaks or incentives offered to specific individual businesses   crony capitalism    and advantages on government contractors for specific businesses the best part  even the gop platform doesn t agree  here s more  directly from the  platform cronyism is inherent in the progressive vision of the administrative state  when government uses taxpayer funding and resources to give special advantages to private companies  it distorts the free market and erodes public trust in our political system  by enlarging the scope of government and placing enormous power in the hands of bureaucrats  it multiplies opportunities for corruption and favoritism  it is the enemy of reform in education  the workplace  and healthcare  it gives us financial regulation that protects the large at the cost of the small  it is inherent in every part of the current healthcare law  which is packed with corporate welfare  crony capitalism gives us special interest tax breaks  custom designed regulations  and special exemptions for favored parties  the solyndra debacle is a perfect example  it creates both subsidies and restrictions to tilt the market one way or the other  by putting the weight of government behind the status quo  it leads to economic stagnation now  i feel it is important to note that i don t agree with republican economic theories at all  there is no such thing as a truly  free market  when markets are an abstract concept defined by and regulated by a central authority   no matter how much libertarian minded conservatives may wish otherwise  yet it can t be denied that trump and pence   and gop views right now overall   do not see remotely eye to eye with the stance outlined in the platform strong regulatory rules that are the same for everyone  progressive economics  are a far cry from  whoever the president wants to win  wins   what republicans are currently claiming to be in support of isn t a free market  it s fascism  and it s as big as big government gets  even sarah fucking palin understands that it gets better  another poll  from the economist yougov  shows that republicans are completely open with their newfound lack of free market economics as you can see  traditional politics has been turned on its head   this poll shows much higher support for free market economics among democrats and independents than republicans now  interpretation  i don t think anything has actually changed at all for the average republican voter  they believe the same things day to day they always did  they re just not that smart  and they have way too much respect for authoritative leaders   they re authoritarian followers who think a  strong  leader like trump always knows what is best  so this is less of a case of switched beliefs  and more a case of  whatever dad says goes  some conservative leaders have tried to fight back against trump s professed love of fascist economics  but the reasonable voices in the gop  by their standard  should have learned that they were drowned out long ago  this is trump s party now  and soon  it s trump s america the right wing has lost all sense of leadership and guidance and is now abandoning its own core principles in a desperate bid to retain power  and i don t mean over one election   they know the future of their party is in danger  hillary s   million popular vote victory  the simmering anger of a large number of americans  and the upcoming census elections are ensuring that the few smart republicans left see the writing on the wall  unless they pull off some massive populist victories during the next few years  they re doomed with trump at the helm and support for fascism on the rise  things are not looking good featured image partial shot of embedded politico poll
