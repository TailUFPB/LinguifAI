democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton is not mincing words when it comes to the bigotry that runs rampant among donald trump supporters  while speaking in new york at a fundrasier focused on lgbtq issues  hillary pointed out what we already know  many on the trump train are straight up bigots  and there s no way around that fact  she said  you know  just to be grossly generalist  you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables  the racist  sexist  homophobic  xenophobic  islamaphobic   you name it  and unfortunately there are people like that  and he has lifted them up  hillary then went on to make sure that people knew that she understands that not all of trump s supporters are like this  in fact likely many are disturbed by many of his statements and the behavior of some of their fellow trump supporters  and they are likely just desperate for change and have been duped into believing trump can deliver it  she continued  that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down  the economy has let them down  nobody cares about them  nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures  and they re just desperate for a change   she said   they don t buy everything he says  but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different  they won t wake up and see their jobs disappear  lose a kid to heroin  feel like they re in a dead end  those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well  she also added that if you know folks who might vote for trump  do something about it  if you know anybody who s even thinking of voting for trump  stage an intervention  hillary is right  of course  donald trump is a demagogue  and this is how demagogues work  they prey on the desperate  they exploit and magnify divisions  all for their own gain of political power  trump is in no way fit to be president  and his very candidacy is already endangering the country  to that end  we need to listen to hillary  get out the vote  and make sure she wins  for the future of our own lives and this great nation that we all love featured image via justin sullivan getty images
