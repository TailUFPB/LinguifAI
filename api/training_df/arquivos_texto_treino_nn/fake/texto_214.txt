this article is uncensored and contains very offensive language the tiny town of riverhead  new york  just across the peconic bay from the hamptons  is on fire  no  not literally  it s not on fire like the california cities donald trump has seemingly forgotten about  but it wouldn t surprise me to find out that trump knows more about riverhead on long island than he does about fountaingrove or coffey park in santa rosa  especially now that officials are on their heels defending town attorney bob kozakiewicz and his wife  dianne delaney  after she posted possibly the most racially offensive rant i have ever seen after visiting a local pizza parlor  delaney took to facebook to complain about the perceived treatment of her waitress by some black people   whether they were fellow patrons or employees is unclear   and it went south after just two sentences also unclear is how someone gets elected  yes  elected  town attorney without the deep seeded racism clearly apparent in his family coming to light before now delaney is  just  the attorney s wife  so she will  of course  face no consequences  but kozakiewicz is being defended by the town after some began calling for his resignation  kozakiewicz and town supervisor sean walter blamed delaney s rant on alcoholism  which may have played a part in the lack of inhibition required to publicly post something like that  but whether her uncensored feelings were set free by liquor or not  nobody but an unabashed racist could even come up with these things to say  drunk or sober kozakiewicz told his local paper monday morning that his wife s  rant in no way  shape or form reflects my views   that s an assertion that s slightly undercut by the fact that shortly before deleting his own facebook page  the most recent post of his own was a share of a video by noted racist and  alt right  nazi mike cernovich the town of riverhead isn t quite ready to let bob go  though  in addition to asking those following this story to  pray for dianne   town supervisor walter laid equal blame at the feet of anyone who posted screen captures of the episode  it is unmitigated hatred that should never be reposted  if you see it and you repost it you re just as guilty in my opinion about propagating that hatred  so i guess i now share the blame for dianne delaney and her husband bob being horrible  garbage humans i can live with that if it eventually gets this asshole fired featured image via composite screen capture
