during the  presidential campaign  president donald trump made a lot of promises on immigration  he was going to build a wall between the united states and mexico  that mexico would fund  he was going to keep muslims from coming into the country  lastly  he was going to cut funding to  sanctuary cities   now it looks like none of that is going to happen  the travel bans have been struck down  the border wall is never going to happen  now  a federal court has ruled against taking funding away from sanctuary cities sanctuary cities are those that refuse to work with immigration and customs enforcement  ice  to deport undocumented immigrants who report crimes  it s important to note that lacking documentation is a civil offense  not a criminal one  this is the second of trump s main policy initiatives to be struck down because it violates the u s  constitution both san francisco and santa clara county won orders squashing an executive order  signed by trump on january    to halt funding to any cities who refuse to deport undocumented immigrants for minor offenses  the president has said these cities can cause   immeasurable harm to the american people and to the very fabric of our republic   u s  district judge william orrick did not see it that way  he sided with san francisco and santa clara county while trump wants to appear powerful  it is clear that he is not aware of what limits there are on presidential power  the president does not decide how federal funds are spent  that s congress s job  the budget that is submitted by the white house every year is simply a wish list of what the president would like to see federal money spent on  congress is under no obligation to follow the budget  by the same token  once funds have been allocated for a program  a president cannot just block that funding because it suits his or her objectives the white house promises to appeal the decision and chief of staff reince priebus has said that the courts in california are  going bananas   he added   the idea that an agency can t put in some reasonable restriction on how some of these monies are spent is something that will be overturned eventually  and we ll win at the supreme court level at some point  for its part  the department of justice assets that federal agencies are still allowed to act against any cities or towns that violate or ignore federal immigration laws  department spokesman ian prior said   the court upheld the government s ability to use lawful means to enforce existing conditions of federal grants   ian prior said in an emailed statement  the ruling is not just a victory for these two jurisdictions  its impact will be felt in sanctuary cities and jurisdictions across the nation  cities such as new york  chicago and los angeles  this ruling is also giving energy to californians who want to be seen as leading the resistance against the trump administration  the californian state senate put through the  california values act   this would turn the entire state into a sanctuary zone
