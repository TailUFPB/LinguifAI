in a stunning example of just how out of touch and heartless the republican party is towards women s healthcare  vice president mike pence convened a meeting to discuss the topic of stripping maternity care requirements from health insurance   and forgot to invite even a single woman needless to say  an image of the meeting is now blowing up on social media as americans sit in stunned amazement that this is how congress and the white house think of the women who make up half the country democratic politicians were equally outraged  massachusetts representative jim mcgovern tweeted his anger over the sheer audacity of this meeting  the picture clearly struck a nerve because the tweet quickly racked up thousands of retweets this is outrageous  not a single woman in the room as  mikepence and  housegop propose removing maternity coverage in  trumpcare  pic twitter com   jim mcgovern   repmcgovern  march    pictured above  some dicks  a lot of assholes  but not a single uterus  and the group was taking women s health so seriously that it appears one member actually fell asleep during the meeting  repmcgovern  daithifall  mikepence  housegop and one dude who s clearly dozed off pic twitter com   kevin byrne   kevbyrnebox  march    and paul ryan have been frantically offering  deals  to the fringe right wing of the gop in the hopes that they will agree to pass the obamacare replacement known as the  american health care act   the bill has been nothing short of a disaster for republicans  for starters  it keeps many of the items that infuriate conservatives intact  while at the same time doing everything that obamacare did  but less well  the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated that over  million people would likely lose their health insurance thanks to this bill  for many people  it would also cause their premiums to skyrocket rather than fix the bill   or better yet  keep the aca   trump and ryan are making huge concessions to the ultra right  one such concession is to remove the  health care  part of the health care bill  republicans are considering dropping the so called  essential health benefits  of the aca  allowing insurers to pick and chose what they want to cover  naturally  things like maternity care and emergency services would be the first to go  which brings us back to the  house freedom caucus  and its all male members in a dimly lit room  the group of conservative white men sat around a table and weighed the relative merits of providing maternity care to women  to give one an idea of how dismissive these elderly gopers were towards giving health care to women  here s how trump s press secretary sean spicer framed it sean spicer on healthcare   i think if you re an older man you can generally say that you re not going to need maternity care    liam stack   liamstack  march    mothers  daughters  sisters  wives   and in some cases  mistresses   might see things a bit differently featured image via twitter
