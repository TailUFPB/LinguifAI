donald trump thanked outgoing fbi director james comey for informing me  on three separate occasions  that i am not under investigation   but it seems that the donald is lying  the shocking firing of the man who was investigating trump came just after the former fbi chief requested additional resources for the investigation  a sign that things were not going well for trump and his accomplices  but you know what else is a sign that things aren t going well  the fbi just confirmed that they are investigating trump directly despite his claims to the contrary an open records request from the sparrow project reveals that there is an  active ongoing investigation  into trump  the organization requested disclosure of any and all records  including investigative records  mentioning or referring to donald j  trump s statement on  july      russia  if you re listening  i hope you re able to find the   emails that are missing   and  i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press  the fbi dragged its heels on the request  prompting a lawsuit demanding that the foia request be fulfilled  the bureau had initially refused to confirm nor deny the existence of any records related to the request  but that changed in the agency s legal response  which confirms an  active  ongoing investigation  and says the fbi is concerned that any release could  reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings  it s worth noting that the requested records were not related to trump s associates or russian accomplices   the request solely related to him and his demand that russia hack hillary clinton things are bad for the russia administration   and they are only going to get much worse after trump s attempt to interfere with the investigation featured image via getty images  pool
