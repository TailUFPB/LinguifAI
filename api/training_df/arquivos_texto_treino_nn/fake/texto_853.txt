while the defense of three members of trump s camp meeting with russians last year has taken more turns than a roller coaster  one defense has been constant  it s a  nothing burger   while donald trump jr   jared kushner and paul manafort did meet with russians to get dirt on hillary clinton  the argument is that it doesn t matter because they didn t actually receive any dirt of course that argument gave us a whole host of botched bank robber and  to catch a predator  analogies  basically saying that if you intend to commit a crime and you act upon it  you have committed a crime  whether or not you get the goods no matter how flawed that defense is  though  it turns out it s not even true  trump jr   kushner and manafort were given some dirt on hillary clinton  from near the bottom of an ap article veselnitskaya brought with her a plastic folder with printed out documents that detailed what she believed was the flow of illicit funds to the democrats  akhmetshin said  veselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the campaign  he said  this could be a good issue to expose how the dnc is accepting bad money   akhmetshin recalled her saying trump jr  asked the attorney if she had sufficient evidence to back up her claims  including whether she could demonstrate the flow of the money  but veselnitskaya said the trump campaign would need to research it more  after that  trump jr  lost interest  according to akhmetshin  they couldn t wait for the meeting to end   he said akhmetshin said he does not know if veselnitskaya s documents were provided by the russian government  he said he thinks she left the materials with the trump associates  it was unclear if she handed the documents to anyone in the room or simply left them behind  he said so if the members of the trump campaign didn t take the information  it was only because they would have had to do some of their own legwork  not only is this administration the most crooked in american history  they are the most lazy  they didn t just want some opposition research from the russians  they appeared to want the russians to do all their work for them featured image via win mcnamee getty images
