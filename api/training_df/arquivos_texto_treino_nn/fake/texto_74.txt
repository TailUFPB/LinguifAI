more than a year ago  house majority leader kevin mccarthy was caught  oops  on a hot mic saying that there were two people in washington who were being paid by the russians   donald trump and california gop  rep dana rohrabacher  sadly  those two people are still in office a new report by the new york times  though  confirms half of mccarthy s comments  rohrabacher isn t just being paid by the russians  he s a russian agent  and he has a code name  and it s not even new information according to the times report  the fbi warned rohrbacher in  that the russians viewed him as a source and had given him a code name  the next year  congress elevated him to the chairmanship of the foreign affairs subcommittee that overseas russian policy  nope  nothing at all fishy there rohrabacher didn t seem to have much involvement in the trump campaign  that would be too obvious  even for the russians   but special investigator robert mueller is eyeing him nonetheless as revelations of russia s campaign to influence american politics consume washington  mr  rohrabacher    who had no known role in the trump election campaign  has come under political and investigative scrutiny  the f b i  and the senate intelligence committee are each seeking to interview him about an august meeting with julian assange  the founder of wikileaks  mr  rohrabacher said  the special counsel  robert s  mueller iii  is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with michael t  flynn  mr  trump s short lived national security adviser rohrabacher s russian connections go back further than just a few years  though  as a young reaganite  he got the warm fuzzies with the fall of the soviet union and he developed a relationship with vladimir putin  in the   rohrabacher lost an arm wrestling match to the man who would become president for life  or whatever the hell putin calls himself rohrabacher  naturally  denies that he is a russian agent mr  rohrabacher has laughed off suggestions that he is a russian asset  and said in an interview that he did not remember being briefed that the russians viewed him as a source  the f b i  and the senior members of the house intelligence committee sat mr  rohrabacher down in the capitol in  to warn him that russian spies were trying to recruit him  according to two former intelligence officials  i remember them telling me   you have been targeted to be recruited as an agent   he said   how stupid is that  only  his actions paint a very different picture  in   he served as what might be called a delivery boy between russia and either the trump campaign or the rnc  he picked up a memo targeting democratic donors  rohrabacher has also met with wikileaks  julian assange and russian  accused criminal  oligarchs rohrabacher insists nothing untoward is going on  his goal  he says  is to bring russia in to help us battle terrorism  to be fair  russia could help rein in terrorism  but they would have to stop funding terrorists  like syrian president bashir assad republicans are finding it a bit easier to distance themselves from rohrabacher than the other alleged russian agent  donald trump  they are limiting his power on the foreign affairs committee politically  this could be disaster for rohrabacher  he s facing a tough race in california  and you d better believe that his opponents are using his russian connections against him hans keirstead  a prominent stem cell researcher competing with five other democrats to challenge mr  rohrabacher  compared the republican s russia record to  a prologue to a very bad book  we ve got a russian tainted congressman   mr  keirstead said in an interview  adding  why should the constituents of the  district vote for an individual whose interests are elsewhere  of course  rohrabacher  like anyone who s been trained in dictator   is fundraising off of it  calling it an  attack  featured image via adam berry getty images
