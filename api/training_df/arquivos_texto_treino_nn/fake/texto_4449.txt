it s been a couple days since the first presidential debate  but the results are finally in  and it s not looking too great for one of the two candidates  especially in regards to the women vote according to the new post debate  nbc news surveymonkey poll  twenty seven percent of likely women voters said the debate made them think worse of trump  meanwhile  nearly a third  or  percent  said their opinion of clinton had improved  compared to  percent of men  women were also far likelier to say clinton won the debate  by a  point margin over men  it seems as if a lot of women are really put off by donald trump s temperament and not only how he treated hillary clinton during the debate  but women in general throughout his lifetime one woman who was interviewed for the poll even admitted that she voted for trump in the primary  but now is leaning towards hillary clinton  year old joan hume of fairfield  ohio said  i m undecided  but i m leaning more towards hillary than i ever have before because of the debate  apparently  she wanted to see washington shaken up  but she admitted  there s a side of him that s scary to me that i m seeing more of  i thought maybe he would change when he got the nomination  but he s getting worse  and while there are some women who apparently still think trump is an acceptable choice despite his blatant misogyny and insults towards women  it s really not looking too great for the reality tv host considering if you want to win the white house  you need to win over women  and right now  it looks like trump is losing while hillary is gaining the poll states this of independent women voters  trump fared particularly poorly with independent women when they were asked if he has the  temperament and personality to serve   eighty percent of independent female voters said he does not  by contrast  independent women voters were more evenly split on clinton s personality and temperament  with  percent saying she met the test for president  yikes  that doesn t look so good for mr  trump here s the thing  trump has a very  very long history of being absolutely horrible towards women  and the women who hadn t caught on yet are now finally starting to see the bigger picture  chances are  more will jump ship to clinton s side before november  at least if they re aware of the reality of the situation here s the take from msnbc on the topic of women and trump featured photo by spencer platt getty images
