while the entire nation is struggling with the question of who is worse  donald trump or mike pence  the state of indiana is thrilled to be rid of the right wing conservative pence who was their governor until just a few weeks ago  and they re doing everything to erase his legacy and all of this is being orchestrated by the replacement that pence picked governor eric holcomb was chosen by pence as his lieutenant governor  pence has often said that he s  a christian  a conservative and a republican  in that order   holcomb  on the other hand is definitely a christian  but he s a lot more pragmatic and frankly  next to pence  anyone seems moderate  well  except perhaps the man who currently occupies the oval office in just these last three weeks  holcomb has cancelled a contract that would have leased cellphone towers to an ohio company which would have left indiana residents to foot the bill for construction projects he also pardoned a wrongly convicted man who served nearly two decades in prison holcomb also pardoned keith cooper  who was wrongfully convicted of robbery nearly  years ago  and declared a disaster emergency for an east chicago neighborhood where residents have been forced to relocate because of lead contamination pence had declined to pardon cooper before leaving office  insisting that he exhaust his legal options despite resounding evidence of his innocence  pence s refusal to exonerate the  year old chicago man came despite a pardon recommendation from the indiana parole board and an online petition urging pence to clear cooper s name that had collected more than   signatures source  indystarwhile holcomb hasn t exactly turned indiana into a liberal haven  he does support a local needle exchange  pence didn t  pence preferred to take the see no evil approach and pretend that if we pray hard enough and disapprove firmly enough  people won t do drugs and they won t get sick from sharing needles  that doesn t work  to be fair  though  pence did eventually succumb  but he still opposed giving local officials the authority to enact such an exchange right before he left office  pence vetoed two bills  one gave university police departments  you know  the ones who are so often charged with investigating sexual assaults and hate crimes  total secrecy and the other prevented the state from establishing stronger environmental regulations than the feds without the general assembly s approval  both vetoes were overridden house minority leader scott pelath  d michigan city  called the turn away from pence s policies  fascinating  the mike pence legacy came to a very quick end today  probably the shortest one in indiana gubernatorial history   he said   we just saw his final two vetoes overridden  gov  holcomb made the very common sense decision to address the east chicago lead problem  which has been our own flint  mich   in the making  he pardoned an innocent man which seems basic human decency  and he allowed that bicentennial cellphone tower deal to die a cow s death here in the hoosier state  residents of indiana aren t exactly hopeful that they ll turn blue  but it s interesting that trump s  and pence s  coattails seem to be non existent  just a few weeks into the the administration  trump is no leader and even other republicans are beginning to see that featured image via mark wilson getty images
