chicago doesn t tend to be one of the cities one thinks of when one thinks of the religious right  unfortunately  they do exist here  and some of them decided to do something unspeakably disgusting and cruel for halloween  calling themselves  christians   which they aren t  they put together a haunted house with  rooms   one of which showed the mass shooting at the pulse nightclub in orlando pulse was a club frequented by the lgbtq community  and there are many on the religious right who seem to think that the victims of that horror simply got what was coming to them  the so called  christians  who put this atrocity together called it   the room  a journey to hell  what s the implication there  it s pretty clear  in each of the  rooms were scenes in which people supposedly made choices that would send them to hell  the inclusion of the pulse shooting indicates that the group who put this together believes that the clubgoers who were brutally murdered that night went to hell due to their  choice  of living the  homosexual lifestyle  ergo  getting murdered was what they deserved for willfully committing that sin the haunted house was to happen at fernwood elementary school  which is part of chicago public schools  an elementary school is not an appropriate venue for anything like this  even though children under  were supposedly prohibited from going through it  cps very wisely decided not to allow the haunted house at all  according to the windy city times  and a spokesperson for cps said  the event organizers mischaracterized the true content of the event  and we did not approve any association with the activities the organizers have now advertised  the event will not be held on cps property  because of course they did the event organizers posted an ad on facebook asking for volunteers for the event  and the event has now been banned there  too  as well it should be  this is christian extremism run amok  and there is no place for this kind of gruesome hatred in our society featured image by gerardo mora via getty images
