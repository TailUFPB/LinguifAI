on monday  donald trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching ahmad khan rahami  who was responsible for the saturday bombing in new york city twitterthis would have normally been a nice gesture  if it hadn t been a contradiction of something trump had said just a few minutes before  fortunately  whenever trump flip flops or lies  americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh t via social media   and they didn t hesitate to remind trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for rahami s capture  he d dissed the nypd for allowing  political correctness  to interfere with catching terrorists  among the first to point this out was msnbc s christopher hayes  who tweeted  twitter hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment trump had made on fox and friends shortly before he congratulated the police officers  in which he said  you know  our police are amazing  our local police  they know who a lot of these people are  they are afraid to do anything about it  because they don t want to be accused of profiling  and they don t want to be accused of all sorts of things  yup   trump had accused the nypd of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are  yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame  other people recognized this epic fail as well  and blasted the republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two faced twittertwittertwittertwitterthis tweet was particularly funny  and i m sure there will be some backlash for trump to deal with twitterthroughout his presidential campaign  trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than african american police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a  law and order  candidate  but thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcement having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists  trump has probably just ruined a year of pro law enforcement campaigning featured image via spencer platt   getty images
