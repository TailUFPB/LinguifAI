donald trump s disgusting travel ban is a highly divisive issue  and last night it caused a cnn panel to completely devolve into chaos as the panelists went at each other s throats on national television on cnn tonight  host don lemon had his hands full as he tried to maintain some sort of order and control over his panel guests as they discussed trump s second version of his travel ban  which bans travelers from  majority muslim countries  but when former federal prosecutor john flannery accused harvard law school s alan dershowitz of supporting the controversial ban due to his apparent pro israel views  things got heated rather quickly  flannery said  our dear colleague  alan dershowitz  i think  hopes that this may secure israel  i think it s a powerful argument that we ve established religion in this fashion through this ban that is transparently against muslims  dershowitz flipped out at this accusation  and fired back  you re lying through your teeth  i never said a word about israel  when you focus on everything i say about israel it really raises questions about your own bigotry and biases  so let s get to the point and just keep your mouth shut  dershowitz then stated that although he felt the ban was  bad policy   trump was within his constitutional boundaries to order it  he and flannery sparred over the legalities for a bit  before the conversation circled back around to israel  dershowitz then exploded  what does this have to do with israel  why in your bigoted background do you have to bring in israel to attack me  your bigotry is showing  flannery responded  i believe that s the reason you re taking the position you are    and this set dershowitz off  you can t believe anything i say because i m a jew and a zionist  for shame on you sir  i never want to be on the show with this bigot again  lemon then had to step in and try to restore some sort of civil discussion  without a doubt  trump s travel ban is one of the worst things he s done in his short disastrous two months as potus  and it s raising some very important questions amongst americans and their biases  you can watch the panel melt down below featured image is a screenshot
