trump promised to release his tax returns  and then  as we all remember  made excuse after excuse after excuse not to  with tax reform now on the table  and trump s plan taking center stage in the white house following the massive failure to repeal the aca  house democrats may finally have a way to force him to release his returns  refuse to even consider tax reform legislation until after they ve seen his returns seriously  rep  hakeem jeffries  a democrat from new jersey  introduced the resolution as a way to discover just how trump himself will benefit from tax reform before any legislation even makes it out of the committee brilliant  new dem bill would delay trump s tax reform legislation until he releases his tax returns  pic twitter com   impeach donald trump   impeachdtrump  april    republicans ask why trump s tax returns are so important  this is why  trump is already personally benefiting from the white house  his ideas for tax reform  along with the rest of the gop s ideas  could be crafted around how it will help him continue to line his pockets one of the most obvious problems is that trump s cabinet is full of billionaires  and his tax plan  along with every plan of the gop s  will amount to hefty tax cuts for the rich and for businesses  they do not help average americans  who are the people most in need of tax relief furthermore  during the campaign  trump called himself smart for finding ways to avoid paying taxes  any tax reform he pushes congress to consider is extremely likely to be of personal benefit to him because that s how he rolls  if it wasn t how he rolled  he would have officially divested of his business interests  he would not allow the government to fund the business trips of his two sons  and he probably would have let us see his returns so the entire country could compare his tax plans to the taxes he currently pays  or doesn t pay  in short  without being able to see his tax returns  president rich bitch can do what he wants with taxes without much more than the standard outcry about tax cuts for the wealthy  now  the democrats  plan would allow the house ways and means committee to review his taxes in a closed door session  so they still wouldn t be truly public  however  if the congressional committee in charge of taxes knows what s in there  then there s a chance  however slim  that we ll get tax reform that s far fairer than what trump likely wants featured image via alex wong getty images
