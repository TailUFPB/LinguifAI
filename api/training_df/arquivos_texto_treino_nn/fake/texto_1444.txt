trump has been bested by a man who is far smarter and far more ethical than he could ever dream of  james comey apparently documented his conversations with trump in memos  and the new york times has spoken to at least two people who reportedly have those memos and read parts of it to them  in one memo  which documents a conversation that happened back in february  comey reports that trump said  i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go  to letting flynn go  he is a good guy  i hope you can let this go  this conversation reportedly took place the day after flynn resigned  so we can assume that trump thought  or hoped  that he could force that to be the end of it  the white house has already made it clear that they re going to try and pin this whole mess on flynn and claim ignorance  and a conversation like this  with trump asking comey to drop it  fits in with that narrative rather well but that s not all  that memo also reportedly says that trump told comey to consider jailing members of the press who publish classified leaks  trump believes that the leaks coming from the white house are the bigger threat and has been raging for weeks that the fbi hasn t been focusing on those in other words  trump was not only trying to turn all eyes off of him  he wanted comey to start working on his  jail all press who speak negatively of me  plan comey was known for taking detailed notes  particularly when he felt that the details of a conversation might be questioned later on  the times reports that he created memos about every meeting and phone call he and trump  and he did share some of them with senior fbi officials of course  the white house is fervently denying this conversation happened this way  according to the times piece  their official statement on the matter says  while the president has repeatedly expressed his view that general flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country  the president has never asked mr  comey or anyone else to end any investigation  including any investigation involving general flynn  the president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies  and all investigations  this is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and mr  comey  of course it s not  at least  not to the white house  trump has said that this investigation is a hoax perpetrated by the democrats in his desperation to appear totally innocent  he even had a law firm send a certified letter to sen  lindsey graham that was somehow supposed to prove that neither he  nor his associates  colluded with russia at any time trump never succeeded in getting comey to do what he wanted in anything  he never got comey to shift his attention to leaks of classified info and jailing members of the press who published them  and he never got comey to stop investigating his own  and his campaign s  ties to russia  he s now so desperate that he s sending out fundraising emails begging his supporters to help him win against the  deep state  no wonder comey was fired  expect the white house to spin up a brand new web of lies  which may include more threats against comey and other fbi officials featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
