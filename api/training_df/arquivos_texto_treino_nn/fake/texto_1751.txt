this is a major ethics violation  period in march  donald trump made his daughter ivanka an official part of his administration by giving her an office in the white house  my biggest concern is that this is yet another erosion of government ethics standards in this white house   said government ethics expert and law professor kathleen clark at the time and now those concerns are being raised again supposedly  ivanka won t be paid a salary  but it appears that ivanka is being compensated in other ways not long after getting her own white house position  ivanka joined her father at mar a lago to dine with chinese president xi jinping and his wife ivanka even posted a picture of herself with jinping at mar a lago on twitter thanking him for visiting the united states thank you president xi jinping and madame peng liyuan for your visit to the united states    pic twitter com vlvzydmiiy  ivanka trump   ivankatrump  april    what ivanka was apparently really thanking jinping for was the trademarks china awarded to her company on the same day they had dinner together according to the boston globe on april   ivanka trump s company won provisional approval from the chinese government for three new trademarks  giving it monopoly rights to sell ivanka brand jewelry  bags and spa services in the world s second largest economy  that night  the first daughter and her husband  jared kushner  sat next to the president of china and his wife for a steak and dover sole dinner at mar a lago clearly  ivanka trump and her dad are still using the white house to get lucrative business deals and now that ivanka works directly in the white house  she ll have even more access to foreign leaders to benefit her business and fill her family s pockets ivanka previously joined her father in a meeting with japanese prime minister shinzo abe at the same time that a licensing agreement between her company and sanei international was at stake so ivanka trump can t pretend that she s involved in her dad s administration because she gives a damn about helping people and serving her country  she only cares about herself and has demonstrated repeatedly that she doesn t care about ethics as long as she s making money  this entire administration is corrupt to the core and it s time for trump and his family to be kicked out of the white house before they sell america to the highest bidder to enrich themselves featured image  twitter
