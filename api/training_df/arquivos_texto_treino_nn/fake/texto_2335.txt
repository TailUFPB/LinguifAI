legendary news anchor dan rather said on thursday that it shouldn t be long now before donald trump s cozy relationship with russia becomes a real problem for him  every once in a while in washington  the fuse is lit for what seems to be a big scandal  much more rarely does that fuse lead to an explosion of the magnitude we are seeing with russia and the new administration  and frankly the republicans in congress   rather wrote on facebook   how can anybody say  with all this billowing smoke and sights of actual flames  that there is no need to at least independently investigate whether a fire is burning down the very pillars of our democracy  the numerous investigations currently ongoing into the trump campaign s  constant  contact with high level russian officials  michael flynn s resignation after it was revealed that he lied  bigly  about his relationship with ambassador sergey kislyak   and  of course now the likelihood that notorious racist jeff sessions also perjured himself about his coziness with kislyak  rather says things are going to get bad quickly the pressure is obviously starting to mount as leading republicans are now calling for attorney general jeff sessions to recuse himself from the russia investigation  this comes in the wake of serious and credible evidence reported by a vigilant press that the attorney general  mind you the top law enforcement man in the united states  perjured himself in testimony to the senate about meeting the russian ambassador during the election  sessions is but the latest person close to president trump who seems to be ensnared in a story that is more worthy of hollywood melodrama than the reality of the governance of our country  democrats are calling for sessions to resign  and this story could move very quickly  we are well past the time for any political niceties or benefits of the doubt  we need an independent and thorough investigation of russia s meddling in our democracy and its ties to the president and his allies   rather says   we don t know what we don t know  perhaps there are perfectly innocuous reasons for why mr trump won t release his tax returns  why he has continued to speak admirably about president putin and why his aides and advisors seem to be so close to russia  that s why we need an investigation  if the air is to be cleared  it needs to be cleared  and if there is deep rot  it needs to be exposed  and quickly  rather says that the press is doing an  admirable  job at holding this administration to account  but  there is only so much it can do without such things as subpoena powers  let s just make this clear  this is about a foreign and hostile power trying to influence our election while being in contact with close aides to the presidential campaign that the kremlin wanted to win  furthermore  there are serious questions about mr trump s longstanding ties to russian money and influence peddlers  we don t know where this might go  but it isn t going away rather is right   things are looking pretty bad for trump  now we just need to wait for the other shoe to drop read his post below  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    every once in a while in washington  the fuse is lit for what seems to be a big scandal  much more rarely does that fuse posted by dan rather on thursday  march    image via screengrab
