it is now possible for religious adoption agencies in texas to reject lgbt  parents from adopting children the daily caller reports that republican texas gov  greg abbott signed a bill on thursday allowing faith based foster care and adoption agencies to deny lgbt parents  this law  hb   effectively protects faith based agencies from being sued for choosing not to place children with any sort of lgbt  couples first of all  why is religion even playing a role in adoption  children need a loving home and if parents are able to provide it  why does it matter who they are or who they re with  lgbt  parents are just as capable as heterosexual  cisgender couples democratic opponents of the bill pointed out that it s a redundant law but supposedly it s a  step further  in preventing a couple from suing a faith based agency if they re rejected  they also believe that it may allow for the use of religion as a tool of discrimination against lgbt and non christian parents  such an imbalance of rights not only could leave these children worse off than they are now  it opens the door to blatant discrimination against children and loving parents who might not share the same beliefs as some foster care providers   democratic state sen  kirk watson said when the bill was brought before the state senate  of course  it s going to be used as a tool of discrimination  why else was this bill written up  certainly not for the welfare of the children according to the daily caller  the author of the bill state rep  james frank  claims it would not only defend the rights of religious agencies but also help solve the housing crisis that plagues the foster and adoption systems republicans argue it s necessary to prevent the loss of faith based agencies where some have already ceased operations due to the risk of being sued for operating according to their religious beliefs you think again  i ask  why is religion even involved in the foster care system  it s an outrage and it s disgusting  it s another tarnish to the christian faith featured image via rodger mallison fort worth star telegram tns via getty images
