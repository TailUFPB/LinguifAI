the working class voters who supported donald trump just got duped again because if trump s secretary of labor pick has his way  workers will no longer be able to take a much needed break during the workday workers need breaks  it gives them a chance to grab something to eat and recharge their batteries so they can go back to work with a fresher mind and body  workers perform their jobs better with breaks and are less likely to make mistakes that s why workers get a mandatory break thanks to labor unions and the federal government but fast food ceo andrew puzder wants to force workers to work straight through the day without a break in a  interview dug up by oc weekly  puzder expressed his disdain for the state of california where the carl s jr  restaurant originated and openly whined about overtime laws and other worker protections  including laws allowing workers to take a much needed break during their shift trump s labor man also had choice words for carl s jr  s home state   i think the big change in california  it s really become a kind of socialist state   puzder opined   you can t be a capitalist in this state  and carl was at heart a capitalist who created a company that to this day bears his initials   the would be labor secretary complained about regulations and overtime laws  claiming workers are overprotected  have you ever been to a fast food restaurant and the employees are sitting and you re wondering   why are they sitting    puzder asked   they are on what is called a mandatory break    he shared a laugh with the interviewer  saying the so called nanny state is why carl s jr  doesn t open up any new restaurants in california anymore in short  all those trump supporters who think trump is going to make their lives easier will not only lose social security and their healthcare  they are going to lose break time at work as well as their overtime pay  minimum wage  and other protections that keep them safe and unexploited while on the job the choice of puzder as labor secretary is the ultimate  f ck you  to the working class  trump literally picked a guy who opposes worker s rights and the right to get paid fair wages any blue collar worker who voted for trump because they believed he was on their side have just been betrayed and while they are denying it now  they won t be able to deny it once they are worked to the bone and get little pay  no healthcare  and no social security to save them from poverty once they retire  assuming they are able to retire at all featured image  drew angerer getty images
