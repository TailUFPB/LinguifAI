since taking office  donald trump has surrounded himself with white nationalists and conspiracy theorists  which has made him and even bigger threat to the nation trump has repeatedly demonstrated over the last two months that he has absolutely no idea what he is doing and that he basically does whatever his advisers tell him to do top adviser steve bannon is the de facto president who fills trump s head with falsehoods and conspiracies  contributing to the atmosphere of infighting and chaos that has gripped the white house and led to decisions that screw over the american people in favor of the racist agenda trump s minions are pursuing as we all know  trump openly accused president obama of wiretapping him after reading a conspiracy theory on breitbart  a conservative website that bannon controlled prior to joining trump s team of course  trump s accusation was baseless and he has not presented any evidence to prove his claim the fact that trump is a puppet controlled by white nationalists who are feeding him conspiracy theories to advance their cause is incredibly frightening  and it was the subject of a discussion by joy reid and her saturday morning panel on msnbc  a discussion that made it clear why trump s associates and his behavior are more dangerous than ever before reid began by pointing out that trump is listening to people like sean hannity  who literally told trump to purge anyone who may disagree with him and referred to them as  saboteurs   now trump is actually beginning to purge the government as hannity demanded former cia terrorism expert jack rice responded by saying that trump should be more worried about russia and the grip they have over his administration then the discussion turned to trump s closest advisers  who appear to be the real power in the white house  i think actually that is a very important point to make because you do have a president who is surrounded by sort of an alt state and that is bannonites   i don t know what you call them   reid said  they want this christian white nationalistic ethno state  i guess  and people like steve bannon  people like sebastian gorka  and stephen miller  there is a core of people around donald trump who want him to keep believing conspiracy theories  who want him to essentially believe president obama can wiretap him from hawaii or wherever he happens to be  national security expert malcolm nance then chimed in and frighteningly reminded everyone that trump has   nuclear weapons at his disposal and that the right conspiracy theory could make him fearful and paranoid enough to use them  we have a conspiracy theory president and i m not even sure whether you can put those three words together in a tangible sentence and use the word president   nance began   he seems to be buying every crazy idea that s out there  now  granted  the man can t seem to tell the truth about anything  this is dangerous and  as much as it sounds amusing  he controls   atomic weapons  he controls the levers of power in the united states  if he s going out with steve king and others in congress and saying that the president of the   the former president of the united states wiretapped a conversation he had a few weeks ago with the president of australia  i mean we have got a very serious problem here  here s the video via youtube if that s not enough to convince every american in this country that trump should not be president  then this country is truly f cked featured image  jim lo scalzo   pool getty images
