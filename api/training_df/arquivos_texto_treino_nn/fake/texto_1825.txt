eric trump sat down with the telegraph and things quickly went off the rails  eric  for years seen as the dumb one    blundered his way through the interview with such lack of self awareness that he wound up revealing a bunch of stuff he shouldn t have  but there is one tone deaf comment that eric trump made that you ll want to keep in the back of your mind throughout the rest of this story  when asked about his father s desire to make the white house a trump family affair  eric said  is that nepotism  absolutely  is that also a beautiful thing  absolutely  family business is a beautiful thing  a lot of ink has been spilled speculating on what trump s presidential  doctrine  is  but the answer is painfully simple  rank nepotism  paranoid and alienated  trump s only allies in washington are his own children and he s been furthering his separation from the rest of his staff by leaning on them with increasing regularity  his son in law  jared kushner has recently become the most powerful person in the country  his only qualification is getting married to ivanka unfortunately  it gets worse  donald trump isn t just placing his close family and friends in positions they have no business being in  but also allowing those inexperienced cronies the chance to influence american military operations  according to eric  his sister ivanka was actually the architect of the decision to bomb syria  until january   ivanka s career was in selling cheap jewelry made in china to fans of her father s reality tv show  she now has a seat at the table in starting a world war  confirmed that president trump s decision to bomb a syrian airbase to punish president bashar al assad for a nerve gas attack last week was influenced by the reaction of his sister ivanka  who said she was  heartbroken and outraged  by the atrocity that he was listening to his daughter and not his advisers explains why the trump white house seemed chaotic and clueless in the hours after the bombing  nobody was on the same page  trump s un ambassador and his secretary of state were issuing conflicting statements about the intent of the bombings  other staff initially bragged about destroying the airfield  trump contradicted them by saying he intentionally didn t destroy the airfield  nobody knew what was going on   except maybe ivanka  a person with no official job in the white house adding to the confusion  trump himself once praised saddam hussein for using chemical weapons on his enemies  it was jarring to watch him claim that assad s use of sarin gas was so personally offensive to him that he had to go to war  eric s confession that it was ivanka s decision fills in a lot of blanks the fact that eric would freely admit that this is how the white house is being run goes back to his observation that nepotism is  beautiful   living all his life in the shadow of his dad  it seems as though he and his siblings aren t aware of how gross this whole thing is  they are second generation silver spooners  their dad owes his success to their grandfather  they are so far removed from the real world that they ve forgotten they never earned anything and they are running the country  together featured image via alex wong getty images
