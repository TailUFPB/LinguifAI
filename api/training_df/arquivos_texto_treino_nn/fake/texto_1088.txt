as is the norm for donald trump  it s clear he did absolutely no preparation for his oval office meeting with panama president juan carlos varela  during the photo op  in an apparent struggle to find some sort of common ground  trump seemed to take credit for building the panama canal   a canal that was built about  years ago and was arranged to be given back to the panamanians during the carter administration  twitter and even varela couldn t let that slide that part of the exchange was rather short  trump  in his usual boasting fashion  said  it s our great honor to have president and mrs  varela from panama  we have many things to discuss  we re going to spend quite a bit of time today  the panama canal is doing quite well  i think we did a good job building it  varela responded with just four words   one hundred years ago  trump didn t appear to hear it  we did a very good job  but things are going well in panama  the relationship has been very strong  we are developing new things to do and only getting stronger  and our   also friendship with the president is very  very good  here s the video the canal was finished more than  years ago  in   the  year old trump had to have studied that in elementary school  right  twitter thinks so i can see why trump thinks he built the panama canal because it was built by underpaid minorities   seth goodtime   sethgoodtime  june    agree  the man has no clue  he thought pavarotti was still alive  a jackson hated the civil war and that the us alone built panama canal  wendy watts     june    have done more than any potus panama canal moon landing pyramids of giza gravity jesus yourewelcome  panamacanal pic twitter com pvszvginsq  unpresidentedaf      unpresidentedaf  june    van halen for spotlighting the panama canal back in the   otherwise  would be in much worse shape today  https   t co   colin boyd   colinpboyd  june    response to the bowling green massacre  president andrew jackson hired donald trump to build the panama canal to keep out the australians  marie connor   thistallawkgirl  june    just took credit for building the panama canal  now he s pissed off the ghost of teddy roosevelt   john fugelsang   johnfugelsang  june     great job building the panama canal using mostly foreign labor  and only   of them died   fogheart   aaroncovfefe  june    pointed out that the canal really isn t doing that well  wellactually the panama canal is seriously undersized for the cargo ships being produced today and about to be completely rebuilt  conner clark   conbonjovie  june    s latest gaffe may be factually true  the united states did build the panama canal  but it clearly demonstrates blotus s intellectual laziness  or stupidity   for contrast  here s what president obama said to varela when they met two years ago well  i just want to thank president varela and the entire team  and the people of panama  for the incredible hospitality  i had a chance earlier to visit the panama canal for the first time and saw the extraordinary progress that s being made in the new development that will be completed next year  it s really a symbol of human ingenuity  but also panama s central role in bridging the two continents and bringing the hemisphere together and i congratulated the president not only on what i m certain will be a successful summit  but also the extraordinary progress that panama has made economically  the transparency and accountability that his government has shown  panama is a proud democracy  and its ability to engage in elections and peaceful transfers of power i think is a symbol of the progress that s been made throughout the hemisphere over the last several decades and as president varela noted  we are great partners on a whole range of issues   security  the economy  education   and we had an excellent discussion about how we can further deepen those ties source  white house archivesin other words  obama did his homework and actually learned a little something about a country before meeting with its leader  trump  on the other hand  thought  panama  and pulled the one word he could think of out of his ass  that word was  canal  and for trump  it s pretty evident that that s all panama is featured image via pool getty images
