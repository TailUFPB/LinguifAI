after trump s latest twitter rant over the performance protest  or rather  polite urging of mike pence  the true big story of the day had some daylight  but not near enough  trump  who claims he never settles lawsuits  did just that on saturday when he agreed to pay   million in the trump university fraud suits  while that might seem like a bit of justice served  it was revealed on sunday that it will be the taxpayers who will pick up the bill to be fair  it s not trump s fault  it s the fault of the us tax code  which  as usual  favors the wealthy   you know  the people who can afford to pay   million in lawsuit settlements of course  the real cost to mr  trump is after tax  not before it  and most business settlements are fully tax deductible  the only part that arguably may not be here is the   million in penalties  but barring express non deductibility commitments  many penalties can be deducted  too  in general  fines and penalties paid to the government are not deductible  section  f  of the tax code prohibits deducting  any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law  despite punitive sounding names  though  some fines and penalties are considered remedial and deductible  that allows some flexibility  companies often deduct  compensatory penalties   a maneuver affirmed in a recent circuit court ruling  some defendants insist that their settlement agreement confirms that the payments are not penalties and are remedial  conversely  some government entities insist on the reverse  explicit provisions about taxes in settlement agreements are becoming more common source  forbesyes  that is tax code  but there are exceptions which the justice department can enforce  for example  credit suisse was forbidden from writing off its fine of    billion for tax evasion this all brings us back to the fact that we still don t have access to donald trump s tax returns  he doesn t pay taxes at all and in fact  one year  he reported a near billion dollar loss trump supporters paint him in a passive light  after all  it s not his fault the tax code is so easy for the wealthy to manipulate  the fact is  though  it s wealthy people like him who have been writing the tax laws for decades  that s why they are able to pay far less  as a percentage of income  than most americans if you expect this will get better with trump in office  let s hope you re not holding your breath  trump was caught just last week promising a restaurant full of wealthy people that he would be lowering their taxes  of course  he didn t need to be caught on a hot mic  analysts have already figured out that trump s tax plan will benefit the wealthy  and only the wealthy  all while putting the country deeper and deeper into debt featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
