ted cruz decided to smear present day democrats as supporters of the ku klux klan in defense of jeff sessions  and it spectacularly backfired when donald trump nominated sessions for attorney general  an uproar ensued because of sessions  racism over the course of his career as a united states attorney  sessions attempted to suppress the black vote in alabama by prosecuting three civil rights activists for helping black people vote sessions  racism is so bad that republicans rejected his nomination for a judgeship in   even coretta scott king strenuously opposed his nomination in a letter that has since resurfaced king wrote that sessions  lacks the temperament  fairness  and judgement to be a federal judge  and has  used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens  she continued by warning that sessions  would irreparably damage the work of my husband  when senator elizabeth warren attempted to read the letter on the senate floor on tuesday  republicans silenced her in defense of their racist colleague  who if confirmed  would gut the justice department and prevent it from protecting civil rights and voting rights cruz joined his colleagues in silencing warren and he defended sessions during an interview on fox news by trying to link democrats with the kkk  it s one of the crutches  when the left doesn t have any other arguments  they go and just accuse everyone of being a racist  the democrats are the party of the ku klux klan  you look at the most racist  you look at the dixiecrats  they were democrats who imposed segregation  imposed jim crow laws  who founded the klan  the klan was founded by a great many democrats  now  the democrats accuse anyone they disagree with of being a racist  that was a false smear of jeff sessions and i think he will make an extraordinary attorney general  here s the video via youtube while it s true that democrats of the past did  indeed  support the kkk  it should be noted that the dixiecrats cruz speaks of became republicans after democrats pushed for passage of the civil rights act  later on  richard nixon and ronald reagan would employ the  southern strategy  to complete the republican abandonment of abraham lincoln democrats have worked hard over the last  years to recover from their racist history  and have successfully done so by passing landmark legislation protecting voting rights and civil rights cruz is also wrong about democrats being  the party of the kkk   that claim may have worked in  or in   but it definitely won t work today  especially since the kkk formally endorsed donald trump and celebrated after trump nominated sessions in fact  sessions once said that he liked the kkk until he found out that they smoked marijuana  apparently he had no problem with their racism and hate and terrorism against black people in response  twitter users roasted cruz  morningjoe ted cruz said democrats are the kkk  the republicans have nominated kkk leaders  who represents the kkk now      tawnylinda  february    what point do people like ted cruz come up with new lines besides  soros did it  and  dems are the party of the kkk    andrew kirell   andrewkirell  february     tedcruz how do you not know the parties flipped  did you go to a  betsydevos school  did you forget the kkk endorsed your candidate   emma catherine   emmstarr  february      tedcruz says dems started kkk whom potus just removed from violent extremist watch list   their confederate flag waving voters cheer  joey toledo   joeytoledo  february     tedcruz democrats were the party of the kkk yada yada yada barack obama  oliver willis   owillis  february     ted  what was that name again of that head of the ku klux klan who endorsed  realdonaldtrump  https   t co   keith olbermann   keitholbermann  february    more featured image  flickr
