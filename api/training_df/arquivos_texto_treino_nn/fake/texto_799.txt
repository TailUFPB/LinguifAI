donald trump s white house is in chaos  and they are trying to cover it up  their russia problems are mounting by the hour  and they refuse to acknowledge that there are problems surrounding all of this  to them  it s  fake news   or a  hoax   however  the facts bear things out differently  and it seems that there are now cracks in the congressional public leadership chuck grassley  r iowa   who heads the senate judiciary committee  is fed up  he is now demanding that donald trump  jr  and former  trump campaign manager paul manafort testify before his committee regarding the now infamous shady meeting between donald trump and the shady russian lawyer who promised dirt on  democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  in fact  this information is due  well  now  this demand sends a few signals to team trump   most notably that they should not fire special counsel robert mueller under any circumstances  despite the fact that it seems that this seems to be what trump s white house is laying the groundwork  so to speak  to do as we speak here is the tweet regarding grassley s warning also  anyone who thinks that senator grassley and the rest of the senate are not serious about this only needs to look at the warning that has already been given  trump jr  and manafort will either follow orders  or be served with subpoenas that force them to comply  if they refuse  they will be held in contempt of congress  which carries with it serious jail time even the cruel  craven creatures within the gop are sick of donald trump s corruption and his scandal ridden white house  they are angry that he staged a hostile takeover of their party  first with birtherism and giving them a permanently racist label all while decimating all efforts that were made to pretend the republican party isn t a hotbed of racism  and while turning their worlds upside down  and with it  the nation  it seems that old timers like grassley  who are clearly sick of trump s bullshit  just might be the ones who could save the republic  all they need is a bit of courage featured image via win mcnamee getty images
