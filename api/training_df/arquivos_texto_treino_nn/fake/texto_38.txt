all senator john mccain wanted to achieve on the morning of monday  december  was to hit that magic milestone of three million twitter followers  a goal of which he was just  followers shy  so what was mccain s approach to gaining those new followers  simple  he would go on twitter and rely on word of mouth  how could that possibly fail we re only  twitter followers away from    spread the word   help us reach this big milestone   john mccain   senjohnmccain  december    was just one little thing senator mccain had forgotten to factor in   his significantly waning popularity since he voted for the republican tax bill  being the republican senator for arizona  some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team  but let s not forget that john mccain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only republicans that has been openly critical of president trump and this is a terrible tax bill not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than    per annum  it would also take healthcare from  million americans and raise the national debt by almost    trillion dollars over the coming decade  to add insult to injury  the  page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on friday night  with some pages crossed out and others with hand written amendments in the margins  furthermore  nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it  but that didn t sway mccain and the bill somehow managed to pass the senate update  senate republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they re now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes seriously  pic twitter com   senator dick durbin   senatordurbin  december    people had grown to believe that senator mccain wasn t too bad for a republican  but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill  one where  million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer  he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt  so when mccain put out the plea for another  followers to reach the three million mark  twitter users instead instigated a massive unfollow campaign using the hashtag  unfollowmccain  costing him hundreds of followers every minute over   people have unfollowed you since you sent this this two hours ago one reason is you because you   a man undergoing cancer treatment   voted to strip   billion dollars from the part of medicare which pays for cancer treatment  unfollowmccain https   t co   mikel jollett   mikeljollett  december    m happy to report that  senjohnmccain has lost more than   followers since i posted the below tweet  please retweet to spread the word    unfollowmccain  https   t co   jon cooper   joncoopertweets  december     i m a  no  on that  you can have all the twitter followers you want   after you prove that you care more about this country than you do about the corrupt gop   your stinking donors by voting  no  on the  goptaxscam meantime   unfollowmccain  jessica james   montaukbuzz  december    vote alone would ve made it   giving time to fight fix whatever   he s the one who so openly said  no  gaining more trust   support from dems  he blew it giving his family tax free    he also said yes to drilling in the arctic reserve   unfollowmccain  suomitytt    musiikkia  december    am so disgusted in your  goptaxscam vote  your legacy as an american hero and a maverick ended right there  denying cancer treatment for medicare medicaid patients gets you  unfollowmccain  justde      december     how bad has the  unfollowmccain campaign been for the arizona senator  well  at the time of writing this article he needed approximately another   followers to achieve his goal  probably just should have kept quiet at  and hoped for things to improve organically featured image via william thomas cain getty images
