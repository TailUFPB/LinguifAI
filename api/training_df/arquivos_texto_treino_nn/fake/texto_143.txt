can things get any worse for papa john s pizza after the nationwide fast food chain s ceo   papa  john schnatter remarked that he was angry that the nfl hadn t  nipped  in the bud a year and a half ago   he watched as he lost   million in less than  hours  no stranger to controversy  schnatter insisted that the protests were hurting sales of pizza  and he may have had at least a small point  the chain is the  official pizza of the nfl   so as the fortunes of the league go  so goes papa john s  to a certain extent of course  the internet didn t let schnatter forget that his restaurants make garbage pizza better suited for dumping  yards from a tailgate to keep seagulls away but possibly the worst of the worst happened on friday  when schnatter perhaps thought that the controversy was beginning to blow over the ultra right wing website the daily stormer   well  not the actual website  that was run underground by a series of web hosts dropping them every time they tried to move their hate to another location   posted an article praising schnatter  making papa john s not just the official pizza of the nfl  but of the  many sides  of the alt right  it happened much like the nascent modern nazi subculture appropriated new balance shoes after that company s ceo disparaged barack obama and praised donald trump  and pretty similar to the way they adopted wendy s as their official cheeseburger after someone with access to that restaurant s twitter  but apparently not a google search box  mistakenly tweeted the meme that has become the most recognizable symbol of the alt right   pepe  the frog so will this be the end of papa john s  not likely  back in   schnatter famously said he was going to cut employee hours and raise prices in retaliation for the passage of obamacare  papa john s seems to have weathered that storm well enough to maintain schnatter s multi million dollar home with the turntable driveway for parking limousines but being praised in an article that uses the phrase  negro fatigue  as the stormer article does is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouths of consumers  a worse taste  even than the pizza they serve featured image via spencer platt getty images
