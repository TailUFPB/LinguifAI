after watching their republican nominee insult nearly every minority living in america  conservatives know just how dangerous the non white vote is in this election  as minorities make up more and more of the general population  donald trump has put the republican party at an incredible disadvantage with his divisive  racist rhetoric so when fox news host bill hemmer celebrated some interesting news on tuesday  it became more obvious than ever that the gop considers the minority vote a major threat to the future of its party  fox news host bill hemmer actually said that he had  good news  in ohio  which was that more white people were voting in the state and the black share of the vote is down  at this point in the election  when democratic nominee hillary clinton is beating donald trump by a landslide  republicans are grasping at straws and desperately trying to find the silver lining in anything they possibly can  hemmer said to rnc communications director sean spicer  i m looking at early voting  you have good news in ohio  white share of the vote is up  points from four years ago  black share of the vote is down   spicer seemed just as giddy about this news  and also noted that the republican party was leading in absentee ballots  he echoed hemmer s excitement when he said   our people are coming out  you can watch this despicable exchange below  in which two white men celebrate the fact that their data shows racists having the upper hand republicans are going to be awfully disappointed at the end of this election  and november  can t come soon enough  despite what conservatives want to believe  america isn t nearly as white as it used to be  and minority voters have great power now  it could very well be that minority voters save white people from making the biggest mistake of their lives   letting trump get into the white house
