california has had a movement going for the last couple of  years that is pushing for the large  deep blue state to leave the union  this state has long been the leader of progressive policies and movements  and with the election of donald trump and his supporting regressive federal government  it is looking more and more like california just might be fed up enough to leave the united states permanently the movement is led by the yes california independence campaign  and they have been given the green light to begin collecting signatures to get on the ballot  thanks to the fact that the trump administration wants to take america back to the dark ages where people of color are more disenfranchised than ever  where lgbtq people are subjected to abuses like conversion therapy and routinely discriminated against  where women have no reproductive rights   well  let s just say the idea just got a whole hell of a lot less far fetched  it s not a stretch to believe that the majority of californians do not want to live under the tyranny of trump and pence and the gop congress the green light is a sign that this could really happen  yes california has  days to rack up   signatures to be on the ballot in time for the  election  if they get this passed via the voters  there will be another election specifically to decide whether or not california wishes to be its own country  in that instance the state would repeal the part of the state constitution that says that the united states constitution is the  supreme law of the land    as well as law codifying california as an  inseparable part of the united states  on the one hand  this sounds like some kind of liberal utopia  and if it were to happen  i d personally be there in a heartbeat  on the other hand  the remaining parts of the united states would be subjected to christofascist gop rule for the rest of eternity  because california is a key state when it comes to delivering democratic victories in presidential races  with its  electoral votes  further  it could lead to a brexit like breakdown of the united states  which could spell trouble for democracy at large  with the break up of countries like the united states and alliances like the european union  this could be a world destabilizing force either way  it could be interesting to watch  and one must wonder how a huge state like california  which has the world s sixth largest economy  would be stopped from leaving the gop infested hellhole that trump and pence are sure to turn america into in short order featured image via ktla
