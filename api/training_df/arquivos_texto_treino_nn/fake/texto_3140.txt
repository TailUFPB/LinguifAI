well  it s happening  if you  voted your conscience  or  refused to support a criminal  who is not an actual criminal  voted for jill stein if you just couldn t handle a hillary clinton presidency because reasons  cast  protest votes for donald trump  or   against his wishes   bernie sanders  you now get to say that you own a piece of history  that s right  for the low  low price of your dignity  you managed to buy yourself a donald trump presidency   the one where healthcare is stripped from the most vulnerable americans  and women s health services go the way of slavery  except if   of donald trump voters had their way  slavery would make a comeback  in the end  while hillary clinton took a historic  almost three million vote lead over trump  it all came down to about   votes in three states    in pennsylvania    in wisconsin  and   in michigan  to put it in perspective for  conscience voters   quadrennial fake liberal hero  jill stein  earned herself   in pennsylvania    in wisconsin  and   in michigan stein and supporters said repeatedly that their goal was to defeat hillary clinton  and they did   all while helping donald trump win  now the causes they  like many of the rest of us  champion  are in danger on thursday  the gop announced the beginning of what will almost assuredly be a glorious  thousand year reich  when they laid out their plans to gut obamacare and defund planned parenthood in the same bill  the hill reports that the situation is exactly as bad as was predicted by those  establishment stooges  who had the gall to vote for the woman who had the best chance to defeat donald trump  rather than sling diapers at the wall for almost a year and join in the propagation of untrue right wing propaganda speaker paul ryan  r wis   said thursday that defunding planned parenthood will be included as part of a bill to repeal obamacare ryan said cutting off federal funds to the organization will be included in a  reconciliation  bill that also repeals the core of obamacare  the reconciliation process prevents democrats from launching a filibuster against the measure  meaning republicans won t need  votes to win on defunding  planned parenthood legislation will be in our reconciliation bill   ryan said  without providing any more details currently  republicans would be hard pressed to lay out any actual plan to replace obamacare   because there isn t one  but that isn t stopping them from undoing the good work of barack obama s administration  their goal over the next four years will not be to help you or anyone else  their goal will be the same as it was when obama was first elected   to erase the legacy of our first african american president  and to undo any good that he has done  isn t that  after all  the true meaning of  make america great again  the worst part is that if we  the people who are supposed to be the adults in the room  had simply united behind the most qualified candidate  we could have prevented this featured image by scott olson via getty images
