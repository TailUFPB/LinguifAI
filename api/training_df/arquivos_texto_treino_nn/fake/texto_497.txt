donald trump is very afraid of special counsel robert mueller  it has been reported repeatedly that he is completely obsessed with the russia investigation  and it seems that he is right to be  according to a new report in the daily beast  mueller has built what they are calling an  army  of lawyers to investigate just what went on with russia s interference into the  presidential election  and especially into any collusion between the trump campaign and russian government officials the new report says that mueller s team now includes  heavy hitting attorneys  and they have space deep inside one of the most secret locations in washington  and the space includes a sensitive compartmented information facility  schif   which is the name for places no laymen and laywomen like us will ever see the inside of  the secrets kept in there are pretty much in a tomb  until those privy to them see fit to release them  on top of all of that  it seems that mueller has pulled together what the daily beast is calling his own  miniature justice department  the daily beast assembled a list of the names on mueller s team  and their resumes are nothing short of stellar  only one has never worked as a federal prosecutor  but he is a top notch lawyer in his own right and is surely useful  you can read the lengthy accomplishments of these attorneys here in short   trump is right to be scared out of his mind  it also bears noting that sometime ago now  mueller actually convened his own grand jury   which means he has enough to believe he will stumble upon something that will warrant criminal indictments  further  this team of lawyers has broad authority to subpoena anyone and everyone in trump s orbit and force them to testify under oath  also  remember   even if they aren t under oath  lying to government officials is still a crime  so these people better start learning to tell the truth unless they want to face some serious jail time come on  special counsel mueller  we re rooting for you  with any luck  everyone in trump s white house will be thrown out of office and in jail before the  midterms featured image via ann heisenfelt getty images
