trump and his allies expect us to dismiss the  page dossier that details donald trump and his team s ties to the russian government  but a lot of crazy stuff keeps happening that makes it impossible when it was just former  agent and author of the report christopher steele  who is in hiding to protect himself from both trump and putin s goons  saying that president asterisk s closet is overflowing with skeletons  and russian hooker urine  it was one thing  but the existence of audio and even video of trump engaging in incriminating acts was confirmed by at least four sources  including one in the american intelligence community  israeli intelligence officials have also been warned about sharing intel with trump s administration for fear that it will be leaked to vladimir putin  and then there s the little matter of what happened to a gentleman who helped steele compile his incriminating yet not entirely verified report oleg erovinkin was a former general in the kgb and the fsb  he is suspected of feeding information to steele  and he was found dead in his car on boxing day  russian state run media initially reported that foul play was involved when  erovinkin s body was  found in a black lexus   a large scale investigation has been commenced in the area  erovinkin s body was sent to the fsb morgue   since then  the cause of death has been downgraded to  heart attack   the telegraph reports erovinkin was a key aide to igor sechin  a former deputy prime minister and now head of rosneft  the state owned oil company  who is repeatedly named in the dossier erovinkin has been described as a key liaison between sechin and russian president vladimir putin  mr steele writes in an intelligence report dated july     he has a source close to sechin  who had disclosed alleged links between mr trump s supporters and moscow the death of erovinkin has prompted speculation it is linked to mr steele s explosive dossier  which was made public earlier this month  mr trump has dismissed the dossier as  fake news  and no evidence has emerged to support its lurid claims the russian state run ria novosti news agency reported erovinkin s body was  found in a black lexus   a large scale investigation has been commenced in the area  erovinkin s body was sent to the fsb morgue  no cause of death has been confirmed and the fsb continues to investigate  media reports suggested his death was a result of foul play it was later claimed he died of a heart attack   christo grozev  an expert on russia related security threats  believes erovinkin is the key source to whom mr steele refers in his dossier  insiders have described erovinkin to me alternately as  sechin s treasurer  and  the go between between putin and sechin   one thing that everyone seems to agree    both in public and private sources   is that erovinkin was sechin s closest associate  grozev says  i have no doubt that at the time erovinkin died  mr putin had mr steele s trump dossier on his desk  he would   arguably   have known whether the alleged  story is based on fact or fiction  whichever is true  he would have had a motive to seek    and find the mole   he adds   he would have had to conclude that erovinkin was at least a person of interest  at this point  it will be difficult for our own intelligence agencies to get to the bottom of this situation  recently  for example  trump decided to retain james comey   yes  the guy who interfered in the election on his behalf   as the head of the fbi  the donald also has the power to fire comey if the ongoing investigation is not positive for trump  at around the same time as the announcement  the bureau cleared michael flynn of any wrongdoing in his numerous  suspicious calls to the russian ambassador our country is in a bad place and we need more information to correctly determine what is going on with any of this   information the current administration and his despotic allies will go to any lengths to hide was erovinkin murdered because of his knowledge of information that could greatly hurt trump and his bff putin  maybe  maybe not  putin is exactly the sort of person who has been known to leave a trail of dead journalists in his wake for reporting too much  it s not outside the realm of possibility that he had a former kgb agent murdered for knowing too much featured image via getty images  drew angerer  twitter
