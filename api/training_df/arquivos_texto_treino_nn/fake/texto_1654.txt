late night host seth meyers regularly has a high old time making fun of the incompetence of donald trump and his administration during his  a closer look  monologues  on thursday night  the subject was trump s complete position change on the north american free trade agreement  nafta   during the campaign  trump had repeatedly called nafta a  disaster   but all it took was a couple of phone calls from canadian prime minister justin trudeau and mexican president enrique pena nieto to get trump to decide that the trade deal wasn t so bad after all meyers made fun of the whole thing by returning to his jokes prior to trump s election  saying many of them are now reality  starting with  if we elect trump we re going to end up fighting with canada  ha  thanks to trump s earlier threats to rip up nafta  canada s  softwood lumber  exports became a hot topic  this was a golden opportunity for meyers  who insisted there would be no jokes about male anatomy  but then he proceeded to make them anyway  saying  i m just saying that donald trump does not want to be slapped with soft canadian wood so he s clamping down on it  meyers then went all in on the idea that canada is deliberately axing prices of soft lumber   a process he referred to as  stumpage   he continued  this is all very confusing for trump because  stumpage  is his nickname for donald jr  as for the overall defeat of trump s nafta termination promise  that was the best joke of all  when meyers ended with a total zinger  something tells me this isn t the first time trump has had to pull out because of soft wood  haha  probably not  then again  that s why he and all of those other old gop men insist that health insurance always includes viagra coverage watch the mockery below featured image via video screen capture
