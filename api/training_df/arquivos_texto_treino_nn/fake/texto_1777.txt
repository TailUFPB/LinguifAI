we all remember how  in february  time magazine ran a cover with the face of stephen k  bannon  trump s chief strategist  on it instead of the face of trump himself  of course  trump s massive ego doesn t allow one iota of attention to go to anyone else  so this definitely got under his skin  however  that was a long time ago  and one would think that trump is over that little irritation  right  wrong  new reporting suggests that here we are in april  months after time ran the bannon cover  and trump is still irritated over it the hill reports that a new york times cover says the following of how trump feels about the bannon cover  and his employees in general getting more attention than he does  mr  trump remains annoyed by a february cover of time magazine labeling mr  bannon  the great manipulator   telling one visitor this month   that doesn t just happen    a favored trump expression for anger at subordinates who tend to their interests ahead of his  it probably doesn t help that this particular issue of time definitely added fuel to the fire on the  president bannon  meme  which suggests that it is really steve bannon who is pulling the strings in the west wing  and that trump is just a puppet  this may have been true at the time  however  bannon s power and influence in the west wing has been greatly diminished as of late  he may even be on his way out of the white house altogether  here is the cover that has gotten under trump s oh so thin skin time s new cover  how steve bannon became the second most powerful man in the world https   t co  pic twitter com   time   time  february    trump is indeed still seething about the bannon cover and the  president bannon  narrative  indeed this is good for the country  as petty as it is  after all  anything that hastens the exit of the head white supremacist from the white house should be a ok with any reasonable american citizen featured image via mario tama getty images
