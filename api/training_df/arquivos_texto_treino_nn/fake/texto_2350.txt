while some have donald trump critics have claimed that the unworthy potus  address to congress may have actually saved his epically failing presidency and have commented that trump actually looked presidential for once  liberal documentary filmmaker michael moore had an entirely different opinion in an appearance on msnbc  moore tore into trump and pointed out why no one should be impressed with the disgusting trick trump pulled on america  commenting on the moment in which trump gave a salute to fallen navy seal william  ryan  owens  moore mocked trump and said  my ratings  record applause  i m going to get an emmy for this  most applause for a dead soldier on my watch  the sickness of this man that moment received a standing ovation  but moore was less than impressed  moore accused trump of inviting owens  wife  widow carryn owens  to be present at the address so he could  use  her as a prop to distract from the fact that the mission that got owens killed was   trump s fault and was a massive failure  moore said  that s why she s there  as sort of an  f you  to the people who are criticizing him for this  and this poor woman  this widow who has lost her husband  she is in desperate grief right now to use that to put another notch on his belt   and what is he thinking about  the filmmaker also trashed trump for his complete lack of empathy  to a malignant narcissist you re not ever thinking that you re insulting anybody because it s all about you  that would require empathy  you can watch moore put trump on blast below while a cnn orc poll stated that  percent of participants thought that trump s speech was positive  no one can argue that moore has a point here  trump will do anything and exploit anyone to detract from his f ck ups  and he doesn t care how distasteful it is featured image via theo wargo and joe raedle  getty images
