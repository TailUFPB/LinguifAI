to hear donald trump tell it  he s the best  hugest  biggest boss there has ever been and the way he runs his businesses  if you ignore the multiple bankruptcies and closures  means the people who work for him should be overwhelmingly proud to be under his leadership but reuters has done some number crunching on what kind of financial support the people who work in his businesses have shown to his presidential campaign  and as he would say  it s very  sad  only a dozen of an estimated   people employed at trump s companies have donated more than   to the celebrity businessman s bid for the u s  presidency  a reuters review of federal campaign finance records through august shows  those who gave less to either trump s campaign or his joint fundraising committees would not have shown up in the review the contributors  including an office cleaner  a golf course groundskeeper  a bartender and an attorney  have given    to trump s campaign  a fraction of the   million trump s political operation has received from donors and joint fundraisers the news service also points out that an employee at the trump companies even has donated to secretary hillary clinton  his electoral rival and the current front runner in the presidential contest by comparison  in  people who had worked alongside republican presidential nominee mitt romney had donated    million both directly to his campaign and to the super pac supporting his campaign secretary clinton has also received donations from employees at the u s  state department  which she headed from  to  trump has continually lagged behind clinton in fundraising during the election  a disparity which has shown up in underfunded campaign operations in many of the key swing states and a severe lack of television advertising  trump claimed he would self fund his campaign  but while he has donated to the enterprise  it hasn t been a significant fraction of the  billions  trump claims to possess  a figure which cannot be independently verified because trump won t release his tax returns featured image via flickr
