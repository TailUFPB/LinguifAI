after being fired from the trump campaign  trump s former campaign manager corey lewandowski is still spreading hate on behalf of his former boss  this time  when asked about why trump had virtually no african americans at a rally where he was talking about african americans  lewandowski answered that it would be too dangerous to have african americans in the crowd  as a campaign manager  wouldn t you want your candidate saying some of these things directly to the people he s supposedly addressing   anderson cooper asked  you know what s amazing to me  is no one remembers donald trump went to go have a rally in chicago at the university   responded lewandoski  and do you remember what happened  it was so chaotic  and it was so out of control  secret service and the chicago police department told him you could not get in and out of that facility safely  and that rally was canceled  and you showed the footage many times of the individuals who attended that rally  donald trump had that rally booked   lewandowski said  that is a black community  he went to the heart of chicago to go and give a speech to the university of chicago in a campus  which is predominantly african american  to make that argument  and you know what happened  the campus was overrun  and it was not a safe environment   he said source  the hillthe rally lewandowski was speaking of occurred in chicago in march   or rather  it didn t occur in chicago in march because it was shut down over protests  the largely african american protesters objected to the violence that has been occurring at trump rallies  but i guess it s okay if white people are violent here s the video trump  who has a zero percent approval rating with african americans  is trying to appear less racist  lewandowski isn t helping  but to be fair  neither is trump  his african american outreach has been nothing but empty  insulting attempts at pandering  it was trump  not lewandowski  who appeared on bill o reilly to say that he d give chicago police carte blanche to do whatever it takes to stop black crime perhaps trump should focus on the crimes that are taking place right under his nose  whether that be the violence at his rallies or the alleged crimes taking place right in his offices featured image via video screen capture
