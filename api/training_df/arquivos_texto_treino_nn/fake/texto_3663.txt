do you remember trump s first meltdown week  it was late july  after the democratic national convention  and as the election drew closer it seemed to many people as if donald trump might be approaching a mental breakdown  it wasn t the final meltdown of the campaign  and doubtless the next four years will prove a harsher test of the donald s sanity  yet it did result in some startling moments of honesty as trump  in the grip of strong emotion  let some things slip that perhaps he shouldn t have take july   for example  he was speaking in denver  colorado when he said the following we have stupid people representing us  stupid  stupid people  so  here s what s going to happen  we are going to build  and bring  our best  look   we have the greatest business people in the world  better than anyplace else  we don t use them  we use political hacks  some of these business people are not nice people  who cares  do you care  i don t think so  some of these people are vicious  horrible  miserable human beings  who cares  who cares  some of these people   they don t sleep at night  they twist  and turn  and sweat  and their mattress is soaking wet  because they re thinking all night about victory the next day against some poor person that doesn t have a chance  and these people   unfortunately  i know them all   these people would love to represent us against china  against japan  against all of these countries   mexico  where they re killing us at the border  and they re killing us in trade for the record  i am not making the case he is projecting or speaking indirectly  despite his attempted qualifier   unfortunately  i know them all   it seems pretty clear that he is directly referring to himself think about it  he is clearly stating  we can all agree here  that we should pick this class of  best business people in the world  to run things  instead of politicians and public servants  furthermore  he has selected himself  by running  as the epitome of what american leadership should be so he s talking about himself  drain the swamp  he s the fucking swamp monster he describes himself as  not nice  and a  vicious  horrible  miserable human being  who  twist  turns  and sweats  rather than sleeping  that explains the  a m  twitter temper tantrums  i suppose he describes himself as staying up all night to figure out how to screw over poor people  i will grant it s not clear whether he means this in a pitiful sense or economically if you doubt the words as i have recorded them  think that i am taking him out of context in an unfair way  or really want to punish yourself  you can watch him speak below  the reported remarks start around    h t  nettildn for pointing this out on twitter featured image via screencapture from embedded video
