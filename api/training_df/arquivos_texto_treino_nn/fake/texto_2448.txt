right wing provocateur  neo nazi  all around douchebag and breitbart news editor milo yiannopoulos is finally getting his comeuppance for being a terrible human being  it seems that even the internet hellhole of misogynists  anti semites  racists  white supremacists  and other assorted bigots that is breitbart has had enough of milo since he came under fire for videos in which he openly defended pederasty  these revelations got him banned from speaking at the conservative political action conference  cpac   and now it seems that they may even cost him his job the hill is reporting that milo s fellow employees at breitbart are disgusted by his remarks  and a fair number of them are threatening to leave the company if milo isn t given his walking papers  an unnamed senior editor leaked to the washingtonian that milo has been a problem for some time now  and that this is the straw that breaks the camel s back for  at least half a dozen  breitbart employees  the fact of the matter is that there s been so many things that have been objectionable about milo over the last couple of years  quite frankly  this is something far more sinister  if the company isn t willing to act  there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it  talking abut young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys  relationships with older men i m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words  what right thinking person doesn t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that  granted  considering the filth that is printed at breitbart and the types of people who frequent the place  this reaction to milo s defense of the indefensible here is hardly something that redeems them  but  at the end of the day  if milo is shunned from polite society and has all of his platforms taken away  it s better for society as a whole  if he s too much for breitbart  chances are he s too much for any other outlet or news network as well update  it is also being reported that simon   schuster will not be publishing milo s book  dangerous simon   schuster is canceling the publication of  dangerous  by milo yiannopoulos  after careful consideration   full story coming soon   publishers weekly   publisherswkly  february    is the statement from the publisher statement  after careful consideration  simonschuster and its  thresholdbooks have cancelled publication of dangerous by milo yiannopoulos     adam rothberg      adamrothberg  february    image via drew angerer getty images
