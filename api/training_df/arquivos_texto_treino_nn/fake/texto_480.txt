for republicans  the robert mueller investigation into donald trump s russian ties is a very inconvenient truth  if trump is found guilty  there s little doubt that many others in the party would be dragged down with him  it s also putting a big damper on the republican agenda to screw the poor and the middle class while giving big bonuses to trump and those in his tax bracket  whatever that is   now there s a bill in congress to shut the whole thing down and it can be done  legally rep  ron desantis  r fla   has introduced a bill that would financially starve the investigation by cutting off funding after six months and would limit its scope to nothing prior to june    which was when trump decided to run for president according to a washington post report  trump has been seeking business opportunities in russia for three decades  it began in   when he explored the options of opening a hotel in moscow  he found it rather inconvenient  because everything is owned by the government while russia was under communist rule almost  years later  in   trump announced that he was going to invest   million in buildings in moscow  those deals didn t pan out  but he was given a lot of trademarks that year in   trump further expressed interest in building in moscow  saying   it s ridiculous that i wouldn t be investing in russia   he said   russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment    we will be in moscow at some point  in   donnie jr  admitted that the trumps have all kinds of money tied up in russia  in terms of high end product influx into the us   he says   russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross section of a lot of our assets   we see a lot of money pouring in from russia  in   while planning the miss universe pageant in moscow  trump tweeted about putin becoming his  best friend  do you think putin will be going to the miss universe pageant in november in moscow   if so  will he become my new best friend   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    that year  he also continued his talk about doing more business in russia cutting the investigation off at  isn t a guarantee that trump will get away with it  there have been numerous meetings between russian officials and trump officials since then mueller  though  is going broad  he s going after money laundering and all of trump s business ties and he s probably going back years  desantis sits on the foreign affairs committee and the committee on the judiciary  it s very possible that he has some insight into the scope of mueller s investigation and he knows that if he prevents him from looking at anything pre   trump may have cleaned up his act  at least on paper the provision  which is part of a government spending package may never see a vote  but if enough republicans see this as a way out of the mess  it could featured image via win mcnamee getty images
