trump hasn t made the economy better  no matter what he and his sheeple claim  in discussing jobs on trump s tv network  trump lackey kayleigh mcenany acted as though trump s  million jobs mark is some kind of record  when in fact  he lags behind obama s final six months  and a bunch of other six month periods during the obama era obama s economy added   million jobs in his final six months  trump s economy has added   million in his first six months  that s an average of   per month for obama vs    per month for trump  this graph shows no evidence of a  trump bump  image via the washington posttrump is having fun pretending he s the best president ever  though  while he hasn t managed to get any major economic policies through congress and signed into law  no infrastructure packages  no tax reform  no new or better trade deals  nothing  all he s done is use executive orders to eliminate some regulations  that s not enough to cause the economic surge he and his lackeys keep insisting is happening  he is so not  making america great again  in terms of jobs  we are currently feeling the continuing effects of the obama economy trump has focused on the manufacturing and mining industries to the detriment of others  such as agriculture  when he pulled us out of the trans pacific partnership  manufacturers cheered  while agriculture sat and stared in horror  we re responsible for an awful lot of agricultural exports to asia  and with tpp gone  the rest of the world is stepping in to fill the void with lower tariffs and other incentives our agricultural industry lost a potential   billion bump in productivity because of trump  and we lost competitive advantages over europe and australia  a four country bloc here in the americas mexico  peru  chile and colombia is becoming the trade leader here and is working on deals with new zealand  singapore and australia  because fuck us they have no reason not to with trump at the helm here  trump has zero understanding of the economy and doesn t seem to know or care that his job numbers could very easily be a sign of a slowing economy  not one gaining speed  nor does he seem to know or care that obama actually did much better during his second term  from february  to july   our economy added   million jobs  for that same period in   we added   million jobs  and for those same six months in   we added   million jobs during that period in   we added   million jobs  that was the first full six months of obama s second term and trump has only managed to add    which  as shown above  is lower than obama s   for his final six months  so trump inherited a possibly slowing economy  which has only slowed more under his and the republicans  leadership  if  indeed  it can even be called that   for the five hundred millionth time  trump sheeple  trump has not turned the economy around  not even close read more featured image via zach gibson   pool getty images
