the first reason the white house gave for president donald trump s firing of former fbi director james comey was that the president had received a recommendation from deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  this excuse was bolstered by the memo rosentein had given that was critical of comey  though it did not explicitly call for the president to fire comey for his part  rosenstein was not happy that the actions trump took around comey were blamed on that memo  rosenstein has already demanded the white house correct the record about this  as a consequence  trump himself told lester holt that the decision to fire comey was all his  by all accounts  rosenstein is a man of integrity  according to the wall street journal  mr  rosenstein left the impression that he couldn t work in an environment where facts weren t accurately reported  the deputy attorney general objected to statements by white house aides citing mr  rosenstein s critical assessment of mr comey s job performance to justify the firing  if that is true  there is no way rosenstein is going to have a long tenure in the trump department of justice  not only does this administration have a hard time telling the truth  they have hard time knowing what the truth is  this week alone  they claimed rosenstein convinced the president that comey should be fired  that trump wanted comey gone because of how badly he treated hillary clinton and that comey told trump that he wasn t under investigation  the only one of these three statements that even has a chance of being credible is the first  and it has been shot down this all comes after months and months of lies and misstatements  the new york times put together a list of all of the tweets trump has put out since he entered the white house  the number of lies that he has told just through that medium is staggering rosenstein has a serious decision to make  how seriously does he want to be taken  how much of his reputation is he willing to sacrifice  the chances seem good that he will have to bring on a special prosecutor to look into the russia trump campaign link  that is one way to salvage his reputation  that may lead to his firing  whether he quits or is fired  his days in this administration are numbered featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
