the effects of a donald trump presidency are already starting to take shape  we ve been hearing of incidents of racism all over the country where people feel trump s win gives them the right to be as racist and violent as they want another thing to remember is everything trump promised during the election  one of those things was a ban on muslims entering the country the daily show s hasan minaj takes that threat of a ban very seriously  because he and his family are muslim  and his mother is currently out of the country while speaking to host trevor noah  minaj broke character from a correspondent and takes on the role of himself as a concerned citizen  he looked straight into the camera  and said  this is a true story  my mom is out of the country right now  she s visiting my grandma  and she s a u s  citizen  she s lived here thirty years  she s on the phone with me last night  and she s like   hasan  i don t know if i can come back until february  am i going to be able to get back into the country   and the fact that i can t tell her  yes  with one hundred percent certainty  is heartbreaking  and there are a lot of people telling me   hey man  don t worry  trump s not really gonna ban all muslims   but i don t know  man  that is my mom  and i need her back home  because i love her then adding some levity to the very serious situation  he says   and she owes me three hundred dollars  minaj looked genuinely concerned for his family  and that is terribly heartbreaking that he even remotely has to be fearful of a trump ban on muslims  that can t be the america we live in watch him speak about his very valid concern here trump s victory hits  hasanminhaj close to home  https   t co szjgxsonor pic twitter com   the daily show   thedailyshow  november    image via video screen capture
