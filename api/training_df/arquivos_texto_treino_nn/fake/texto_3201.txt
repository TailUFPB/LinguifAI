donald trump s strained relationship with the media has been nothing but problematic from the start  the president elect has openly attacked the press countless times  threatened to sue  and even expressed the desire to restrict the media s freedom to report facts that paint him in a negative light this has raised several concerns about what trump s presidency is actually going to look like when it comes to reporting and keeping americans informed  recently  three former white house press secretaries came forward with warnings about what trump s disdain for the media might turn into during a panel conversation on nbc s meet the press in speaking to host chuck todd  joe lockhart   who was white house press secretary under president bill clinton   likened trump s lies and misinformation to the behavior seen during president richard nixon  calling trump out for his habit of literally just making things up  lockhart said  it s somewhat orwellian  which  you know  you redefine the past  which means you can define the present and the future  and that s going to be very difficult for both sides to come to grips with  president george w  bush s communications director  nicolle wallace  also remarked on the fact that  while trump has a clear hatred for the press  his ego still needs it  like an addict craves their drugs   she said  i think we re staring at trees and missing the forest  we ve just elected a man who bullies female reporters at his rally as an applause line  we have just elected a man who started a hot war with a female anchor instead of attending a debate she moderated  we are in a new place  and i don t think it s good  and i don t think it has any parallels to the past  ari fleischer  a former white house press secretary for bush  also stated that the hard feelings are on both sides  and called the tension between trump and the media a  double barreled hostility   fleischer said  he can use it to his advantage  because as the gallup poll recently indicated  confidence in the press to report the news accurately and fairly has never been lower  and so the press has made itself vulnerable  because it lost the trust of their readers and their viewers   and trump has widely taken advantage of it  trump s relations with the press are unprecedented  and trump has worked hard throughout his presidential campaign to create distrust for the press because it enables him to continue telling lies and makes it harder for him to be held accountable  trump knows exactly what he s doing  and his presidency is going to be extremely damaging when it comes to how americans are kept informed featured image via zach gibson via getty images
