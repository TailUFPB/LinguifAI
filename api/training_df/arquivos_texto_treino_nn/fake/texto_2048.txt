devin nunes  the chairman of the house intelligence committee and in charge of the investigation into whether russia influenced our election  says he has information that members of trump s transition team were  in fact  sort of but not really under surveillance after the election  he also reiterated that he doesn t believe trump tower was actually tapped  making his statements to the press confusing and conflicting but the kicker here isn t the conflicting statements  it s that nunes shared this information with the white house before he shared it with the rest of the intelligence committee   specifically  the democrats  thus proving that he s way too biased and partisan to conduct a truly credible investigation it seems that the democratic members of the committee actually learned of all of this via the media this afternoon  in fact  rep  adam schiff  the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee  said the following about it today  chairman nunes shared information with wh still withheld from our committee  he cannot conduct a credible investigation this way  pic twitter com   adam schiff   repadamschiff  march    information that nunes gave to reporters earlier today is extremely important  way too important to withhold from the rest of the committee like this  here s what he told white house reporters  first  i recently confirmed that on numerous occasions  the intelligence community collected information about u s  citizens involved in the trump transition  details about u s  persons associated with the incoming administration  details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value were widely disseminated intelligence community reporting i have confirmed that additional names of trump transition team members were unmasked fourth and finally  i want to be clear  none of this surveillance was related to russia or the investigation of russian activities or of the trump team what i ve read bothers me and i think it should bother the president himself and his team because i think some of it seems to be inappropriate  oddly enough  nunes also said that he believes that this information was incidentally collected  and that members of the transition team were not specific targets of surveillance  he also believes that the information was collected legally  and disputed again trump s claim that obama tapped his phones at trump tower  no  no  no  that did not happen  i have said this for many  many weeks  the fact that nunes decided to go running to trump with this information  instead of briefing the rest of the committee as he should have done  suggests he s incredibly partial to trump  he s still working on the assumption that who leaked info is more important than whether a foreign power just installed a puppet government here  undermining our democracy in one of the worst ways  this is just ridiculous   we need this turned over to an independent panel  we can t trust nunes to either get his info straight or to behave in as impartial a manner as possible featured image by mark wilson via getty images
