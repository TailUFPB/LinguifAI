this proves that republicans never care about the struggles americans face until they go through it themselves donald trump is continuing to push republicans to pass his trumpcare bill to repeal the affordable care act  which would strip healthcare from millions of americans and end protections that help people with pre existing conditions get access to affordable health insurance republicans have been whining about what is also known as obamacare for a long time now  they even demonized the landmark healthcare law so much that they ran campaigns on it  that includes david jolly  who ran an anti obamacare campaign in florida back in  for a house seat jolly has since lost his seat in congress  but he is singing a much different tune about the affordable care act now you see  jolly became unemployed after losing his re election bid  and to top it all off  he has a pre existing condition that would have made getting insurance much harder had it not been for the protections provided by obamacare  the very same law that jolly opposed during an appearance on msnbc on monday night  jolly revealed that he has a pre existing condition and went to say that he now supports obamacare and does not want it to be repealed because doing so would put millions of americans at serious risk  on january   i was a former member of congress   unemployed with no health insurance   jolly explained   and a pre existing condition  and while i ultimately chose a private sector plan  i also knew in  that obamacare provided an exchange that was a safety net that wasn t there before   jolly continued   if i had to rely on it  i knew it was there  jolly went to say that the politics of obamacare are different today than they were in  when he ran for congress out of anger towards obamacare  but he now realizes that obamacare provides protections and options for people who need a safety net here s the video via youtube  jolly s relevant remarks are at the   mark  million americans would lose their healthcare coverage if republicans pass trump s healthcare bill  republicans in congress  meanwhile  get to keep their taxpayer funded health insurance  that s not right the trumpcare bill is cruel  it destroys healthcare for the poor just so the wealthy can get a major tax cut  it should not only end the political careers of any republican who votes for it  it should put them behind bars  people will die because of this bill  and when that happens  every republican who voted for it should be charged with murder featured image  screenshot
