donald trump has been caught buying    worth of his own books and he paid this hefty bill with money from campaign donations  which is flat out illegal if he gets any royalties from the sales as reported by the daily beast  on may   the trump campaign paid barnes   noble     according to a filing with the federal election commission  that amounts to more than   copies of the hardcover version of crippled america  how to make america great again  or just over   copies of the renamed paperback release  great again  how to fix our crippled america  according to a spokesperson for trump  these books were purchased for gift bags given to delegates at the republican national convention  indeed  delegates did each receive a copy of crippled america along with miscellaneous make america great again gear and a plastic fetus  all neatly stuffed into tote bags bearing the same trademark slogan but here is where the problem lies  under federal elections committee rules  trump cannot legally be paid royalties on the books bought by the campaign  paul ryan  not the one you are thinking of   from the nonpartisan nonprofit campaign legal center  explains  it s fine for a candidate s book to be purchased by his committee  but it s impermissible to receive royalties from the publisher   ryan said   that amounts to an illegal conversion of campaign funds to personal use  there s a well established precedent from the fec that funds from the campaign account can t end up in your own pocket  neither the trump campaign nor the book s publisher  simon   schuster  has been willing to comment  regardless  federal campaign law clearly states that campaign spending cannot  result in the conversion of campaign funds to the personal use of the candidate or any other person  it may be the case for a candidate to instead donate those royalties to charity that might be a permissible arrangement   said the clc s ryan   but the bottom line is  no money of this    from the book can end up in donald trump s pocket without violating federal law  it isn t exactly unusual for celebrities or politicians to buy copies of their own books  or to give them away  however  ben bruton  who has spent the past  years working in publishing public relations  the circumstances surrounding trump s purchase is suspicious  what any author that i know would most likely do is go to the publisher and say   i want a bunch of these in the goody bag    come to the publisher and say he needed books for a charity or an event  and we would donate  all the time  and we ll sell more to you at a  percent discount   said bruton  the red flag  i think  would be that they re trying to get back on the times best sellers list  or they re trying to buy them at retail for royalties  if trump s books were bought at a brick and mortar store like barnes and noble  then they will count towards best seller lists  i ve worked at four different of the major six publishing houses and a lot of times people want to buy a bunch of books to get on the list  you can t do it from amazon  you can t buy them from the publisher   said bruton   only buying from place likes barnes   noble at full price is looked at as sales  bruton added that at least the times list is aware of the possibility of authors buying their way to the top with bulk sales and has penalties in place to prevent this  that s how the times keeps that sort of in check  so you can t just buy your way onto the best sellers list   he said  however  i do believe that was definitely an attempt to both make money and to get onto the best seller list   bruton added featured image via spencer platt getty images
