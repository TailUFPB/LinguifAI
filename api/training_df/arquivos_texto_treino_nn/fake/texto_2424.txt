remember when republicans wasted millions of dollars over two years investigating benghazi  voters definitely remember republicans repeatedly and constantly used the benghazi attacks of  to persecute president obama and hillary clinton  the witch hunt surpassed the length of the   investigation  and the house select committee on benghazi alone cost nearly   million of taxpayer money overall  ten committees were involved in those investigations  which means the amount spent by congress is even higher  and they forced the state department and defense department to spend and additional   million to defend themselves in the end  republicans found no evidence of wrongdoing by hillary clinton in contrast  republicans have been refusing to investigate donald trump s ties with russia  that scandal has continued to escalate ever since mike flynn resigned as national security adviser over his negotiations to ease sanctions with russia prior to trump taking office  and lying about it trump s dubious relationship with russia goes back to the campaign  when he specifically asked russian hackers to keep attacking hillary  many in trump s inner circle have connections to russia  and trump s campaign adopted policies favorable to putin  including less support for nato and dropping sanctions placed on russia for invading ukraine  because of russian interference in our election process  trump was installed in the white house as putin s puppet  and our national security has been threatened ever since but republicans don t feel like investigating because they know trump would be exposed  so when arkansas rep  steve womack held a town hall on tuesday  he ran into a buzzsaw as his constituents called out his hypocrisy womack told the crowd that russia is an  existential threat  to america  and that he opposes the deals trump is making with putin  but he got massively booed after he suggested trump is only friendly with russia because democrats have been blocking his cabinet nominees  at the end of the day  you and i agree that russia is a threat  and i believe that once we get the president with his people assembled around him  he will better recognize that russia is part of the problem   womack said when asked if he would support an investigation of trump s ties with russia  womack refused and used the excuse that such investigations would reveal classified information  you guys just want to investigate everybody   womack said to more boos and jeers it s even more insulting since republicans literally tried to investigate every little thing that went wrong under president obama  you guys wasted a lot of money on benghazi  waste a little on trump   one constituent demanded afterwards  womack referred to his constituents as an  angry mob   and suggested they acted like children for demanding he do his damn job  i m sorry to the community that it became somewhat one sided and not necessarily a lynch mob  but at least an angry mob that was just not going to be happy with anything i said  and it took away from the ability for us to have what i believe we need to have  and that s a good  adult level discussion  here s the video via youtube republicans should be called out for not investigating trump  we are talking about our national security and the sanctity of our elections  if they are going to put party and power above our country  they have no business serving in congress featured image via screen capture
