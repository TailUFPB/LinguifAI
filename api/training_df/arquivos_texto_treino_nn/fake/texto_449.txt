it s more than clear that donald trump is very proud of himself for visiting texas for the second time after hurricane harvey  he s made sure to post videos of himself arriving  and the press is swarming him while he visits shelters housing displaced hurricane victims  optics really are the best  right  especially for plummeting approval ratings however  in a very weird moment  the camera caught trump talking about his hand size  that s right  trump shouted  my hands are too big  here s the video trump yells  my hands are too big  not sure who he is talking to  pic twitter com xprsbrlhcc  judd legum   juddlegum  september    right  it s not really clear why he would say such a thing  or who he was saying it to  however  there he was  in the middle of a hurricane shelter  seemingly bragging about the size of his hands if you re unaware  the size of trump s hands has been an ongoing joke ever since the presidential race  the gag is that he has really tiny hands  or at least that s how rumor has it  so  overcompensating  he bragged about his hands then  and he s clearly still making sure people think his hands are plenty big enough for whatever it is he is doing at that shelter nonetheless  it s still weird and unnecessary to make sure he says such a thing on camera  he doth protest too much featured image via video screen capture
