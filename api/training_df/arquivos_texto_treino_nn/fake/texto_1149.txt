donald trump has to be the most corrupt  president  america has ever seen  after his infamous firing of fbi director james comey over the investigation into his campaign s ties to russia  trump was reportedly infuriated that his racist elf of an attorney general  jeff sessions  recused himself from all things related to russia  then  deputy attorney general rod rosenstein saw fit to appoint former fbi director robert mueller as a special counsel to get to the bottom of the russia matter  now  it seems that mueller  who enjoys broad bipartisan support and has an impeccable reputation in washington  is now in trump s crosshairs  in fact  it is now being reported that trump wanted to fire mueller  and was only stopped by his own white house staff  because any thinking person knows that this would be a political   and potentially legal  disaster the rumors of trump s intention to fire mueller were first fueled by an interview that newsmax ceo and close trump confidante christopher ruddy gave to pbs newshour  in that interview  ruddy said of what he knew of trump s paranoid thinking on the matter  i think he s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel  i think he s weighing that option  well  trump had better get that option out of his head  after all  even the gop sycophants in congress are saying that this is a bridge too far  and that trump needs to leave special counsel mueller alone and let him do his investigation  congressman adam schiff  d ca   who is the ranking member on the house intelligence committee has already told trump that going after mueller would be a waste of time  because congress would intervene if president fired bob mueller  congress would immediately re establish independent counsel and appoint bob mueller  don t waste our time   adam schiff   repadamschiff  june    is acting like richard nixon did toward the end of watergate  if he starts trying to treat robert mueller like richard nixon treated archibald cox  it will not end well for him let s see you fire robert mueller  you orange buffoon  you ll die in jail if the people who actually care about this nation have anything to say about it featured image via win mcnamee getty images
