yesterday  white house counselor kellyanne conway sparked national outcry when she used a fox   friends interview as a pathetic commercial for trump s daughter ivanka  after nordstrom became the latest retailer to drop ivanka s brand from its stores  it was not only an incredibly awkward interview to watch as conway shamelessly told viewers to buy ivanka s products  but it was also highly unethical  causing conway to get blasted for violating ethical guidelines earlier today  cnn reported that conway had to apologize to trump for the controversy  as federal employees are not supposed to endorse products or promote the goods of friends or family  even though trump seems to do this quite often   white house press secretary sean spicer was even forced to respond to the backlash  stating that conway had been  counseled  for her behavior now that conway has apologized to trump  she s apparently back in his graces and can continue spewing her alternative facts  aka blatant lies   conway tweeted that trump still supports her and her shameless lack of ethics but not all is well just yet  according to cnn  trump is not happy with spicer s comments about having  counseled  conway on the matter  apparently  trump said he  hated  what spicer said this is just the latest in the breakdown of trump s chaotic  volatile team  every day  there is a new f  k up or controversy to react to as trump s team proves to be the most incompetent  dishonest  disorganized and troubled team we ve ever seen operate the white house  there have already been rumors that trump is looking to replace spicer and conway continues to be shunned by the media over her pathological lies  which won t work in trump s favor  it seems like trump s biggest supporters  conway and spicer  are now doing more harm than good and things are definitely imploding faster than they can handle featured image via alex wong and chip somodevilla   getty images
