trump s supporters  and some in the press  believe that if it wasn t for trump being a disgusting sexual predator  hillary clinton would have been done when wikileaks released a bunch of emails from her campaign  however  an aide to hillary  john podesta  has made an interesting connection  too  one of trump s close allies  roger stone  communicates with wikileaks and stone has just admitted to it  i do have a back channel communication with assange  because we have a good mutual friend   stone told  news  wednesday evening   that friend travels back and forth from the united states to london and we talk  i had dinner with him last monday   he claims he doesn t have direct communication with assange  though  and he insists he has nothing to do with their email dump  democrats and u s  officials believe that wikileaks might be working with russia on this  which wouldn t be surprising since they hacked the dnc over the summer and are showing interest in trying to rig our election podesta has also accused stone of having advance knowledge of what was going to be in wikileaks  email dump   an accusation that stone flatly denies  i have a back channel communications with wikileaks   stone told nbc news   but they certainly don t clear or tell me in advance what they re going to do   what s the point of the communication  then  given what wikileaks is busy doing trying to expose hillary as corrupt  which could tilt the election in trump s favor it s not really all that difficult to imagine that this  back channel communication  is actually collusion directly between stone and assange in fact  back in august  stone said he was in direct communication with assange and that they were actively working to bring down hillary s campaign  speaking to the southwest broward republican organization  stone referred directly to the so called  october surprise   saying  according to mediaite  well  it could be any number of things  i actually have communicated with assange  i believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the clinton foundation but there s no telling what the october surprise may be  lately  it seems that everything anyone involved with trump tries to do to bring hillary and the democrats down backfires  if stone communicates with wikileaks  that implicates the trump campaign  he s admitted to back channel communication  he has said he s spoken to assange  although he denies it now  this won t look good for trump s already faltering campaign featured image via ben jackson getty images for siriusxm
