donald trump might want to stop creating public polls  it s never going to end well for him as he is the most hated potus in history it s no secret that even before trump stepped foot in the white house  the nation was mourning the loss of president barack obama  stunned and heartbroken that a truly great potus would be replaced by an incompetent reality television star we re now several weeks into trump s presidency and we still can t get over it  if the average american is upset about trump being in the white house  you can only imagine what obama s former officials feel  having worked closely with a truly great man and leader  today  former obama official chris lu gave us a look at some major resistance to the new president lu was obama s top liaison to federal departments and agencies  and clearly showed that he was fiercely loyal to the former potus  trump made the mistake of asking the public what agencies he should cut   and it went horribly wrong thanks to lu  lu answered the question   by proposing that trump s white house be eliminated trump was looking for a way to make the federal government more efficient  effective  and accountable to you    and we can all agree that our government would be far more effective without trump and his corrupt administration  here s lu s hilarious response to trump lu wrote  the president seems more interested in visiting his own properties instead of fulfilling his constitutional duties  but if he wants to stay in office  he should disclose his tax returns  eliminate all conflicts of interest  and disclose who is visiting the white house  that s something we all could agree on  we have all seen how miserably trump fails whenever he tries to get something done   four years under this administration will be detrimental to the country featured image via feng li   getty images
