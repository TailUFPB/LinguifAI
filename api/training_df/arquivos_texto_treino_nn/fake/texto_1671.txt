joe scarborough is not having the best morning  on morning joe earlier today  the conversation turned to the number of trump family members who are serving in the white house and the rampant nepotism there  this led scarborough to compare president donald trump s daughter  ivanka  to a robert f  kennedy scarborough said that having ivanka and her husband  jared kushner  working for him in the west wing created the same kind of situation that upset so many republicans during the kennedy administration  when host mika brzezinski questioned that logic  scarborough did not take it well scarborough s rant went like this   you don t have to be so snotty  i was about to say  you didn t let me get it out  you don t have to be so rude  the fact of the matter is that they are not bobby kennedy as i was about to say but you wanted to get your cheap shot in so you got your cheap shot in  no i am not saying jared and ivanka are bobby kennedy  maybe it s time for the host to switch to decaf here s the video featured image via carolyn cole getty images
