the right wing pastor who posted a cartoon of hillary clinton in black face just got his a   handed to him by cnn pastor mark burns has been one of donald trump s biggest cheerleaders  on his church website  he bragged about his military experience in the army and claimed that he graduated from north greenville university with a bachelor of science the only problem is that neither of those claims are even remotely true  which means burns has been lying to his congregation and the american people during an interview with cnn host victor blackwell  burns was taken by surprise when called out for posting false information about himself when asked if he attended the university  burns said that he had  but then blackwell confronted burns about the claim on his website that he actually graduated  as it turns out  burns only attended for one semester burns whined and claimed that the interview was supposed to be  off the record   but blackwell made it clear that he  didn t agree to that  burns continuing complaining and accused blackwell of character assassination  this is not fair at all   burns whined   i thought we were doing a profile and all of a sudden you re here to try to destroy my character  i m not here to destroy your character   blackwell said before getting back to the results of cnn s investigation blackwell proceeded to grill burns and revealed that not only did burns not graduate from north greenville university  he didn t serve six years in the army either  he only briefly served in the national guard here s the video via youtube burns later released a statement claiming that he only lied in his biography because he wanted to be taken seriously as a pastor  as a young man starting my church in greenville  south carolina  i overstated several details of my biography because i was worried i wouldn t be taken seriously as a new pastor  this was wrong  i wasn t truthful then and i have to take full responsibility for my actions  burns  who has raked in the money as a televangelist  has built his empire on a foundation of lies that automatically disqualifies him from serving as a so called  man of god  this man lied to become a pastor and he has been lying to his congregation ever since but burns could not even take full responsibility for his sins as he blamed the media and claimed that he is only being outed because he is a black man who supports donald trump  i do also want to set the record straight about why this attack is happening   because i am a black man supporting donald trump for president  for too long  african american votes have been taken for granted by democratic politicians  and enough is enough  so burns literally played the race card  which something conservatives hypocritically often claim that liberals do so not only is burns a liar  he s a hypocrite and one has to wonder what else he is hiding featured image  stephen maturen getty images
