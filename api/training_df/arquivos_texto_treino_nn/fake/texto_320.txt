donald trump is facing seriously fierce blowback for his attacks on black athletes who choose to protest racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games  everyone from owners to players to players to former players are giving trump a big middle finger during suturday s games on sunday  and former nfl star chris kluwe didn t stay out of the fray  during an interview with cnn host fredricka whitfield  kluwe  who believes he was blacklisted in the league for speaking out for lgbtq rights  did not hold back  first  whitfield asked  this display of kneeling at the national anthem on a football field started a year ago with  s kaepernick and now has evolved into something else or perhaps has blossomed into the same thing but in a bigger way  chris  what statement do you see nfl teams  owners  coaches making when they kneel  touch  lock arms on display like this  kluwe responded  well  i think that the players and the teams are saying that they are not going to be dictated to by a racist  fascist white supremacist who currently occupies the highest place in our government  when you look at what donald trump has said about speaking out against nazis  i think it s fantastic that players and owners are now taking a stand in using the platform to speak out against this because this is not what america is  america is not a fascist military state where its devotion to the flag above all  right now our nation is not holding up its end of the social contract  especially with communities of color  it should be a baseline right now that you can walk down the street and not get shot by a police officer for carrying a toy gun or for selling cigarettes out of the back of a car  it should not be out of the ordinary to expect that  so i m glad to see these players and owners taking a stand  communities of color within our nation are not receiving the same level of justice that white communities are   he added   black members of our society are far more likely to be put in prison for what white members are able to skate by on  but it s also morphed into a discussion that we have a person in charge of our society that does not understand what it means to wield the american empire  and has shown no willingness to work with minorities  with immigrants  with anyone who is not white  and that is  again  against the heart of what america stands for  kluwe is spot on  these players do not suspend their first amendment right when they take to the field  further  donald trump should not be using the bully pulpit of the white house to try and get people fired for demonstrating for justice  these players are using their platforms to bring awareness to a very serious  and literally life or death  issue in america s communities of color  there s nothing more patriotic that they could do trump  on the other hand  is no patriot  kluwe is correct   trump is a racist  a fascist  and a white supremacist  kudos to these sports teams for standing up to this bullying watch the video below featured image via video screen capture
