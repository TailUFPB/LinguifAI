donald trump has been going off on his infamous psychotic twitter rants again  and they just keep getting more and more terrifying as the days go on on tuesday morning  trump suggested that americans who burn the american flag should lose their citizenship or alternatively be forced to spend a year in jail  nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag   if they do  there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or a year in jail  twitterthis is yet another instance where trump has displayed how little he knows about how the actual constitution works  burning the american flag is completely legal  unlike what trump is suggesting  trump s proposed punishment for flag burning also goes against the landmark  supreme court case texas v  johnson  where burning the flag was protected under the first amendment  it should also be noted that one of trump s idols  the late justice antonin scalia  ruled in favor of that case revoking citizenship is a very serious concept to play with  according to the huffington post  an american citizen can only lose their nationality by pledging allegiance to another country  committing treason  or voluntarily giving it up  anand giridharadas didn t hesitate to call trump out  bringing attention to the fact that trump is more of a fascist than anything else  he summed up trump s threat perfectly when he said  the explicit articulation that doing legal things could cost you citizenship  twitterthen  giridharadas gave us some historical context twitterthat s terrifying  and unfortunately it s only the tip of the iceberg  trump s flag burning tweet came after he went on a troubling twitter rant last night  in which he attacked the free press for debunking his voter fraud lies  when you put all of trump s threats together  it becomes clear that he s more interested in being a dictator than a president featured image via maddie mcgarvey  getty images
