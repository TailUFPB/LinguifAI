the woman who accused donald trump of raping her at age  has dropped her lawsuit after canceling a press conference slated for the middle of next week  and nobody knows why  however  she canceled the press conference because she had been getting death threats  and was too terrified to show up on wednesday  lisa bloom  the lawyer who organized the press conference that ms  doe canceled  said  jane doe has received numerous threats today  as have all the trump accusers that i have represented she is living in fear  she has decided that she is too afraid to show her face  she s been here all day ready to do it  but unfortunately she is in terrible fear  so it s entirely possible that trump  his people  his supporters  and or other misogynists literally terrorized her into dropping the suit  her fears would be well founded  too  given that trump allegedly threatened her if she told anyone how he d violated her  one witness said  i personally witnessed defendant trump telling the plaintiff that she shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like the  year old female maria  and that he was capable of having her whole family killed  that adds some credence to the possibility that she dropped the suit out of fear  she very likely stayed silent all this time because she was terrified of what would happen to her should she come forward  now she s receiving death threats  which must seem to her like her worst fears coming true  it s horrific on friday  jeffrey meagher  ms  doe s lead attorney  simply filed a one page notice dismissing the case without explanation  it merely reads  pursuant to f r c p   a    a  i  of the federal rules of civil procedure  the plaintiff  by and through her counsel  hereby gives notice that the above captioned action is voluntarily dismissed against the defendants  she may or may not be able to file this claim again  and her attorneys would have explained that to her  however  if she s being terrorized the way it sounds and that s entirely plausible given the really despicable natures of trump and everyone close to him she may just want to let it rest and hope to live out the rest of her life in relative peace  that does not make her a liar  though  as many will no doubt say  that makes whoever is threatening her despicable and deplorable featured image by joe raedle via getty images
