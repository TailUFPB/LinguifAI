kellyanne conway  who serves as a senior adviser to donald trump  is a connoisseur of  alternative facts   in other words  she lies so much she even believes herself  but don t call her a liar  or she ll freak out  conway is on the offensive today after the president of her alma mater called her out for repeatedly trying to sell falsehoods to the american people as truth trinity washington university president patricia mcguire blasted conway for her lies in a blog titled on lies and the truth we must tell   she said conway was  part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power  presidential counselor kellyanne conway  trinity class of   has played a large role in facilitating the manipulation of facts and encouraging the grave injustice being perpetrated by the trump administration s war on immigrants among many other issues  she is one of president trump s primary spokespersons  an almost daily figure on cable news shows   mcguire wrote    some people admire her staunch advocacy for her client s positions  and others applaud the fact that she was the first woman to manage a successful presidential campaign  but in fact  as is true of many of president trump s statements  her advocacy on his behalf is often at variance with the truth  ms  conway invented the now infamous phrase  alternative fact   to defend trump s claims about the size of crowds at his inauguration  a thinly veiled autocratic scheme to try to claim that the trump inauguration drew the biggest crowd in history when  in fact  it was on the smaller side   she continued   ms  conway has been part of a team that thinks nothing of shaping and spreading a skein of lies as a means to secure power  perhaps the  bowling green massacre  comment was truly a mistake  as she claims  but she repeated that canard on three different occasions as an explanation for why the travel ban  an executive order that clearly discriminates against muslims  was necessary  when the washington post informed conway of mcguire s comments  she didn t take it well at all  true to form  she lashed out and slammed not only mcguire s wise words  but also her fellow alumni  because why not  it s a disappointment to have the president of the university lift up other trinity graduates who have a casual relationship with the truth   conway said  she then whined that mcguire didn t even have  the courtesy of calling or emailing me to ask what i meant on any given occasion  without addressing the fact that she has been running around making up the truth as she goes along  including the bowling green massacre that never happened  conway added that she has given the school lots of money over the years  my money was good   she noted  apparently  writing a check means that no one is allowed to call you out for spouting lies to defend a demagogue  sounds totally legit featured image via mark wilson getty images
