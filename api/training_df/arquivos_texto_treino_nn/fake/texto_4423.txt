star trek opposes donald trump for obvious reasons in a lot of ways  star trek has predicted the future of earth and humankind  technologically  star trek has inspired many of the inventions we take for granted today such as cell phones  tablets  and laptop computers  currently  scientists are working on developing transporters  tractor beams  and other tech found in the trek universe but the vision of star trek is a utopian future where war  disease  hate  hunger  and sexism no longer exist and the only thing people work for is to better themselves because money is unnecessary  the nations of earth are united and so we set out into the wider universe in search of new life and new civilizations to join us but donald trump has no interest in creating a better future designed to help and unite all humans  if elected to the presidency  trump will slam the brakes on progress and take us back to an era before star trek was even an idea  and that is so scary that the casts and crews across the various star trek series are uniting against trump and urging people to vote for hillary clinton if we want to continue the path toward a brighter and more hopeful future  star trek has always offered a positive vision of the future  a vision of hope and optimism  and most importantly  a vision of inclusion  where people of all races are accorded equal respect and dignity  where individual beliefs and lifestyles are respected so long as they pose no threat to others   the group trek against trump wrote on facebook we cannot turn our backs on what is happening in the upcoming election  never has there been a presidential candidate who stands in such complete opposition to the ideals of the star trek universe as donald trump  his election would take this country backward  perhaps disastrously  we need to elect a president who will move this country forward into the kind of future we all dream of  where personal differences are understood and accepted  where science overrules superstition  where people work together instead of against each other the resolution of conflicts on star trek was never easy  don t remain aloof  vote  we have heard people say they will vote green or libertarian or not at all because the two major candidates are equally flawed  that is both illogical and inaccurate  either secretary clinton or mr  trump will occupy the white house  one is an amateur with a contemptuous ignorance of national laws and international realities  while the other has devoted her life to public service  and has deep and valuable experience with the proven ability to work with congress to pass desperately needed legislation  if  as some say  the government is broken  a protest vote will not fix it  do this not merely for yourself but for all the generations that follow   the post concludes   vote for a future of enlightenment and inclusion  a future that will someday lead us to the stars  those who signed the statement include george takei  walter koenig  and the families of leonard nimoy and jimmy doohan of the original series  jonathan frakes  wil wheaton  and brent spiner of the next generation  kate mulgrew  robert picardo  and tim russ of voyager  scott bakula  dominic keating and connor trinneer of enterprise  ren  auberjonois and armin shimmerman of deep space nine  and chris pine zachary quinto  and zoe saldana from the new star trek film series  along with many other trek actors  the signatories also include writers  directors  and the son of star trek creator gene roddenberry here s the full post via facebook star trek is the idea of the future we all want to believe can be reality one day  but letting trump become president would be a major setback for that dream  we need a president who will boldly take america into the future  not a coward who fears it featured image via wikimedia
