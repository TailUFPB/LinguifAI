gas prices are expected to rise sharply this year  but donald trump thinks a ten year low for a single day is something he should get credit for on july   gas prices dropped to an average    a gallon  it s the lowest it has been on independence day in ten years so  of course  trump bragged about it gas prices are the lowest in the u s  in over ten years  i would like to see them go even lower   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    in mind  we are only halfway through   and one day does not equal one year also  presidents do not control gas prices  something conservatives are always hypocritically pointing out when gas prices come down during a democratic presidency or when gas prices are high during a republican presidency  but when gas prices are low during a republican presidency  conservatives throw that knowledge out the window and claim that the president did it such is the case now but trump had nothing to do with current gas prices  you see  the market has been flooded with oversupply from opec  which has driven the price of gasoline down over the last couple years in   the national average price of gas dropped from    in  to    and last year s independence day saw a gas price of    per gallon  that s a mere three cent difference from the low that trump bragged about yesterday you didn t hear conservatives giving president obama credit for that  nor did they give obama credit for the even lower national average of    per gallon in november  but  again  oversupply is the reason why we have cheaper gas right now  once that supply is burned off  the price of gas will go back up and there s nothing trump can do about it  one thing he will do  however  is blame anyone and anything else for the rise  he certainly won t be taking credit or bragging featured image via michael reynolds pool getty images
