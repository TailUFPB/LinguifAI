in july  a washington post editorial called donald trump  a unique threat to democracy   this is entirely true  trump has suggested building a wall to protect from  rapists  and  murderers  mexico is  sending  to america  he has suggested rounding up members of a religious group  forcing them to be entered into a national database and wear a special little badge  and then be thrown into concentration camps trump has ordered his supporters to beat african american protesters at his hate rallies  even suggesting that he will pay their legal fees if they are arrested while acting as his attack dogs  hell he even kicks his own supporters out of his events if he thinks they might be a little too dark for the room  but award winning monthly science magazine  scientific american  wants to remind you that he has about as much respect for science as he does a well educated  black  gay journalist who recently converted to islam four years ago  the magazine s shawn otto warned that  the new science denialism is creating an existential crisis like few the country has faced before  otto wrote those words in the heat of a presidential election race that now seems quaint by comparison to the one the nation now finds itself in   the magazine s editorial board wrote in a piece that will appear in september s print edition scientific american is not in the business of endorsing political candidates  but we do take a stand for science the most reliable path to objective knowledge the world has seen and the enlightenment values that gave rise to it  for more than  years we have documented  for better and for worse  the rise of science and technology and their impact on the nation and the world  we have strived to assert in our reporting  writing and editing the principle that decision making in the sphere of public policy should accept the conclusions that evidence  gathered in the spirit and with the methods of science  tells us to be true it won t come as a surprise to anyone who pays even superficial attention to politics that over the past few decades facts have become an undervalued commodity  many politicians are hostile to science  on both sides of the political aisle  the house committee on science  space  and technology has a routine practice of meddling in petty science funding matters to score political points  science has not played nearly as prominent a role as it should in informing debates over the labeling of genetically modified foods  end of life care and energy policy  among many issues the current presidential race  however  is something special  it takes antiscience to previously unexplored terrain  when the major republican candidate for president has tweeted that global warming is a chinese plot  threatens to dismantle a climate agreement  years in the making and to eliminate an agency that enforces clean air and water regulations  and speaks passionately about a link between vaccines and autism that was utterly discredited years ago  we can only hope that there is nowhere to go but up in october  as we did four years previously  we will assemble answers from the campaigns of the democratic and republican nominees on the public policy questions that touch on science  technology and public health and then publish them online  we will support sciencedebate org s efforts to persuade moderators to ask important science related questions during the presidential debates  we encourage the nation s political leaders to demonstrate a respect for scientific truths in word and deed  and we urge the people who vote to hold them to that standard if donald trump is elected president  it will be a precarious position for scientific research in general  and this is something that is important to remember when you are speaking out against donald trump  remember to mention that he doesn t care about scientific progress featured image via getty images jeff swanson
