assuming hillary clinton wins tuesday s election  as she s predicted to do  she will owe at least part of her success to the senate minority leader and senior senator from nevada  harry reid nevada  which is a traditional red state  is a tossup this year  fivethirtyeight shows both donald trump and clinton in a statistical near tie  but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in clinton s camp  this is especially good news for clinton because if she wins nevada s six electoral votes  it will mean that she can still afford to lose florida and north carolina  trump won t  and doesn t  have that luxury  if clinton does win  that will be reid s doing yet about one thing trump was right  harry reid built this  after two years of boosting voter registration among key democratic demographics  the retiring senate minority leader has brought turnout among hispanics in the state to record levels  in doing so  he s almost surely delivered the state for hillary clinton and possibly with it the presidential race  trump has only the narrowest path to  electoral votes without nevada   the reality of this election is that if clinton wins  especially if she ends up needing nevada  it s not a stretch to declare that reid was the single most important person in her victory source  politicotrump is complaining about the turnout of latino voters  but he has no one to blame but himself  his campaign began by attacking mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers   and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants  then  there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  mexican   the judge isn t  he s mexican american  or  there are trump s attacks on univision s jorge ramos  the list could go on  but it s cost trump big  clinton has the support of   of latinos and trump has the lowest approval rating among latinos than anyone in more than  years reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of trump to the max  and the early results bear it out  whereas the latino vote was  percent of the nevada electorate in  and  percent in   data i have seen shows now it is up  percent from  in early voting  meaning it could go above  percent of all voters by tuesday evening  we ve been focused on registering and building our latino turnout from day    said one democratic organizer   that is paying dividends with latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall  in five out of the six highest hispanic precincts  turnout in the early vote exceeded    right now  nevada appears almost un winnable for trump  if he loses  that will pretty much seal his fate  as for reid  well  he will no longer be in office and the senate race in nevada is a squeaker  but it s hard to imagine that if hillary walks away with the state in her pocket  so will cortez masto  the democratic poised to replace reid featured image via ethan miller getty images
