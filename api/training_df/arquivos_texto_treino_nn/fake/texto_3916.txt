while campaigning in reno on saturday  the secret service suddenly rushed trump off the stage with no one to give an explanation  the audience started trying to leave  and it was a very good show  minutes later  trump reappeared onstage to continue his speech it seems there was a protester in the front of the crowd holding a  republicans against trump  sign  and the trouble started after someone shouted   gun   nobody found any guns at the scene  though  and the man  austyn crites  was allegedly put in a chokehold and grabbed by his testicles both trump s social media director and his son found a tweet from a rabidly lying trump fan saying that trump had just survived an assassination attempt  this tweet has yet to be taken down from trump jr  s twitter feed look  we get it  cardboard signs with writing on them are terrifying for trump fans  they still don t qualify as weapons  tthough  and oddly enough  there was no weapon and likely no aggression on the part of crites  there are some on twitter claiming that crites first tried to grab a gun off of a secret service agent  the secret service merely searched him  questioned him  and released him doesn t sound like he tried to grab a gun there  in fact  the secret service has so far said nothing about that happening  don t confuse the trumpkins with facts and truth  though  it hurts their three brain cells later on  at a rally in colorado  the man who introduced trump to the crowd said that there was  an attempt of murder  at the reno rally  again  there wasn t an assassination attempt  but of course they ll say anything to garner sympathy for their candidate and make him out to be both a hero and a victim at the same time despite the lack of evidence that crites was a would be assassin  trumpkins have taken to twitter to push that whopper and make utter fools of themselves     for his part  trump issued a blah statement  and  at the time of this posting  hadn t said anything on twitter about it  his fans  though   are just eating this up  they re so thick in the head that they ll believe anything and everything that makes their lord and savior into a victim of a nefarious plot  that includes spreading lies about assassination attempts here s a video of the secret service rushing him offstage obama called  trump un american   unhuman yesterday  today  there was an assassination attempt on donald trump  pic twitter com   trump super pac   trumpsuperpac  november    image via screen capture from embedded video
