when hurricane sandy hit  affecting states all the way from north carolina to new england and particularly devastating new york and new jersey in   texas lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against recovery assistance  in fact  john culberson  whose  congressional district includes parts of houston  was the only texas republican in congress in favor of the    billion relief effort one of the loudest opponents of sandy aid was ted cruz  who was merely weeks away from becoming a texas senator  cruz s main concerns involved additional spending  which included funding for disaster preparedness and relief in other parts of the country as a means of gaining support for the hurricane sandy relief effort  hurricane sandy inflicted devastating damage on the east coast  and congress appropriately responded with hurricane relief   cruz said in a statement at the time in an effort to justify his stance  unfortunately  cynical politicians in washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to sandy  now cruz  who campaigned for president of the united states  eventually losing the republican primary in indiana to donald trump in march of last year  has teamed up with fellow texas senator john cornyn to contact president trump  begging him to sign a major disaster declaration at the request of texas governor greg abbott  allowing the state to access key federal resources as soon as possible  given the potential catastrophic impact that the hurricane may have on texas communities   cruz and cornyn wrote in their plea to trump   we strongly support this request and urge you to provide any and all emergency protective measures available by a major disaster declaration  the irony of cruz s appeal to the president hasn t been lost on residents on the east coast  msnbc even quizzed cruz yesterday on the hypocritical nature of his request  but in typical fashion  cruz just avoided the question  there s time for political sniping later   he said   i think our focus needs to be on this crisis and this disaster  despite cruz abandoning them in their time of need five years ago  several new york and new jersey lawmakers have decided to take the high road and support cruz during his despite my tx colleagues refusal to support aid in  southjersey time of need  i will support emergency disaster    for those impacted  frank lobiondo   replobiondo  august      emergencies are just that disasters   emergencies  must stand together as americans  not be hypocritical based on geography  frank lobiondo   replobiondo  august    cruz   texas cohorts voted vs ny nj aid after sandy but i ll vote  harvey aid  ny wont abandon texas   bad turn doesnt deserve another  rep  pete king   reppeteking  august    lifelong nyer w  ny values i will vote for emergency harvey   for ted cruz s constituents  above all  true americans must stand together   rep  pete king   reppeteking  august    were also quick to mention that maybe cruz should also pursue the funding for disaster preparation that he was so opposed to when sandy hit texans should hope cruz helps do what he criticized the sandy aid package for doing  get   for future texas storm prep  he won t  of course   chris hooks   cdhooks  august    image via michael reynolds   pool getty images
