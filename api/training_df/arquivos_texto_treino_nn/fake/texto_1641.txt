while most americans did not know about michael flynn s ties to turkey  team trump did  when they were vetting the former general  they did learn of flynn s work for both turkey and russia  they knew he had violated the law and the u s  constitution and they hired him to be the national security advisor anyway msnbc s rachel maddow said this on her show on friday night   nbc news has learned from sources close to the trump russia investigation that both the trump transition and the white house did do a background check on flynn   she went on to say that the vetting team trump did of flynn was done  very casually  the new reporting by nbc news mirrors the claims flynn has been making for some time that he and his lawyers were upfront with the vetting team about the lobbying he was doing on behalf of the turkish government for its part  the white house has taken to blaming the obama administration  flynn worked as the director of the defense intelligence agency  dia   his job at the dia did require he receive a top secret clearance but it is important to note that he was fired from that job in   he started there in    this was a full year before he was scheduled to retire this week  press secretary sean spicer indicated that the transition team relied on the vetting that had been done by the obama administration  the timing of this is important to note because flynn did not start his consulting work until after he left the dia  the vetting he received prior to that role  which is what gave him his clearance would not have shown his ties to turkey or russia because that work hadn t happened yet members of the military are barred from working for foreign governments for life  unless they receive congressional approval  the reason is that they can be called back to duty at any time and working for a foreign government could cause a conflict of interest featured image via mark makela getty images
