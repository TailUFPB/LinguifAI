while it can be said that no one is immune from punishment  a terrific example of that fact is how a secret service agent who was on mike pence s detail just got himself arrested why was he arrested  for getting caught soliciting sex from a prostitute according to cnn   a secret service agent on vice president mike pence s detail has been suspended from official duties after meeting a prostitute at a maryland hotel  one law enforcement source says the agent was caught after police saw him exiting the hotel  apparently  this is how it all went down  the police responded to a call from the hotel manager who became suspicious of activity in one of the rooms  the source said this was not a sting  now  even though the agent was off duty and wasn t currently guarding the  vice president  it is still illegal to solicit sex cnn reports  a secret service spokesperson  speaking on the record  acknowledges  an alleged incident  occurred and says it involved an off duty secret service employee and said that the matter is under investigation by the office of professional responsibility to determine the facts according to the spokesperson  the employee was required to surrender his weapon and official gear and was placed on administrative leave  the employee s security clearance and access to all secret service facilities has also been suspended  tsk tsk  you d think someone  especially in the secret service  would know better  especially considering the history of prostitutes with agents in the secret service who can forget the colombian prostitute scandal of  when nine secret service agents had been discovered bringing hookers back to their rooms mike pence s former secret service agent will be disciplined  but it still doesn t look good for the entire united states secret service  or the  vice president for that matter  and you can only guess the big guy in the oval office doesn t like it  no  not bannon  the other big guy   pending investigation into russian interference in the  election featured photo by alex wong getty images
