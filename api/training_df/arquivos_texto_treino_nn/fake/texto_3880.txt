whether republican nominee donald trump actually ever wanted to be the next president of the united states has been under speculation for a while now  especially with rumors about a trump tv network surfacing as his campaign came to an end  it probably doesn t help that trump celebrated election day by dissing his own presidential campaign  perhaps in early acceptance that he might come out of this defeated in an interview with fox and friends on tuesday morning  trump decided to spend election day telling americans that his campaign might very well have been a big waste of time for him  his exact words were  if i don t win  i will consider it a waste of time  energy and money  seriously  could trump be any less deserving of america s future  his rival  hillary clinton  would never have called her campaign a  waste  and understands what an honor it is to lead this country  to imply that he might have better things to do with his time is extremely disrespectful and ignorant of trump  which is hardly surprising when you look back on how awful his campaign was  you can watch trump diss his own campaign below what trump s family members said on election day wasn t much better  on msnbc s morning joe  donald trump  jr  seemed to already be accepting defeat as he spoke about what the trump family would do after the election  trump s son said   we go back largely to doing what we re doing  but i think hopefully he was able to create enough of a movement that forces people in the political elite  people in that political class to truly represent their people  these interviews clearly show that trump doesn t understand the responsibility or honor that comes with being the commander in chief  we ve never had a less worthy presidential candidate  and he doesn t deserve to be elected featured image via andrew renneisen   getty images
