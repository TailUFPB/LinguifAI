donald trump and his campaign know that they stand an ice cube s chance in hell at winning the presidential election unless they can sway some of the minority vote  as it stands now the campaign has next to nothing in the realm of that voting block so  what is trump doing to try to get some of that vote  he s pandering to african americans and latinos  of course  however  he s doing a terrible job of it he s literally asking minority voters  what do you have to lose  as though that s all the reasoning they d ever need to vote for him  as if minority voters are going to show up to the voting booth in november  look at the ballot  and say   eh  why not trump  what do i have to lose  well  the answer to that is everything considering trump is currently endorsed by white supremacists and has regularly compared latinos to rapists and murderers does trump really think that line is going to work  i mean  he can t be that dumb  right  who knows  really  clearly  his current supporters are well  not letting trump get away with being such a pathetic pandering fool  ana navarro  a conservative mind you  tells trump exactly what they have to lose on cnn navarro stated  i don t speak for all hispanics  i speak for myself  maybe the eighty plus percent of hispanics who don t approve of him  some of them may agree with me  i think what we have to lose  is our dignity  our sense of self worth  i think what we have to lose is our moral compass  i think that if we allow ourselves to vote for a man who has been making textbook racist remarks  and in my book that makes him a racist  for over a year  against hispanics  against immigrants  you are voting against your own self interests  i think that we would lose our political leverage  we would lose any power  if we allow somebody who has been bashing us for over a year to win the presidency  it means the hispanic vote does not matter  so  that s my answer to donald trump  what do we have to lose by voting for you  our dignity  it really doesn t get more perfect than that  well said  ana watch navarro explain what latinos have to lose by voting for trump here   ananavarro s answer to donald trump   what we have to lose by voting for you  our dignity   https   t co   cnn tonight   cnntonight  august    image via video screen capture
