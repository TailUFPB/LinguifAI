daryush valizadeh is a sexist and misogynist who is lobbying to make rape legal on private property  and he is a fan of donald trump trump s past statements and behavior towards women has emboldened men who think women are inferior and can do with them as they please and valizadeh wrote a manifesto celebrating trump s win as the  moment  legal rape activists have been waiting for to make their goal a reality i m in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a   scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude  we may have to institute a new feature called  would trump bang   to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity  simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer  and not the  beauty at every size  sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who don t take care of themselves  and neither should you  we now have a president who will not encourage anti male propaganda  rape culture  and female victimhood  while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feminist minded daughter  ivanka  trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama  because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense long term manipulation  it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order  stop feeding the rot and it will die off  allowing biology to naturally reassert itself we ve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we haven t had a chance to understand what s going on and adapt  instead  we ve been reacting from one blow to the next  whether it s the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration  trump s victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harm s way this jackass went on to brag that men like him will be able to say what they want to do what they want to women and get away it whether trump changes the laws or not  suggesting that men can go right ahead and rape all the women they want without consequence this is our moment  the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men  and the best part of it is that we don t need to wait for trump to do anything  his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bull s horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors  it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back anti masculine laws and policies  but it s not required  because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands this creepy asshole literally believes donald trump s election victory is one step closer toward making it legal for men to rape women across the country  trump supporters have already committed over  hate crimes  including crimes against women such as assault if valizadeh has his way  we are about to see sexual assault crimes skyrocket  which means america just became an even more dangerous place for women because of trump s victory featured image  womansurvival com
