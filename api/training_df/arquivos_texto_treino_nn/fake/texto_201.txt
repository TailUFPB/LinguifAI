donald trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle  not only because he continues to make it worse  but because america is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth it was only yesterday that white house chief of staff john kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing rep  frederica wilson for calling trump out for disrespecting a gold star widow  kelly also went after wilson for an old speech in   stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the fbi acknowledging two deceased agents  little did kelly know  this lie would ignite a sh tstorm for the trump administration earlier today  white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest trump administration  reporters blasted sanders with questions in the press briefing  directly pointing out that wilson s fbi speech completely contradicted kelly s claims  when a reporter boldly pointed out that wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech  sanders stumbled through her response  absolutely  general kelly was stunned that representative wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain fbi agents about her own actions in congress  including lobbying former president obama on legislation  as he pointed out  if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring american heroes all about yourself  you re an empty barrel  or as we say in the south  all hat  no cattle  this was hardly the end for sanders  because she d defended kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims  reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech  sanders claimed she had  and a reporter pointed out that she should know that wilson actually praised the fbi agents and didn t talk about funding  even as her spot was completely blown up  sanders pathetically defended kelly the icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if kelly would respond to more questions over the matter  when sanders said he already had yesterday  the reporter pointed out  he was wrong yesterday  as usual  the trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying  sanders fired back  if you want to go after general kelly  that s up to you  if you want to get into a debate with the four star marine general  i think that s something highly inappropriate  go ahead  you can watch sanders get grilled by reporters below featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
