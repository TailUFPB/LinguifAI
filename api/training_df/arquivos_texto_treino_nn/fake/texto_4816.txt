donald trump is not going to like this at all the republican nominee s pathetic effort to draw hispanic voters to his campaign has failed miserably  especially after his disastrous trip to mexico and the immigration speech he made afterwards trump visited our southern neighbor to discuss the wall and who will pay for it  only to be told that mexico will not pay for it  defeated  trump was so humiliated that he claimed there was no discussion about that particular topic  only to be embarrassed once more by mexican officials when they called him out on his lie in fact  trump doubled down on his immigration plan  declaring that there will be no amnesty and that mexico will pay for the wall in other words  trump still wants to deport  million people and is suggesting that he will somehow force mexico to pay the bill for something they did not build nor support and that s exactly why hispanic chamber of commerce ceo javier palomarez went on morning joe on msnbc on thursday morning to declare trump s campaign  done for  among the latino community palomarez began by pointing out that net immigration across the mexican border has basically dropped to about   people  which might as well be zero in a nation as big as ours  then he revealed that the   are those who are leaving america instead of coming in  that blows trump s entire premise for a wall out of the water joe scarborough asked palomarez what his take is on trump s effort to have it both ways by suggesting that maybe he won t deport that many people while also repeating his draconian immigration plans to his racist conservative base  he s painted himself into this box   palomarez replied   he s damned if he does  and damned if he doesn t  he really had to come back out and fire up his base  but in reality he hasn t done anything to help himself in terms of growing the number  so i think he is done for with the hispanic community  palomarez said that trump will never see the white house without a decent portion of the hispanic vote  and then he dropped the hammer on the republican nominee with a single word of spanish  i don t know if you guys speak spanish  but i want you to remember this one word   payaso   it means  clown   this guy is a complete clown  palomarez went on to say that trump has  laid to waste  any outreach effort republicans have made after the  election and  there s no going back  here s the video via youtube there is no way donald trump can possibly make amends with hispanic voters with two months to go  any such attempts would be seen as desperation from a failing candidate whose poll numbers have only imploded since the rnc convention in july hillary clinton is poised to win the hispanic vote by even larger margins than president obama did in   and trump is so despised that his presence at the top of the ballot could be disastrous to republicans down the ticket it s too late to appeal to hispanics for their votes  and republicans know it  the only ones who don t are delusional trump fans who really believe he is going to win the election and they are going to be devastated when the results are revealed on election day featured image via screen capture
