donald trump is throwing a hissy fit because democrats are blocking many of his cabinet nominees  but he should be blaming republicans instead trump has chosen nominees who want to destroy the departments they have been picked to lead and they are mostly unqualified to hold the positions but those are not the only reasons why democrats are putting up a fight for eight years  republicans frequently obstructed president obama s nominees and any legislation democrats proposed  and for nearly a whole year  republicans blocked obama s supreme court nominee merrick garland from taking his rightful place on the high court the obstruction was unprecedented in american history  yet republicans and trump are whining because democrats are doing the exact same thing to them   on tuesday  trump took to twitter to complain like a hypocrite it is a disgrace that my full cabinet is still not in place  the longest such delay in the history of our country  obstruction by democrats   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february     republicans blocked garland s nomination for nearly a year even though he was totally qualified and had received praise from gop lawmakers  garland was also considered a moderate choice for the court  furthermore  republicans blocked an obama nominee for years from taking her place as ambassador to the bahamas and she died waiting to serve her country so while republicans are throwing a temper tantrum over democratic obstruction  they really only have themselves to blame  for eight years  they viciously blocked legislation and nominees because they hated president obama  and they hated him because he has black skin  if donald trump wants to bitch about obstructionism he should blame republicans for setting the precedent also  trump is lying because president obama didn t have his full cabinet in place until april and twitter was quick to remind him of it  realdonaldtrump this is what happens when your party sets a new standard for obstructionism   the other side has to escalate to compensate   tom coates   tomcoates  february    realdonaldtrump like most democrats  i d prefer that we didn t have to do things like this  but after  attempts to repeal obamacare   tom coates   tomcoates  february    realdonaldtrump after republican refusal to even talk to obama s supreme court nominee   tom coates   tomcoates  february     realdonaldtrump no i d say the republican controlled senate holds the honor  but you re  the  source for  fakenews https   t co   dr  craig malkin   drcraigmalkin  february    re being responsible  denying the picks bannon manipulated you to make  realdonaldtrump  zach hunter   zachjhunter  february    realdonaldtrump all you do is moan   so so doesnt like me blah blah  do some work you are president   tweet using the word  haters  really   darius syrossian   dariussyrossian  february    realdonaldtrump yet another lie  clinton didn t have cabinet in place until march   bush sr was march   obama not till april   jeremy m   thismyshow  february    realdonaldtrump or  you nominated the widest bunch of disqualified nimrods in the history of so called presidents   jaime primak   jaimeprimak  february    realdonaldtrump fuck yeah  bitch     resist  youarethedisgrace         perez   theperezhilton  february    rosie  realdonaldtrump all the tiny violins in the universe can t make me feel sorry for you  you made your bed  donald        february    should obstruct trump s nominees and his agenda at all costs  turnabout is fair play and republicans need to be taught a lesson featured image  andrew harrer pool getty images
