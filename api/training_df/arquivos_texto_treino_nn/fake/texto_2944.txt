for the first time since   latinos will be totally shut out from having any role in an administration despite the fact that latinos make up  percent of the population in the united states  trump apparently does not want them anywhere near him or his presidency  which makes it clear that he intends to treat them like second class citizens over the next four years  we re extremely worried  this is anti democratic   national hispanic leadership agenda chairman hector sanchez told the dallas morning news after trump chose a middle aged white guy to be secretary of agriculture  the last cabinet position to be filled  trump has not only been the most anti latino  anti immigrant president in the history of the nation  by not including latinos in the cabinet he is just showing how he is planning to govern   sanchez continued indeed  the alarming absence of latinos in trump s cabinet caught the notice of the media  who promptly asked trump s official mouthpiece  sean spicer  about it his response is flat out offensive  i think that when you look at the totality at his administration   the people that he s talked to  the people that he s met with  the people that he s appointing   you see a president who s committed to uniting this country  who s bringing the best and brightest together  look at the cabinet   elaine chao  dr  ben carson  nikki haley  the first indian american  not only is spicer suggesting that latinos are not  the best and brightest   he s suggesting that ben carson is actually one of the  best and brightest   let s not forget that carson thinks the ancient pyramids were built to be grain silos  something that is totally wrong and has been mocked by archaeologists spicer then doubled down  claiming that americans should focus on whether trump is hiring the best people for the jobs  and claimed that trump s cabinet is  diverse  here s the video via youtube again  latinos are the fastest growing demographic in this country  there should be at least one in an administration that is supposed to represent all of america  trump and his team can t honestly say that they couldn t find a person of hispanic descent who is qualified to work in any cabinet position  but  percent of our nation s population will be alienated by trump trump s claim that his cabinet is ideologically diverse and filled with the  best and brightest  is also bullshit  not only did trump only pick conservatives to fill his cabinet  all but two are men and all but two are white  that s not even close to being diverse  furthermore  as the atlantic points out  the only nominee who has experience running a federal agency is elaine chao  plus  most of his cabinet picks want to destroy the departments they have been selected to lead in no way are these the  best and brightest   and you can be damn sure that latinos will punish trump and republicans for it in  and  when the next midterm and presidential elections give the american people a chance to fix the mistake made in  featured image via twitter
