german chancellor angela merkel is up for reelection in september  and she s locked in a pretty tight race against martin schulz  the former president of the european parliament  following the  summit  where trump s childish arrogance was on full display  schulz simply shredded trump for his treatment of merkel  election campaign or no election campaign  in this situation let me be entirely clear  the chancellor represent all of us at summits like these  and i reject with outrage the way this man takes it upon himself to treat the head of our country s government  that is unacceptable  it is  but it s hard to expect trump to understand that at this point  in his mind  he s the most important person ever to walk the planet  as such  he was  more or less  a complete asshole during his visit to europe  he called germany who  up until now  was our most powerful european ally bad  very bad   for their trade policies  he said that german sells millions of cars in the u s  and implied that we get nothing from it  so it is going to stop  he proved with those statements that he has no idea that german automakers actually employ thousands of u s  workers inside u s  borders trump had the gall to castigate nato  too  for allegedly freeloading off the u s  as though we make up for the money they aren t spending  in truth  that two percent mark that nato allies are supposed to reach refers to the percentage of their individual gdps they need to commit to their national defenses   he also yelled at them for the cost of their new headquarters  almost acting as though we paid for it without voting for it for her part  merkel has since said that germany  and probably nato  can t rely on us as a partner anymore  that s a dangerous position for us to be in   trump is throwing away everything we ve worked towards with europe because he s a dickbag elsewhere  he showed his total asshattery by shoving the prime minister of montenegro aside to get to the front of a photo op  his body language there read   do you know who i am   according to one body language expert who analyzed his postures during that and two other incidents at the summit those other two incidents involve french president macron  the first is when macron arrived in italy   as he was walking towards the leaders who were already there  trump stuck his hands out to greet him  but macron veered toward merkel to greet her first  he greeted two other leaders before making it to trump  who then yanked him toward him as though to show him who was boss then there was the now famous  white knuckled handshake  with macron  who admitted that wasn t totally innocent  he wanted to show trump that france  and by extension  europe  would not allow trump to bully them some have interpreted schulz s comments as an attack on merkel he did appear to also say that she shouldn t have allowed trump to treat her the way he did but the bottom line is this  when someone s chief political rival takes their side against someone else  that someone else has royally screwed up featured image by olivier douliery pool via getty images
