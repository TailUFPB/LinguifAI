if there is one upside to having this level of unchecked corruption running through the trump white house it s that they aren t very good at hiding it in yet another example of the lengths trump s cronies will go to cover for him  the republican house intelligence committee chairman  devin nunes  was just exposed as having been secretly at the white house the night before he magically  discovered  an unnamed source that seemingly vindicated parts of donald trump s wiretapping claims  nunes claims that this visit was harmless and wasn t about coordinating with trump  and nunes thinks you are stupid enough to believe that speaking to eli lake at bloomberg  nunes feigned innocence in an interview monday  nunes told me that he ended up meeting his source on the white house grounds because it was the most convenient secure location with a computer connected to the system that included the reports  which are only distributed within the executive branch   we don t have networked access to these kinds of reports in congress   nunes said  he added that his source was not a white house staffer and was an intelligence official but daily beast reporter tim mak   who recently broke the story that nunes had disappeared the night before his  bombshell  came out   noted how ridiculous the premise was  of course the house intelligence chairman has access to secure locations in the capitol  he s the house intelligence committee chairman  his whole job is working with sensitive information in a secure way just a reminder that the committee nunes chairs has its own secure area  and he could have easily used that https   t co   tim mak   timkmak  march    was one of trump s biggest supporters during the election  as head of the intelligence committee  he has repeatedly claimed that he is impartial enough to investigate trump  but this latest exposure of malpractice might be the straw that breaks the camel s back  nunes seems incapable of doing a single thing that doesn t point to his coordination with donald trump  rather than investigate trump  nunes seems hellbent on providing cover for him as if to reinforce that point  nunes has yet to provide a shred of evidence to back up his claims that trump was wrongfully surveilled  ironically  the only thing he has done is bring up the possibility that trump was incidentally recorded in fbi wiretaps of known criminals  he might want to avoid bringing that up the next time he secretly goes to the white house featured image via drew angerer getty images
