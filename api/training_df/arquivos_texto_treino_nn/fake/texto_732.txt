while it s sometimes difficult to keep up with all the legal hot water donald trump is in  one lawsuit predates even his russian troubles and now trump wants to put an end to lawsuits like it for years  trump peddled his supposed real estate expertise in a scheme called trump university  which is not a university and it s really not trump  in the end    people sued trump in a class action lawsuit  they claim that the promised donald trump investment techniques were mostly stuff that you could find on the internet  some of which was illegal in some of the states where the seminars took place   she said   they say that the promised mentoring was worthless or nonexistent  that the instructors were unqualified and that they were definitely not handpicked by donald trump  as he claimed  and transcripts of donald trump s deposition   confirm that he was relatively unengaged with what went on in trump university  source  nprthey won   million and now  trump wants to put an end to class action lawsuits altogether  which would free corporations to screw their customers with very little accountability while the consumer financial protection bureau finalized a new rule that would ban mandatory arbitration clauses  and would instead allow consumers to sue banks when they are wronged  the white house came out with a statement saying that when consumers sue  it s frivolous  if allowed to take effect  the cfpb s harmful rule would benefit trial lawyers by increasing frivolous class action lawsuits  harm consumers by denying them the full benefits and efficiencies of arbitration  and hurt financial institutions by increasing litigation expenses and compliance costs  particularly for community and mid sized institutions    the white house said in a statement source  the weekmandatory arbitration  while it might sound efficient  is rarely customer friendly  most arbitrators are paid by the institution and in most cases  what they say is legally binding  most of the time  the arbitrators rule in favor of the institution in a sample of   cases  arbitrators ruled in favor of consumers  percent of the time  meanwhile  arbitration firms used by companies such as mastercard  visa  discover financial services and american express co  won  percent of the disputes  the study showed source  seattle pifrivolous  like when donald trump sued a man for daring to be born with the name donald trump  or when he sued a miss usa contestant  or when he sued the chicago tribune for doubting trump s chicago building would eclipse the then sears  and now willis  tower altogether  trump has been involved in more than   lawsuits  but despite the fact that our taxpayers pay for courts  he wants to take the option to use them away from us  unless we can afford pricey attorneys class action lawsuits are democratic  they give the people a voice  in trump s and in republicans  world  though  consumer rights are inconvenient for profits  we should just shut up and when a bank salaried arbitrator tells us we need to take it up the you know what  we d better take it up the you know what featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
