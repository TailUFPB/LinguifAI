meet william quayle jr   who is trying to give sarah palin a run for the worst thing to ever come from alaska quayle is a man who is voting for donald trump  but would have preferred ted cruz and previously criticized the donald for his hateful rhetoric and lies  because he s angry about the state of our country   and running for juneau s city assembly because things need to change  dammit  or something   and boy  does he hate that hillary clinton lady   largely because he buys into right wing conspiracy theories that paint her as so sick she s likely to die any day now quayle s facebook timeline is filled with right wing memes and messages  including frequent references to convicted felon dinesh d souza s latest propaganda film  hillary s america            but his obvious stupidity   the climate change post  really    is not what is bringing this normally unimportant person into the spotlight   it s his twitter account  where he shares his love of large  full figured women and their full figured breasts and  of course  where he sends some of these women insanely creepy messages  the gop candidate seems to spend much of his time harassing women   most commonly model chelsea charms   about fattening themselves up  inviting them to come live with him  and even encouraging them to get pregnant so their  boobs would get much bigger              i do not wish to discuss about my fetishes  i am a heterosexual male and that is that   quayle told ktoo fm when asked about the posts   i do have original ideas that my competition does not have  all they want to do is tax and cut budget   he does not deny the account is his  and even at one point auto posted some of his more awkward messages to facebook it s perfectly ok for someone to like large breasted women  it s not ok to harass women whose photos you look at while you do unspeakable things to your little soldier  it can be safely assumed that this is the case based on his public messages  the election is tuesday  may god have mercy on our souls if this guy manages to win featured image via facebook twitter
