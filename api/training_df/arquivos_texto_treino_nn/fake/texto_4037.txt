the all lives matter movement may have just found its new spokesperson  on wednesday morning  rudy giuliani gave everyone who denies racism more reason to be loud in their cause to ignore social justice issues  and unfortunately  giuliani s words were meant to defend the most racist american of all the former mayor of new york city went on msnbc earlier today to argue that trump couldn t be racist  even though trump has been supported by white supremacists all over the country and has an ever growing history of racist behavior  but not only did giuliani say that trump is not a racist  he said that no one is a racist   pretty much solidifying that he should never be in any position of power considering he does not understand the current state of america or the basic human rights issues that many americans are facing today  giuliani said  racist  the last thing in the world donald trump is is a racist  i ve known him for  years  the man likes white people  he likes black people  he likes hispanic people  he plays golf with them  giuliani has obviously forgotten the time that trump called mexican immigrants drug dealers  immigrants and rapists  or the fact that trump wouldn t rent apartments to black people in the past   among several other racist things trump has done over his lifetime  but it gets worse  in an astounding  baffling display of white privilege  giuliani argued that racism wasn t actually a thing  to say that donald trump is a racist is outrageous  and to call anyone a racist is outrageous then  giuliani railed against democratic nominee hillary clinton for talking about racism in america and actually treating it as the serious issue that it is  he said  if she thinks we all have implicit bias  hillary  i got news for you  i don t  maybe you do  i have no racial guilt  not a single bit of it  which is why i m willing to tell the truth about black crime and what has to be done about it  truly  it s enough to make your brain hurt  here s a clip of this moron talking featured image via alex wong   getty images
