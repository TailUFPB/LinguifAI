throughout the election  donald trump s tax returns have remained a mystery  he said he d release them if he won  but so far  crickets  it s not a giant leap to imagine that trump has something either incriminating or simply something bad in his taxes  would trump have run for president if he knew a little known law that makes every single presidential tax return go through an automatic audit the last time we had a known tax evader in office was during the richard nixon administration  his vice president  spiro agnew  was forced to resign in  after pleading guilty to tax evasion  nixon himself was twice audited by the irs  in   he had to pay    worth of back taxes for a three year period after that  nixon made all his tax returns public  since then  all but gerald ford  and now trump  have  the irs even passed a law requiring that all sitting presidents and vice presidents are audited every year  the requirement for mandatory audits of the tax returns of the president and vice president dates back to the watergate era in the    the irs said in a statement to mcclatchy  noting that non partisan career employees adopted the requirement   since then  this provision has remained in place during both republican and democratic administrations as well as under irs commissioners appointed by both parties  source  mcclatchybefore you get too excited  the law also specifically outlines how the president s and vice president s taxes are handled  in special orange folders  in a secure area and with confidentiality  in other words  if trump isn t breaking laws  we still won t be able to see his tax returns there is a chance that trump could get the law overturned  i don t believe there is anything that would prevent the president from   instructing that this precautionary measure of the irs audits be rescinded   said norman eisen  who as special counsel to the obama white house during the first term put in place new ethics guidelines   he could theoretically do it  trump could even go beyond having that law overturned  many republicans want to abolish the irs altogether  which is a stupid idea  one which would surely bankrupt the country  but donald trump has shown himself to be thin skinned and completely self interested  if he has a beef with the irs  the republican congress could be sympathetic featured image via drew angerer getty images
