it s no secret that house speaker paul ryan only grudgingly accepted donald trump as the gop nominee  after all  trump has made ryan s life a living hell for the last year and a half  as he has repeatedly been forced to defend  explain away  and distance himself from trump s inexcusable behavior in any number of directions  this time  though  it seems that ryan has had enough of course  we re all aware of the extraordinarily lewd tape of trump boasting of sexual assault on an access hollywood bus with the then host of the show  billy bush  as if that weren t enough to make paul ryan s head explode over the weekend  there s the fact that trump kicked off the second presidential debate not only with that tape as the scandalous backdrop  but also by digging up women who have accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct of one kind or another in the  s  or accused hillary clinton of threatening them into silence  after that gutter level nonsense from his nominee  ryan held a conference call with elected with republicans with one instruction and one instruction only  to save their own asses  don t let trump drag them down and make them lose their seats  further  ryan himself will not be campaigning with trump  and he will not be defending anymore of trump s antics because trump is a thin skinned  bullying  sniveling little boy in a dirty old man s body  he could not resist going after ryan on twitter  trump tweeted  paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget  jobs and illegal immigration and not spend his time fighting republican nominee  here is the tweet paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget  jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    asked about trump s childish tweeting  one of ryan s spokeswomen completely avoided trump  saying  the speaker is going to spend the next month focused entirely on protecting our congressional majorities in order to advance our  better way  agenda  ryan  of course  is in a tough spot of his own making  he  mitch mcconnell  and all the rest of the gopers who lined up behind trump had to know that something of this nature was coming  now  the whole party has the stench of the racist  misogynist  all around bigoted pig that is donald trump time to cash in your life insurance policy and make some funeral arrangements  gop  by the time november  rolls around  there will be nothing left of the republican party  and this is all your own faults featured image via alex wong getty images
