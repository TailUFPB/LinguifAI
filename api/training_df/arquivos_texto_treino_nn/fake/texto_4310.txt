donald trump issued a strange video after midnight on friday night to address the leaked audio of him making crude jokes about sexually assaulting women  the video  released via his facebook page had all the appearance of a hostage video  and the actual content was almost as bad referencing his comment that he would  grab them by the p y  and that he was in favor of pushing himself on women and kissing them  trump said   anyone who knows me knows these words don t reflect who i am  i said it  i was wrong  and i apologize  he then went on to say   hillary clinton and her kind have run our country into the ground   and made the allegation that  bill clinton has actually abused women  the comments come as condemnations continue to pile up against trump from his fellow republicans  and some have also called for him to completely drop out of the race  senator mark kirk of illinois  stuck in a tight race against democratic rep  tammy duckworth  called for trump to leave the race  as did former new york governor george pataki other republicans  while not calling for trump to drop out  issued condemnations  including speaker paul ryan  who disinvited him from a joint campaign event   senator ted cruz  senator marco rubio  former governor jeb bush  and senator kelly ayotte  among others trump was roundly condemned by hillary clinton s campaign  and her spokesperson issued a statement   this is horrific  we cannot allow this man to become president   her running mate  senator tim kaine also responded to trump s remarks   this kind of behavior is disgusting  it makes me sick to my stomach  some reports have indicated that senior officials hastily arranged meetings on friday night to discuss possible scenarios in which trump would be removed from the ticket  but doing so is nearly impossible at this point  and several states that allow early voting have already had ballots cast this is unquestionably a disaster for the republican party  and trump s crazed  petulant video does not help featured image via screen capture
