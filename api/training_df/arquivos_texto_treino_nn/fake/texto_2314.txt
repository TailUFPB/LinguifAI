the evidence that russia is buying us up continues to mount  and the pile is so tall it s about to tip over  while trump is busy accusing chuck schumer of being a hypocrite because he s met with russia too  a thing he openly admits and has never lied about or covered up  which is the issue with trump s people   one of his campaign advisers  j d  gordon  has decided to reverse course on his statements about why the rnc reversed its course on russia and inserted pro russian language to its platform now he s saying this   advocated for the gop platform to include language against arming ukrainians against pro russian rebels because this was in line with trump s views  expressed at a march national security meeting at the unfinished trump hotel   apparently  trump didn t want to start wwiii over ukraine  but he s perfectly willing to start it on twitter with china  mexico  and all of nato  gordon says that trump believed helping get russia out of ukraine was anathema to  improved relations with russia   the problem with  improved relations with russia  is that trump doesn t want that for world peace and unity  he wants it because he s in bed with putin  along with jared kushner  jeff sessions  and disgraced security adviser michael flynn sessions actually presided over the meeting where that plank of the platform was changed  look impossibly suspicious yet  it should  to make trump s growing ties to russia even more crystal clear here  the week that this went down was also the week that wikileaks released thousands of emails that russia had obtained via its hacks seriously  can we impeach trump now  the time for that started the day he was inaugurated  we have an entire administration selling us out to one of our biggest enemies  and an entire political party that won t do a thing about it  likely because it will make them look as corrupt as they are featured image by john moore via getty images
