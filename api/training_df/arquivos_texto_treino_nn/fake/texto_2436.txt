today  donald trump  and his team pissed off the anne frank center over his pathetically late condemnation of anti semitic crimes while visiting the national museum of african american history earlier today  trump tried to denounce hate crimes targeted against jewish people  and the anne frank center correctly pointed out that trump should have denounced those attacks far sooner  especially since trump and his administration s actions have perfectly reflected anti semitism  the center said  his statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting anti semitism  yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record  make no mistake  the antisemitism coming out of this administration is the worst we have ever seen from any administration  it was a powerful statement  and it was   true  unfortunately  the way trump s team has chosen to handle that feedback is disgraceful  later that day  white house press secretary sean spicer threw a fit and complained that trump was never good enough  for human rights organizations like the anne frank center  spicer said  i saw the statement  i wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area  the president has made clear since the day he was elected  and frankly going back to the campaign  that he is someone who seeks to unite this country  he brings a diverse group of folks into his administration  both in terms of actual positions and people who he sought the advice of  and i think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate  because of their religion  because of their gender  because of the color of their skin  and it s something he s going to continue to fight and make very  very clear that  has no place in this administration  but it s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this  it s never good enough  today  i think  was an unbelievably forceful comment by the president as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards jewish community centers  but i think that he s been very clear previous to this  spicer pretty much serves as trump s little attack dog  jumping on anyone who criticizes him and calls it like it is  here s a news flash  though   people treat trump as if he s not good enough because he s not good enough  he s incompetent  ignorant and has no idea what he s doing   and it shows  for spicer to go after the anne frank center in defense of trump is absolutely unforgivable  you can watch spicer come unhinged below  featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
