donald trump has lied about how and why he received    from the new york state government which had been earmarked to help small businesses dealing with the aftermath of the september    terrorist attacks previously  trump claimed the money was  probably a reimbursement for the fact that i allowed people  for many months  to stay in the building  use the building and store things in the building  and  the value of what i did was far greater than the money talked about  much of which was sent automatically to building owners in the area  a new expose from the new york daily news reveals that documents that trump s own company filed with the government show this to be a falsehood  the daily news says but those comments don t match the forms trump s company submitted to the new york state government requesting the money for his property  the trump building  located at  wall st those documents  exclusively obtained by the news from the empire state development corporation which administered the recovery program  show trump s company asked for those funds for  rent loss    cleanup  and  repair    not to recuperate money lost in helping people even worse  trump has previously admitted on the record that his property  wasn t affected by what happened to the world trade center   but he took the money anyway officials also told the paper that if trump had submitted forms to be reimbursed for letting people use the building  as he claims  it would have been rejected out of hand  the program was in place to help businesses get back on their feet after the devastating attack that killed thousands  not to pad the pockets of alleged billionaires the   scam from trump is part of a continuing pattern from the republican presidential nominee  in which he has spread falsehoods  made questionable claims  and profited while others are left holding the bag  this case is just a little worse than the others for how he used the worst terrorist attack in american history as cover for sucking up money featured image via flickr
