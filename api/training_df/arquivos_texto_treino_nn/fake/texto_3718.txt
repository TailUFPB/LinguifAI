over the weekend  the white supremacist group  national policy institute  held their annual conference in washington  d c   and it naturally drew some ire  a panel on anderson cooper s show laid into trump for enabling and emboldening the white supremacist movement  because  let s face it  he has with his hateful rhetoric during his campaign and by being a complete failure at effectively denouncing them trump surrogate kayleigh mcenany  however disagreed  claiming that trump repeatedly denounced white supremacists and that the  liberal media  repeatedly takes him out of context  president elect trump has repeatedly denounced racists more than any candidate in this race  and if the alt right thinks that they have a friend in the white house  it s not because of donald trump  who s repeatedly denounced racism  it s because of liberal commentators who completely take him out of context  who gloss over the fact that he has called out racism  and mischaracterize his statements like you just did when he said he called mexican immigrants rapists  that is not what he said  um  yes it is  but trump surrogates live in an alternate reality  where his words aren t actually his words   some liberal ventriloquist pretended they were trump s words the rest of the panel wasn t having it  though  journalist peter beinart  of haaretz  shot back at her  with all due respect  i really don t think that s why they think they have a friend  i did not imagine that donald trump spent years claiming that barack obama was not born in the united states  i didn t make that up  i didn t make up the fact that donald trump responded to the san bernardino attack by calling for a halt to muslim immigration into the united states you are the one who  at every turn  has tried to defend the indefensible about this man  oh  burn  mcenany apparently didn t like that  because she changed tactics and tried to invoke reagan in a horribly wrong way  given matt lews  of the daily caller  said reagan denounced bigotry and racism  she just gave us another demonstration of how trump lovers have to grasp at any straw there is in order to defend their lord and savior  king cheeto  she really sounds like a spin artist instead of someone who really understands what s happening watch the whole exchange below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
