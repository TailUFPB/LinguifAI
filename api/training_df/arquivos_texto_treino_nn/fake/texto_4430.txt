mexico does not like donald trump  and for good reason  he s accused their people of being rapists and killers  said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with  and we all know about the wall he wants to force mexico to pay for  one mexican literary magazine  called letras libres  decided to illustrate what they think of trump after all of this  their october issue features him on the cover  and it s not in a flattering light en nuestro n mero de octubre  pic twitter com   letras libres   letraslibres  september     stache is reminiscent of hitler s mustache and reads  fascista americana   or   american fascist  suffice it to say  the editors at letras libres aren t thrilled with trump  either one expert on the history of fascism said that trump s nonstop  offensive ethnic stereotyping  and his fear the foreigners rhetoric are textbook fascism  mexico is a foreign country  their people are foreigners  and trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs  both inside and outside our borders  he hates them and he wants us to hate them his ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline  when it isn t  is likewise textbook fascism  he s got the entire world worried  confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a u s  election cycle  and just generally pissed the hell off one thing he did recently was complain that mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there  but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax  mexico has a value added tax that american companies must pay when they sell products there  but mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country  even though they don t have to pay it here  our companies don t pay it here either trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that nafta is needs to be torn up  trump doesn t know what he s talking about  but that is  in fact  just another claim that mexico is stealing from us  and must be stopped in other words  letras libres sees trump for what he is  he may not quite be hitler or mussolini  yet  mostly because he s not in charge yet   but he s definitely got a very strong fascist streak featured image by win mcnamee getty images
