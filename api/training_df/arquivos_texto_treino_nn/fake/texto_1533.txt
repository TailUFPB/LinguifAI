when getting to the truth behind donald trump s scandals  there s probably nothing more revealing than trump s twitter history and his erratic behavior  time and time again  we ve seen that when trump s scandals begin to close in on him  he just gets crazier and does whatever he can to distract from the situation  and if his public behavior wasn t concerning enough  what trump does behind the closed doors of the white house is even worse according to a new report from politico  trump can t even act like a mature grown up when he watches television and sees segments about his russia scandal  behaving more like an old bitter retiree than the sitting president of the united states  trump apparently can t contain himself and resorts to yelling at the television politico states that  two advisers  said that trump would sometimes scream at television clips about the probe  into his russia investigation  because that s not incriminating or weird at all  right honestly  the best thing trump could do for his scandals and public image is to just stay the hell away from social media and cable tv   but we all know that trump can t do that  and as long as trump lacks the self control to manage his emotions or the insane amount of television and social media he consumes  these outbursts are going to get him in even more trouble this information from trump s advisers shows that trump will do anything to make this scandal go away   to the degree that he has to scream at televisions to vent his anger  this kind of uncontrollable rage is exactly what the majority of americans who voted against trump were afraid of   a man this unhinged should never have access to nuclear codes  with any luck  trump s scandals will be his downfall and we won t have to deal with him much longer featured image via mark wilson   getty images
