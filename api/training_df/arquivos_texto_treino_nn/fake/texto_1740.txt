by now  pretty much all of america can agree that donald trump needs to spend more time working and less time on the golf course   and it s not just the democrats who think this  apparently  there is now a big push from the republican party to get trump to spend less time at mar a lago republican joni ernst confessed that the gop is having a hard time defending all the time trump is spending away from his responsibilities at the white house  at an iowa town hall  ernst admitted that the gop as a whole believes that trump should drastically cut down on his costly getaways  i do wish he would spend more time in washington  dc  that s what we have the white house for  we would love to see more of those state department visits in washington  dc  i think it s smart that he does business in washington dc  so i ve had those same concerns myself  ernst then dropped this bombshell  signaling that many republicans aren t happy with how trump is performing  i have not spoken to him about the florida issue yet  but that is something i think that has been bothering not just me  but some other members of our caucus  so i think that is going to be a topic of discussion that we have when we get back to washington  ernst has criticized trump before  previously stating that he  has a number of flaws   while we can t expect that the gop will lash out at trump for taking far more golf trips than former president barack obama did  this is a step in the right direction  it seems the gop is trying to reel trump in and actually get him to perform his presidential duties  they probably won t succeed  but their attempts show that trump s honeymoon period is coming to an end as he has nothing to show for his first  days in office featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
