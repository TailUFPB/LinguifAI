republicans are hilarious when they try to point out democratic hypocrisy  they re even more hilarious when they fall flat on their faces with it  as opposed to being merely embarrassed by it  such is the case with texas rep  mike conaway  who weighed in on the growing body of evidence that vladimir putin actually ordered the operation to help trump and harm hillary   an operation which included hacking the dnc and other systems and his comparison is simply beyond ridiculous to conaway  the issue is simply that there were foreigners all over the place whose purpose was swaying our election to one side or the other  harry reid and the democrats brought in mexican soap opera stars  singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into las vegas  to entertain  get out the vote and so forth  those are foreign actors  foreign people  influencing the vote in nevada  you don t hear the democrats screaming and saying one word about that  he went on with this utter gem  t s foreign influence  if we re worried about foreign influence  let s have the whole story  oh  well  okay then  since a performance from a mexican singer with a latino american group is totally the same thing as a hostile foreign leader engaging in cyber warfare against us  then the case is closed  go home  folks  there s nothing more to see here twitter didn t go home  though  they piled on him for this    vicentefernande vicente fernandez also sang for  georgewbush at the  gop convention  conaway ur an idiot   rfh     january     so was it okay for nigel farage to appear at trump rallies  or was that the equivalent of russian hacking   ralstonreports  howard klion     january    ralstonreports   texans are more foreign in nevada than latinos   beth crispin   iyamiyam  january     mike conaway  r midland   who serves on the house intelligence committee  is a moron who needs to resign https   t co   kim oconnor   kimoco  january      concerts  only thing   seems to get right is that  democrats performed strongly in the state on election day  https   t co   stewart boss   stewboss  january     mexican singers are not a hostile foreign govt  are you really that fucking stupid  oh wait  texas  answer is yes  cunt  james william townse     january     how is an open mexican artist openly supporting a candidate the same as russian covert op  hacking the dnc the same thing   guardianofwhills   gilinreallife  january      theiia you are one stupid sob if you believe that babble about mexican singers  idiotic and treasonous comment old man  fu  putinspuppet   presidentdimwit  january    sits on the house permanent select committee on intelligence  and is a member of the nsa and cybersecurity subcommittee there  so what the hell is he smoking  he ought to know differently  rep  joaquin castro  a fellow lawmaker from texas says conaway does know better  and assumes he was joking however  others  like rep  luis gutierrez of illinois  aren t as sure  in fact  gutierrez threw it back in conaway s face  more or less  by asking what trump s meeting with mexico s president during the campaign cycle he also pointed out that republicans often run political ads on stations that play hispanic music  the goal is to find ways to reach out to the fastest growing demographic in the u s  that s what campaigning is all about but that doesn t matter to republicans  they care about trying to make democrats look bad  and in the face of the growing russian hacking scandal  they re getting increasingly desperate featured image by lance cheung  u s  dept  of agriculture  under cc by   via flickr
