florida senator marco rubio actually knows something the rest of us know for once  that there aren t enough racists in america   or even the congress   to pass donald trump s new immigration bill  the bill would curb even legal immigration  setting a completely arbitrary limit on how many total people could come to america through traditional methods last wednesday  trump trotted out that annoying kid from the comey hearing  tom cotton  and human stegosaurus david perdue to unveil the raise act  a singularly horrible piece of legislation that would among other things require proficiency in english  advanced degrees  and or high paying job offers in order to legally immigrate to this country  team trump called it  merit based  immigration  but as an online quiz posted almost immediately by time highlighted  even most americans wouldn t have enough  merit  to apply for a visa the real question is  if people without degrees  skills  or  merit   as trump said  are the ones coming to america  how are they stealing all of our jobs now marco rubio is on the record setting trump and his lackeys  from two of the states that would suffer the most by curtailing immigration  straight on this bill s chances that bill s not going to pass    i think the white house knows that you don t have  votes for that in the senate rubio  a cuban american from miami  has some pretty understandable differences with trump and other republicans when it comes to immigration  after all  the unspoken fact is that every immigration bill is primarily aimed at spanish speaking would be immigrants but lest you think marco is some kind of hero for breaking with the president on this  you have to remember   he is still a republican where i probably have a big difference of opinion with this bill is that it sets an arbitrary cap on the number of people that are able to come through with a green card  i don t think that should be an arbitrary cap  that number should be driven by demand i see  so we just let in as many as we want here  and what about the idiotic idea of advancing a  century meritocracy in  the very controversial gang of eight  four democrats and four republicans  proposed moving legal immigration to a merit based system but  wasn t marco one of the four republicans he s talking about  so marco rubio still wants horrible  backwards immigration policy  just not quite as horrible and backwards as donald trump s it s good to know you have standards  senator read more featured image via tasos katopodis getty images
