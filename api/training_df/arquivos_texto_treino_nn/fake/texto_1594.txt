massachusetts rep  jim mcgovern brought the house down with a scathing rebuke of the pathetic republican healthcare bill on tuesday he began by pointing out that the bill destroys all of the good things that the affordable care act provides  such as covering preexisting conditions and allowing kids to stay on their parents  insurance until the age of  mcgovern conceded that the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  is not perfect  it has some issues that can be fixed  and democrats have repeatedly offered to work with republicans to fix the problems and cover more people while also bringing down costs but as mcgovern noted  republicans are only obsessed with repealing the law  they have no interest in fixing the minor problems  many of which they created themselves by chipping away at the law over the years so far  the republican bill touted by trump has failed several times in the house because even many republicans are concerned about the fact that repealing the affordable care act would strip healthcare away from millions of americans  including their own constituents for months  republicans have been torn a new one by their constituents at town halls over their effort to repeal what has become a very popular law  it is even more popular than donald trump now in their continued effort to sell the bill to the american people  trump and house republicans have been insisting that it covers pre existing conditions  but that is a complete lie nowhere in the trumpcare bill will you find a passage making it clear that people with pre existing conditions won t lose their insurance  it s just not there mcgovern called out republicans for this lie on the house floor  to claim or to imply that the republican plan covers people with preexisting conditions  it is a lie   mcgovern declared  it is a lie  and let s be honest about it  this does not cover people with preexisting conditions  and to come on the floor and say it does  to try to fool people  well  you may get away with it in the short term  you may get a headline but i tell you people will figure out soon enough when they are denied health care coverage  furthermore  republicans refuse to get a cbo score for the bill before holding a vote because they know it will get a failing grade for one thing  the bill would be a massive tax cut for the wealthy at the expense of the millions of americans who finally got healthcare coverage through the medicaid expansion mcgovern shamed republicans for this  you should be ashamed   mcgovern said   to have a health care bill that cuts medicaid by   billion so you can give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country  you should be ashamed  he then called upon republicans to vote against the bill or pull it entirely and received a standing ovation here s the video via youtube if trump and republicans have their way  millions of americans will suffer so that wealthy assholes can get even richer  that s outrageous but even more outrageous is the fact that while the american people will lose the benefits of the affordable care act  republicans have exempted themselves from losing the same benefits the law provides that s right  republicans are literally making sure that they get to keep their obamacare  that makes them heartless and selfish as well as hypocrites  they should not only be ashamed  they should be booted out of office featured image screenshot
