the way president elect donald trump has treated the press during his presidential campaign  only to get far worse after winning the election  is nothing but terrifying  trump has not only ditched press pools and created distrust for the media  but he has issued threats to punish or silence reporters for doing their jobs and holding him accountable  trump has never sounded more like a dictator  and quite frankly we should all be very worried about what he s going to do once he gets into the white house fortunately  the press is fighting back  editor in chief and publisher of the columbia journalism review kyle pope has just written an open letter to trump on behalf of the u s  press corps  and it s a strong message to trump that things aren t going to go the way he wants them to go  pope wrote  in these final days before your inauguration  we thought it might be helpful to clarify how we see the relationship between your administration and the american press corps  pope then expertly outlined several attacks trump has made on the press which have made the relationship between trump and journalists extremely tense  pope said  you ve banned news organizations from covering you  you ve taken to twitter to taunt and threaten individual reporters and encouraged your supporters to do the same  you ve advocated for looser libel laws and threatened numerous lawsuits of your own  none of which has materialized  but while you have every right to decide your ground rules for engaging with the press  we have some  too  pope noted that even if trump tried to prevent journalists from having access to him  the media would not back down  pope warned the president elect that the press would merely take it on as a  challenge   we are very good at finding alternative ways to get information   telling reporters that they won t get access to something isn t what we d prefer  but it s a challenge we relish  signaling that what trump has really done by suppressing the media is unite it  pope stated that the press would be working together to hold him accountable now  specifically pointing out a disgusting incident in which trump belittled and attacked cnn reporter jim acosta at a press conference last week  we now recognize that the challenge of covering you requires that we cooperate and help one another whenever possible  so  when you shout down or ignore a reporter at a press conference who has said something you don t like  you re going to face a unified front  we ll work together on stories when it makes sense  and make sure the world hears when our colleagues write stories of importance  pope made it perfectly clear that journalists were not going to play by his rules and have every intention of being involved in covering his presidency honestly and with transparency  no matter how much he hates it or threatens them  pope said  we ve been around since the founding of the republic  and our role in this great democracy has been ratified and reinforced again and again and again  enjoy your inauguration  this is exactly what we needed our press to say to this tyrant  and we hope it terrifies him featured image via drew angerer   getty images
