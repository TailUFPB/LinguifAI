steve bannon has a clear  strong agenda for trump s relationship with the press  the far right white supremacist just did a rare interview with the new york times  which is ironic considering how much he seems to hate the press  and he took the opportunity to paint the press as an incompetent enemy  in that interview  he said  point blank  the media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while  listen to what  more of trump s lies  the press should let his lies go unchallenged  just for the record  the press does not like being told they can t challenge public figures  the press does not like being muzzled so  one member of the press  cnn s jake tapper  responded to that with something thoughtful and eloquent  yet appropriately brief  watch below  no     jaketapper to steve bannon pic twitter com   colin jones   colinjones  january    he s laughing at the very notion of shutting up and listening  it s brilliant in the face of bannon saying   sit down  shut up  and let him lie all he wants   that s really what it comes down to   letting the administration put forth unchecked lies so they can create the reality they want  in fact  bannon actually told the times to quote him on this  i want you to quote this   mr  bannon added   the media here is the opposition party  they don t understand this country  they still do not understand why donald trump is the president of the united states   so the media should shut up  stop with the criticism  stop with the challenges  it hurts donald s little feefees and we just can t have that too bad for them that the press isn t going to listen featured image via screen capture from embedded video
