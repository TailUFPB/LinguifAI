former president george h  w  bush can teach donald trump a thing or two about handling conflicts of interest as january  approaches  donald trump is apparently poised to violate the constitution the moment he finishes reciting the oath of office because he has yet to properly eliminate the conflicts of interest between himself and his family business public officials are not allowed to use their office to to influence policies that would increase profits of a company they have a personal stake in  by not putting his assets  including the trump organization and any stocks he owns  into a blind trust or sells them off  trump is violating the the emoluments clause and breaking decades of precedent the most example is when jimmy carter sold the peanut business he built from the ground up to avoid conflicts of interest  of course  republicans initiated a series of witch hunts against carter s business anyway in a desperate effort to find a scandal  today  republicans don t care if trump continues to own his business  even though he is already using the presidency to make business deals and bring in profits indeed  when ivanka trump sat in during a meeting between her father and the japanese prime minister  her company was in the middle of working on a deal with a japanese company as newsweek explained at the same time  officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with sanei international  the largest shareholder of sanei s parent company is the development bank of japan  which is wholly owned by the japanese government headed by abe trump has also talked to the president of taiwan and the leader of argentina  where trump s company is trying to secure deals to build hotels  clearly  trump is flagrantly using the presidency to enrich himself and his company george h w  bush warned his own family not to do this or even make it appear that they are doing it by sending each family member a letter in  in the midst of the presidential election the elder bush told his family that people are going to try to be their friend but that  friendship  could result in asking for favors simply because they are connected to the leader of the free world  if there is a legitimate inquiry  call my office   bush wrote   it is certainly appropriate to contact your own government  but let s do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence  in other words  bush told his family not to call him on their friend s behalf  they have to call his office themselves bush knew all too well that   every effort will be made to find some phone call  some inquiry  some letter that can be made to appear improper  here s the full letter via twitter pic twitter com   eric lipton   ericliptonnyt  december    trump  however  is influenced by his business and since his children are deeply involved in the company  that means they ll have special access to him and will be able to curry favors such as asking him to gut certain regulations or asking him to call certain foreign leaders to push through business deals that s a serious ethics violation that cannot be tolerated  hell  eric trump has already been busted trying to sell access to his father in exchange for   million donations to his fraudulent charity  so it s pretty clear that there is already a pay for play scandal brewing before trump has even taken office this needs to stop now and the only way it will stop is if trump sells his company or puts it into a blind trust  anything less is unacceptable featured image  wikimedia
