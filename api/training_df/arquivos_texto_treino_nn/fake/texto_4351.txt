remember when fox host sean hannity directly asked donald trump if he would ever accept money from a country like saudi arabia that treats women  christians  and jews like shit and he said he wouldn t hannity began by claiming that the clinton foundation accepted   million from the saudi arabian government and trump has repeatedly demanded that the charity give the money back but trump nor hannity have any proof of their claim  and politifact could not find any evidence that hillary clinton personally solicited funds from the saudis  saudi arabia did donate at least   million to the foundation to contribute to the building of the clinton presidential library  but the saudis also donated the same amount toward building the george h  w  bush library politifact further noted that the saudi government never donated any money to the foundation while hillary clinton served as secretary of state  thus undermining trump s accusations that hillary was involved in a pay to play scheme with saudi arabia but while trump whined about the clinton foundation s relationship with the saudis  he told hannity that he wouldn t take money from them here s the video via youtube just to jog your memory well  it turns out that trump lied back in   the republican nominee did big business with saudi arabia and had absolutely no problem doing so according to the new york daily news trump sold the  floor of trump world tower to the kingdom of saudi arabia for    million the five apartments included  bedrooms and  bathrooms at the time of the sale  and had yearly common charges of    for building amenities if those common charges remain the same  trump was paid at least    million by the saudi government since  so while trump attacks hillary over donations made to the clinton foundation  he has literally been doing business with the saudi government and taking millions of dollars from them since  this is yet another example of how trump doesn t practice what he preaches to his conservative fans it s been revealed that trump tried to do business with fidel castro s cuba in direct violation of the embargo that has been in place for decades in response to cuba s human rights record  trump also does business with china by purchasing steel and other metals from companies there instead of companies in the united states  thus helping china topple american companies while screwing over american workers  trump also furnishes his hotels with goods not made in the usa and even offers qurans to any guest who requests one despite bashing islam on the campaign trail in short  donald trump is a lying hypocrite as usual featured image  alex wong getty images
