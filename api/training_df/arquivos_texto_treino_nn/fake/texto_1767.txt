trump was supposed to be a non interventionist  but  allegedly as soon as he saw videos of poisoned children on cable news  the same children he doesn t want coming here because other videos that were edited showed him that refugees were all big  burly   something men and not mothers and children   he decided we had to intervene in syria  and he attacked  then he attacked afghanistan with the biggest bomb we have then he was lauded for both moves  and also lauded for giving more control over this kind of thing to his generals  but army vet jason kander  speaking on cnn s  state of the union   has hit the nail on the head for why trump really gave that control to his generals  i believe he wants to take credit for good things when they happen  and blame generals when bad things happen  kander also explained that there were only two acceptable answers to why trump would make such a move  he s the commander in chief  and he also needs to defend the reasoning behind why a commander on the ground actually made the decision to bomb afghanistan with the biggest one we ve got had the moab failed to do anything at all  trump would definitely have blamed the general who actually authorized dropping it  kander backed his position up by explaining how trump blamed the generals who were in charge of the failed yemen raid  where we lost navy seal ryan owens  instead of saying   we lost him   trump said   the generals lost him   kander also used trump s own pseudo explanation of whether he authorized the moab drop to back that truth bomb up  if you think back to when he was asked whether or not he approved the dropping of the moab in afghanistan  his answer was something along the lines of  it started with  uh   and then it went from  uh   to  everybody knew exactly what was going on   which was  of course  the opposite of true  i mean  he was giving that answer because he didn t want people to know exactly whether he approved it or not  trump won t take responsibility for failures  even military ones watch kander savage trump over it below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
