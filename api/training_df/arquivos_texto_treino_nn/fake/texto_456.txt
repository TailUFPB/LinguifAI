this is why religion should stay out of government the people of houston  texas are drowning as flooding continues in the aftermath of hurricane harvey death and destruction are everywhere  and people are desperate for any help that can be provided  people need food  shelter  clothing  and medical supplies at this point  the people of houston don t really care where the aid comes from as long as it comes but texas  republican secretary of state rejected an offer from canada this week that would have provided blankets  beds  and physical manpower to the region affected by the storm quebec s minister of international relations christine st pierre contacted rolando pablos to offer aid and condolences  it was a conversation about how devastating the situation is and we want to express our support to the people of texas   st pierre said had pablos accepted canada s help  many people in texas could have had blankets  pillows  and perhaps even something more crucial  the manpower canada offered would have come in the form of professional electricians who would have helped restore much needed power to residents and buildings such as hospitals and shelters  our crews are well equipped and they have good knowledge of the grid so they can help to restore and rebuild the distribution lines   hydro qu bec spokesperson louis olivier batty told cbc  indeed   hydro quebec electricians did great work restoring power in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in  canada offered real help to storm victims  but republicans slapped away their hand of friendship  instead of accepting the generous offer of supplies and volunteers  texas republicans rejected the offer and asked for  prayers from the people of quebec  that s right  texas republicans think prayers can help them more than actual supplies and manpower what the people of texas need right now are not prayers  they need blankets  beds  and electrical power  all of which are in short supply because god sent a f cking hurricane to slam the texas coast the people of texas should be outraged that their elected officials are not accepting help from canada  this offer could mean the difference between life and death for many people  prayer is not going to help  it s a nice thought  but it won t do any good  people can t get warm by wrapping themselves in prayer  electrical lines won t magically fix themselves because of prayer this is why republicans are totally unfit to lead  they offer prayers instead of real solutions  and that is going to cause more deaths and suffering in texas featured image  screenshot
