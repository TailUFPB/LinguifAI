fox news  purveyor of lies branded as  news   has finally decided to drop the act and tell the world who they really are  in a fairly surprising move  they re dropping their  fair and balanced  slogan  the slogan was roger ailes  from the time the network was launched  but it s come under increasing fire for sexual harassment and assault allegations  the slogan is too closely tied to the worst harasser there was there ailes himself so the network s management decided to drop it and just when you thought they might actually be doing something right  they twisted reality again to fit their own warped view of themselves  the new slogan will be   most watched  most trusted  sure most trusted by people who don t know what facts are  when roger ailes came up with  fair and balanced   it was because he felt doing right wing news branded as such was a recipe for failure  that slogan had become the nearly religious mantra behind their ongoing push of conservative ideology  no matter how outrageous  or  dare we say it  false  the stories were fox news has always seemed to be anti fact because of that  and despite their  fair and balanced  slogan  but  most trusted   in   they weren t  at least  not among adults who had heard of them or in comparison to other networks  including cnn  however  earlier this year  rasmussen found that more fox news viewers trust fox news than cnn viewers trust cnn maybe that s what they mean by  most trusted   of course  conservatives are allergic to factual reporting and so of course more of them would see fox news as trustworthy as for the  most watched  part  their ratings have been slipping ever since it came out that there s a serious problem with sexual harassment there  at the end of may  fox news had fallen to third place behind cnn and msbnc for prime time viewership  that was the first time in  years that had happened so  most trusted   sure  if you re a right wing nutjob who s allergic to facts  truth and history   most watched   that s a far more difficult claim to make  maybe they believe they ll regain their top spot  and there s nothing wrong with believing that  but changing their slogan is probably only a tiny step towards convincing any sane person that they re capable of sticking to truth and facts  particularly with people like tucker carlson and sean hannity still on the air featured image via frederick m  brown getty images
