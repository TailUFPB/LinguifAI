donald trump has had a rocky relationship with the press ever since his presidential campaign  and he s only punished them further for trying to report the truth since becoming the president elect on monday  trump was set to have an off the record meeting with television networks to try and hash out presidential press access  this meeting was particularly important because trump has previously limited press access  and has ditched two protocol press pools since getting elected some reporters in attendance were nbc s deborah turness  lester holt and chuck todd  abc s james goldston  george stephanopoulos  david muir and martha raddatz  cbs  norah o donnell and charlie rose  fox news  bill shine  jack abernethy  jay wallace  suzanne scott  msnbc s phil griffin  and cnn s jeff zucker and erin burnett  it was a good group  and it could have been a very effective meeting if only things had gone according to plan unfortunately  instead of having a respectful conversation and coming up with an amicable way to move forward  what the press got was a baby trump temper tantrum of epic proportions  or  as one person put it   it was like a f cking firing squad  trump made zero attempt to hide his disrespect for the media  according to the new york post  one anonymous source said  the meeting was a total disaster  the tv execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the trump administration  but instead they got a trump style dressing down  this claim was backed up by another person  who said  the meeting took place in a big board room and there were about  or  people  including the big news anchors from all the networks  trump kept saying   we re in a room of liars  the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong  he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest  deceitful liars  he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar  and cnn was network of liars  this attack left reporters stunned  and even as they tried to keep bringing up press access to stay on topic  trump barely let them speak  while this is certainly shocking  this behavior is completely typical of trump  he has always hated the free press because it has held him accountable and reported on his mistakes and shortcomings americans on social media are already coming to terms with how terrifying this is twittertwittertwitterinterestingly enough  trump spokeswoman kellyanne conway had the nerve to say the meeting went well  she said  excellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks  pretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days  disgraceful featured image by christopher furlong via getty images
