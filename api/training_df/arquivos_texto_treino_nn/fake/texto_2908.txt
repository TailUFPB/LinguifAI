sean spicer got off to a bit of a rocky start as white house press secretary on saturday when he embarrassed himself  his president  his country  and pretty much anyone who has so much as heard of the united states  with his trainwreck of a press briefing  spicer chose to kick off his new  exciting  and likely short career by focusing on the issues that matter the most   like trump s crowd size despite a turnout that was dwarfed many times over by a stampede of nasty women descending on washington d c  to tell trump to go f ck himself  spicer claimed that this was the largest audience to witness an inauguration  period   this was  of course  a gigantic lie  according to spicer  the crowd only looked small because they used  floor coverings  to protect the grass and this somehow transformed a large percentage of the crowd into vampires who were unable to be captured by a single recording device  though we suppose that white area could have been the tops of trump fans  hoods creating the illusion of an empty space  alec baldwin may not have reprised his role as the donald this week  much to the dismay of an eager populace  but he did stop by twitter to have some fun with spicer  delivering a kick to sean hannity s deploraballs for good measure sean spicer reminds me of sean hannity  another hopped up  no talent white boy who thinks he s right and clever  both are neither   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january    also dropped an important message of hope on americans  reminding us that the rallies  the marches  the protests  and everything else that causes donald trump to cry himself to sleep at night are a good start  but it is up to each and every one of us to keep hope alive because eventually this nightmare will be over and we will work to fix whatever damage he is able to do together   all of today s rallies  marches  protests are a beginning  the great responsibility now is to keep those fires burning   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january     trump and his kleptocratic handlers are banking on everyone hitting the wall  burning out  they are counting on your fatigue   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january     i pray that we show them that  while we hit times like these  times of inconceivable bleakness fueled by the avarice and ego of trump  abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january     this will end  and from this we will find someone  whoever they may be  who will rebuild this government   abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january     trump wants to take the principles of american democracy  honed over many years  and smash them out of hatred and fear  reminds u of    abfoundation   abfalecbaldwin  january    is right  saturday  we saw one of the largest civil rights marches in history  the marches need to get bigger  the message that we are not going to tolerate his brand of hatred must get louder  and we as americans   a nation of people who were forged from and tempered by adversity   need to stand together against anything he throws at us featured image via screengrab
