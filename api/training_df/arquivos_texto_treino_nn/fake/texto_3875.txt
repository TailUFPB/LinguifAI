the election result tonight is hard to swallow for many of us  donald trump is so deeply unpresidential in so many ways  it s hard to imagine we live in a country that would actually stoop so low as to elect him  and the hardest part might be explaining it to those that just don t have the tools yet to understand   especially when we re having trouble grasping it ourselves nobody has made that point better than cnn s van jones  who makes a passionate and stirring point about the difficulty for some parents in explaining to their children how a person like donald trump could become president  he s also right about his other point   donald trump is the result of  whitelash   it s the middle finger from white america for electing barack obama  and for daring to nominate hillary clinton  this was about race  and it was about sexism   and it was about gerrymandered districts which gave the republican party more electoral representation per vote than the democratic party here s the video of his comments  courtesty of now this featured image via screenshot
