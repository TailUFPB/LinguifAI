it takes one to know one  turkey just held a referendum that greatly expands the power of their president  recep tayyip erdogan  it passed by a very narrow margin  taking turkey on its latest step toward brutal dictatorship  and here s donald trump  who sources say called erdogan to congratulate him on  winning  the referendum vote while we re busy justifying blowing up absolutely nothing in syria because a brutal dictator used sarin gas on his people  trump is busy calling someone who s working hard on becoming the region s next brutal dictator to congratulate him on furthering that goal this referendum  according to the daily beast  moves turkey away from a parliamentary democracy and towards one person rule  but what he has already done there makes the referendum more of a formality  erdogan had already managed to form a one party government   a move that greatly diminishes the voices of opposition last year  erdogan asked turkey s parliament to redefine the country s anti extremism law to include politicians  journalists and members of academia  he claimed that  pro kurdish  politicians were inciting terrorism  and journalists and academics were spreading the info that allowed the politicians to do so  therefore  they are all terrorists branding press as  the enemy  is something trump has been trying to do here  as the washington post s front page motto says   democracy dies in darkness   this is the darkness and now  erdogan is  more or less  the sole ruler of turkey but what does trump care  it wouldn t be surprising to find that he wishes something like that would happen here  too  if for no other reason than it would help cement his overinflated opinion of himself as a great man who is beloved by all  with nobody left to shine a light on the truth  like  oh  say  a free press the way the turkey referendum was held has appalled international election monitors  according to them   voters were not provided with adequate information  opposition voices were muzzled and the rules were changed at the last minute   in short  this was not a truly democratic process good job continuing to support authoritarian rulers over true democracies  trump  you re about as un american as it gets featured image by mark wilson via getty images
