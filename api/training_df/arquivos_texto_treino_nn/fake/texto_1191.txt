so many questions have come up in the wake of james comey s senate testimony  house minority leader nancy pelosi is again asking the harsh but necessary question   what do the russians have on donald trump  pretty much everyone is in agreement that thursday s testimony by james comey was totally devastating for trump  even trump s buddies over at fox news are admitting it was  very damaging for the president  by far the most incriminating statement made by comey was that he couldn t  remember any conversations with the president about the russia election  the fact the russia attempted to control the outcome of the u s  presidential election is indisputable at this point  what s curious is that trump had no interest in the fact that our democracy was attacked and how we remain susceptible to attacks in the future this total lack of concern for foreign election hijack prompted pelsoi in a press conference on friday to ask some critical questions  so again i ask the question  what do the russians have on donald trump   politically  personally  or financially   that he just won t go to that place and instead enshrines them  sings and dances to their tune  and republicans in congress have been resistant to finding it   have resisted finding out the truth  so i think there are other remedies that we can exhaust  i respect the opinion of those who think he should come  but i think we   if the republicans in congress would be more  shall we say  open to facts and the truth  we can learn a lot without the president coming here  comey warned us on thursday   they re coming after america   why does that not concern or pique any interest from the president  see what pelosi has to say about it photo by drew angerer getty images
