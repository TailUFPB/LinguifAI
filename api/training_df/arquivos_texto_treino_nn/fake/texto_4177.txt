we ve heard all kinds of reasons why people shouldn t vote for trump  and why they shouldn t even have accepted trump to begin with  trump really should never have gotten this far in the election process  but his lack of sound policy  his racist  xenophobic hyper nationalism and his misogyny are actually only part of the reason  the rest of the reason lies squarely on the skin that s as thick as a single layer of gauze voters  confidence in the democratic system is always shaken when their candidate loses  according to democracy expert shaun bowler  this is true even when the elections are known to be fair  bowler says  collectively  the responses show that when voters see their candidate lose  their regard for the system of government as a whole takes a hit  even within an established democracy and after an election that was not especially controversial  we see weakening legitimacy of the system in the eyes of losers  trump has made his thinking very clear  if he wins  the election was fair  if he loses  it was rigged from the start  he will undoubtedly shout that repeatedly at the end of election night instead of give a measured concession speech designed to reassure his supporters that democracy still works  and they ll still be in good hands  he ll do it every day afterwards until people stop listening  too trump is a very sore loser  he was a sore loser in the primaries  and now  with his entire campaign falling apart  he s spinning wild conspiracies about how everything happening is specifically designed to take him down the problem lies in the unrest that could easily follow such a declaration after the votes are counted  his supporters are all in solid agreement with him that the polls are rigged  the press is bought and paid for  and the entire planet  except russia  of course  has been set up to put the woman they call  crooked hillary  into office  we ve already seen people  like this sheriff  call for armed revolt if trump loses  because of that paranoia we ve seen other trump supporters say that as well  in fact  mike pence  who would understand this much better than trump or his average supporter  despite being evil in his own right  had to shut down a trumpkin in l a  who was calling for armed revolution  our lives depend on this election  our kids  futures depend on this election and i will tell you just for me  and i don t want this to happen but i will tell you for me personally if hillary clinton gets in  i myself  i m ready for a revolution because we can t have her in  pence s reply was a quick   don t say that   however  he still encouraged people to volunteer as poll watchers to be sure that no fraud happens three white men  who turned out to be trump supporters  were arrested for planning to blow up a mosque and an apartment complex full of somali refugees the day after election day other supporters are saying they re going to menace anyone who doesn t appear to be american at the polls  i ll look for       well  it s called racial profiling  mexicans  syrians  people who can t speak american  i m going to go right up behind them  i ll do everything legally  i want to see if they are accountable  i m not going to do anything illegal  i m going to make them a little bit nervous  there s no reason to believe that this stuff won t happen  because trump is fueling it  rather than trying to quell it  in his story  bowler points out what actually has happened in other countries where the people believed their elections were rigged  remember  the lowered levels of regard for the system  occurred in an election in which no candidate was crying foul  crying foul widens the gap in opinions  undermining the support for and legitimacy of the system as a whole we have seen this in recent elections in mexico  ukraine  and georgia  the consequence has been popular unrest and disturbances  one could argue that several of those elections were  in fact   dirty   and so people were right to protest at an election being stolen   genuine corruption is another demonstrable way to undermine faith in democracy   but problems come when the election was clean and yet the losing politician refuses to accept the result was arrived at fairly   there s virtually no evidence that any of our elections have ever been rigged  with the possible exception of a few local elections through history  it s easier for these paranoid lunatics to believe in a vast conspiracy  though  than it is for them to face the truth that their candidate could easily lose in a fair election  the unrest that would follow  due to trump s fueling such conspiracy nonsense  could be devastating for us  they will not accept evidence that doesn t support their point   it ll be part of  the conspiracy  even the gop is afraid of what trump s  it s rigged  rigged  i tell you   rhetoric can do  lindsey graham said  i don t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason  former senator kit bondi  of missouri  said something similar  someone claiming in the election   i was defrauded   isn t going to cut it  they re going to have to say how  where  why  when  trump won t  though  he ll just say he knows  because hillary s crimes and democratic enabling and corruption are well documented  and will expect that to be sufficient now republicans are crying about mounting evidence that their candidate isn t just rude  crude  vile  and impossibly thick  but is also a sexual predator  they made their bed  if we end up with trump in the white house  what he unleashes on the world will be on their heads  if we end up with civil unrest because of trump s sour grapes after losing  it s likewise squarely on their heads it ll be interesting to see how they try and wriggle out of responsibility for this featured image by sarah rice via getty images
