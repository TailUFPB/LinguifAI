just when you thought trump might have calmed down while basking in the glow of his written for him speech at the joint address  he decides to come out and make zero sense with a chopped up statement about attorney general jeff sessions  he could have just left it as a statement on his facebook page and offered a link to it  but no  he decided to appear as crazy as ever keep in mind it was about eight minutes between tweets   that s a lot of words for his tiny thumbs he tweeted  jeff sessions is an honest man  he did not say anything wrong  he could have stated his response more accurately  but it was clearly not intentional  this whole narrative is a way of saving face for democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win  the democrats are overplaying their hand  they lost the election and now  they have lost their grip on reality  the real story is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information  it is a total witch hunt  jeff sessions is an honest man  he did not say anything wrong  he could have stated his response more accurately  but it was clearly not    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    intentional  this whole narrative is a way of saving face for democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    to win  the democrats are overplaying their hand  they lost the election  and now they have lost their grip on reality  the real story  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information  it is a total  witch hunt    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    of all  sessions didn t only lie  he lied under oath  which is otherwise known as perjury  trump then saying he he could have been more accurate also proves he lied secondly  this has nothing to do with democrats and everything to do with listening to our entire intelligence community and following through with evidence that russia interfered with our election  something trump doesn t want to look into  because a   he either took part in it or b   because he won and doesn t want the results changed  both reasons prove he cares nothing about the sanctity of american democracy lastly  saying there are leaks and that there s nothing there in the same sentence contradicts itself  which is it  are there leaks with info getting out about russia  or is there nothing there  can t be both trump is running in circles and is clearly panicked  he s trying to say there s nothing wrong with any of this and it s all everyone else s fault  never his   meanwhile  he s making himself look pretty damn guilty having twitter fits late in the evening isn t a good look on anyone featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
