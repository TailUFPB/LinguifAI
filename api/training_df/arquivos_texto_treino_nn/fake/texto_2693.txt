earlier in the week  there were leaked draft executive orders circulating that would strike president obama s executive order protections for lgbtq federal workers  there were also rumors that donald trump would sign a sweeping  broadly worded  religious freedom  bill into law that would effectively legalize discrimination nationwide  however  trump and his famously homophobic vice president  mike pence  ran into a road block  trump s kids  specifically  his son in law jared kushner and his daughter ivanka trump jared and ivanka have long been seen to be the reasonable  moderating influences that are needed to calm trump s impulsive  erratic temperament  it appears that this is what happened here  ivanka and jared see all of the fear and the protests in the streets against trump  and they feared that there would be even more national and international backlash against trump s bigotry via executive order  therefore  there was a complete reversal on these orders of course  white house press secretary sean spicer outright lied when asked about it  he insisted that these orders were just a couple out of hundreds that were being considered  then  of course  a statement was hastily rushed out  saying that the trump administration is  determined to protect the rights of all americans  including the lgbtq community  considering all of the virulently anti lgbtq people trump has around him   namely mike pence   i don t believe that for so much as a second  if ivanka and jared can keep trump s hands away from the lgbtq community for the time being  though  all the better  hopefully it will hold until   and we manage to take congress back  thus crippling the amount of damage trump and pence can do until they are out of office while their reasons were political rather than noble  at this point  it s better than nothing featured image via aaron p  bernstein   stringer getty images
