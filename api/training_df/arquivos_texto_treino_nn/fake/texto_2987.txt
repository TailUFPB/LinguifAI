donald trump is paving the way for russian aggression against europe and admitted it during an interview with european newspapers trump has had a cozy relationship with putin ever since russia helped him win the election in november in fact  that was the consummation of a relationship that began months earlier when trump started attacking nato and made it clear that he intends to eliminate sanctions that were slapped against russia after putin seized the crimea from ukraine now trump is practically inviting russia to be more aggressive in putin s pursuit of tyrannical rule  i said a long time ago that nato had problems   trump told the times of london on sunday   number one it was obsolete because it was designed many  many years ago  number two the countries weren t paying what they re supposed to be paying  trump then went on to praise putin and stated his intention to make  some good deals  with russia  which apparently involves weakening nato and europe as a whole so russia can attack to that end  trump also wants to see the european union dissolve  which would cause transatlantic chaos not seen since world war ii  people want their own identity  so if you ask me  more countries will leave   trump remarked when asked about the united kingdom s regretful vote to exit the eu in other words  trump wants europe to return to the nationalism that divided nations against each other and caused the deaths of millions  the two world wars were the reason why the european union was created in the first place  not to mention the economic benefits both sides of the atlantic have enjoyed according to the washington post the full ramifications of a breakdown in transatlantic relations are so extensive they are difficult to total  u s  guarantees underpin european security  the united states and the european union  with a population of  million  are each other s most important trading partner  for decades  european nations and the united states have worked tightly together on issues of war  peace and trade  the incoming u s  president is the first american leader since world war ii not to support european integration  the european union has long been considered to be in the u s  interest  because it created a unified market for u s  businesses  provided a bulwark against communism during the cold war and helped quell the bloody slaughter that cost u s  lives  among others  in the first half of the  century  after the breakup of the soviet union  the european union expanded eastward into formerly communist nations  a development that leaders there say helped bring rule of law and stability as they modernized their economies the only nation that would directly benefit from the fall of nato and the european union would be russia  while america and the various european nations suffer weaker economies and weaker national security in other words  trump truly is putin s puppet and the world is about to become more dangerous because of it featured image via screenshot
