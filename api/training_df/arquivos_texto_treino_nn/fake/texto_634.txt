mitch mcconnell is not a happy man  that s probably true in general  especially considering he wakes up every morning only to find a bespectacled testudine in the mirror when he goes to brush his beak teeth  but speaking to a rotary club in his home state of kentucky on monday  poor mitch seemed even more glum than usual  if you can imagine  his mood was darker than the night john mccain cut mcconnell s healthcare bill down the belly with a caesarean thumbs down on the senate floor why was he so upset  the senate majority leader is mad because people just don t understand how government works  specifically  they don t get the fact that legislation is apparently glacial in progress when he s involved  abc news caught a little of mcconnell s speech to the rotarians  i m not gonna ask for a show of hands  but i know everybody s saying we ve been there  haven t done anything  which  uh  i find  extremely irritating  do go on  mitch  and i m gonna tell you why  now congress goes on for two years  and part of the reason  i think  that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because  in part  because the president and others have set these early timelines about   things need to be done by a certain point  i bet this is the part where mitch says donald trump is new to this job  let me get some popcorn  because this is about to ge  zzzzzzzzzzzzz now our new president has of course not been in this line of work before  and i think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process  and so part of the reason i think people feel like we re under performing is because too many kind of artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality and the complexity of legislating may not have been fully understood  what    nothing about democrats screwing everything up  and of course our political adversaries love to say that any time  that s better  and i bet it felt good to get all that nasty butthurt off his chest  too you still haven t accomplished anything though  dumbass  president barack obama was handed his first bill to sign nine days after his inauguration  i mean  i guess he had  been in this line of work before   although republicans sure were loath to admit it  still  nine days kinda belies that whole  reality and complexity of legislating  thing you can watch mitch whine here speaking to rotary club in kentucky   senatemajldr says he finds it  extremely irritating  that congress has a reputation for doing nothing  pic twitter com   abc news politics   abcpolitics  august    more featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
