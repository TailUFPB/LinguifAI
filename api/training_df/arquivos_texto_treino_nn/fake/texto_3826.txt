hillary clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results  despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary  she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by fbi director james comey to interfere in the middle of the race  just as we were back up on the upward trajectory  the second letter from comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for trump s voters   clinton said  essentially  the second comey letter played right into trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the washington establishment was helping clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout   trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally  and the result is the result   clinton said the former presidential candidate also said she is  concerned  and  deeply saddened  for those who say they are living in fear in the united states after trump s election the decision by comey was blasted by democrats  and even some republicans  as it gave the appearance that clinton was still involved in wrongdoing  even though she had been previously cleared  it also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with clinton s emails  which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election by contrast  trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage  by comparison  nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity  the trump foundation the press  in concert with the fbi and the right wing  weighed in on the election all against one candidate  while the right makes claims about  liberal media  bias  it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the republican side of the aisle and not the other featured image via flickr
