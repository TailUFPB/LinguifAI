chris wallace tore this prick apart it s only been a week since a gunman shot and killed  people and wounded nearly  in las vegas with a fully automatic assault weapon on sunday  national rifle association executive director chris cox appeared on fox news sunday and began by appearing to suggest that the nra is only calling for regulating bump stocks because nra members were shot at the concert  you know  because non nra members apparently don t matter anyway  cox went on to once again say that we should not be discussing gun control after this latest mass shooting and that we should wait in the name of  common decency  host chris wallace had a problem with that  you say common decency  let s wait  what s enough time   wallace asked   i mean  here were  people killed  almost  injured  is it common decency to wait a day  two days  a week  a month  i mean  it is understandable   i know you don t agree with their solution but what s wrong with saying we need to address this  of course  rather than answer the question  cox turned the discussion into an attack on hillary clinton and other democrats  all while whining about them have armed guards  is that a sensible way to have this conversation  to try to turn it into class warfare  where if you re for gun control somehow you re part of an elite   wallace responded indeed  after the numerous death threats directed at her during the  campaign  including one by trump in which he called for  second amendment people  to do something if she had won  it s understandable why hillary clinton would want security  it s not class warfare   cox replied   it s what the american people want  and that s when wallace buried him  that s not actually true  if you talk about background checks  if you talk about automatic weapons   there are a lot of people  in fact a majority of people according to the polls who would like to see those gun controls  i have to say that i m put off at the argument  if you believe in gun control  you re an elite  i have to tell you  mr  cox  i know very few people  who have armed body guards  one of the few people i know who has armed body guards is wayne lapierre  we can argue about the merits of it  but i think to dismiss people and say   well  that s just the elite and they have armed guards   it seems to me does a disservice to your argument  here s the video via youtube a cbs poll last year found that  percent of americans support an assault weapons ban and polls consistently show that  percent to  percent of americans  including  percent of nra members  want background checks for all gun sales so  cox was clearly lying and wallace rightfully called him out for it featured image  screenshot
