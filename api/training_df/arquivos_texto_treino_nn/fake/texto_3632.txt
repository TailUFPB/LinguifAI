bernie sanders appeared with conan o brien on tuesday night  the segment of the show was hardly funny  but it didn t matter  it was about the frightening fact that the president elect of the united states has the self control of a toddler with an intellectual sophistication to match  and an apparent desire to totally destroy our democracy the first tweet conan and bernie talked about was this one in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    correctly pointed out that the argument is ridiculous  and beyond that  dangerous  first of all  it s delusional  it s totally insane   sanders said  but what s even  scarier  in his view is that trump is  sending a signal to republicans all over this country   urging them to  suppress  the votes of poor people  people of color  immigrants and others who might vote against them   my own view is we have got to work overtime to bring more people into the political process  not make it harder for people to participate  source  the daily beastthen  there was this tweet nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag   if they do  there must be consequences   perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    acknowledged  after saying that there were far more important issues than flag burning  that that too is a  hidden message  and that is be careful if you are prepared to dissent  we re watching you   is the message  even though the supreme court ruled that flag burning is free speech  i worry about the future of this country   sanders said  especially given the fact that the cornerstone of the president elect s campaign was  bigotry  against mexican americans  muslims  and other groups here s the video we hear you  bernie  everyone with a modicum of intelligence is worried for the future of this country  and frankly of the planet  under a trump presidency  while bernie is right that trump s tweets hint at his dictatorial leanings  we shouldn t let his tweets distract from trump s actual dictatorial moves and the fact that the swamp trump claimed to want to drain is being filled with the dirtiest water in the country featured image via video screen capture
