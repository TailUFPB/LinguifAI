the new york observer  which ivanka trump s husband  jared kushner  owns  has made its presidential endorsement  or  more accurately  its presidential non endorsement  after endorsing trump during the primaries  his own son in law s paper has decided it s not endorsing anyone at all the observer s editor in chief  ken kurson  simply said  observer is not going to make an endorsement in the general  oh  ouch  that just hurts  at least for trump  we re ecstatic  the observer can t endorse hillary or they d probably all get fired  and the same thing could happen if they endorsed a third party candidate  but it seems that they can t  in good conscience  endorse their owner s father in law wow trump hasn t been able to get very many newspaper endorsements in the general   in fact  he s only gotten six endorsements in all  and they re all from small papers with the exception of sheldon adelson s las vegas review journal  that s it  that s all  hundreds of newspapers in the country  and trump garners a whole six endorsements compare that to hillary s dozens of newspaper endorsements  which include conservative papers like the arizona republic  which had never endorsed a democratic candidate in its  year history  and the dallas morning news  which hadn t endorsed a democrat for more than  years  other papers with strong histories of endorsing republicans likewise broke with tradition to endorse hillary you know your candidate just sucks horrifically when his own son in law s paper can t bring itself to endorse him  amusingly  the observer has actually had issues with its coverage of trump because of kushner s relationship  with kurson saying in   if we run something pro trump we will automatically be accused of carrying water for him  on account of the relationship to our publisher   if we run something anti trump  we will be accused of trying to curry favor with our peers in journalism or worse  intentionally being only a little hard on him so that later we can love him up and point to the earlier softball as proof that we re fair  so they re in an impossible position  really  but their refusal to endorse trump at all is a blow to his standing as a candidate featured image by brian blanco via getty images
