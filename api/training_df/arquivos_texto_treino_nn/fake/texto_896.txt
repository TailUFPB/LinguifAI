get ready for donald trump to throw the worst temper tantrum of his presidency when you think of trump  what s the first word that comes to your mind  that s the question that a new quinnipiac poll asked americans trump has often bragged that he has  the best words   but this poll makes it clear that americans had the best words to describe him  and they are words that even trump can understand  idiot  is the top word americans used to answer the poll  followed by  incompetent  and  liar  americans also used words such as  asshole  unqualified  ignorant  racist  embarrassment  narcissist  bully  arrogant  dishonest  bigot  buffoon  blowhard  clown  and greedy  just to list a few adding insult to injury  trump s approval rating reached a new low in the poll  only  percent approve while  percent disapprove in addition   percent say trump is not honest and  percent say he does not have good leadership skills the poll also shows that americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the way trump talks about the media  percent to  percent  most   percent  also trust the media more than him to tell the truth  a statistic that will likely send trump off the deep end americans also want democrats to take back control of the senate overall  it s pretty damn clear that the american people loathe trump  and even though trump will try to spin the numbers or use fox news propaganda to dispute them  assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll tim malloy says trump really is out of excuses at this point  there is no way to spin or sugarcoat these sagging numbers   malloy said and this poll was taken long before trump s embarrassing overseas trip to poland and the g  summit in germany  where trump kissed putin s ass for two hours and offered to let russia work on american cyber security despite the fact that russia has been launching cyber attacks against our nation so it s likely americans would use even more negative words to describe trump if they could pick again trump is going to blow a gasket when he learns of this poll and you can bet the hissy fit will be public for all to see because trump is thin skinned  which curiously was not a word americans thought of for the poll  maybe they will next time featured image  isaac brekken getty images
