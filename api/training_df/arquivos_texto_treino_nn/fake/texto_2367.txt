earlier today  speaker of the house paul ryan dropped a truth bomb that absolutely humiliated donald trump and made him look like a moron after he had a meeting with the undeserving trump  ryan was later asked about the calls for a prosecutor to look into russia s interference in the u s  election  which the intelligence community has reported extensively on trump has denied over and over again that russia meddled in the u s  election  and has repeatedly shot down and offended the cia and other intelligence organizations in order to protect russia and his favorite tyrant  vladimir putin  so when ryan responded to the question with the exact opposite stance that trump has taken  it made the former reality television star look even more foolish than before  clearly  this is yet another thing that the republican party is divided on right now ryan stated very bluntly that russia without a doubt did mess with the u s  election on trump s behalf  further embarrassing trump for his ridiculous defense of the country  ryan said  we know russia meddled in the election  no one is disputing that  and this last government gave us that information in the first place  no one is alleging that some american was in on it beforehand  and yet  there s still a little problem with ryan s statement   the part where he says  no one is disputing that   let s remind him that just yesterday  trump tried to convince everyone that all this  russia talk is fake news  and blamed the democratic party and media for being petty and bitter over the election loss trump is seriously delusional  and ryan s statement perfectly illustrates that the republican party is splitting from trump in many ways  unable to agree with his insanity  looks like trump is alone in defending russia  and the gop doesn t care if they make him look like an idiot anymore  you can watch ryan trash trump below featured image via mark wilson and chip somodevilla   getty images
