as commander in chief  shouldn t the army field manual apply to the president as well as the men and women he commands because one psychiatrist brilliantly used the army field manual to demonstrate that donald trump is mentally unfit to be president dr  prudence l  gourguechon wrote an editorial for the los angeles times detailing how trump s behavior makes him an unfit leader and she proved it by consulting the field manual used by the united states army after pointing out that the  amendment of the constitution has been getting a lot of attention recently because of trump s behavior  dr  gourguechon said that after searching through  thousands of articles and books written on leadership  primarily in the business arena  i have found only one source where the capacities necessary for strategic leadership are clearly and comprehensively laid out  the u s  army s  field manual   leader development  that is particularly interesting since trump is the commander of america s armed forces specifically  the manual discusses the areas of trust  discipline and self control  judgement and critical thinking  self awareness  and empathy  and as dr  gourguechon notes  trump fails in every category on trust  the manual states that  leaders shape the ethical climate of their organization while developing the trust and relationships that enable proper leadership  gouguechon elaborated a leader who is deficient in the capacity for trust makes little effort to support others  may be isolated and aloof  may be apathetic about discrimination  allows distrustful behaviors to persist among team members  makes unrealistic promises and focuses on self promotion as we know  trump doesn t trust people and he sows an environment of distrust  and let s not pretend that trump hasn t made unrealistic promises or promoted himself on discipline and self control  the manual mentions traits such as selflessness  respect  integrity  and courage  if you are laughing  it s because you know that trump has none of these traits  in fact  he is the most undisciplined and selfish person on the planet  or at the very least the most undisciplined and selfish person who has ever lived in the white house  without discipline and self control  a leader may not be able to resist temptation  to stay focused despite distractions  to avoid impulsive action or to think before jumping to a conclusion   dr  gourguechon wrote   the leader who fails to demonstrate discipline reacts  viscerally or angrily when receiving bad news or conflicting information   and he  allows personal emotions to drive decisions or guide responses to emotionally charged situations  on judgement and critical thinking  the manual makes it clear that trump has no business being the commander in chief a leader with the capacity for critical thinking  seeks to obtain the most thorough and accurate understanding possible   the manual says  and he anticipates  first  second and third consequences of multiple courses of action   a leader deficient in judgment and strategic thinking demonstrates rigid and inflexible thinking the manual also makes it clear that trump lacks self awareness  it describes him perfectly  self aware leaders know themselves  including their traits  feelings  and behaviors   the manual says   they employ self understanding and recognize their effect on others   when a leader lacks self awareness  the manual notes  he  unfairly blames subordinates when failures are experienced  and  rejects or lacks interest in feedback  the same goes for empathy a good leader  demonstrates an understanding of another person s point of view  and  identifies with others  feelings and emotions   the manual s description of inadequacy in this area   shows a lack of concern for others  emotional distress  and  displays an inability to take another s perspective  so if we go by the military leadership standards outlined in the army field manual  trump should be removed from office as soon as possible  he definitely should not have been allowed to take office in the first place  americans need to take trump s behavior seriously  he literally controls the most powerful military in the world  and the military would never voluntarily make him their leader if they follow this manual  that speaks volumes featured image  ralph freso getty images
