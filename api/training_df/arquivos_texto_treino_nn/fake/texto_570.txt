today  there were hundreds of marches showing solidarity with charlottesville  virginia  where anti racist protesters were mowed down by a white nationalist  as is usual for these marches  people take pictures and post them to social media  and some inevitably find themselves being asked for permission to use the photos in news stories  one man  keegan stephan  tweeted a series of great pictures from new york city  and fox news promptly contacted him for permission to use them across all their networks this initially happened via direct message  but stephan was kind enough to post the brief exchange to twitter  stephan is an organizer and a student representative for the american bar association s civil rights division  and his reply to fox news  request is simply perfect for the record  pic twitter com   keegan stephan   keegannyc  august    are no other words for that than  perfect   this is someone who truly knows what he stands for  and will not be complicit in the part fox plays in emboldening these hate groups  fox news gives air time to people like judge jeanine pirro  sean hannity  and tucker carlson  who all push trump s racist and nationalist ideals and who seem to think that conservative whites just have it so hard here now  to allow them to use photos you took while marching against all of these things makes you complicit it s worse when you consider the fact that fox news supports a man who fancies himself the greatest person ever to live  but who can t say the word  terrorism  if the terrorists are white  al jazeera english actually counted how much he talks about terrorism when the terrorists are not white   realdonaldtrump tweets a lot about  terrorism   but not when the attackers are white  we looked at the data  pic twitter com   al jazeera english   ajenglish  august    stephan will not participate  and fox news can get its photos from elsewhere  you  however  can see his awesome photos from new york city s union square march here featured image via drew angerer getty images and twitter
