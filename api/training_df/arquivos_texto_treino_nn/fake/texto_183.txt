with all the recent talk of sentencing reform and unfair bail across america  sometimes what it takes is an outrageous case in a small town somewhere to light a fire under activists to demand a change  and even though the resignation of a judge in pearl  mississippi  a suburb of the capital with a meager   residents  isn t really anyone s idea of a revolution  it probably means a lot to the mother at the center of the case judge john shirley of the now dissolved pearl youth court decided back in august of  that some unpaid court fees were enough to separate  mother a   a resident of nearby jackson  from her baby for a period of  months  the unidentified mom and a friend were driving through pearl one day looking for work when they were pulled over by a police officer who discovered that both women had misdemeanor warrants for minor offenses honestly  the story begins with that officer  who is also unidentified in the report from the clarion ledger  the news outlet that first reported the judge s resignation  so much begins with a cop s interaction with a young person   will they detain them  will they give them a warning  initial contact with law enforcement often determines the course of a young person s life  and most police are totally aware of that fact  mother a  had her baby with her that day  and although the woman s grandmother came to the scene immediately to collect the baby  that officer decided to change the young woman s life by requiring her to bring the child before the pearl youth court if it seems like i m being too hard on the cop  let me assure you  i ve saved most of my hate for judge shirley  how an arbiter of justice thinks ordering a young mother to stay away from her newborn baby is anything approaching justice is bewildering to me  but that s just what judge shirley did  remanding the infant to the custody of the grandmother and imposing a goddamn no contact order between mother a and her baby until the poor  as in  without money  young woman could pay off her court fees not only could she not see her child  she couldn t see her grandmother while the baby was present  it was just to be cruel  that s the only explanation cliff johnson  the director of the roderick and solange macarthur justice center at the university of mississippi school of law  agreed  as a civil rights lawyer in mississippi  i am no stranger to injustice  but for a judge to prohibit an impoverished mother from having any contact with her baby until monetary payments are made is shocking and repugnant  such orders are tantamount to judicial kidnapping  between two people   one cop and one judge   a young woman s life is forever changed  her idea of justice forever skewed  her trust in authority forever hobbled by the fear of a cruelty that exists only for its own sake featured image via judgejohnshirley com
