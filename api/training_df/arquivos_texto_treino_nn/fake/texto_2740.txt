senate republicans on wednesday took an extraordinary step to force through two of alleged president donald trump s top cabinet nominees after a boycott from democrats  republican lawmakers on the senate finance committee changed the rules so there will no longer be a requirement for democrats to be present to achieve quorum republicans then forced through the controversial picks of rep  tom price for secretary of health and human services and steve mnuchin for secretary of treasury democrats boycotted for very good reasons democrats launched their boycott tuesday because they felt there were too many unanswered questions about the two nominees  possible ethics violations  they refused to participate in the process if there wouldn t be more time for vetting  when not a single democrat showed up on tuesday  the vote could not proceed  because of a rule requiring at least one member from the minority party be present every single seat on the democrats  side of the dais was empty committee chairman orrin hatch  r ut  called the boycott  extraordinary circumstances  and allowed the republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee   they  on their own accord  refused to participate in the exercise   he said   they have nobody to blame but themselves  the day before  hatch said the democrats were  acting like idiots  for their boycott  he said that as if he has no memory of the obstruction republicans openly launched against president obama for  years and democrats have ample reasons to scrutinize the nominees  there is evidence that both price and mnuchin lied to the committee that swamp is being filled with terrifying creatures for example  mnuchin has even acknowledged that his answers were not  true  accurate  and complete   as was apparent from his need to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire twice because of entities he  inadvertently missed   he also testified that onewest bank never used  robo signers   even though it frequently did and there were already questions about whether he was qualified to serve in the position in the first place  mnuchin s bank foreclosed on tens of thousands of people while accepting   billion in loan forgiveness from the fdic  and may have even broken the law by backdating documents to rush foreclosures price  too  has issues  he was involved in legislation that could have benefited his stock holdings  his tax returns and financial disclosure statements were brought into question ahead of the hearing in the end  both of trump s nominees were approved   hatch was confronted by reporters who rushed over to the building because of the little notice given to the public about the meeting to suspend the rules  he reportedly chuckled and said   you were scrambling  well  you know  that s neither here nor there  hatch admitted that he has not yet spoken with the committee s top democrat  sen  ron wyden   i don t feel a bit sorry for them   he said questions will be left unanswered democrats asked that price offer clarify on  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about privileged and discounted access to stocks   and wanted mnuchin to address  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about the potentially illegal process known as robo signing   among other things  i don t care what they want at this point   hatch said one thing we could agree with trump on is that the swamp needs to be drained  of course  we knew he wouldn t keep that promise  republicans have launched an attack on democracy photo by chip somodevilla getty images
