right in the middle of the nine thousand scandals swirling around donald trump comes one about his running mate  mike pence  as governor of indiana  pence oversaw everything from legalized discrimination to destroying the state s educational system  and there was even an attempt to destroy freedom of the press  now  it s come out that he may have engaged in some voter suppression as well   particularly against indiana s black voters this is so much worse than the clearly fraudulent voter id law  the indiana state police raided the offices of the indiana voter registration project  ivrp  in an alleged attempt to root out  voter fraud   ivrp didn t see it that way  and neither did advocacy groups  they saw it as a deliberate attempt to shut them down  slowing registration and nullifying thousands of registration applications for black people across the state  the whole  initiative   if it can even be called that  started in nine counties  and then expanded to  counties shortly after this raid the ivrp is based in indianapolis  which has a higher black population than the rest of the state  patriot group usa  a progressive advocacy group  started running ads against pence and the state after the raid  they and the ivrp say that more than   black hoosiers may not be allowed to vote on nov   besides that  employees were barred from filming the raid  and the police handcuffed a black employee and denied him his legal right to speak to an attorney black voters tend to vote democratic  and almost every voter suppression tactics are aimed at harming democratic voting  as longtime gop consultant carter wrenn said  when he effectively threw his party and its suppression tactics to the wolves  look  if african americans voted overwhelmingly republican  they would have kept early voting right where it was  he was speaking of north carolina trying to end early voting  but this applies to most voter suppression tactics  pence would know that   he s a conniving old white man who sees the black community as an electoral threat  if they can t register  they can t vote  and if they can t vote  his party is safer it s so disgustingly simple it makes us want to put our fists through the walls of course  pence s spokesperson called the allegations  false and absurd   he said  in fact  the indiana state police has uncovered strong evidence of voter fraud by patriot majority usa  among governor pence s top priorities is ensuring the integrity of the election and that every single hoosier vote counts  he has full confidence in the indiana state police investigation to achieve this goal  uh huh  sure  the state police have found exactly ten irregularities so far  and they re mostly missing zip codes or other minor problems  according to fusion  ten  and those irregularities show anything but fraud pence ought to be ashamed of himself  but he s still donald trump s running mate so we all know he s incapable of shame featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
