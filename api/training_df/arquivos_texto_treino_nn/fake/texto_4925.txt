a gop lobbyist who s known for his own brand of bigotry has denounced trump in a completely unprecedented way  instead of vowing to vote for hillary  or  at least  saying trump isn t fit to be president like other republicans have  he s actually called on attorney general loretta lynch to investigate trump for corruption yes  he really did that  jack burkman  who s president of his own lobbying firm  is primarily concerned with trump s penchant for expecting favors from people to whom he s donated campaign money  in fact  as lawnewz said  he used that exact thing to prove that our political system is broken during the first gop debate in august of last year  i give to everybody  when they call  i give  and you know what  when i need something from them  two years later  three years later  i call them  they are there for me  he also said those words to rolling stone  other instances of trump s admissions to possible corruption are listed in burkman s letter to lynch  including an interview with the wall street journal  and when he formally accepted the republican nomination for president  trump has made a habit of talking about how he knows that lawmakers will do anything for anyone who gives them money burkman  who wrote the letter on his lobbying firm s stationery  said  in florida  attorney general pam bondi considered joining a new york suit against the real estate mogul over the allegedly fraudulent trump university  ms  bondi received a    donation to her campaign  and florida did not join that suit against trump university  an aide to bondi said that she actually solicited that donation  which makes it worse as galling as it is to side with a republican lobbyist on anything at all  burkman is making a good point  while nobody can make specific accusations of corruption against trump right now  just the situation in florida is very suspicious  it s so suspicious that burkman isn t the only person to call for an investigation into that  boston attorney whitfield larrabee has called on the irs to investigate that  too  since the donation came from trump s non profit foundation when combined with his bragging that he s repeatedly gamed the system  along with all the money he s given to other lawmakers representing districts in which he s got business interests  it paints a very grim picture indeed it s not like we don t have an idea that trump is corrupt  that s almost a given at this point  what s surprising is that we have a gop lobbyist calling on a democratic attorney general  appointed by a president that republicans hate with the fire of a thousand suns  to investigate the man at the top of their ticket burkman concluded his letter with this  if mr  trump has never engaged in any political corruption  why would he repeatedly gloat about his gaming of the system  if he did  then he should be investigated  prosecuted and if convicted  imprisoned the blatant effusive nature of his public statements should be considered nothing short of a challenge to the u s  department of justice and whether the agency would bother to investigate whether he has  in fact  crossed the line between politics as usual and corruption  lynch should at least take this seriously enough to look into it  there s just too much there to ignore featured image by bill pugliano getty images
