republicans everywhere have been denouncing trump for his boasts about sexually assaulting women  but it seems that they can t stick to their guns  in a very cowardly move  four republicans have re endorsed him  one has knuckled under and stayed quiet  and more are sure to follow both of these leads  these weak kneed  spineless rat turds are busy putting party over country  and it s disgusting first up  senator deb fischer of nebraska  she made her position clear on the radio shortly after the worst weekend trump has ever had  as a woman  there is no way she should still support him  and yet  she does for some sick reason  well  like most nebraskans  i am fully committed to defeating hillary clinton  i support the republican ticket and i plan to vote for mr  trump and mr  pence on november   she went on to say that she d never said she wouldn t vote for the gop ticket  which is likely true  but smacks of making excuses  all she s done is show that beating hillary is more important than the very real danger of legitimizing sexual crimes  and making a predator into a role model for our children  giving in to that ideology is the move of a coward senator john thune of south dakota is next  he tweeted that trump should withdraw and mike pence should take over  now  though  he s caved like the chickenshit he is  too  he said  he has a lot of work to do  i think  to win this election  but i m certainly not going to vote for hillary clinton  so vote for evan mcmullin   at least he s respectable  knowledgeable and sane  unlike trump and his minions new jersey congressman scott garrett said that he felt mike pence was a better candidate than trump following trump s unmasking as a sexual predator  however  garrett s campaign has since said that he still feels trump is the best candidate to lead our country  his spokesman said  in part  donald trump remains the nominee of the republican party  and rep  garrett has always said he will vote for the republican party nominee  scott garrett s top priority in this election is stopping the clinton gottheimer agenda of higher taxes  more wasteful spending  and weak national security policy  all important issues  but dismissing half the electorate by essentially saying   sure  we care about you  but your problems with sexual assault are just not that important   right now is clueless and vile  it s typical sexism  actually in fourth place  but tied for first  is congressman bradley byrne of alabama  we probably shouldn t be surprised that an official from alabama would decide to support trump  though  even after sixteen straight months of rotting vomit spewing forth from his mouth  byrne was one of the first officials in alabama to call on trump to step down  but apparently  that s all changed now that it s been a week since trump s  hot mic  tape was released byrne s spokesman  seth burrow  said  he will support the republican ticket on election day  as he has pledged to do all along  he just believes that person should be mike pence  he just believes that person should be mike pence   is one of the worst cop outs in the long  sad history of bad cop outs and last  but certainly not least  is paul ryan  while he has refused to campaign with trump anymore  and even disinvited him to an event in wisconsin  he s got an extraordinarily flimsy position on trump now  he won t talk about trump  and he seems to be urging people to just kind of forget about trump s twitter storms and other problems no mention of trump being a sexual predator  which is unbelievably hypocritical for someone as  christian  as paul ryan  to be sure  ryan never rescinded his endorsement of trump  and apparently  that position has not changed  it s still sick more republicans are sure to follow as they decide their party is more important than actually standing for what s right  they are bloody pieces of feces infused wimpiness for that  considering they keep trumpeting every type of  moral value  there is photo of deb fischer by mark wilson  photo of john thune by alex wong  photo of scott garrett by chip somodevilla  photo of paul ryan by win mcnamee  via getty images  photo of bradley byrne by u s  house of representatives  public domain via wikipedia  all photos merged by rika christensen
