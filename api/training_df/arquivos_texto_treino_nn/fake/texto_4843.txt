house speaker paul ryan may have been hoping to be re elected come january  but thanks to his fellow conservatives it looks like he doesn t have a chance  in fact  house gopers are actively conspiring against ryan to make sure that he doesn t succeed although these anti ryan conservatives don t have enough votes to oust their current speaker of the house  they are plotting a coup movement to stop him from being elected again   a move that could very well have an even bigger impact on his political career further down the line  as a conservative member explained to the huffington post  if he loses the speaker election  he s not going to be president  in a nutshell  ryan s fellow conservatives are trying to kick him out of his position because he s not being the kind of  conservative  they want him to be  republicans really know how to stick together in a time when they need unity to save them from donald trump s circus of course  this would be completely humiliating for ryan and even if his conservative haters couldn t indefinitely prevent ryan from getting on the ballot for re election  they might use this leverage to get certain changes made for their own benefit  the huffington post explained that these gopers are looking for increasing caucus representation on committees  bulking up subcommittee staff with hard liners who could be groomed for election  allowing the gop house campaign arm to collect contributions for the freedom caucus that could be directed to conservative candidates  and clarifying rules suspension votes  and some of these house conservatives are just plain furious that the gop has taken on more moderate candidates   and they re taking their frustration out on ryan  one member explained this by using an extremely inappropriate  strange analogy  how can you have a gang  and have one in your gang get stabbed  and do nothing  you got to stab somebody  or else what s the point of having a gang  ryan has been house speaker for less than a year  and his party is already going public with plans to oust him  this just shows what a mess the gop is right now  their republican nominee is the worst thing to happen to the party  and this is further proof that the gop as we know it is dividing and falling apart featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
