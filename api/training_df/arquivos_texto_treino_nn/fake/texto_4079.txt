the idea of there being a group of people who are gay and actively support the gop is pretty ludicrous  considering the republican party is bigoted against lgbtq people as a matter of practice and policy  after all  their official  party platform is easily the most anti lgbtq in history  nevertheless  the log cabin republicans keep trucking on  trying to make people who will always hate them allow them into their club well  it seems even these morons have a line  as they ve decided that there will be no endorsement for gop presidential nominee donald trump from them  this is most curious  considering that the group has said that trump is the most pro lgbtq presidential nominee in the history of the party  this is in no way true of course  after all  trump picked mike pence as his running mate  and he is the man who rose to national prominence by signing a horribly bigoted law that effectively legalized discrimination against lgbtq people in indiana  the state he currently governs  here is what the log cabin folks had to say about trump  and their decision not to endorse  even though he pandered to lgbtq people  which they say is  unprecedented  for their party  but log cabin republicans have long emphasized that we are not a single issue organization  nor are our members single issue voters  even if we were  rhetoric alone regarding lgbt issues does not equate to doctrine as mr  trump spoke positively about the lgbt community in the united states  he concurrently surrounded himself with senior advisors with a record of opposing lgbt equality  and committed himself to supporting legislation such as the so called  first amendment defense act  that log cabin republicans opposes  well  at least they showed a bit of backbone here  but it still boggles the mind that these idiots think that they re a part of the right political party  oh well  this is more than most people who look at the log cabin republicans and shake their heads could ask for featured image via brian blanco getty images
