wells fargo  one of the biggest banks in the u s   was recently caught running a scam known as  sandbagging   to inflate bankers  numbers and get them more money  basically  they were opening fake accounts and transferring customers  money into those accounts without their authorization  they ve been slapped with   million in fines  but the executive who is most closely and directly linked to this scam is walking away with a nice  fat reward for it at the end of the year  when she retires carrie tolstedt  the head of wells fargo s scamming department  will receive almost   million at the end of this year despite being in charge of a department that ripped off its customers to inflate its own bottom lines  of course  as is standard procedure whenever a big company is caught ripping people off  wells fargo isn t admitting any wrongdoing  even though this has been going on for the last five years tolstedt herself isn t saying anything about it  either  but wells fargo is praising her service  saying she s been  a standard bearer of our culture  and  a champion for customers  yeah  right  charging your customers fees they don t owe because you put their money into accounts they didn t open to inflate your bottom line is being a champion for customers  at least the head of the consumer financial protection bureau saw right through that drivel  it is quite clear that  are unfair and abusive practices under federal law   said cordray   they are a violation of trust and an abuse of trust   wells fargo has fired some   employees for these tactics  but their clawback provision  which they expanded after the  financial crash  didn t seem to deter this department  and they kept up these secret and deceptive practices  it s bad enough that elizabeth warren  who s been after the big banks since she was elected in   wants hearings into wells fargo s sandbagging  she doesn t believe wells fargo didn t know about the fake accounts any more than anyone with any sense does  come on this went on for years and they didn t smell anything in the air about fake accounts  and if they did  she believes  then wells fargo is too big to manage  either way  they defrauded their customers and should pay  as should the head of their department instead  wells fargo has decided to send a message to other banking executives that this kind of behavior is okay  it s the same problem we ve had with the big banks since before   tolstedt should be fired  and walk away with nothing featured image by joe raedle getty images
