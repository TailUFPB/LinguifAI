during donald trump s meltdown during his rally in phoenix tuesday evening  he threatened to shut down the government unless congress funds his border wall  the former reality show star launched a rant which was so insane that people are starting to question whether he s fit to hold office  we re pretty sure that house speaker paul ryan is wondering that  too  after trump s screamy ragey speech on wednesday  house speaker paul ryan  r wi  said he doesn t  think a government shutdown is necessary   however  we ve noticed that when the republican leader says something in stark contrast to trump s rhetoric  he never says it to his face  like  for example  when he tweeted his denouncement of the nazis who marched in trump s name in charlottesville  virginia  with one of them murdering heather heyer    and injuring  others  he failed to tag  realdonaldtrump but anyway  ryan said during a press conference in hillsboro  oregon   i don t think a government shutdown is necessary  and i don t think most people want to see a government shutdown  ourselves included  ryan continued to say that  congress in the house has already done its work on this issue  and left it up to the senate  given the time of year it is  and the rest of the appropriations we have to do  we re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process  particularly in the senate   he said talking points memo reports trump on tuesday night suggested he would push to tie funding for his proposed border wall to a government spending bill congress must pass in the fall to avert a shutdown  i don t think anyone s interested in having a shutdown  i don t think it s in our interest to do so   ryan added   i don t think you have to choose between the two  watch   speakerryan   i don t think a government shut down is necessary  and i don t think most people want to see  one  https   t co  pic twitter com   this week   thisweekabc  august    ryan should have  a sit down with trump and explain to him what happens during a government shutdown  on the other hand  trump doesn t seem to care about very much  ryan is trying to distance himself from the very president he supports  he s playing it safe  knowing full well that trump won t last much longer in office  ryan wants to come out of the madness with his hands clean so he can say   hey  i called trump out  without actually calling him out  that said  he s going to have a battle on his hands to keep the government open and it looks like he s ready for that  we re certain several of his republican colleagues would back him up on that image via screen capture
