well  this came back to bite allen west on the ass the former republican congressman from florida apparently wants to be part of donald trump s cabinet  so he had to scrub and make up a pathetic excuse to explain a very racist post on his facebook page in celebration of trump s choice of former general james mattis to be secretary of defense  west posted a meme of mattis with the caption   fired by obama to please the muslims  hired by trump to exterminate them  here s the now deleted post via twitter once in a while  the mask slips down   and people like allen west reveal their true thoughts  pic twitter com   imraan siddiqi   imraansiddiqi  december    s right  west literally cheered for mattis because he expects him to commit genocide against   billion people who practice islam it s despicable and west should be automatically taken out of consideration for any spot on trump s team but in an effort to cover his ass  west has the editor in chief of his website take responsibility for the post and apologized for it  you know  because west is too cowardly to do it himself  as editor in chief  i must take full responsibility for this  although i was not the one who posted it  and it was posted without my knowledge   michele hickford claimed   i neither condone nor support the message included in the meme  this meme was not created by me or any of our writers  it was reposted from another source  the image has been removed  its message was despicable  offensive to many  and a terrible error in judgment by the person who posted it  furthermore  it does not reflect col  west s beliefs  principles and values  clearly  west is still incapable of taking responsibility for things himself  just like donald trump  and it s not like there isn t any proof that west hates muslims and has no problem committing war crimes against them four of the men under his command in iraq beat an iraqi policeman in an effort to get information  west then threatened to kill the man by firing his pistol near the man s head  this is torture and to make it stop  the man gave meaningless information to his tormentors  west should have faced a court martial but he was allowed to retire instead will full benefits so allen west has no business being put in charge of a government department nor should he be placed in any position of authority in our government at all  his hatred of muslims disqualifies him and it would be an insult to humanity to appoint him featured image  wikimedia
