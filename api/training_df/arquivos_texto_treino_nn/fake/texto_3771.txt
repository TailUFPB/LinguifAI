one of the things that trump wants to do over the next four years is continue to hold huge rallies for the purpose of stroking his ego  apparently  that s already getting underway  he s planning to take a  victory lap  around the states he won sometime in the next several weeks  rather than working closely with his transition team to make sure as much is in place as possible before inauguration day this will be a  state tour if he plans on visiting every state that voted for him  since the trip seems to be mostly for the purpose of visiting the states he won  it s hard not to see this as a giant middle finger to the states he lost  even though there are a number of voters in rural areas of blue states like illinois who voted for him it doesn t really jibe with his ongoing assertions that he will work every day for all americans  shouldn t he be impossibly eager to get to down to business    in fact  it doesn t jibe with the idea that he ll do any work at all the glow of winning a presidential election already seems to be wearing off   he has to continually find ways of feeling superior and getting the instant gratification that these huge  cheering crowds give him  and really  who wants to spend day after day in boring meetings with transitional staffers  members of congress  security teams  the current president  and more when he can just be  gone  all the time  stroking his ego  while some have spun his need for large rallies full of adoring fans as rubbing shoulders with the everyday american  it just doesn t seem like that s what trump really wants to do he has an ego the size of russia  it s not easy to quiet that  and his staff would rather kowtow to him than try and actually mold him into a real statesman  he publicly admits that his life is going to change drastically  but what he s pushing his advisers and planners to do shows he s going to try and hold onto his old life as much as possible will he hold rallies in states he didn t carry  who knows  he ll promise to  because to do otherwise would be to confirm that some people don t matter  even if they voted for him  will he actually do it  though  it might actually depend on whether he thinks he can get the huge crowds he wants  which is totally what being president is all about featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
