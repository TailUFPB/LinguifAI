donald trump s campaign currently has a leadership that is under fire for more than a few scandals  on sunday  chuck todd blasted trump s running mate mike pence for hiring both steve bannon of breitbart  a right wing reactionary media site  and roger ailes of fox news  bannon is facing allegations of anti semitism and ailes for  sexually harassing what now seems like every woman who ever stepped foot in his office  quick question about the leadership of the campaign  there s been some troubling allegations both against steve bannon  somethings he may have said about jewish people  some things that may have happened between him and his wife  todd said during a broadcast of meet the press   there s been troubling allegations having to do with roger ailes  both of whom are apparently advisers to this campaign  are you comfortable with that considering some of the allegations you ve read against both of these men  are you comfortable with their involvement in this campaign  i promise you the person leading donald trump s campaign is donald trump   pence responds   he and i talk every day  sometimes several times a day  he is   he is a hands on leader and a hands on ceo  todd then goes on to question pence further  asking him it is   appropriate for roger ailes to be involved  i trust donald trump s judgment to assemble around this team a group that s going to help us move forward and be successful and win   pence says   and come on  i mean  steve bannon has denied all of those allegations    todd then interjects to say   some are in court records  i mean  look  i know   look  divorces are divorces  but it s troubling allegations  people are going to look and say  all right  steve bannon and then you see all these allegations against roger ailes  it just feels as if there s   does he ignore troubling allegations against people that work for him  i trust donald trump to assemble a team around him in this campaign has he has and will continue to  you ll continue to see people added to this campaign   pence says pence s claim that we ll see more people added to his campaign staff has me wondering who trump will hire next  martin shkreli seems like he would fit in with the rest of trump s campaign compadres  at this point  it wouldn t even be shocking to see trump hire george zimmerman to spearhead his outreach efforts to voters of color what todd doesn t go into is the fact that a presidential candidate has officially aligned himself with two major players in the media  while ailes may have resigned as the chairman and ceo of fox news due to his inability to give women in his employment their basic human rights  he still remains on of the most powerful men in the news industry  so powerful in fact  that rupert murdoch has gone on record as saying that ailes is responsible for the success of trump s campaign thus far   then there is bannon  who is on a  temporary  leave from his position as the ceo of breitbart  a staple site in propagating bizarre right wing conspiracies and white supremacist narratives what this amounts to is the collusion two of the largest private dispensers of information in the world working with a fascist billionaire to try and take control of the wealthiest and most influential nation in the world  this current situation should serve as a warning to the entire left wing that in the era of neoliberalist domination  corporations have the power to  convince millions of people to vote for an administration that would rather turn the united states into sacrifice zone  rather than lose a profit you can watch the clip below featured image via video screenshot
