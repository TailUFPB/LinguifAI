you would think that after president barack obama specifically warned republican nominee donald trump not to attack his wife  trump wouldn t want to test those waters  then again  when has trump ever listened to the advice of anyone other than himself on friday during a rally in north carolina  trump tried to slam first lady michelle obama by taking a line out of a  campaign speech to smear michelle  president barack obama and his opponent hillary clinton  trump tried to throw each of his biggest threats under the bus when he said we have a bunch of babies running our country  a bunch of losers  they are babies  we have a president  all he wants to do is campaign  his wife  all she wants to do is campaign i see how much his wife likes hillary  but wasn t she the one that started the statement   if you can t take care of your home  you can t take care of the white house or the country  trump was quoting a line from michelle s  speech when she was campaigning for her husband   but he took it completely out of context  michelle had been talking about how she managed politics  two careers and raising two children  this balancing act between family and work responsibilities is something that many americans could relate to  which was why she said it  her words were one of the things  the important aspects of this race  is role modeling what good families should look like  and my view is that if you can t run your own house  you certainly can t run the white house  can t do it  so  so we ve adjusted our schedules to make sure that our girls are first  so while he s traveling around  i do day trips  they just know that i was at home to tuck them in at night  and it keeps them grounded  and  and children  the children in our country have to know that they come first  and our girls do  and that s why we re doing this  we re in this race for not just our children  but all of our children  it was a beautiful speech  and it is simply disgusting that trump would use it in such a negative context  however  it s a sure sign that the business mogul is still bitter about the speech michelle gave on thursday  where michelle accurately stated that trump could not relate to the average american s struggles  she said perhaps living life high up in a tower in a world of exclusive clubs  measuring success by wins and losses  the number of zeros in your bank account  perhaps you just develop a different set of values  maybe with so little exposure to people who are different than you  it becomes easy to take advantage of those who are down on their luck  to him  most of america is  them  so basically  the only way trump can attack michelle is by making things up and twisting her words   but he only makes himself look stupid in the end  you can watch trump try to attack the first lady   and fail   below trump comments on flotus as surrogate for clinton   his wife  all she wants to do is campaign  pic twitter com   abc news politics   abcpolitics  october    image via scott olson and paul morigi   getty images
