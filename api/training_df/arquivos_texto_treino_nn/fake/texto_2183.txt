ivanka trump is complicit in what her father donald trump is doing to america and saturday night live hilariously made sure everyone knows about it in yet another classic commercial spoof  saturday night live brilliantly mocked ivanka  portrayed by scarlett johansson  with an advertisement for a perfume called  complicit  as dressed in gold ivanka walks across a ballroom where champagne is being served and guests are gawking at her as a narrator speaks highly about her without choking on the words  every man knows her name  every woman knows her face  when she walks into a room  all eyes are on her  she s ivanka  and a woman like her deserves a fragrance all her own  a scent made just for her  because she s beautiful  she s powerful  she s complicit  she s a woman who knows what she wants   the narrator continues   and knows what she s doing  complicit  ivanka then walks up to a mirror and applies lipstick but her reflection is that of her father as played by alec baldwin  she doesn t crave the spotlight  but we see her  oh  how we see her  the narrator then goes on to describe ivanka using terms like  feminist  but has no idea why they apply to her  a feminist  an advocate  a champion for women   the narrator says   but  like  how  she s loyal  devoted  but probably should ve bounced after that whole access hollywood bus thing   the narration continued in reference to donald trump bragging about grabbing women s genitals without their consent   oh well   ivanka said the commercial then concluded with an epic and accurate slogan for the  complicit  perfume  for the woman who could stop all this   but won t  here s the video via youtube indeed  ivanka trump has a lot of influence over her father but she has failed to use it  instead  white nationalists like steve bannon are pulling the strings and america is suffering for it  ivanka trump should be ashamed of herself and she should always be remembered as the one person who could have done something but didn t  that makes her complicit featured image via screenshot
