donald trump is arrogant and narcissistic enough that he probably thinks he convinced black voters to support him  he is very wrong as it turns out  black voters are overwhelmingly unimpressed by trump s pathetic outreach effort  and republicans have no one to blame but themselves for years  republicans have stereotyped black people as poor people who live in violent neighborhoods and want free stuff  donald trump has made that view the centerpiece of his plea to african americans  you re living in your poverty  your schools are no good  you have no jobs   percent of your youth is unemployed   what the hell do you have to lose   trump asked during a speech earlier this week and his message has only strengthened the resolve of black voters to not vote for him the new york times actually went out and talked to black voters  unlike trump  who was speaking to an all white audience while telling black people what their lives are like  i hear him not talking to black people  but talking to white people about black people so they will think he cares about black people   said former atlanta daily world publisher alexis scott   the real thing that he s trying to do is to try to protect some of the white vote by suggesting to them that he cares  he is giving voice to every stereotype he s ever heard   scott continued   i heard someone say   it s like he only watches  the wire   and that s what he knows about black people  national urban league president marc morial wasn t a fan of trump s depiction of black people either  it s an inaccurate portrayal of the community that seeks to define the community by only its biggest challenges   morial told the times   black america has deep problems   deep economic problems   but black america also has a large community of striving  successful  hard working people  college educated  in the work force  retired postal worker demeitrus williams concurs  who s he talking about   he wondered before answering his own question   i don t know   most of the black people i know are educated and live in nice neighborhoods  everybody in my family is required to have a degree  indeed  characterizing all black people as living in poverty is a huge mistake that is not based in facts  while the percentage of blacks living in poverty is still high compared to white people  only  percent of african americans live that reality and the criticism goes beyond the people the new york times spoke to charlotte observer columnist eric frazier slammed trump and the republican party for trying to sucker black voters into voting for them even though they don t support any of the issues african americans care about  blacks vote democrat today because democrats fought for their votes   frazier wrote  the party that once welcomed cross burning klansmen did an about face on civil rights and earned the black vote are you fighting to get those votes back  nope the path to do so is clear  if you re interested  embrace affirmative action   and let racist base voters walk  pass criminal justice reform  champion black entrepreneurship and the rebuilding of the inner cities  reach out to churchgoing black families  their traditionalist social values mirror yours  in contrast  republicans have only moved farther to the right into the open arms of white supremacists and are working constantly to weaken or destroy the voting rights act and civil rights act so what do black voters have to lose by voting for trump  their rights and their freedom  which is why republicans can expect to continue losing the black vote for years to come featured image via jeff swensen getty images
