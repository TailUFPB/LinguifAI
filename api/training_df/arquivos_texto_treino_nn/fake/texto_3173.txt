a chandler  arizona family awoke early one morning to see that the menorah sculpture on their lawn had been vandalized and turned into a swastika  clearly  this was bad enough for the jewish family  but when fox  phoenix posted the picture  things got really ugly  not surprisingly  donald trump s name was mentioned a lot   a very ignorant  shallow person  a coward   said gary guadagnino  who has lived in the neighborhood for more than two decades  the menorah decoration belonged to her neighbor  naomi  and her husband according to naomi  she and her husband built the religious symbol two years ago  and it was brought back by popular demand  naomi said her family has no idea why someone would do this  especially in their accepting  welcoming community  someone full of a lot of hate and prejudice would do it   said naomi   i can t imagine that someone from this community or this neighborhood would do something like that  facebook users weren t as sympathetic as the neighbors  some thought the holocaust symbol was amusing others blamed liberals and people who didn t vote for trump others blamed the homeowners some  like this guy with a confederate flag  thought the swastika was no big deal the united nations did it  really john kerry even got the blame and there were some proud nazis saying that the jewish family brought it on themselves for being jewish this guy hates jews too this voice of sanity got absolutely zero likes part of the blame for this belongs with the conservative media  who has been jumping on a few faked hate crimes to try to delegitimize true hate crimes  and trust me  there s been no shortage as the comments show  racists and antisemitics feel empowered now  and for that we can blame donald trump  while the right wing media is pointing to  or maybe  instances of faked hate crimes  the southern poverty law center has collected more than   incidents of hate crimes  just since the election   of those have included a swastika and  have been anti semitic  these weren t done by liberals or by people who voted for hillary clinton  donald trump brought this on featured image via screen capture from embedded facebook post
