the results of the disappointing  presidential election aren t even official yet  but vice president joe biden is already making noise about   known for bucking the rules and speaking from his gut  the outgoing vice president hinted that he might be up for another fight four years from now cnn asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again  yeah  i am  i m going to run in    biden responded when asked for what position  biden responded   for president  what the hell  man  when cnn told biden it was planning to publish his quotes  the vice president responded   that s okay  no  i ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the senate  it s a great feeling to come back  i love this place  biden later clarified   i m not committing not to run  i m not committing to anything  i learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening  biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in america  and that popularity is even higher among democrats  biden is seen by many as a democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum  but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a senator from delaware and then as a two term vice president biden would likely be able to tap into existing democratic donors if he ran  as he has near   name recognition domestically and internationally  besides first lady michelle obama  he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with president obama biden considered running in the  election  but decided against it after the tragic death of his son beau biden  since then  president obama has put biden in charge of the  moon shot  effort to find a cure for cancer  while biden endorsed and heavily campaigned for secretary hillary clinton in the  election featured image via flickr
