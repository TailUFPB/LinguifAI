it s been a tragic  but infuriating day for america  in the wake of the mass shooting at a church in texas  we ve all heard the obligatory  thoughts and prayers  and  may god be with yous   we ve come to expect from republicans who are more concerned about their nra ratings than they are about actual lives  so senator chris murphy of connecticut blasted them for it in his official statement on the shooting in it  he asks a very  very important question  how can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents  this is something he wants each of his republican colleagues to consider seriously as they go to sleep tonight  because many of these people  like ted cruz and paul ryan  claim to value human life in the abortion debate  but behave as though the deaths of thousands of people already here on this earth due to gun violence is simply the price of freedom  that s not valuing life  that s valuing the money they get from various lobbies murphy went on to state his heartbreak  not just over high profile mass shootings  but others as well  my heart breaks for sutherland springs  just like it still does for las vegas  and orlando  and charleston  and aurora  and blacksburg  and newtown  just like it does every night for chicago  and new orleans  and baltimore  and bridgeport  then he ended it with quite possibly the most powerful statement there is  the terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic  the time is now for congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something  congress continually fails to act because republicans won t  so while murphy diplomatically says that we aren t safe because congress is too cowardly to act  he s laying the blame for this squarely at his republican colleagues  feet  the saddest part is that the gop won t heed this  the gun lobby will have to be shut down one way or another for republicans to open their eyes to reality  you can read his full statement below whoa  this statement from  chrismurphyct on the sutherland springs  texas shooting is extremely powerful  wow  pic twitter com   erick fernandez   erickfernandez  november    image via erich schlegel getty images
