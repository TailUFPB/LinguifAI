it s been a very  very bad day for the newly elected donald trump administration  first  amid revelations of russian connections  his national security advisor  michael flynn  was forced to resign  now  others may soon follow  but it s the big guy himself that has mental health professionals concerned and in an open letter in the new york times  they begged that congress and the media do something about it the  mental health professionals  ranging from social workers to psychologists and psychiatrists have all violated the ethical code called the goldwater rule  which is a self imposed ban on diagnosing public officials  frankly  though  there hasn t been such a high level politician who s been putting us in as much danger as trump is  at least not since the resignation of richard m  nixon   so they felt it was time to speak out while the letter doesn t diagnose trump with a specific mental illness  like malignant narcissism   they are more generally concerned with trump s delusions of grandeur mr  trump s speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own  leading to rage reactions  his words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize  individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state  attacking facts and those who convey them  journalists  scientists  in a powerful leader  these attacks are likely to increase  as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed  we believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by mr  trump s speech and actions makes him incapable of serving safely as president others have gone even further in a bid to warn the public  psychologists are publishing their diagnoses of trump  most recently  john d  gartner said trump  is dangerously mentally ill and temperamentally incapable of being president  he believes trump shows signs of  malignant narcissism   which is defined as a mix of narcissism  antisocial personality disorder  aggression and sadism in campbells  psychiatric dictionary in december  three psychiatry professors wrote to president obama  calling trump  mentally unstable  his widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity  impulsivity  hypersensitivity to slights or criticism  and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office   the professors from harvard medical school and the university of california wrote to the then president  urging him to order a  full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation  of the then president elect unfortunately  obama  who was probably aware that trump was mentally unfit  had no legal recourse to do anything  trump  however  is a clear and present danger to our country  his refusal to accept even the tiniest amount of dissent  his business conflicts and his russian associations make it too dangerous for him to remain in office for another day  unfortunately  we have a republican congress that puts party before country  they d rather see it burn down than to damage their mission of complete corporate reign featured image via win mcnamee getty images
