house republicans failed to pass their disastrous healthcare bill on thursday and rachel maddow hilariously mocked them for it due to the deep unpopularity of the legislation  republican leadership decided to cancel the vote on the bill at the last minute rather than see it get humiliatingly defeated many republicans are leaning against the bill because it fails to lower premiums and would strip healthcare away from over  million americans  many of whom are conservatives who rely on the affordable care act  which actually does keep premiums lower and covers more people under the trumpcare bill  senior citizens would have to pay nearly ten times as much money on healthcare than what they currently pay under the affordable care act  and since senior citizens are a major voting block for the gop for some reason  republicans are backing away from the bill of course  republicans have been rehearsing the repeal of the affordable care act for years  holding over  separate votes in the house over the years just to make their conservative base happy  but now that more people understand what the affordable care act actually has done  they are fiercely opposing any repeal effort rachel maddow noted the angry crowds of constituents at republican town halls and pointed out with a laugh that the gop bill is more unpopular than despised new jersey governor chris christie  for every action  there is an equal and opposite reaction  in the universe  including our weird politics  a day after the election  nobody would have told you that republicans would have any trouble repealing obamacare  that s what they could do on their own  they d push on an open door  the affordable care act  they d been rehearsing repealing it for years  it would definitely be their first casualty  no problem  then they d get on to the hard stuff  but people all over the country in every congressional district in the country changed the course of that otherwise inevitable history the republican plan to repeal the affordable care act has a  percent approval rating  that s worse than chris christie  there is not a single congressional district in this country where the number of people who like the republican idea out number the people who strongly hate the republican idea  not in a single congressional district  that happens for a reason  that political climate doesn t exist in nature  it is created by people engaged in political action  maddow concluded the  minute segment by reminding everyone that republicans failed to pass their bill despite having majority control of the house and said it s all thanks to people who have added their voices to the chorus of those opposed to killing a law that actually helps people  for the people who have been trying to save the affordable care act all over the country  even what just happened tonight is huge   maddow said   everybody thought republicans would be able to move at will on this but people said nope  here s the video via youtube donald trump s healthcare plan would literally kill people in this country and that s not right  it s inhumane  it forces people to choose between getting medical care or not going bankrupt and that s morally wrong  healthcare is a human right and it s a need that no one should be priced out of having if republicans somehow ram this legislation down our throats they should be brutally punished for it  because any lawmaker who supports something that kills people is not someone who should be in public office featured image via screenshot
