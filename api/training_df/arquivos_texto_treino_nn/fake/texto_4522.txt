pennsylvania republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on election day in support of donald trump first proposed in june  house bill  would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters  which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote in other words  it would legalize voter intimidation as brennan center for justice counsel adam gitlin told propublica earlier this month  poll watchers  especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion  could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process  there s actually a risk that  in a more disorganized way  people are going to be showing up to the polls  they won t know the law  and they ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges   gitlin said   that can create the potential for a lot of disruption  longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote  and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls  as we all know  conservatives who support trump are racists who think their brand of christianity should be the law of the land  so it is likely they will challenge every black and latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a muslim and that s exactly what republican nominee donald trump wants  we re going to watch pennsylvania   trump declared during a rally in the state last month   go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don t come in and vote five times  if you do that  we re not going to lose  the only way we can lose  in my opinion   i really mean this  pennsylvania   is if cheating goes on  trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to  stop crooked hillary from rigging this election  in response to trump s claim that the election will be rigged against him  pennsylvania republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor  originally  it was only going to go into effect  days after passage with the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate  pennsylvania is even more important now  but voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in trump s favor and effect races down the ticket  in short  trump and the republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal  and if it works in pennsylvania you can bet that republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else featured image  jeff swensen getty images
