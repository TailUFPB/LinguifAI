figuring out the best way to deal with healthcare and health insurance is very delicate  complicated  we ve got hundreds of thousands of americans to take care of or do we  we re all going to die anyway  at least  according to fox news fox news has presented the best argument to the health insurance problem on wednesday by revealing that we will all one day die so it doesn t matter  we can all pack up and go home   everything is solved  you know what the crazy thing is   lisa kennedy montgomery said to her fellow hosts  chuckling after each soundbite from the democrats   we re all gonna die  and they can t predict there  there s no way  unless they re absolutely psychic and have a party line to heaven  they don t know who is going to die  or when  or how many people  this revelation and chuckling came after airing statements from democratic leaders nancy pelosi and vermont senator bernie sanders  in which they warn that cutting health care access for at least  million people by  a figure the nonpartisan congressional budget office released this week   could result in thousands of deaths across the nation i guess when you get down to it  the genius of this argument is pretty funny  it s so simple newsweek points out that multiple studies over the course of decades have consistently reflected a decrease in deaths from treatable diseases when there is increased access to coverage  a new england journal of medicine report states  the largest decreases  were for deaths from  health care amenable  conditions such as heart disease  infections and cancer  which are more plausibly affected by access to medical care  beginning with the institute of medicine s  report  care without coverage   some analyses have suggested that lack of insurance causes tens of thousands of deaths each year in the united states   the journal wrote in its report   health insurance coverage and health what the recent evidence tells us  several quasi experimental studies using population level data and longer follow up offer more precise estimates of coverage s effect on mortality   it continues   one study compared three states implementing large medicaid expansions in the early  to neighboring states that didn t expand medicaid  finding a significant  percent decrease in mortality over five years of follow up  source  newsweekin other words  the personalities on fox news are completely lost  do people genuinely watch fox news  do they really soak all this in  there s enough evidence to show that cutting medical coverage will seriously hurt thousands of people  yet fox news is happy to laugh it off featured image via robin marchant getty images
