the ties between donald trump s presidential campaign and the regime of russian leader vladimir putin have been extensive and troubling as they ve been revealed over the course of the campaign  trump has repeatedly praised putin  despite his invasion of ukraine and his belligerent attitude on the international stage  including his support of syrian dictator assad in exchange  putin has also had nice words for trump  and it is believed that russia is backing hackers who have attacked  democratic nominee hillary clinton and the democratic party now trump has escalated the back and forth by promoting a delusional conspiracy theory that began on russian propaganda websites  from cnn trump didn t cite a source to back up his claim  but the most recent report alleging this came from sputnik news  a russian state owned news agency  google search engine was suppressing the bad news about hillary clinton   trump said  apparently referring to google searches during the first presidential debate on monday night trump s remarks wednesday night came two weeks after sputnik news  a russian government controlled news agency  published a report claiming that google search results are biased in clinton s favor  conservative news outlets  including breitbart news  whose chairman became trump s campaign ceo last month  linked to the report trump has surrounded his campaign with conspiracy theorists  including radio host alex jones  who is an ardent trump supporter and who believes that the   terrorist attacks were an  inside job  executed by the u s  government  jones also believes that the children murdered at sandy hook elementary were  crisis actors  there is no truth to trump s claim about google  and it is very possible he got the information from jones  who has alleged that he is in phone contact with trump trump s supporters ate up the claim  as a majority of them visit and believe the same propaganda false stories as their leader does featured image via wikimedia commons
