once again  a mouthpiece for donald trump gets their ass handed to them for blatantly lying on the air during her show on saturday morning  msnbc host joy reid had to frustratingly correct trump supporter david malpass for making false claims about hillary clinton it began with reid talking about the alleged  pay to play  scandal republicans have been accusing the former secretary of state of conducting in conjunction with the clinton foundation during her years in the post reid explained that if donald trump gave    to the clinton foundation which then went to fighting aids in africa  which benefits those who get treatment  reid pointed out that getting a phone call from clinton aide huma abedin is not proof of pay to play however  donald trump giving    to florida attorney general pam bondi s campaign in exchange for getting the investigation against trump university dropped in that state is the very definition of pay to play malpass tried to claim that there were   million contributions but when challenged to provide proof of that claim malpass could not do so  reid called out malpass for lying and went on to explain that the associated press found that only  of the meetings that clinton had with people who were donors but not one of those meetings occurred after a donation was made the ap story was  pilloried   reid said   because they attempted to find pay to play and found nothing  huma abedin emailing you back is not getting something   reid continued   it s huma abedin emailing you back  malpass  however  desperately tried to pin something on hillary clinton and brought up her emails  which have nothing to do with the topic at hand  reid called malpass out again  but he continued to claim that the emails  brought out the information  about the clinton foundation  malpass also claimed that hillary clinton has not held any press conferences but reid corrected him again by pointing out that she held two last week as reid repeatedly shamed malpass for  conflating press conferences  emails and foundations   her other guest kurt eichenwald broke out in laughter because malpass was clearly making false claims by the end of the segment  a frustrated reid admitted that her head hurts after having to debunk so much bullshit from trump s minions here s the video via youtube trump and his team are desperate to make anything clinton does into a scandal  and that s why any claims they make that they are somehow winning this election are complete bullshit  a winning campaign does not have to stoop to telling outright lies to the media every day  but that is what trump is doing because his poll numbers have imploded and his campaign has fallen off a cliff republicans have waged countless witch hunts using taxpayer money in an effort to sabotage the woman who stands in their way of absolute power and they have failed miserably because the investigations have always cleared hillary clinton of wrongdoing  rather than admit that  trump and his minions would rather repeat lies because it s all they have left featured image via screenshot
