the pro gun crowd loves guns first  and respect last  at least  that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black and white war photo  the photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave  the troops  are just obeying orders   and the dead in the mass grave are  citizens obeying gun laws  this is the meme image via twitterwe don t know who created this  but we don t have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them  the piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that  had the jewish citizens of germany and elsewhere just had guns  the holocaust wouldn t have happened the photo in the meme is from the german occupied soviet union  and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the einsatzgr ppen  they were tasked with mass executions of jews  communists  and anyone else that the nazis decided weren t suitable to living their empire and master race  tens of thousands were murdered this way   they are part of the holocaust the myth of guns and the holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description  yes  the nazis seized guns from their enemies  however  they actually didn t make much of a dent in total gun circulation in germany  contrary to what the gun rights crowd wants us to believe furthermore  the nazis actually loosened gun laws in  for everyone except jews  people who have a basic understanding of nazi germany know that the nazis targeted more groups than jews  and they know that more people than jews opposed the nazis however quietly they had to why didn t those people  who could own guns  rise up  it s because of the power of a police state   the very thing the  moar gunz  crowd fears the most therefore  the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about  but worse than that  they have no problem whatsoever with using the horror of the holocaust to further their  all guns all the time  agenda  that is just abominable  and has no place in any discourse at all  here s why  this historical second guessing is deeply offensive to jews  holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against hitler during world war ii  it is  in fact  as many historians have previously noted  a distortion of history itself when you manipulate the history of the holocaust and use it to score political points  its wholly inappropriate and offensive  especially for the sake of the victims of the nazi onslaught and their memory  it must stop  that s from jonathan greenblatt  the national director of the anti defamation league  he was speaking against ben carson s painfully offensive assertion that the nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill jews with impunity  but it s just not true  and it s an serious affront to every single victim of the nazis  as well as everyone who fought them this meme s creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out featured image via screen capture from twitter
