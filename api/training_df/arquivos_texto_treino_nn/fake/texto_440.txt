donald trump s credibility and  power  has become such a joke that not even members of his own party have any faith in him to deal with the current issues that america is facing on sunday  republican sen  jeff flake  r az  unintentionally showed everyone just how little the gop believes in trump when he couldn t force himself to say that trump could handle the current nuclear crisis the united states is facing with north korea  in an interview with cnn s dana bash  flake was put on the spot about how capable trump is  and isn t   bash asked flake  senator  there are a lot of people waking up this morning in this country very concerned about what they re hearing from north korea  do you share clapper s concern  not just about north korea  but with the president s ability to respond  flake couldn t give a straight answer  he said  well  i   i do have good confidence in our national security team and those who are advising the president  and the president does not have experience in this   in this kind of situation  but few presidents do when they come into office  and i m confident that the people around the president are giving him good advice  and i believe that he will follow it  i sure hope he does  obviously  you like a leader that s measured and sober and consistent  our allies want to hear that  i think our adversaries need to hear that  but we have got a good team around the president  bash was quick to put flake on the spot and point out that he hadn t actually said that trump could handle this matter  bash pressed   senator  you talked there about the president s team  but not about the president himself  are you concerned about the president himself  as james clapper is  flake continued to stumble through this interview  well  like i said  no president comes in prepared with regard to foreign policy experience  that s why you have a good team around them  i have had my concerns  i think everyone has  at some of the statements that have been made by the president with regard to nato and other areas in foreign policy  like i said  i think we   we want somebody who is   who is measured and sober and consistent and conservative in this regard  but he has a good team around him  and i have confidence in them  this is absolutely humiliating for trump  not only was his defense secretary  james mattis  sent out earlier today to deliver a public statement on north korea in his place  but now a member of his own party practically said trump isn t capable of handling north korea  flake refused to support trump and say he was a competent president  and instead opted to talk about the experts surrounding him you can watch flake humiliate trump below featured image via screenshot
