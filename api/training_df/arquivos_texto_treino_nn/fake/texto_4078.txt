the presidential debates have been comedy gold for saturday night live and a disaster for donald trump and that didn t change last night like the first two debates  snl s cold open featured the third and final debate between donald trump as played by alec baldwin and hillary clinton as played by kate mckinnon  only this time  the show featured tom hanks as fox news host and debate moderator chris wallace hanks  wallace kicks things off by comparing the debate to the the third lord of the rings film   you don t really want to watch  but hey  you ve come this far  mckinnon s hillary was eager to feast on trump  remarking that she  set the table  during the first debate   fired up the grill  during the second   and declared that she ll be carving him up and serving up the feast this time around baldwin s trump announced that he would be speaking very quietly like a  baby trump  this time around  but quickly blew that idea to smithereens when asked about reproductive rights   they re ripping babies out of vaginas   he yelled hillary responded by sarcastically claiming that the two people most qualified to talk about women s issues are on the stage because she s had a child and used birth control while trump is a child and his face is birth control the next question involved immigration and upon trump saying  bad hombres   hillary interrupted to inform wallace that she filled out her bingo card trump then bragged about his relationship with mexican president mr  guacamole and his wife tacito as hillary banged her head against the microphone while trying to explain his plan for isis  trump sniffled his way through a confusing statement which wallace thankfully interrupted much to trump s relief the sexual assault allegation against trump were also addressed  but when trump claimed that  no one has more respect for women than i do   the entire planet erupted in laughter trump then complained that the election is being  rigged  by the media because they  take everything i say and everything i do and put it on tv  wallace then tries to get trump to repeat after him the he will accept the results of the election if he loses but trump tweaked it by saying he ll only accept the results  if i win  here s the full video via youtube it s too bad there isn t a fourth debate  because while america probably doesn t want to see the two candidates again  they ll definitely miss baldwin and mckinnon adding laughter to this madness featured image  screenshot
