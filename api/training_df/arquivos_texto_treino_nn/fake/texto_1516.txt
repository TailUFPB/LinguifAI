by generous accounts trump is facing a scandal as inflammatory as watergate  by less than generous accounts  trump is facing a scandal even more inflammatory than watergate  so what is he doing to address it  apparently  clamping his hands over his ears  squeezing his eyes closed tight and wishing it was november    again in what may go down as one of the saddest moments in west wing history  trump s aides were spotted shuffling in a giant framed picture of you guessed it  the election map  adding even more idiocy to the moment  the map is helpfully marked   presidential election results  spotted  a map to be hung somewhere in the west wing pic twitter com tpppdynfte  trey yingst   treyyingst  may    was a blown up version of the same election map that trump has been carrying around with him as he goes about his days  he is so proud of the election map that he even printed out extra copies to give to several reporters who sat down with him in the oval office here s a pic from reuters of trump with the electoral maps he showed to reporters yesterday pic twitter com   gideon resnick   gideonresnick  april    reportedly loves his maps so much that he begged the washington post run the map on the front page of its newspaper   they said no  the framed picture which will now hang somewhere in the west wing  along historic portraits of former presidents and paintings commissioned from world famous painters  seems to be trump s answer to the press for not doing his bidding  if you won t run the map in your newspapers  i ll just hang it up in the white house trump  angry  bitter  and increasingly beleaguered by self created scandals  has retreated further and further into his ego friendly safe space  the fact that his map   which reflects the election results by county   doesn t show what he thinks it shows only makes his desperation more pathetic  trump see s a lot of red  literally explains to reporter that it represents  us   and thinks it shows that people like him  instead  the map s colors are misleading  trump may have won a lot of counties   but the ones he won are mostly empty  and trees don t vote  the blue spots represent the biggest areas of human population in the country  including trump s hometown of new york city  and they all voted against him  that s why he lost by three million votes featured image via twitter
