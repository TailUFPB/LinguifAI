donald trump has been positioning himself as an outsider who is going to clean up the corruption that is rampant in the united states government  that is  of course  absolute hogwash  it is the billionaire class that has ushered in our current era of oligarchical rule  on sunday  cnn political analyst van jones informed one of trump s surrogates that he is a billionaire who manipulates the tax code for his benefit and thus is the corruption he claims to be fighting during sunday s broadcast of cnn s state of the union  the show s host jake tapper questioned trump super fan rachel campos duffy on the new york times  revelation that trump may have used the tax code in a way to get out of paying income taxes for two decades  she dodged his question and said that president obama is  the epitome of cronyism  jones then called out campos duffy for evading the question  saying  that s a good pivot   that s when jones let campos duffy have it  he lambasted her and trump for championing his tax manipulation   it is  in fact  true if donald trump lost a billion dollars  think about this  lost a billion dollars  he could wind up as a winner legally in his taxes for a generation  is that because he s a genius   jones asked incredulously   it s because billionaires have armies of lobbyists to write the rules  here s the deal  if you re obeying horrible rules that you helped to write  that doesn t make you a genius  it makes you a part of the corruption  that s exactly what every trump supporter needs to understand  trump is not the answer to the problems that are facing the nation  by electing trump as president  all they are doing is taking the middle man out of the corrupt political process  instead of electing officials who take orders from the wealthy  they would just be electing the wealthy to the office directly  the segment is one of the best that has come out of a political talk show this election season  van jones masterfully expresses what so many who have been fighting against trump since he was crowned with republican presidential nomination  what s more  center for american progress  ceo neera tanden explains exactly why it is so important for trump to release his tax returns  if he did so  he could prove that he is as honest as he says he is  however  he won t   he has broken from decades of tradition and only offers pathetic excuses as to why he won t release his returns  it does not appear that he will do so even now  that s because he has something to hide  the moment he does his campaign will be effectively over  if one snippet of info from his  returns can be as damaging as they have so far been  one can only imagine the skeletons he is hiding you can watch the segment below in full featured image from video screenshot
