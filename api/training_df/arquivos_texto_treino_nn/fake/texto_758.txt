donald trump s conflicts of interest are finally starting to create some major problems for the undeserving potus when trump was elected  most americans were up in arms over the fact that trump has so many messy  shady business ties and would clearly be trying to exploit his position in the white house for his own personal gain  judging from what we ve seen from trump and his corrupt family in these short six months of his presidency  we had every right to be worried   trump has been trying to profit off of his new role from the second he stepped into the white house fortunately  members of congress are standing up to this unethical behavior  on monday  a democrat in the u s  house of representatives proposed legislation that would prevent the government from renting rooms at any of trump s hotels for official business matters  in a statement that pretty much reflects exactly how most americans feel about this  representative don beyer of virginia said  donald trump should not be allowed to line his or his family s pockets with taxpayer dollars  exactly  rep  beyer also stated that these amendments to a spending bill were critical due to trump s unprecedented failure to divest from his business  and the ongoing entanglement between the trump organization and the white house   this is following a similar motion that happened last month  when the attorneys general of maryland and the district of columbia filed a lawsuit that stated it was a constitutional violation to make government payments to trump s businesses the white house has yet to comment on this  but we can all be certain that trump is going to have a colossal meltdown over it  every time someone calls out his unethical actions   even if they re  percent true   trump acts like a toddler and has a meltdown  whether he likes it or not  trump should not be profiting from his presidency when he is supposed to be serving the american people  and his personal interests must be blocked featured image via alex wong    getty images
