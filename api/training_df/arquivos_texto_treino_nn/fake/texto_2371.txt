earlier today  donald trump told a group of u s  governors that his mysterious  frustratingly nonspecific replacement plan for obamacare  also known as the affordable care act  would give states more flexibility amongst other soaring promises  he also thanked some of the governors in the room for helping him because he obviously knew nothing about health care before he stepped into his role as potus   and he probably still doesn t trump s plan to repeal and replace obamacare was a disaster from the start  and we re now seeing protests erupt across the country as millions of americans stand to lose life saving affordable health care if trump gets his way  many prominent gopers have also spoken out against completely taking obamacare away from the american people  but trump isn t listening in his speech  trump addressed the reason why his plan has been so secretive and poorly planned  stating that health care was  unbelievably complex   he said  we have come up with a solution that s really  really i think very good  it s an unbelievably complex subject  nobody knew that health care could be so complicated  we have a plan that i think is going to be fantastic  it s going to be released fairly soon  i think it s going to be something special   i think you re going to like what you hear  and of course  he couldn t provide any details as usual  despite bragging about the republican party s major move to repeal and replace a health care law that has given millions of americans affordable  accessible health care  trump and the gop have done nothing but stall and beat around the bush  and yet despite having a concrete solution  trump dissed obamacare  as soon as we touch it  if we do the most minute thing  just a tiny little change  what s going to happen  they re going to say it s the republicans  problem  but we have to do what s right because obamacare is a failed disaster  you can watch trump s speech below featured image via pool   getty images
