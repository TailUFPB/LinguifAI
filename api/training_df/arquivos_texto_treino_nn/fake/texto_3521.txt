a major bipartisan infrastructure bill has gone through the house  and it proved that house republicans don t care all that much about  buy american   just like their lord and savior  king cheeto   the bill  which would have permanently required all piping for water infrastructure projects receiving federal funding to be made in the u s   has sadly been watered down to a single year why is this  trump made a huge deal about  made in america   and how american manufacturing has gone down the tubes over the last  years  yet all his products are made overseas  as are most of what his daughter  ivanka  sells in her fashion line  trump has said that his   trillion infrastructure plan would have strong  buy american  requirements  so either the gop doesn t care what their own leader wants  or trump cares even less about american manufacturing than we thought or both  critics say that it amounts to giving federal funding to some companies  and not others  creating a system of  winners and losers  in the market  that s what they always say  and they have yet to be proven right  senate democrats see it differently  and have been waging a twitter campaign to build support for keeping the permanent requirement in place   senatorbaldwin s  buyamerica provision would help build us infrastructure w  us steel  how can  housegop oppose this obvious job creator   chuck schumer   senschumer  december     realdonaldtrump  tell  speakerryan to put  buyamerica back in water bill  american tax dollars for american jobs https   t co zpzjrhoocf  sherrod brown   sensherrodbrown  december      housegop plan harms american manufacturing   housedemocrats will fight to support  buyamerica   we urge  realdonaldtrump to do same   rep  jim mcgovern   repmcgovern  december    housesgop plan harms american manufacturing   housedemocrats will fight to support  buyamerica   we urge  realdonaldtrump to do same https   t co   bonnie watsoncoleman   repbonnie  december    to illinois senator elect tammy baldwin  trump has been silent about this problem while sitting in his gilded bubble at the top of trump tower  by removing my buy america standard  speaker ryan and house republicans are embracing the status quo in washington  this is a failure by house leadership to make a solid commitment to american manufacturers and workers   said senator baldwin   american workers should build our infrastructure with american products and taxpayers  money should not be spent on chinese or russian iron and steel  it s disappointing that the president elect is sitting silent in trump tower  one would think that  if he can blast boeing for something that isn t happening  then he can at least issue a statement of disappointment in house republicans for removing the provision  now democrats have to introduce it as a separate amendment it s true that the single year provision ends up in appropriations bills for the drinking water state revolving fund  which is a joint project between the states and the federal government for water infrastructure improvements  this particular bill would be part of that  but having to reinsert the  buy american  language in every appropriations bill every year makes it easier to remove however  it s also true that  if republicans were serious about bolstering american manufacturing  they d take a harder look at putting a permanent requirement in this kind of a bill  the free market certainly isn t doing anything to help  and gutting trade agreements could make things worse all throughout our economy but whatever  we know by now that the gop has badly failed american workers with their dogmatic adherence to the extreme  reckless brand of capitalism we practice here  they ll continue to do it until they have strong reason not to  and that involves the wealthy getting severely pissed at them featured image by mark wilson via getty images
