at this point  there is no doubt that vladimir putin s russian regime hacked the  election  and they did it with one purpose  to elect donald trump president of the united states  now that this effort has been successful  many republicans are doing all they can to pretend that this isn t as serious as it is  since it benefits their party and chosen american leader  however  one american hero is furious with his fellow republicans over their response to these russian hacks  and that is former prisoner of war and arizona senator john mccain senator mccain appeared on cnn s state of the union on sunday morning  and had some very strong warnings for those who refuse to take the fact that russia hacked our elections for the threat to this great republic that it is  mccain said to host jake tapper  this is the sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after world war ii  which has made one of the most peaceful periods in the history of the world  this is serious business  if they re able to harm the electoral process  they may destroy democracy  which is based on free and fair elections  because of the gravity of this situation  mccain is going up against his fellow republicans and calling for a special committee to investigate the activities of the russians and especially vladimir putin  and insists that it must be done in a timely and bipartisan fashion  without regard for political gains or consequences  thus far  mccain and south carolina senator lindsey graham are the only ones being forceful here  as the two most powerful republicans in congress  house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  are instead choosing to roll over for donald trump  however  mccain isn t letting up  he has written a letter to mcconnell  signed by fellow republican senator lindsey graham  as well as senate minority leader chuck schumer   d ny  and democratic senator jack reed  d ri   the letter said  in part  cyber is the rare kind of all encompassing challenge for which the congress s jurisdictional boundaries are an impediment to sufficient oversight and legislative action  only a select committee that is time limited  cross jurisdictional  and purpose driven can address the challenge of cyber   the letter said   we believe it is justified by the extraordinary scope and scale of the cyber problem  this is what bipartisan patriotism looks like  direct threats to our democracy like what russia has done is nothing to play with simply because it benefits one s own party  i never though i d say this  but why can t more republicans be like john mccain and lindsey graham mccain continued to tapper  there s no doubt they were interfering and no doubt it was a cyber attack  the question now is how much and what damage and what should the united states of america do  and so far  we ve been totally paralyzed  i m sure that when vladimir putin was told quote  cut it out  unquote  i m sure that vladimir putin immediately stopped all cyber activities  the truth is  they are hacking every single day  so true  this is a threat that must be met head on  and with as much force as possible  party politics be damned  our very way of life depends upon it watch mccain s remarks below featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
