hillary clinton is far from the perfect politician  she sometimes comes across as cold  as unemotional  she  unlike her opponent  though  is perfectly aware of her flaws and in a deeply moving op ed in the humans of new york blog  clinton opens up about her flaws and about being a woman in what s still a man s world if anyone is demonstrating the double standard between women and men  it s clinton s opponent  donald trump  who just this week said that clinton doesn t have  a presidential look   yeah  we know what that means  or how about the people who are criticizing clinton for not smiling enough  could you imagine that happening with a man by this time  clinton is used to the double standard  but it does make it tougher for the most qualified presidential candidate in decades to compete  in the article in humans of new york  clinton talked about her history and about how hard she works at not appearing too feminine she relayed a story about law school  and how hard she worked to learn to control her emotions  she also recognizes that she comes across as cold and unemotional because of that  i had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions  and that s a hard path to walk  because you need to protect yourself  you need to keep steady  but at the same time you don t want to seem  walled off   and sometimes i think i come across more in the  walled off  arena  and if i create that perception  then i take responsibility  i don t view myself as cold or unemotional  and neither do my friends  and neither does my family  but if that sometimes is the perception i create  then i can t blame people for thinking that  as for the inevitable comparisons with bill clinton and barack obama  well  she knows she doesn t have their charisma  she also sees how hard they work on it  i m not barack obama  i m not bill clinton  both of them carry themselves with a naturalness that is very appealing to audiences  but i m married to one and i ve worked for the other  so i know how hard they work at being natural  it s not something they just dial in  they work and they practice what they re going to say  it s not that they re trying to be somebody else  but it s hard work to present yourself in the best possible way  she also notes that there are very few role models for women in politics and that obama s and her husband s type of charisma doesn t work for women it s a double edged sword  clinton is accused of being stiff  but if she s animated  things get even worse  but i ve learned that i can t be quite so passionate in my presentation  i love to wave my arms  but apparently that s a little bit scary to people  and i can t yell too much  it comes across as  too loud  or  too shrill  or  too this  or  too that   which is funny  because i m always convinced that the people in the front row are loving it  if clinton wins  some of these double standards might start drifting away  but it s still a misogynistic world  a woman president won t solve misogyny any more than an african american president solved racism  it s a societal problem  but for those who don t consider themselves sexist  perhaps it s time to take a good hard look at your criticisms of clinton  would the criticisms be the same if she was a man featured image via justin sullivan getty images
