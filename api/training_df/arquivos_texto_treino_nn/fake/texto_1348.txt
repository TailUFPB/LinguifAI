yesterday  donald trump visited brussels and met with several top leaders of the european union  as expected  he completely blew it and humiliated america once again earlier that day  german leader angela merkel had spoken at nato hq  where she took a shot at trump when she said it wasn t the  building of walls that makes us successful   merkel and trump already have a rocky relationship  as america s unworthy potus has publicly disrespected merkel several times  trump had responded by criticizing nato for not putting enough money toward defense  but apparently he didn t get it all out of his system  while in brussels  trump continued to lash out at merkel with his usual childish behavior and went off on a disgusting rant against the germans german publication der spiegel reported that as trump spoke to eu commissioner jean claude juncker and european council president donald tusk  trump further damaged america s standing with germany by saying this  the germans are bad  very bad  trump also promised to put an end to german car sales in the united states  look at the millions of cars they sell in the us  and we ll stop that  junker tried to explain to incompetent trump that free trade was beneficial  and eu attendees expressed concern that trump actually had no idea how eu trade agreements actually worked  and that america couldn t isolate germany in negotiations overall  trump s statements about germany were extremely embarrassing and a pathetic response driven by trump s fragile ego  it couldn t be more clear that trump has no idea what he s doing as potus  and has even less awareness about how america s relations with other parts of the world really work  every time he meets with world leaders  he shames our country and his first overseas trip couldn t be better proof of that featured image via sean gallup   getty images
