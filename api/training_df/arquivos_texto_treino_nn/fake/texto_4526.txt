while giving a speech at a church rally in cleveland  donald trump confused everyone by actually siding with a victim of police brutality instead of law enforcement   and it s gotten him in trouble with america s largest police union in speaking to the rally goers in cleveland  trump strayed from his normal  pro cop rhetoric to say a few unflattering words about betty shelby  the tulsa police officer who shot an unarmed black man  clearly worried about how horrendously his attempts to reach black voters have failed  trump gave an unusually thoughtful response to a group of african american pastors  in which he suggested that shelby had  choked   now  did she get scared  was she choking  what happened  but maybe people like that  people that choke  people that do that  maybe they can t be doing what they re doing  okay  they can t be doing what they re doing i watched the shooting in particular in tulsa  and that man was hands up  that man went to the car  hands up  put his hand on the car  i mean  to me  it looked like he did everything you re supposed to do  and he looked like a really good man  trump made these comments just five days after the fraternal order of police  fop   which has   members  endorsed him  but after hearing trump criticize the tulsa police officer  fop executive director jim pasco is livid and thinks trump s comments were inappropriate  pasco said that trump must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all  including police officers  now  no one should be proud or relieved that trump finally decided to acknowledge police brutality victims   he s been known to pander to whatever audience he is in front of at any given moment  and is notorious for flip flopping almost instantly  this speech was easy for trump to say in front of black pastors   i doubt he would have dared to say this in front of a predominately white audience  trump also knows he is struggling tremendously with the minority vote  which may very well determine this election  trump will say whatever he needs to win   but this time  he lost a major support group here s the clip that got trump in trouble with the police union featured image via joe raedle   getty images
