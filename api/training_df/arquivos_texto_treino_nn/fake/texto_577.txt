when donald trump was elected  many hoped that his daughter ivanka and her husband  jared kushner  would be a moderating influence when it came to tamping down on a far right agenda  however  those of us who held out that hope were disappointed time and time again  trump hired white supremacists to work in the west wing of the white house in the form of open white nationalist stephen k  bannon as his chief strategist  anti immigrant extremist stephen miller as his speech writer and immigration policy adviser  and neo nazi sebastian gorka as a senior adviser  trump also promptly attacked the lgbtq community   a group of people ivanka has been openly supportive of  therefore  it was concluded that ivanka and jared could not reign in trump s worst instincts ivanka has been totally silent when it comes to her father s bigotry  and has even defended him when it comes to people calling him out for being a misogynist  however  it seems that the white supremacist violence that resulted in several deaths in charlottesville  virginia this weekend was too much for her  while trump himself gave a tepid response from prepared remarks regarding this tragedy that was a direct result of open bigotry  ivanka took to twitter to denounce the hate and to call out neo nazis and white supremacists  she tweeted   there should be no place in society for racism  white supremacy and neo nazis   ivanka trump   ivankatrump  august     we must all come together as americans   and be one country united   charlottesville  ivanka trump   ivankatrump  august    no mistake   ivanka will not call her father out for not strongly condemning this  she has to know he s a racist  after all  she s his daughter  and she watched the kind of campaign he ran just like the rest of us  but  credit must be given where credit is due  it is likely not easy to break with one s father in a family that operates the way the trumps do  so  in this instance  way to go ivanka  maybe your father will take a cue from you and speak out in a more direct and appropriate way  i won t hold my breath on that one  though featured image via win mcnamee getty images
