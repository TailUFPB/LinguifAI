this needs to happen david letterman is no stranger to dealing with donald trump  the comedy legend humiliated trump repeatedly as host of the late show  and since retiring  letterman hasn t shied away from commenting on trump s dumpster fire presidency when he is asked about it during an interview with the associated press on monday  letterman made it clear that he is sick of trump s constant whining and offered a brilliant solution  we know there s something wrong  but what i m tired of is people  daily  nightly  on all the cable news shows telling us there s something wrong   letterman said before calling for action  i just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it   letterman continued   and other people have made this point  if the guy was running dairy queen  he d be gone  this guy couldn t work at the gap  so why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness  his ignorance  indeed  trump would have been fired long before now and definitely would not have even been hired after many of the things he has said in public  ordinary american workers would no longer have a job if they repeated some of things trump has said letterman also had a message for trump s supporters  letterman said he feels bad for them because they got duped into thinking trump would be best for america  letterman said that he wishes trump would be the one who fixes the problems our country faces  but trump is not the right person to get the job done  in fact  trump should be ousted from office and placed  in a home  where he can get the medication he needs whenever he feels the need to rant uncontrollably  but it s just the behavior is insulting to americans  whether you voted for him or not   and i feel bad for people who did vote for him because he promised them things that they really needed and one wonders if he s really going to come through  i know there s trouble in this country and we need a guy who can fix that trouble  i wish it was trump  but it s not  so let s just stop whining about what a goon he is and figure out a way to take him aside and put him in a home  david letterman s solution is a great idea but the only place donald trump should really be right now is prison  either that or a mental health facility featured image  screenshot
