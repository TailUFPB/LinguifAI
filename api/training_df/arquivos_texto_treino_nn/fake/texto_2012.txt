president obama has finally been vindicated after seven years of republican attacks on the affordable care act resulted in humiliating failure on friday once again  republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote for their trumpcare bill the day after previously pulling it because many republicans couldn t bring themselves to vote for such a terrible piece of legislation the bill would have repealed the affordable care act  stripping healthcare from over  million americans and causing healthcare premiums to skyrocket donald trump  of course  immediately blamed democrats for the defeat even though republicans control the house  senate  and the white house in short  republicans only have themselves to blame because they are the ones who tried to replace the affordable care act with a plan that was just awful and universally opposed across the country adding insult to injury  fox news anchor bret baier forcefully pointed out that while republicans went down in flames  president obama won the day  let me just say one thing  the biggest winner today  president barack obama  who came out this week and defended his legacy healthcare law   baier began   it is now clear that republicans cannot do  at least yet  what they planned on doing in the campaign  after campaign from          repeal and replace  was the mantra  indeed  republicans rehearsed their repeal of the affordable care act incessantly  holding over  useless symbolic votes over the years  but when push came to shove  republicans demonstrated that they are incapable of governing even when they control every branch of government  barack obama has the win right now  and it has changed the entire way that we look at healthcare   baier continued   it is now the democrats  version  the ideology  that government does have a role in providing healthcare in some way shape or form  thousands of americans across the country showed up at town halls to confront republicans in defense of the affordable care act and only  percent of americans approved of their bill and in the end  not enough republicans were willing to commit political suicide by supporting the bill and decided to stand against it instead in conclusion  baier echoed fox business host stuart varney by noting that republicans control congress and the white house but still could not get anything done  the repeal  drag it up by the root has not worked   baier said   they can t get it through a republican house  a republican senate and a republican president  today is a win for president barack obama  here s the video via youtube americans should remain vigilant  however  and continue to watch republicans closely to make sure they don t try to sneak the bill through  just like the affordable care act failed a few times before it passed  the gop could always bring up their terrible bill again for another vote  it will be up to each and every one of us to make sure they fail again  but for now  the affordable care act is the law and republicans should accept that and get over it featured image via pete souza
