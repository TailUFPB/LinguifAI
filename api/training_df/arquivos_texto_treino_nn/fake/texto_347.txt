let s just put it this way  if world leaders really agree with donald trump they have a lot of explaining to do in their home countries because a massive global survey found that only two nations think trump is doing a good job during his speech to the united nations general assembly this week  trump voiced his disdain for the united nations  accusing the organization of being a mismanaged bureaucracy and threatened to pull american financial and military support trump also threatened war with north korea and criticized the iran nuclear deal while one of his top advisers told climate ministers that trump is still withdrawing america from the historic paris climate agreement afterwards  trump took to twitter to boast about his speech  and claimed that those in attendance agreed with most or all of what he said a great and important day at the united nations met with leaders of many nations who agree with much  or all  of what i stated in my speech   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    fact  trump received tepid clapping from the general assembly  not even close to the kind of thunderous applause president obama received when he spoke before the international peace keeping body and a new study of global surveys reveals that most nations in the world have very little confidence in trump  which means all the world diplomats who supposedly agree with  much or all  of what trump said can expect to be replaced  in fact  the only nations who have a favorable view of trump are russia and israel according to fivethirtyeight com  since trump took office  confidence in the president has gone down further  on average  than favorability toward the u s   confidence dropped  points  u s  favorability just  points some of the biggest declines have been in countries with whom the u s  has a collective defense agreement  such as nato members and japan  especially when it comes to confidence in the president mexico  unsurprisingly  also saw a big public opinion drop on both questions  on the other hand  public favorability toward the u s  has gone up in russia  and public confidence in the president has gone up in both israel and russia since trump took office  while president obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of  to  percent  trump only has a rating of  percent one of the largest drops came from south korea  in which only  percent have confidence in trump   percent had confidence in president obama just two years ago  clearly  south koreans are alarmed by the pissing match trump is having with kim jong un to discover who is the craziest dictator of them all  overall  though  trump has brought a return to george w  bush era levels of favorability for the u s  and the presidency   fivethirtyeight concluded and it turns out that the world disagrees with trump on most of the issues only one nation agreed with trump s climate change policy  trump s mexican border wall was  almost universally disliked   his vows to withdraw from trade agreements were just as unpopular  only turkey approved of withdrawing from the iran deal  and only three nations approve of trump s muslim ban  basically  most of trump s supporters come from nations that have committed human rights violations or have oppressive governments in short  the world representatives who make up the united nations general assembly are more likely repulsed by trump  tepid clapping is not the definition of overwhelming agreement  trump thinks that everyone likes him and agrees with him because he is a delusional narcissist the reality is that trump has turned america into an international joke and has harmed our reputation around the globe  he is an embarrassment to our country who should be removed from office immediately before he inflicts more damage he is now the most hated president in history  and that must make george w  bush very happy  featured image  ron sachs   pool getty images
