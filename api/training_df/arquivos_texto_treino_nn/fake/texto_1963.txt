years of racism in the workplace has finally resulted in a long overdue lawsuit against fox news on the same day that fox host bill o reilly made an outrageously racist comment about congresswoman maxine waters  and a week after news broke that fox fired comptroller judith slater for making racist remarks to black employees  a racial discrimination lawsuit was formally filed against the network by two african american women who experienced the racism firsthand according to the new york times the women   tichaona brown  a payroll manager  and tabrese wright  a payroll coordinator   accused ms  slater of making numerous racially charged comments  including suggestions that black men were  women beaters  and that black people wanted to physically harm white people they also said that ms  slater claimed that black employees mispronounced words  such as  mother    father    month  and  ask   and that she urged ms  brown to say those words aloud in a meeting  ms  wright said ms  slater once asked if her three children were all  fathered by the same man  the lawsuit was filed in state supreme court in the bronx and the attorneys representing the two ladies are  confident  that fox is not going to like the outcome if they go to court  we are confident that the good men and women of the bronx will hold fox accountable for what we believe to be its abhorrent racist conduct  reminiscent of the jim crow era   they said in a joint statement of course  fox news whined about the lawsuit in a statement to raw story we take complaints of this nature very seriously and took prompt and effective remedial action before ms  brown and ms  wright sued in court and even before ms  wright complained through her lawyer  there is no place for inappropriate verbal remarks like this at fox news  we are disappointed that this needless litigation has been filed frankly  it s about damn time fox news faced a lawsuit like this  the network s record of racism and racist remarks has been atrocious over the years  especially since the election of the president obama in  bill o reilly and sean hannity have been especially guilty of being racist  yet unlike slater  they remain employed by the network o reilly has even been named in sexual harassment lawsuits but fox executives still keep paying him to run his mouth every night fox news is pretty much saying that it s okay if their on air personalities are sexist and racist but it s not okay for their executives who work behind the scenes  sounds like a double standard but the sexism and racism at fox news is now catching up to them as former and current employees are starting to fight back by filing lawsuits  at some point  fox news is going to have to drag itself and their employees into the  century before they go broke trying to defend themselves in court featured image  dangerous minds
