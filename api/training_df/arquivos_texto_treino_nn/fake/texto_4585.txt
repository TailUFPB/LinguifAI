just in case anybody s wondering just how dangerous trump s love of putin is  here s a little reminder  when putin was running for election in   he hosted a big  lavish banquet where he spoke to a variety of leaders on a variety of topics  when he addressed the americans there  he said that the only reason the u s  was interested in a relationship with moscow was because russia could destroy the u s   in a half hour or less  that s according to two authors of the russia china axis  who concluded from putin s thinly veiled threat  it would be difficult to find a statement more revealing about putin s true position regarding the united states  this is a man that donald trump repeatedly praises as a strong leader  and over whom he fawns because putin likes him  putin and trump are two of a kind in terms of demagoguery  but it s never been a secret that putin isn t a fan of the u s  it seems the only way he ll become a fan of us is if trump is elected why he likely believes he can pull trump s puppet strings  trump might think that putin is just a good negotiator  but he fails miserably at understanding the naked fact that putin sees us as his number one enemy if putin is actively working to undermine our democratic process  and there is credible evidence suggesting exactly that   then a president trump is very likely to just hand us over  knowingly or unknowingly  to a hostile leader who believes he can destroy us on a whim russia has a squillion nuclear weapons   that s never been a secret  we have roughly   of the damn things that aren t awaiting dismantlement while russia has roughly   in that state  in total  we have   while russia has    however  russia has managed to negotiate cuts in our arsenal while they work to strengthen theirs  some reports say that their military exercises center around nuclear strikes now in other words  their nuclear arsenal might be a bigger threat than ours  and they are more prepared for a nuclear war than we are  compare all of that to north korea s eight and iran s nonexistent nuclear arsenal  and one has to wonder why our leaders seem to focus all our energy on those two countries when russia is currently led by a man who said he could destroy us in a half hour  and we have a presidential candidate who is in love with that man this is so frightening to many in the gop that some feel they re in the awkward position of having to rationalize trump s love affair with vladimir putin while quietly quaking in their boots  but others aren t fooled  like lindsey graham  other than destroying every instrument of democracy in his own country  having opposition people killed  dismembering neighbors through military force and being the benefactor of the butcher of damascus  he s a good guy  and the ghostwriter of trump s best selling art of the deal  tony schwartz  to undecided voters  trump wants to be putin  a despot   dictator  the world may not recover  save your children and grandchildren  yeah  putin s a great guy  so s trump  two peas in a pod  anybody who thinks we ll be safe with trump as president has their head buried up their buried up an ass full of sand featured image by dennis grombkowski getty images
