this is disgraceful and totally un american ronald reagan is rolling in his grave after a new poll revealed that republicans now see russia as our friend and admire vladimir putin far more than we did just two years ago a yougov economist poll released in december shows that putin s favorability has soared by  points among republicans  likely bolstered by the fact that russia helped donald trump win the election in november  clearly  republicans can be bought by murderous dictators as long as that dictator helps their party seize power trump specifically asked the russians to continue meddling in our political process and they did  trump has since stacked his cabinet with pro russia nominees and republicans have joined trump in defending russia despite a cia assessment concluding that russia did interfere in our election to help trump putin s net favorability among republicans now stands at   percent  up significantly from the   in   democrats  meanwhile  still despise putin um  wow net favorability of putin democrats july     dec     july     dec     yougov economist   will jordan   williamjordann  december    is republicans and democrats on vladimir putin since july   pic twitter com   will jordan   williamjordann  december    addition  republicans now see russia as a friend  again  apparently it is easy to draw republicans to the dark side  if russia had rigged our political process decades ago  that whole cold war thing would not have happened because russia would have had a puppet in the white house long before now it s not just putin here are perceptions about whether russia is a friend to the us or not  since   pic twitter com   will jordan   williamjordann  december    a net rating  the  friendly  rating for russia among republicans has swung from low of   in  to   today  https   t co   will jordan   williamjordann  december    s also a  point swing from two years ago it is absolutely deplorable to watch the republicans party bend over for putin just because russia helped their party win the election  if anything  republicans should be outraged and concerned trump will now be a puppet who owes russia favors  trump has since chosen a close friend of putin s as secretary of state and wants to end sanctions against russia  trump also expressed his intention to possibly abandon nato  which would open the door for russia to be more aggressive toward europe with no united states to challenge them the only reason why republicans are fawning over russia and putin is because they would not have won the white house without their assistance  this is a sad time for our country  the political party that once saw russia as our mortal enemy is now happy to be in putin s pocket  and that means we can expect more russian meddling in  unless the gop and trump face consequences featured image of donald trump by joe raedle getty  image of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot getty
