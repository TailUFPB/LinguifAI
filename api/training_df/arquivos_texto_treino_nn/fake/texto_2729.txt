trump isn t smart  he s a complete buffoon with a temper that s so short it s virtually nonexistent  but he likes to pretend he s the president of the united states  which means he thinks he s this country s sole leader  as such  he believes he can do and say as he wishes  even if it means alienating people  countries and groups that we need during a phone call to australian prime minister malcolm turnbull  trump threw a livid fit over an agreement we reached with them under obama to accept   refugees  trump accused australia of planning to send us  the next boston bomber   and promptly hung up  then  instead of staying quiet or actually  gasp  doing some basic homework and admitting he made a mistake with that  he took to twitter to double down do you believe it  the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia  why  i will study this dumb deal   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    of all    is not  thousands   secondly  refugees are not illegal immigrants and trump s calling them such is dangerous  third  how can they be  illegal immigrants  if they aren t even here yet  and have permission  via a diplomatic pledge and paperwork  to come here  and fourth  he s not the deal maker he thinks he is if he believes being a jackass to turnbull is the way to handle this fortunately  here s twitter  coming to the rescue
