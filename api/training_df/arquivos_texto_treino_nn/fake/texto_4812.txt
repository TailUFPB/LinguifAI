brace yourself for this  folks  trump foreign policy adviser michele bachmann has just returned from jesusland  that little imaginary country that exists in her head where her brain should be  with some dire news  apparently  supreme overlord god jergenson  we assume that s his last name anyway  is giving the people of the united states a choice between life and death this election  trump or clinton   and if we don t choose  life   well  there just won t be anymore elections  well  i don t want to be melodramatic but i do want to be truthful   bachmann says melodramatically in an interview with the christian broadcasting network   i believe without a shadow of a doubt this is the last election  this is it  this is the last election  and the reason why i say that david is because it s a math problem   bachmann tells interviewer david brody   it s a math problem of demographics and a changing united states  if you look at the numbers of people who vote and who lives in the country and who barack obama and hillary clinton want to bring in to the country  this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles  this is it  hillary clinton  i m not judging her spiritually or where she is at but we know where she s going to come down on supreme court justices  she s pro planned parenthood  she s for everything i m against  i think it s very clear  we ve got a day and night contrast   bachmann says and  of course  she s right  where clinton is a classy  intelligent  grounded  sane human being  bachmann is a vapid mess of a person who thinks the lion king was gay propaganda and the founding fathers ended slavery  yes  seriously  bachmann says she knows trump can be a bit  crude  but urges people to  get over it  because hillary clinton is pure evil  this isn t even close between what donald trump stands for and espouses and what hillary clinton stands for and espouses  people look at trump and he can be coarse and a little crude and all the rest and i say   get over it   get over it because what he is going to do is uphold religious liberty and advance the constitutional republic that our founders gave us  according to bachmann  clinton  has said herself that she is going to grant wholesale amnesty to people from the third world who are here in the united states   she says that the projected  million undocumented immigrants in the united states is a  fake number   then provided her own hipper  cooler fake number she got from donald trump    about thirty to forty million illegal aliens currently in the united states  what hillary clinton s ultimate goal is  is to secure her reelection   bachmann says   the very first thing she will do as president hillary clinton is this  she will have a wholesale amnesty so that republicans will never again have the chance at winning florida or texas  if we can t win florida or texas  it s game over   from there  clinton will  ensure  republicans never win the white house by changing   the demographics of the united states so that no republican will ever win again  but it s worse than that  a trump loss would so displease god that he d just kill us all anyway to prevent a clinton presidency  god says to every nation for all of time   i set before you life and death  what are you going to choose   if you look at the book of genesis  you don t even have to get beyond chapter  to see god gives us life  the first thing he gives mankind is life  what does man choose  death  we choose rebellion and death  you go from genesis all through the bible to the book of revelation  man stupidly makes the same decision over and over again by rejecting life and choosing death  what i m telling you is that s what we re looking at now in this country  i know all of this sounds scary  but choose  death  this november   unless  of course  you want to see the sort of  life  we would have under an insane racist who will likely throw us into nuclear war within his first  days watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
