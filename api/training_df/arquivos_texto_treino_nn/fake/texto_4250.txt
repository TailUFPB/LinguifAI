the humane society of the united states pretty much never weighs into politics  unless  of course  it s about an issue that directly affects animals  this is no normal election  though  and after a series of pictures in which donald trump s sons gleefully show their murdered animal  trophies   and after seeing trump s potential nominees  the animal rights group had to weigh in  calling trump a  threat to animals everywhere  the next president will have an enormous impact over animal protection in this country for the next four to eight years  and the stakes are high with policy decisions overseen by the u s  department of agriculture  u s  fish and wildlife service  national park service  bureau of land management  national institutes of health  and other executive agencies  when you consider the potential for advancing animal welfare reforms at the federal level  or rolling back the recent gains and rulemaking actions  there could not be a greater contrast among the white house hopefuls  one ticket has a clear  compelling record of support for animal protection  while the other has assembled a team of advisors and financial supporters tied in with trophy hunting  puppy mills  factory farming  horse slaughter  and other abusive industries  the names that trump s campaign has floated for engagement on interior and agriculture department issues are a  who s who  of zealous anti animal welfare activists the photos of trump s trophy hunting sons were bad enough  the pictures show the two men with their trophy kills  which include cape buffalo  waterbuck  a leopard and even an elephant tail  african elephants and leopards are nearly extinct  the group compared the two to walter palmer  the dentist who shot cecil the lion this might just be symbolic  but donald jr  has been floated as possible interior secretary the risk of having a globe trotting trophy hunter at or near the helm at interior  or having the ear of the president  should be a terrifying prospect for any animal advocate  the administration is responsible not only for policies involving hundreds of millions of acres of federal lands  but also wildlife law enforcement  international treaties on trade and conservation  and import policies for wild animal parts and trophies they also note several other potential cabinet members  including oil tycoon forrest lucas  who is anti animal welfare  for secretary of agriculture  trump has mentioned pork farmer bruce rastetter  who is known for building the very same pig gestation crates that the state of new jersey tried to ban and trump surrogate chris christie vetoed the bill several other possible candidates also worry the humane society  but they are very favorable toward hillary clinton while trump has advocates for trophy hunting  puppy mills  factory farming  and horse slaughter on his side  hillary clinton has a strong record of taking a stand against many of these issues  she published an animal welfare statement on her campaign website  noting that  he way our society treats animals is a reflection of our humanity   clinton highlights the humane issues she plans to tackle as president  as well as her strong record on animal protection in the u s  senate and as secretary of state  she pledges to crack down on abuses such as wildlife trafficking  puppy mills  and horse slaughter  and to support a federal anti cruelty statute and more humane treatment of farm animals it s not just who he advocates that makes trump so dangerous for animals  it s also what he advocates  and that is the near total elimination of regulations  one of trump s least favorite regulatory agencies is the food and drug administration  which he laughs at  because they regulate dog food  the strong implication is that trump doesn t care about any animals  not even pets  the humane society is right  he is a threat to animals everywhere  even the two legged kind featured image via win mcnamee getty images
