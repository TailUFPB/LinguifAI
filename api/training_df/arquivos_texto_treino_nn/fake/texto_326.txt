james clapper  the director of national intelligence under president barack obama  appeared on cnn s erin burnett out front on friday night  and he told burnett just what many americans have suspected since january  speaking about russian interference in the  presidential campaign  clapper told her that the intelligence community had met with donald trump prior to his inauguration  in that briefing  he and other intel chiefs discussed with trump a joint assessment by the cia  fbi  and nsa that concluded that the interference was significant enough to warrant concerns over the outcome of the election  our intelligence community assessment did  i think  serve to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory in the election  although clapper didn t say it in the interview  the unspoken implication is that this message may have prompted trump s ridiculous overreactions to his inaugural crowd size  the myth that millions of  illegals  voted in the election  and any number of other actions and statements that led to the creation of trump s laughable  commission on election integrity   which has  thus far  served only as a vehicle for promoting voter suppression clapper s cnn appearance was timely  it came just a short while after trump went back to his favorite outlet  twitter  to vent his frustrations for the millionth time the russia hoax continues  now it s ads on facebook  what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    for trump  the fact is that the facebook ads purchased by russia weren t even part of that discussion with clapper  those weren t discovered until recently  after facebook combed through their ad sales records and discovered hundreds of fake russian profiles buying pro trump and pro conservative ads on the social media platform during the campaign  that means that completely independent of any allegations about ad buying  the intelligence community had already concretely agreed that russia helped trump win the election even after the transition to trump s administration and cabinet  the investigation into russian interference produced the same responses from different intel chiefs  when senator mark warner  the ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee  asked trump s own cia head and his new director of national intelligence whether they believed that russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the hacks and leaks that led to the investigation  both mike pompeo and dan coats agreed clapper told burnett that trump s demeanor during the january briefing has been completely different than his behavior since he was inaugurated  calling the earlier trump  solicitous  courteous   even complimentary  when he sat down with the agencies trump is getting more than a little nervous now  and this interview with james clapper sheds light on his renewed efforts to brush aside the russia investigation watch featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
