despite repeatedly claiming that he will be tough on crime  donald trump s weekend escapades to mar a lago are literally forcing the secret service to do less crime fighting the secret service does not merely exist to protect presidents and their families  they perform other duties as well that keep america safe such as busting currency counterfeiters  searching for missing and exploited children  and cybercrimes but instead of doing that part of the job  the secret service is being forced to abandon those responsibilities in order to spend more time and money on presidential security  and it s all because trump refuses to stop going to his mar a lago resort in palm beach every single freaking weekend according to the washington post  the secret service asked for an additional   million for their budget to fund security for trump tower in new york city because melania trump refuses to move into the white house  the extra funding would also go towards the security requirements necessary for when trump goes to florida to play golf but the white house budget office denied the request  you know  because trump actually doesn t give a shit about fighting crime so the secret service is being forced to cut funding from their criminal investigation wing  which will likely lead to a rise in those criminal activities because the secret service won t be able to do their job effectively trump s vacations to mar a lago costs taxpayers   million every weekend and so far  trump has only stayed in washington one weekend since taking the oath of office  in fact  it was the weekend after taking the oath that trump chose not to go to palm beach speaking of palm beach  despite promising to create jobs  trump s frequent visits to mar a lago on the taxpayer s dime is taking a toll on local businesses there because all the extra security measures are causing businesses to lose money  local taxpayers have also had to spend money on extra security for trump  which has forced the palm beach city council to consider a measure that would slap a tax on trump to help reimburse the city and at the rate trump is going back and forth between washington and palm beach  he will likely force the secret service to blow their entire budget well before the next fiscal year commences  trump is on pace to take more vacation days in one year than president obama did in eight  and trump s vacation time will cost taxpayers even more so not only are taxpayers losing money  the american people are losing a crucial element of our ability to fight crime in this country  not only can counterfeit money flow to fund multiple criminal endeavors  it can hurt the economy by flooding it with too much currency and would hurt the reputation of the dollar  if other nations and businesses can t trust the authenticity of our money  the whole system could suffer greatly perhaps the secret service would be better off choosing to not protect trump so much  after all  he s the one making their job more difficult than it should be  and frankly  if trump wants more secret service protection he should have to pay for it himself if he continues to insist that he be a part time president featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
