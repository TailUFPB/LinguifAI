a vicious new law in arkansas proves that republicans are on the side of rapists two months ago  republicans fast tracked a brand new anti abortion bill through the legislature and governor asa hutchinson signed it last week arkansas act  bans the most common and safest abortion procedure available to women known as dilation and evacuation  which is used for abortions performed during the second trimester  that means arkansas republicans are openly defying the framework set up by the supreme court in roe v  wade which says states can t interfere with a woman s right to choose until the fetus becomes viable   percent viability rate is achieved at  to  weeks  but the new law would ban safe abortions after  weeks and creates a burden for women because it forces them to choose less safe options to end their pregnancies doctors who perform the abortion procedure would be charged with a felony that carries a    fine or six years in prison but the bill also has a terrifying clause that rapists are going to love the bill gives rapists the power to deny their victims an abortion if they sue the abortion provider according to the daily beast a clause in the arkansas law allows a woman s spouse  parent or guardian  or health care provider to sue an abortion provider for civil damages or injunctive relief that could stop the abortion  and because act  does not provide any exceptions for cases of rape or incest  the clause could allow the fetus s father to sue an abortion provider even in cases of spousal rape or incest some lawmakers  like democratic state senator will bond  had a problem with the bill because the way it is drafted seems to allow any family member of the pregnant woman to file a lawsuit to stop the abortion and could actually end up severely disabling women who are forced to choose a riskier abortion procedure  there is an injunctive relief section in the bill that  in my reading of it  would seem to allow litigation among family members  if one spouse sought injunctive relief to prevent a certain procedure  or possibly other family members have the possibility for injunctive relief  that was a concern of mine  there is an exception for women s health in the bill  but it required irreparable harm  permanent disability of a woman  the way it was drafted  i had concerns that the women s health exception is way too narrow  and there s no exception for rape and incest  the fact that rapists have a new tool to use to torture their victims is totally unacceptable and demonstrates that republicans are totally anti woman of course  these kinds of bills have been blocked in other states  so it s likely this one will be blocked from going into effect as well  but women cannot rely on the courts to protects their rights  they need to vote and kick republicans out of office if they truly want to guarantee that government will not try to dictate what decisions they make about their own bodies featured image via woman survival
