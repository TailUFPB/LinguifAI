there definitely seems to be a new sense of entitlement among donald trump supporters now that he won the electoral college count in the presidential election  they can t exactly say he won via popular support seeing as hillary clinton currently leads by over  million votes however  these trump supporting bullies are out there nonetheless  with seemingly a permission slip from the new bully in chief elect  to be as awful to others as they want to be  after all  trump was a bully to pretty much everyone and still won the election one of the most recent examples of this bullying behavior was caught on camera while boarding a plane  one trump supporter was outright being plane vile to anyone who voted for hillary clinton  even shouting  we got some hillary bitches on here   then proceeds to say  donald trump  he s y alls president  every god damn one of yas  if you don t like it  too bad  regardless of the bad grammar or the obvious observation that he may very well be intoxicated  this sort of entitled bully behavior has been seen all over the country what is even more startling  is that people seem to be allowing it and staying silent as he rants we have to speak up or people like this will continue to think it s okay  this man should ve been tossed from the plane  but he wasn t  this isn t okay watch this trump supporter be exactly like the bully we also know his leader to be  the epitome of post election white privilege  he wasn t put off the plane in spite of multiple requests  pic twitter com   shaun king   shaunking  november    image via video screen capture
