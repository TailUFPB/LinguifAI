donald trump s russia problem just won t go away  in fact  the investigation is steadily expanding  and with the revelation that trump himself is now personally under criminal investigation  trump s number two man  mike pence  has hired his own lawyer  there are also reports that one of trump s own lawyers  michael cohen  has lawyered up as well  of course  there was also the revelation that trump s own son in law and top adviser  jared kushner  is also under federal investigation by special counsel robert mueller for potential financial crimes  now  it seems that trump is more nervous than ever  and seems to believe that his own long time civil litigation lawyer  marc kasowitcz  is no longer enough  trump has now retained john dowd  a high profile attorney who has represented the likes of senator john mccain  r az  this addition is a major development  dowd is experienced with keeping corrupt politicians out of jail  he is  years old and the ultimate washington insider  this means that trump s legal troubles are mounting  and the white house knows it  dowd joins an already beefy team  in addition to dowd and kasowitz  trump has also retained mark bowe and jay sekulow now  this is a risky move for someone as distinguished as john dowd  trump s intemperate twitter rants and revealing public statements would make him an almost impossible to manage client  his own incriminating statements  along with his penchant for refusing to pay his bills have already made many high powered washington law firms to turn down the opportunity to represent the man baby  president   granted  the guy is getting up in age and already has a long career behind him  perhaps he is not afraid of taking what is sure to be a losing case due to trump s own foolish words and actions either way  this russia investigation is no longer just smoke  there s fire there as well  and the people around trump and in the white house know it  it would be a prudent decision for every single person working in the west wing to lawyer up stat  unless they want to spend the rest of their miserable lives in federal prison   which is likely where many   if not all   of them belong featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
