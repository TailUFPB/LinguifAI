if there is anything that really gets under donald trump s skin  it is people questioning his authority and his legitimacy as president  this is the reason that he keeps making up claims of fake voter fraud whenever anyone points out the fact that hillary clinton won the popular vote by close to three million  it is also why he took such exception to saturday night live portraying his chief strategist  former breitbart news head stephen k  bannon  as the real president well  that narrative has been taken to a whole other level by  resistance organizers  they  like anyone sane  realizes that bannon has an unusual amount of power in the trump white house  that is troubling  considering that bannon is a white supremacist who also has said he wants to  destroy the state   therefore  the answer to this is to make sure that people understand that it is quite possibly bannon  rather than trump  calling the real shots up there in washington the new campaign has put signs in major cities around the nation that read   impeach president bannon  spotted in dc this morning   these are so newly posted the wheat paste is still wet  pic twitter com pwtubjvfmu  garance franke ruta   thegarance  february    to the people who organized the effort  their reasoning for doing so is the following  no one voted for steve bannon  yet he is the de facto  president of the united states  this could very well be true  after all  trump has named bannon to the national security council  all the while demoting the head of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence  further  it is pretty clear to anyone watching that bannon has quite a bit of influence over trump   so much so that time magazine actually put bannon on the cover instead of trump  and called him  the great manipulator  as for the goals of this campaign  well  there are a few possibilities  according to those behind it  maybe we ll encourage an angry tweet or two  maybe even get trump to say his two favorite words to bannon   you re fired   we ll tune in  it ll be great for ratings  hopefully  trump s ego takes over on this one  and bannon is out the door sooner rather than later  that would definitely be a win for  theresistance featured image via drew angerer getty images
