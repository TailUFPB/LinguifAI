it s easy to think the whole brouhaha with michael flynn was over the moment he was forced from his post as trump s national security adviser  but it s not  the house oversight and government reform committee has been investigating flynn and his connections with russia  and they just found something incredibly damning rt  a state run news network in russia  paid flynn to attend a gala in moscow with russian president vladimir putin  rep  elijah cummings  the ranking democrat on the house oversight committee  released records that include checks  invoices and emails showing that rt literally paid flynn nearly    to attend the function and not too long afterward  he was busy advising trump and his campaign in a voluntary capacity  not only was he paid a speaking fee at the gala  but his company  leading authorities  received    from that gala  all told  flynn was paid    to appear with putin and do work for two russian firms  all while he was acting in an advisory capacity with donald trump some of that involved a russian company  kaspersky lab  which is a subsidiary of a russian company that specializes in  uncovering western government spyware   in other words  evidence shows that he worked for a company that works against not just the u s   but also against all our nato allies  kaspersky lab claims it has no ties to any government  but  is proud to collaborate with the authorities of many countries   in fighting against cybercrimes cybercrimes like hacking the dnc to help tilt our election to trump s favor  maybe  if this isn t corruption by a foreign power  then what is  democrats on the house oversight committee now want an additional investigation into these payments because the come from companies based in russia we already know flynn was acting as a foreign agent in turkey while working for trump s campaign  and that he failed to disclose that until just recently  but now we see he was working with russia  too  it s high time we learned just how deep this goes  it s not likely that flynn was a solo actor here  the entire trump administration must be thoroughly investigated   we can t allow flynn to serve as their scapegoat featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
