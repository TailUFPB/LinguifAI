donald trump insists that he doesn t have to divest or sell his business empire to be president  but george takei strongly disagrees throughout the campaign and ever since the election  trump has been repeatedly criticized for desperately trying to hold on to his company you see  past presidents have sought to avoid conflicts of interest by selling their businesses or putting them in a blind trust so that whatever decisions they make as president are for the good of the country instead of being for the profit of their business but trump not only wants to keep his business in the family while serving as president  he has openly used his status as president elect to do business  for instance  trump met with the leader of japan and invited his daughter ivanka to sit in as newsweek pointed out in a damning report on trump s conflicts of interest  at the same time  officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with sanei international  the largest shareholder of sanei s parent company is the development bank of japan  which is wholly owned by the japanese government trump s company is also seeking to build hotels in taiwan at the same time trump broke decades of policy to make a phone call to the taiwanese president the trump organization is also building projects in the philippines  which is why trump is getting cozy with rodrigo duterte despite the fact that he is committing human rights atrocities against the filipino people the list goes on  but it s clear just from these few examples that trump is going to put his business interests ahead of the best interests of the country thus far  republicans have ignored trump s major conflicts of interest and seem to have no problem with trump using the presidency for personal gain  senate democrats are proposing a bill that would force trump to divest  but the gop will almost certainly block it  of course  if president obama had been the owner of a business upon winning in   republicans would have initiated round after round of investigations  they would have turned it into a huge scandal we know this because republicans did exactly that to another beloved democratic president  george takei knows it  too  so he called out republican hypocrisy by posting about it on twitter remember when jimmy carter sold his peanut farm to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest  and the gop investigated for  mos anyway   george takei   georgetakei  december     jimmy carter built that peanut business from scratch and it meant a lot to him but he parted with it anyway to guarantee that there would not be a conflict of interest during his presidency what happened next was disgraceful as republicans still brought in a special prosecutor and persecuted carter for six months in a desperate effort to find a scandal  they found nothing so this is how republicans treat democrats versus how they are treating trump now  and trump s business has done many shady things over the years that would likely get trump impeached if a special prosecutor were to be brought in to investigate  but republicans won t do that because they are dirty hypocrites who think the law and precedent don t apply to them donald trump must be forced to divest or sell his business no matter what excuse or promise he makes  the presidency is too sacred and too important to risk tainted with conflicts of interest that are sure to become huge scandals over the next four years  hell  trump isn t even president yet and he is already demonstrating that he intends to use the office to pursue business deals for his company even it doing so violates or destroys american foreign policy or puts our national security in jeopardy as takei later wrote the problem with conflict of interest isn t that trump might make more money  it s that his decisions actually might be guided by that goal   george takei   georgetakei  december    republicans allow trump to do this  they can no longer whine if a democrat does the same thing  in fact  republicans should not be allowed to pursue investigations against any democrat ever again if they let trump flout our constitution and decades of precedent  the presidency is not a corporate office created to make personal business deals  it s the office of the american people created to do what is in the best interests of our nation as a whole  by not selling or divesting  trump is demonstrating that he only cares about himself featured image via slaven vlasic getty images
