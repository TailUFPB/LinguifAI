everyone had their suspicions as to the timing of fbi director james comey s letter regarding hillary clinton s email server that he later rescinded in relation to the election  in addition  many were fairly certain that russia had direct involvement in our election  and now  as it turns out  both things definitely did affect the election  and the first person who will agree with that definitely seems to be hillary clinton herself breaking her silence while speaking to donors about what seemed to directly impact the election away from her winning  clinton didn t hold back and called out russian president vladimir putin by name according to nbc news  hillary clinton told donors on thursday night that her loss was partly due to u s  election hacks directed by russian president vladimir putin and fbi director james comey s election eve letter to congress related to her use of a private email server  putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election   clinton is heard saying in an audio recording first obtained by the new york times and verified as authentic by several sources present at the event to nbc news  clinton also said  he is determined not only to score a point against me  which he did  but also to undermine our democracy  and as it turns out  putin was directly involved with the hacks and how the information gained was to be used  in fact  nbc news reported  putin s objectives were multifaceted  a high level intelligence source told nbc news  what began as a  vendetta  against hillary clinton morphed into an effort to show corruption in american politics and to  split off key american allies by creating the image that  couldn t depend on the u s  to be a credible global leader anymore   the official said  putin very clearly wanted donald trump to win and used information gained to release only what he wanted to skilfully get what he wanted out the the u s  election and now that all of this has been revealed  president obama is vowing retaliation against russia  saying  i think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing some of it may be explicit and publicized  some of it may not be  and while donald trump and his campaign are clearly pleased with the election results and want to peacefully continue a transition while thinking all accusations against russia are just excuses for a clinton loss  evidence proves quite to the contrary hopefully  we will get to the bottom of this and justice will prevail featured photo by justin sullivan getty images
