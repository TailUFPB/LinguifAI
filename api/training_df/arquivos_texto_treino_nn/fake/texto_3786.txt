for a crash course in why reality television star donald trump is unfit to be the next president of the united states  one only needs to look through his twitter history  unfortunately  the less intelligent americans in our country  aka conservatives  have a very different take on the immature attacks that trump spews on a daily basis with his tiny orange fingers  and their reasoning is painful to listen to cnn host chris cuomo had his brain melted by rep  chris collins  r ny  on  new day  on wednesday morning when he dared to ask collins what he thought about trump s recent onslaught of tweets against the new york times  who trump has been blasting for making him look bad twittercuomo asked if this was presidential behavior  do you think that this is a healthy way for him to govern going forward  collins  who was the first member of congress to give trump his endorsement  gave an answer that took cuomo by complete surprise when he shrugged trump s behavior off and said it was just the president elect s way of  relaxing  well  i can tell you this  the pressure that has got to be on president elect trump is immense  the enormity of the job ahead of him  and so i would have to say if this is his way of relaxing  god bless him  cuomo fired back   relaxing    in complete disbelief  collins said  absolutely  if this is what he has some fun with and he finds this relaxing  and his entertainment  let him go with it  uh  isn t a president supposed to be more concerned with running a country than  entertainment   apparently not  according to collins  i would not second guess anything he s doing that he would use to make himself call it unwinding  relaxing  and i think that s part of it  it s donald trump being donald trump  you don t want this stuff all bottled up  so frankly i don t have a problem with this in the least  i think america actually wants to continue to see a real human being in the white house  and i put this in to the you know  this is his way of unwinding  and taking some stress off  so i think it s a good thing  absolutely terrifying  trump has already gone back on his promise that he would be  very restrained  on twitter now that he s going to be president  making it clear that he lacks self control  and as expected  republicans don t have the backbone to stand up to him for the good of the country you can watch collins shock cuomo with his stupidity below featured image via screenshot
