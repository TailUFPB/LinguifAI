donald trump spent his week on twitter blasting mika brzezinski and joe scarborough  hosts of msnbc s morning joe  rather than focus on something important  like the fact that his party is trying to kick millions of people off of their health care and leave them to die  he would rather spout off about the host of a cable news show  bleeding badly from a facelift  i heard poorly rated  morningjoe speaks badly of me  don t watch anymore   then how come low i q  crazy mika  along with psycho joe  came    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    to mar a lago  nights in a row around new year s eve  and insisted on joining me  she was bleeding badly from a face lift  i said no   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    continued his attack  tweeting about morning joe being  low rated   fake news   refusing to let it drop  he attacked again on saturday  writing that scarborough is  crazy  and brzezinski is as  dumb as a rock  watched low rated  morningjoe for first time in long time  fake news  he called me to stop a national enquirer article  i said no  bad show  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    joe scarborough and dumb as a rock mika are not bad people  but their low rated show is dominated by their nbc bosses  too bad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    msnbc producer jesse rodriguez decided to set the record straight and remind trump that morning joes is currently experiencing record high ratings  apparently  our tweeter in chief missed the memo that the show had msnbc s highest rating ever in the time period in the key demographic last quarter just a reminder about the  morningjoe ratings https   t co   jesse rodriguez   jesserodriguez  july    to our viewers   morning joe  had msnbc s highest rating ever in the time period in the key demographic last quarter  pic twitter com   jesse rodriguez   jesserodriguez  june     trump s own ratings have been sinking lower by the day  maybe instead of attacking women on twitter because he thinks are mean to him on tv  he should focus on doing his job and maybe try to not embarrass himself  the office of the presidency  and our entire country on a daily basis  just a thought featured image via getty olivier douliery
