when high profile women like sarah palin stay silent  it enables sexual predators and puts more women at risk of being sexually harassed and assaulted as fox news continues to reel in the aftermath of bill o reilly s sexual harassment scandal just a year after the network dealt with roger ailes  own sexual harassment scandal  former contributors and anchors have been coming forward to tell their stories of how they were treated by their male colleagues there but not sarah palin  palin would rather pretend that nothing happened to her and that her male colleagues were totally professional and considerate during an interview with jake tapper on cnn  palin danced around the question of whether she experienced sexual harassment at the network and made it sound like her decision to leave fox news was more about looking for different opportunities tapper   it sounds like you experienced something  palin   i just   you know  it was just time to part ways and  and  you know  get   get out there in  i guess  a more diverse arena to express views  in fact  palin had far stronger words for the victims who were repeatedly sexually harassed at fox news than she did for the perpetrators  if a woman believes that she is being intimidated and harassed  she needs to stand up and do something about it and not stick around for a paycheck for years and years and years  and then after the fact complain about what she went through  sarah palin collected a paycheck for five years     from fox news as a contributor and analyst the sexual harassment was there from the start in   fox news sunday host chris wallace remarked that  one can only hope  when asked if palin would be sitting in his lap during an upcoming interview  seriously in   roger ailes openly admitted that he only hired palin  because she was hot and got ratings  tucker carlson  who has been with fox news since  and was just recently promoted to take bill o reilly s place  posted an incredibly sexist tweet about palin in  that he was forced to delete  palin s popularity falling in iowa  but maintains lead to become supreme commander in milfistan   carlson wrote in other words  things haven t changed much at all at fox news  the network merely fired an old sexual predator and replaced him with a younger one if palin faced this much sexual harassment at the beginning it stands to reason that she faced it constantly throughout her time at the network  and she drew a paycheck for years without doing something about it and she continues to do nothing about it  she is protecting fox news by staying silent and that puts women who still work there at risk palin then went on to shame other women who haven t spoken up and once again demonstrated that she is a hypocrite  as a strong woman  i say we should feel more empowered than that and take a stand and get out of the place and blow the whistle on the perpetrator doing the bad stuff so that the culture will change  but palin herself refused to speak up and  blow the whistle  on the men who sexually harassed her at fox news  and she just got done shaming the women who have come forward to actually blow the whistle this is why sarah palin has zero credibility and why she is not a good role model for women featured image  screenshot
