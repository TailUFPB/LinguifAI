donald trump is still using his twitter account to push big  ridiculous lies about his troubled personal foundation  the donald j  trump foundation  despite his success in the presidential election  it seems trump just can t let go of the issue since it s still generating negative headlines for him in a tweet trump claimed that    of money  donated to the foundation  goes to wonderful charities   but as the huffington post reports  that is a total lie about how the foundation has operated over the years of its existence the donald j  trump foundation  established in   admitted to the internal revenue service just last year that it engaged in  self dealing   a prohibited practice in which a nonprofit leader uses an organization s money to benefit his or her own interests according to a washington post report earlier this month  the foundation s  tax filings confirmed it had transferred income or assets to a  disqualified person  that year  in this case  a  disqualified person  could be trump himself or a member of his family or business  and had engaged in similar practices in previous years while the media fixated on the  optics  and right wing innuendo about the clinton foundation  much of that smear financed by the head of breitbart by the way   trump s foundation escaped much of the same scrutiny despite its admittedly illegal behavior additionally  the trump foundation donated money to a political group associated with florida attorney general pam bondi  who dropped a probe of trump university at the same time  the irs fined the foundation over that behavior he also used the foundation as a slush fund to settle multiple lawsuits that had been personally filed against him  instead of using his own bank accounts to do so  this behavior has continued to cast suspicion on trump s claim that he is a billionaire  and his refusal to release his taxes hasn t helped alleviate those thoughts featured image via flickr
