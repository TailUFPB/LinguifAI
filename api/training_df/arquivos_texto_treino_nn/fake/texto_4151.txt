trump campaign manager kellyanne conway ran into a buzzsaw named wolf blitzer on monday and she was absolutely shredded with facts the cnn host grilled conway for being a hypocrite when it comes to women who are accusing republican nominee donald trump of sexual assault versus the women who accused bill clinton of sexual assault twenty years ago  why do you believe that voters should believe bill clinton s accusers  there are several of them  but not donald trump s accusers   blitzer asked during the situation room after pointing out a tweet by conway saying that she agrees with hillary clinton that  every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard  conway responded by basically walking back her tweet and then started ranting about evidence and that belief should only apply if the women take trump to court  of course  the statute of limitations pretty much prevents any meaningful judgment from coming down  meanwhile  bill clinton s accusers did not file their own claims in court until after they went public in the media  juanita broaddrick  who accused bill clinton of raping her  even filed a sworn affidavit claiming that the rape allegations were not true  thus contradicting her own retraction later on conway also tried to change the subject  but wolf didn t let her off the hook  and that led to conway whining about how little air time bill clinton s accusers supposedly received at the time they made their accusations  these woman got nearly no air time compared to the air time that was given on cnn and other places  wolf  to the accusers of donald trump   she complained   it s simply unfair and unbalanced  it s also a complete fabrication  you see  wolf blitzer was a senior white house correspondent at the time so he remembers the media circus surrounding the accusations against clinton and he brutally reminded conway of that fact and the fact that she should know better since she was there as well  let me just point out  i was cnn s senior white house correspondent in       when these women  including of course monica lewinsky  got tons and tons and tons of air time  you remember those days  i remember those days  we all remember those days  we went through all of those cases  these women who have come forward  we gave them a lot of reporting time  when blitzer continued by asking conway if she would encourage trump s supporters to go to court  she quickly denied doing that  you know  because trump would be forced to go to court as well conway proceeded to argue that hillary s conduct toward the women is relevant but then turned around and cheered on melania trump for calling her husband s accusers liars and accusing them of  fabricating  these allegations for  financial and political reasons  in other words  conway is okay with melania trump believing her husband and treating these women like moneygrubbers and liars  but she thinks hillary clinton is evil for doing the same thing back in the  that s some professional hypocrisy conway is practicing here s the video the bottom line here is that bill clinton is not running for president  donald trump is hillary clinton was first lady twenty years ago  and she acted as any wife would in defense of her husband  but again  hillary clinton has never been accused of sexual assault  trump is being accused of sexual assault  but trump and his team are pretending that hillary clinton s conduct toward her husband s accusers is worse than trump s conduct toward women and that is a false equivalency that should be blown to smithereens the same way wolf blitzer torpedoed kellyanne conway s whining about equal air time featured image  screenshot
