defending donald trump is no easy task  but even his most prominent campaign members are struggling to make sense of his behavior and comments when msnbc s morning joe had campaign manager kellyanne conway on board to talk ahead of the monday night debate between trump and democratic candidate hillary clinton  trump s righthand woman couldn t have been any more defensive and avoidant  in all honesty  she failed miserably to make her candidate look good  and choked under the pressure bloomberg politics host mark halperin  who was also a guest on morning joe with conway  asked the trump campaign manager about trump falsely accusing the debate moderator  nbc s lester holt  of being a democrat  he asked  he said lester holt was a democrat  lester holt is a republican  how could he say such a thing that just black and white factually incorrect  it was a fair question  and conway wasn t ready for it  her response was basically that trump was not a liar  he just spoke without knowing the truth  conway responded  i don t know that he knew what lester holt s voter registration is  halperin wasn t letting it go  he pressed conway  repeating back to her what she d just said  without knowing then  he asserted he was a democrat  conway then tried to use one of her boss  favorite interview tactics   dancing around questions  she fired back  first of all  if you tell me the media are not overly populated with democrats  that s false  at this point  halperin is getting frustrated and tries to keep conway focused  he points out just exactly what was wrong in trump s comments about holt  i m asking about a very specific thing  he made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong  and it s a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis  that are wrong  again  instead of responding  conway began talking about the backlash nbc s matt lauer received after being  too nice  to trump  it then becomes obvious that morning joe s mika bzrezinki is also losing her patience  when she says   this is a filibuster  while conway rants on  halperin once again tries to bring the conversation back  you re not answering what i asked you  i m asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a democrat  which is factually incorrect  how can he do that  he shouldn t have asserted  he didn t say   i don t know what he is  but i think he s biased   he said he s a democrat  conway left this topic again to attack hillary clinton and the media  and brzezinski had to refocus her by saying  i don t understand what that has to do with mark s question  we were asking why he lied about lester holt  conway finally says   i don t think he lied  and brzezinski corrected her  um  i think he did   conway then gave this moronic reply  mika  a lie would mean he knew the man s party registration  co host joe scarborough had to cut the conversation short  but not before an exasperated halperin could ask  so as president  would he say things that are false without knowing the truth  you can watch the interview below   kellyannepolls  trump  didn t lie  about lester holt   a lie would mean that he knew the man s party registration  https   t co dzwtcwpoim  morning joe   morningjoe  september    image is a screenshot
