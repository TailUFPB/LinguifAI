for the entirety of donald trump s presidential campaign  there was a massive amount of suspicion surrounding the reality television star s relationship with russian president vladimir putin  it turns out that just two days after trump has gotten elected to be the next president of the united states  most of our instincts were correct on thursday  russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov confirmed that  there were contacts  between the trump campaign the russian embassy staff throughout this election  he said  obviously  we know most of the people from his entourage  those people have always been in the limelight in the united states and have occupied high ranking positions  i cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with russian representatives  this news comes after we d already seen various instances where trump embraced and praised putin during his campaign  giving the impression that these two might actually be best friends  trump had also said he would improve america s relations with russia  and told nato allies  they ll need to pay tribute to the united states if they want to continue to have protection against possible russian aggression  trump s relationship with russia concerned intelligence and foreign policy experts alike   and it should concern all of us as well  trump has lied about his relationship with russia   much like he has lied about everything else in his presidential campaign  trump repeatedly told americans that he had not been interacting with the kremlin even in the face of evidence that he was praising putin  once again  ryabkov contradicted trump s previous denial when he said  we have just begun to consider ways of building dialogue with the future donald trump administration and channels we will be using for those purposes  it s also useful to point out that trump s former campaign chairman paul manafort resigned from the campaign after the new york times reported that ledgers discovered in ukraine found that millions of dollars had been earmarked for trump from the pro russian political party of former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych  if that isn t shady  i don t know what is now that the election is over  trump s lies are being exposed one by one  his followers are going to be devastated when they find out who they really elected featured image via adam berry and mark wilson   getty images
