to be a republican these days  one apparently needs to kiss russian president vladimir putin s ass as well as donald trump s on wednesday  gop rep  dana rohrabacher defended putin s human rights record by pretending that russia has not committed any human rights violations under putin s reign  which is total bullshit russia s treatment of the lgbt community alone is enough to make the world cringe in horror  but for some reason republicans are big fans of what russia is doing russia even committed espionage against our country by hacking into our election system and the dnc  but again  republicans seem to think this is just fine and not a big deal at all russia has also made aggressive military moves toward europe and seized the crimea from ukraine clearly  russia is no friend of ours not is russia a friend to our allies  but republicans are apparently enamored with putin  and that very much concerns joe scarborough  who hilariously took republicans to task on thursday morning for being infatuated with him  putin s a guy that assassinates journalists   scarborough pointed out on morning joe   he s the guy that shoots down   in front of the kremlin    political opponents  he s the guy that locks political opponents into jail for years  and then he ripped rohrabacher and the other republicans who love putin  i don t understand  he was always a conservative s conservative  are you a rino if you don t have pictures of putin on the wall shirtless  and go up and pray to him every night  rohrabacher s defense of putin is even scarier because donald trump is seriously considering him for secretary of state  which would likely make russia very happy because it means their hope for a puppet in the white house is becoming reality here s the video via twitter rep  rohrabacher asks  biannagolodryga  where do you come from    morningjoe panel flabbergasted by his remarks https   t co ktztatvbvk  morning joe   morningjoe  december    aligning themselves with russia  republicans are selling out the united states and abandoning american values  they should be ashamed of themselves for defending a man who is basically a dictator and they should be worried that donald trump admires putin  trump is already threatening journalists and satirical shows that criticize or make fun of him  he is already stacking his cabinet with generals  which sends the message that trump intends to rely on military power instead of diplomacy  and he has made it clear that he doesn t care about the rights of minorities  so trump is a putin in the making and republicans are lining up to kiss his ass by kissing putin s featured image  photo of donald trump by joe raedle getty images  photo of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot getty images
