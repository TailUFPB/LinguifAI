yesterday  the trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming   that former breitbart news chief steve bannon  who is now serving as trump s white house strategist  was being kicked off the national security council  while bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough  it turns out that s not how he really feels at all   and trump is in trouble according to a new report by the new york times  bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him  in fact  he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration  the times wrote  mr  bannon resisted the move  even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward  according to a white house official who  like others  insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations  mr  bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution  not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence  considering the fact that bannon did not show up at trump s press conference with jordan s king abdullah ii  some bitterness on bannon s part makes absolute sense bannon s position on the national security council has been controversial to begin with   it was a role he basically tricked trump into giving him  trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said   and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have  bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the national security council  but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the trump administration  unfortunately for trump  the white house is crumbling due to its own erratic  inexperienced staff featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
