there are big scandals   like trump s ties to russia  his repeated flaunting of conflict of interest violations  the nepotism   and then there are small ones  it s the small ones that are most disturbing because of how completely avoidable they are  the trump family just assumes you re too stupid to notice here s a particularly galling example jared kushner and ivanka trump released a family photo during passover  that  in and of itself  wouldn t be newsworthy except for the fact that it was a much needed break from the trump administration s repugnant treatment of the jewish community  kushner s jewish faith is extremely important to trump because his staff is rife with anti semitic thinkers trump s advisor steve bannon is a life long anti semite  whose own wife once said he refused to allow his daughters to attend a school with jewish kids  trump s press secretary sean spicer went on a nonsensical holocaust denial rant and only apologized hours later when the nation of israel openly said he needed to resign  trump s inner circle includes a guy who pledged an oath of loyalty to a pro fascist nazi allied group  in the middle of all of this  trump no showed on a passover seder dinner the white house hosted so a photograph of trump s daughter and son in law  two key members of his team  celebrating a jewish holiday might send a positive message to the country  however  like clockwork  even kushner s passover family photo quickly turned into something offensive it turns out that the photo was not  in fact  taken during his passover celebration  it is an old photo taken on what seems like the sunday after the inauguration  cnn s betsy klein noticed that fact when she realized the entire trump clan was wearing the same outfits they were photographed in during services at the national cathedral it appears the passover trump kushner family photo was taken the sunday after inauguration following services at the national cathedral  pic twitter com   betsy klein   betsyklein  april    so incredibly lazy  and unfortunately  that s the message they are sending featured image via twitter
