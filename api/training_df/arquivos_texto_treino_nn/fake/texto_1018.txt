eric trump has a new haircut and that haircut looks to be an outrageously offensive political statement moving away from the slicked back caricature of a wall street sleazeball  eric landed on a hairstyle that is  at this moment  mostly popular with a collection of up and coming neo nazis  as the washington post described it last year in a article titled  does this haircut make me look like a nazi    the style looks as follows it is short on the sides and long on the top  it is clean and tidy  with a military sheen  it s been popular among young people for several years  but now this haircut is making us ask ourselves  with seriousness that seems unthinkable in   hipster or nazi thanks to high profile nazis like richard spencer  the answer in  is  nazi the look  once popular with hipsters  is now decidedly one meant to symbolize an alt right ideology  in fact  the cut was co opted by nazis because it had connections to hitler  the style was a modern take on one made popular by the hitler youth in nazi germany  you re probably familiar with it  photo by chip somodevilla getty images now  it s obvious that not everyone with that particular haircut is associated with white supremacy  it s a haircut  but within white supremacy circles  the haircut is used to signal to other members that the wearer is part of the  team   in the same way a particular piece of clothing or hand gesture can identify you as a member of a group  the haircut has become the calling card of many prominent neo nazis here s spencer today still with the haircut along with his buddy wearing a slightly shorter variation of the same haircut nathan damigo  pic twitter com   richard   spencer   richardbspencer  june    now eric trump has it  too eric trump has a fascist haircut this cannot possibly be unintentional  pic twitter com   ali gharib   aligharib  june    it intentional  you d be forgiven for thinking so  eric and his brother donald jr  s behaviors since the election are only fueling the controversy  since their father s win  the family has been growing increasingly close with the alt right  a group that breeds neo nazis  donald jr  in particular  has globbed onto the group  retweeting articles and figureheads of the alt right movement  now eric is styling himself  physically  after them that s a lot of smoke and the question we need to ask ourselves now is   where s the fire  featured image via fox news
