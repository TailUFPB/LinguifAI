while we don t yet have the smoking gun that specifically says donald trump colluded with the russians to win the presidency  us officials now have the blueprint that the russians used to ensure that hillary clinton lost the election  and much of it will sound very familiar according to three current and four former us officials  a russian think tank controlled by vladimir putin used tried and true kgb tactics to make sure the election went exactly as they wanted they described two confidential documents from the think tank as providing the framework and rationale for what u s  intelligence agencies have concluded was an intensive effort by russia to interfere with the nov   election  u s  intelligence officials acquired the documents  which were prepared by the moscow based russian institute for strategic studies   after the election source  reutersthe first of the two documents was written in june  it didn t specifically mention donald trump  but it did outline a plan of using social media to sour voters toward any candidate who would share president obama s hardline stance toward russia the second document was from october  just a month before the election a second institute document  drafted in october and distributed in the same way  warned that democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton was likely to win the election  for that reason  it argued  it was better for russia to end its pro trump propaganda and instead intensify its messaging about voter fraud to undermine the u s  electoral system s legitimacy and damage clinton s reputation in an effort to undermine her presidency  the seven officials said in other words  all the anti hillary  anti dnc crap you heard during the election was straight out of putin s playbook  from the right  while trump was making accusations of voter fraud  you can be sure that his marching orders were coming from the kremlin the us officials are still remaining anonymous and american intelligence agencies are not commenting right now  but it s clear without russia s campaign of fake news and their attempt to undermine confidence in our electoral system was exactly what trump needed to win  the hacking wasn t part of the blueprint  but that was icing on the cake that came from another kremlin source featured image via drew angerer getty images
