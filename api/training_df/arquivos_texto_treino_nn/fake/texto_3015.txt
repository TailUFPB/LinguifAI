a member of the idaho house of representatives has been punished for making absolutely offensive accusations against every female lawmaker after rep  judy boyle was named the chair of the house agriculture committee  rep  heather scott remarked that boyle got the position because female lawmakers  spread their legs  to rise in rank  suggesting that women perform sexual favors to get leadership positions the incident occurred on december  in the house lounge and the remark was said loudly enough that several witnesses heard it scott then repeated the remark in the house chamber  not only upsetting female lawmakers  but male lawmakers as well  that s not true   rep  stephen hartgen  told the spokesman review in response to scott s claim   i ve been here almost  years  people get ahead here on the basis of merit  in my humble opinion  i ve never seen anything that would cause me to question that premise  rep  christy perry also blasted scott s behavior   it s important to me that the public understands that it s absolutely a false allegation   that it s not what happens in this building  it s extremely disrespectful  a number of the lady legislators are very upset about this  it s just entirely inappropriate  and the idaho legislature responded as a whole by stripping scott of all her committee assignments according to the statesman review as the house convened today  it moved to the  order  and the clerk read the list of committee assignments  listing all members of three committees   commerce  environment and state affairs  missing from all three was the name of rep  heather scott  r blanchard so maybe scott will think twice about what she wants to say next time she wants to react to her colleagues getting leadership roles  because spreading lies about how those positions were attained won t earn her any respect let s hope the voters in scott s district follow up by kicking her out of office in the next election featured image via electablog
