this is especially monumental since the wall street journal is a conservative newspaper donald trump is running out of supporters  and that includes his supporters within the media the straw that appears to have broken the camel s back is trump s accusation that president obama wiretapped him during the  election  of course  trump offered zero evidence to back up his claim then and he still hasn t provided any now but when fbi director james comey testified to congress under oath that trump s wiretapping accusation is complete bullshit  whatever shred of credibility trump had left imploded in an instant and now some right wing media outlets are backing away from him fox news began distancing themselves from trump after he threw them under the bus because sean spicer repeated a claim that president obama enlisted british intelligence to wiretap trump  which was basd o a conspiracy theory offered up by fox legal analyst andrew napolitano  who has since been refuted by the network and removed from all programming indefinitely and now the wall street journal appears to also be coming to their senses in a piece published on tuesday  the journal slammed trump for clinging to his lies about obama like a drunk person clinging to an empty bottle  the president clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle  rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims   the journal wrote   sean spicer who doesn t deserve this treatment was dispatched last week to repeat an assertion by a fox news commentator that perhaps the obama administration had subcontracted the wiretap to british intelligence  the journal then pointed out that trump did this all the time during the election and that he was able to get away with it at the time because his supporters did not care about the truth  as trump said during the campaign  he could have murdered someone in broad daylight on the street and his supporters would have still voted for him but trump is in the white house now  and that means his usual tired rhetoric and outrageous accusations horrify more people than it amuses because the american people as a whole are watching  and most of them despise trump and are terrified of what he will do next trump s credibility has imploded here and abroad as he has caused international incidents between us and some of our strongest allies  for instance  he insulted great britain and germany in the week alone and has also insulted mexico  australia  and china  how is trump going to convince other nations to support our foreign policies if he can t even get along with the nations we get along with the most  all of this continues the pattern from the campaign that mr  trump is his own worst political enemy   the journal continues   he survived his many false claims as a candidate because his core supporters treated it as mere hyperbole and his opponent was untrustworthy hillary clinton  but now he s president  and he needs support beyond the breitbart cheering section that will excuse anything  as he is learning with the health care bill  mr  trump needs partners in his own party to pass his agenda  he also needs friends abroad who are willing to trust him when he asks for support  not least in a crisis  the journal then concluded by calling attention to the fact that trump s poll numbers are in the toilet and that americans think he s a fraud  two months into his presidency  gallup has mr  trump s approval rating at    no doubt mr  trump considers that fake news  but if he doesn t show more respect for the truth most americans may conclude he s a fake president  frankly  it s too late for trump to rebuild his credibility  assuming he had any to begin with  he refuses to admit he was wrong and refuses to apologize even when he is proven wrong beyond a shadow of a doubt  he has lied so much in just the first  days of his presidency that even richard nixon would be embarrassed at this point  trump needs to resign or he should be impeached  america cannot afford to put up with his lies any longer  he is going to cause an international incident someday that could get us all killed because he couldn t keep his big mouth shut  he s a disgrace to the nation and out constitution and he must be stopped before he humiliates america worse than he has already featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
