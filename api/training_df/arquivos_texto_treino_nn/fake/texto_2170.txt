donald trump is starting another week in the white house with yet another attack on the media and the reporters that dare to cover his minions accurately on monday morning  trump took to twitter to warn the media to  be nice  to him and his dishonest team  likely inspired by a set of recent interviews in which his senior adviser  kellyanne conway  was blasted and taken to task for her ridiculous defense of trump s wiretapping claims  trump tweeted this little gem  it is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives  be nice  you will do much better  perhaps trump and his team might  do better  if they followed his advice  too   considering they ve made more enemies in the last few weeks than any administration in modern american history and this wasn t trump s only attack on the media  either  after watching morning joe hosts joe scarborough and mika brzezinski criticize his presidency for the last several weeks  trump finally made the decision to unfollow them on twitter  seriously  it s almost as if we have a teenager living in the white house if trump wants the media to cover him more favorably  then perhaps he might try actually doing his job well for once   or just doing his job  period  trump is the laziest  most incompetent potus america has ever had and his team is just as much as a failure if the coverage has been negative  it s because trump and his people actually suck  plain and simple  but instead of trying to improve and fix what is being criticized  trump would rather just go on twitter  bully the media  and cry about it featured image is a screenshot
