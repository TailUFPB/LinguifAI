trump s long record of tweet before think action has gotten him into some hot water in the past  but somehow a few weird pre potus tweets from november  through january  went largely unnoticed by the media during the five months before officially announcing his bid to run for the presidency  mr  trump shot off nine very strange tweets about running for president to two russian accounts these tweets which are currently still live   for now  are re tweets from   and  russiannavyblog  which accounts have since been deactivated  tagged in these tweets are human rights activist dr  rita pal  someone belonging to the handle    and  monkiekaty   russiannavyblog    i follow mr  trump in a crusade to get him to restore western civilization with a trump palin   ticket    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november         realdonaldtrump  be sure to set exceptional goals for your  resolutions  push yourself  you can do it  think big     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december         realdonaldtrump  be sure to set exceptional goals for your  resolutions  push yourself  you can do it  think big     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december        realdonaldtrump merry christmas my favorite billionaire   thanks   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december        realdonaldtrump and  mcuban and  warrenbuffett are my favorite billionaires and heroes    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december        realdonaldtrump oh how i respect you  a billionaire a family man and a tv star   thanks   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january       realdonaldtrump you are the best  billionare and the great teacher i love your inspiring books   thanks and good luck   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     russiannavyblog   realdonaldtrump  apprenticenbc an announcement mr trump will run for president and fix the obama ruined nation    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     russiannavyblog       dnorrell  greta  statedept  foxnews if there is anything america desperately needs  it s a trump run    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     monkiekaty   realdonaldtrump  russiannavyblog      dnorrell  greta  statedept  foxnews yes  yes  yes  trump for president   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    these tweets  trump is continually quoting someone named vladimir who was pretty obviously hinting that trump was about to run for president  these tweets are really weird  but even more strange is the fact that trump ripping world of pissed off citizens and media haven t picked up on these tweets until paste magazine reported about them on may  it s unlikely that   is vladimir putin  so what the hell is going on here  what would provoke trump to quote tweets calling him  the great teacher  in broken english at christmas time from some random unverified dude name vlad  well  this is trump we are talking about  but five  from the same unimportant nobody  maybe trump thought he was tweeting putin  or  maybe he wanted people to think putin was an admirer  he was up to something  even if he didn t realize he was making it public it seems like there have been many attempts in the past to erase the identities of trumps twitter friends  as a total of  twitter accounts that trump quoted have now disappeared  according to the  social puncher data tracker    is one of the forever lost accounts  fortunately for us  the second deleted twitter account  russiannavyblog  is a hilarious story  it seems an ex cia russian warship expert was trolling trump  but he still doesn t get the joke according to the paste article  an ex cia trump hater who went by the handle  russiannavyblog  was pissed at trump for calling mccain a  loser  for being captured in vietnam  when trump tried to defend himself by retweeting a picture of a vietnam vet  it turned out to be a hoax picture of jefferey macdonald  convicted murderer   amazingly  the person who originally tweeted that picture at trump was  russiannavyblog  with the original caption  my bad ass vietnam vet dad has balls too which is why he s voting trump  now if that s not hilarious enough  it seems in september  russiannavyblog trolled him again about trump s draft dodging  this navyblog trickster got trump to make fun of himself by such talented wit that tump mistook him for a supporter can you believe our idiot president took this tweet for an endorsement  we really do have a shit for brains president   russiannavyblog    i follow mr  trump in a crusade to get him to restore western civilization with a trump palin   ticket    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november
