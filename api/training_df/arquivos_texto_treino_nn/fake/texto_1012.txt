if you want to know just how bad donald trump s healthcare bill would be for this country  just ask ali chandra thanks to the affordable care act  chandra was able to get health insurance for her three year old son  who has a pre existing condition known as heterotaxy syndrome  a defect he was born with  heterotaxy syndrome literally means different arrangements   chandra explained to cnn on sunday  ethan was born with nine heart defects   nine congenital heart defects  he has two left lungs  five or so spleens of dubious function  and his liver and his gallbladder are down the middle of his body along with his heart  and then his stomach is on the right side instead of the left side  here s the video via youtube any human being  especially parents  should sympathize with chandra and what she and her family are going through but their situation would be much worse if the trumpcare bill passes congress and is signed into law  the protections guaranteed by the affordable care act  also known as obamacare  would vanish  and that could mean financial ruin for chandra and her family  and the loss of the care ethan needs you see  without insurance and the protections obamacare provides  chandra would have to pay    instead of just   for the medical care ethan has received  she even posted the bill on twitter and proceeded to explain what s at stake it seems fitting that  with the  trumpcare debate raging  i got this bill in the mail today from ethan s most recent open heart surgery  pic twitter com   ali     june    ll save you some math  without insurance we would owe    for  hours in the or   week in the cicu and  week on the cardiac floor  pic twitter com   ali     june    s had four of these surgeries  some more involved than others  the one before this had him in the cicu for three weeks   ali     june    far  ethan s care has gone over the   million mark  trump s healthcare bill would put lifetime caps on benefits  which means insurance companies would be able to deny coverage to ethan after reaching a fixed dollar amount  that means no healthcare for ethan unless his family goes broke to save him that s not only cruel  it s inhumane  especially since republicans claim to be  pro life  and ethan s medical care is not done yet we re hopeful that going forwards he ll need fewer and smaller surgeries  but this was not the last time they ll open his chest   ali     june    surgeon who created what we call ethan s  picasso heart   shaping  chambers from the  he was born with  is several states away   ali     june    also regularly see a local cardiologist  and electrophysiologist for his pacemaker  a pediatrician    immunology for his polysplenia   ali     june    takes  different prescription medications multiple times a day  all of this adds up  none of this would be possible without insurance   ali     june    i want you to go look at that number again  nearly a quarter million dollars for one surgery  reinstate lifetime caps and he s out   ali     june    blew past the million dollar mark long ago  i haven t even mentioned the er trips for sepsis workups every time his temp goes above    ali     june    the surprise admissions that sometimes follow those er visits when his body just isn t strong enough to fight a common virus at home   ali     june    trump and the republican party should be fighting to save this boy s life  not trying to kill him by taking away his healthcare furthermore  the astronomical price of ethan s healthcare is morally wrong considering what similar medical care costs in other developed nations  especially those with socialized systems  according to twitter users who commented on chandra s post  ethan s medical bills in nations such as sweden and england would be far less in sweden max   year for healthcare and another   year for meds  my breast cancer costed me about   incl hysterektomi op  annika dahlberg   lovemylotus  june    has huge problems but it does work  i have three  hand examples of how serious  prolonged  excellent care costs zero   richard ingham evans     june     in   a british couple unexpectedly had to have their baby delivered in an american hospital and end up being slapped with a    medical bill for something that would have been free at a national health service hospital or only    at a private facility in the uk so whether provided by the government or by private hospitals  healthcare is far less expensive in other nations and is provided to all that s what we need in america  instead  republicans are working on stripping healthcare away from millions of people but chandra is determined to fight for her son s life even if republicans wont a lifetime cap on benefits is the same as saying   sorry  you re not worth keeping alive anymore  you re just too expensive   ali     june    my son in the eyes and tell him that he s fought so hard to be here but sorry  you re just not worth it anymore  i dare you  pic twitter com igdqoounyb  ali
