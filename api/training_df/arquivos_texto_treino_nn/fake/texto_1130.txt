as attorney general  jeff sessions is the top law enforcement person in this country  he s also under investigation for colluding with the russians and for lying about it  let that sink in for just a moment there s a new report out on thursday  which  whether or not it is to be believed  is more bad news for sessions according to an article in the guardian  an american lobbyist for russian banking and oil interests claims that he had dinner with sessions  this is in direct conflict to what sessions claimed in front of the senate just this week sessions testified under oath on tuesday that he did not believe he had any contacts with lobbyists working for russian interests over the course of trump s campaign  but richard burt  a former ambassador to germany during the reagan administration  who has represented russian interests in washington  told the guardian that he could confirm previous media reports that stated he had contacts with sessions at the time  i did attend two dinners with groups of former republican foreign policy officials and senator sessions   burt said burt  who previously served on the advisory board of alfa capital partners  a private equity fund where russia s alfa bank was an investor and last year was lobbying on behalf of a pipeline company that is now controlled by gazprom  russia s state controlled energy conglomerate  first told politico in october that he had been invited to two dinners that were hosted by sessions last summer  at the height of the presidential campaign there are two ways this could play out for sessions  either burt is telling the truth  which is a possible smoking gun for perjury and obstruction  or he s lying  while republicans seem to be operating under the assumption that putin is holding them tight in his warm shirtless embrace  the truth is that putin doesn t give a crap about jeff sessions  donald trump or paul ryan russia s goal is to destabilize the united states using the best tools at their disposal  and right now  republicans are their biggest tools  that will change the moment the idiots prove they re no longer useful  burt s statement could  even if not true  prove that session s usefulness is done  russia could be ready to turn on the trump administration featured image via alex wong getty images
