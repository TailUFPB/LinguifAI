the right wing was quick to claim that clinton had experienced her own    moment  with her  basket full of deplorables  remark  but nothing could be further from the truth  clinton s remark turns out to be fairly accurate in fact  if anything clinton actually undersold just how deplorable trump s supporters actually are  during an appearance on cbs s face the nation on sunday  slate s chief political correspondent  jamelle bouie explained how the statement clinton made is supported by scientific evidence bouie looked at polling data that showed that more than half of republicans believe that president is a muslim or was born in another country  so  i m inclined to see it as strategy and not so much as a gaffe because when i heard the remark  my first question was  well  is this true  right  regardless of how it sounds  what it looks like  what is the case about donald trump supporters   bouie asks   and if you break down the numbers and you look at the realclearpolitics average  and it gives trump   percent of the registered voters  there re about    million people  compare that to polls show  to  percent of all republicans who say that barack obama either wasn t born in the united states or is a muslim  if one doesn t think that believe that birtherism is a bad enough belief to hold to earn the title of deplorable  then bouie has the data to show that roughly have of republicans are racist  you look at pilot data from the american national election study  and it shows upward of  percent of republicans saying things like blacks are more violent  blacks are lazier  muslims are more violent  muslims are lazier   bouie points out  among trump supporters in particular       percent of them agree with statements that political scientists categorize as being explicitly racist   bouie continues   so i m looking at clinton s statement  and half  which is about  million people again  doesn t really seem that out of bounds  forty to  percent of republicans  i would say looking at the full spectrum of data  agree with beliefs that we would categorize as explicitly prejudiced  so regardless of whether or not clinton needs to walk it back or not  i think she s being correct and accurate  conservatives are angry at clinton because they still cannot accept that pointing out bigotry and racism do not make the person bringing it up racist  clinton may have half heartedly backtracked on her statement  her sentiment was worded poorly even if it was accurate as bakari sellers pointed out on sunday while on cnn s state of the union  it doesn t matter how many of trump s supporters are bigoted racists or not because they are all supporting a candidate who is a bigot there is no left wing conspiracy out there to make republicans and trump supporters like deplorable  as polling indicates  they self identify as being racist bigots on their own you can watch the clip below featured image from video screenshot
