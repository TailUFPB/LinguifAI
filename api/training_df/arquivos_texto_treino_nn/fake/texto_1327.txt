donald trump has been on twitter for nearly  straight hours  clearly making up for lost time during his international trip when his advisers took away his phone  the tweets have been all over the place  a sign of the sort of unhinged mania that has consumed trump  angry messages directed at foreign leaders  defending russia  lashing out at critics  and   now   defending his son in law jared kushner from disturbing allegations that he had gone behind the backs of america s intelligence community to set up a secret  backchannel  with putin using russian spy equipment numerous media organizations including the washington post and the new york times have confirmed with reliable  high ranking sources that kushner did this  the evidence appears to be pretty damning  in fact  the white house seemed unable to defend kushner  for the first few days after news broke  the only response from trump supporters was that kushner should have been allowed to do this trump  as he is known to do  imploded that argument with a single tweet  posting a story from fox news  trump and the conservative channel are claiming that kushner is completely innocent  their  proof  is a single anonymous source that spoke only to fox during the meeting the russians broached the idea of using a secure line between the trump administration and russia  not kushner  a source familiar with the matter told fox news  that follows a recent report from the washington post alleging that kushner wanted to develop a secure  private line with russia the idea of a permanent back channel was never discussed  according to the source  instead  only a one off for a call about syria was raised in the conversation sounds legit this is a clear aboutface for trump  who has lashed out at anonymous sources whenever they leak things that make him look bad  suddenly  the mysterious anonymous source fox found  or invented  to clear kushner is completely trustworthy and trump is back to loving sources again smarter people have reason to be skeptical  it s been said that fox news under trump has operated as little else than his state media to push his agenda and defend him from attacks  this latest story seems incredibly suspect  after days of reporters from numerous outlets confirming and re confirming the original claims that kushner had  in fact  tried to set up a back channel with the russians  fox news magically found a  source  that disproves all of it  this flies directly in the face of trump s own national security advisor h r  mcmaster who  as part of his job to repeatedly humiliate himself in the name of trump  claimed that kushner was allowed to set up a back channel trump s attempt to save his son in law from a possible prison sentence actually may have made things worse  if the original defense of kushner was that he was right to set up this secret channel with the russians  kushner will face a choice if he is ever subpoenaed  lie about the backchannel to supporter his father in law s claim or admit he did talk to the russians and expose trump in yet another lie  whether he then gets charged with perjury hangs on his answer kushner might need to have an uncomfortable talk with his father in law  stop trying to help so i don t spend my life behind bars featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
