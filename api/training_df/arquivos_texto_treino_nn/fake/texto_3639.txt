it s expected that trump s critics would get on his case for lying about massive election voter fraud   there s simply no evidence of it  one might expect even the most supportive republicans to jump on him for that too  since they re all about upholding our democracy  and making claims of massive fraud in an election undermines public confidence in democracy  they re suspiciously silent  though  except for a few surprisingly  one of those few is one of trump s biggest fanboys  newt gingrich  he s spoken out against trump before  sure  but not very often  not very loudly  and not like this  the president of the united states can t randomly tweet without having somebody check it out  it makes you wonder about whatever else he s doing  it undermines much more than just a single tweet  so i d say that s probably the biggest single thing he s done wrong   no  we re not fans of newt gingrich  but we are fans of this because he s right  it does make you wonder what trump is doing that none of us can see  what he s cooking up behind the scenes  how he really sees the world  which has been a point of endless speculation  things of that nature nobody else put it this way  though  other critics were more conventional in their criticism of trump s tweet about election fraud  they re saying he needs evidence before making that claim  which is also true  lindsey graham  one of trump s most vocal and vicious critics despite also being a republican  blasted the specific nature of that tweet  you are now the president elect of the united states  if you really believe that millions of people voted illegally  you should have some proof  because your voice is not just an ordinary voice  however  others  including john mccain  just said they weren t going to weigh in on this  john cornyn of texas even said he s got bigger things to worry about  and from his point of view  that very well may be true  however  it s important to note that trump actively undermined the people s faith in democracy all through his campaign by crying that everything was rigged against him in doing that  he made us vulnerable to becoming a dictatorship  the one thing republicans seem to fear the most  that s what makes this important now that he s won  none of that none of the recount efforts  nor the popular vote should matter much to him  but there he is  on twitter  bitching up a dark  smelly cloud about election fraud to try and bolster his own political legitimacy when it all should be tiny potatoes to him now  that can be a characteristic of an autocrat gingrich believes trump shouldn t stop tweeting  but should put someone between him and his twitter account to avoid things like this  that s to be expected   no matter what trump does  gingrich is still totally and blindly enamored of him  and it s getting kinda creepy  actually   but to speak to the national press  and say openly and publicly that trump is actively working to destroy america s  ahem  confidence in him  is pretty huge for a fanboy featured image by drew angerer via getty images
