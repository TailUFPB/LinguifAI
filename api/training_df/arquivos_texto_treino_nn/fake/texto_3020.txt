georgia congressman john lewis is an american civil rights icon  he was nearly beaten to death at the infamous bloody sunday march in selma  alabama  and has since risen through the ranks of congressional prominence  on friday  he sat down with nbc s chuck todd for an interview  and when asked if he will be able to forge a relationship with trump as he has done with presidents past  rep  lewis said the one thing no one else in prominent positions of power has been brave enough to say  that trump is not a legitimately elected president  he told chuck todd i don t see the president elect as a legitimate president  i think the russians participated in helping this man get elected  and they helped destroy the candidacy of hillary clinton  after chuck todd tried to warn rep  lewis off of sending that kind of message  lewis plowed on  i think there was a conspiracy on the part of the russians and others to help him get elected  that s not right  that s not fair  that s not the open  democratic process  representative lewis is correct  trump was not duly elected  and should not be taking office  aside from that  he is the very demagogue our founders warned us of  he is dangerous  likely compromised by the russians  and an unqualified bigot to boot  we should definitely be listening to representative lewis on this one of course  the one thing a wannabe strongman like trump cannot stand is anyone questioning his legitimacy  he is sure to show his true colors once again by attacking rep  lewis for what he said  it is only a matter of time watch the video below featured image via rick diamond getty images
