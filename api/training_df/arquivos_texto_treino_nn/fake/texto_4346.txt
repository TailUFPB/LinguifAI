things really aren t looking too great for donald trump s charity foundation  with recent developments prohibiting the trump foundation from soliciting funds in new york state  it s now looking like a good majority of states may be following suit the trump foundation has also been being looked at by the attorney general for how it is getting and spending funds  especially after what happen with veterans organizations earlier this year according to the daily beast  to make matters worse for the trump foundation  the probe may not be limited to new york  charity experts and lawyers tell the daily beast that the attorneys general of other states may soon get involved in a long  drawn out process all major charities are required to register with  different states across the nation in order to individually request permission to fundraise  when trump raised money for veterans  he may have broken the rules in dozens of states  the president of the national committee for responsible philanthropy  aaron dorfman  stated  the trump foundation would be required to file similar paperwork with the attorneys generals of nearly every other state  and they could all take similar action  it is likely that other states will follow suit and they will be issued cease and desist orders denying them fundraising privileges in other states  that is the most likely next step  this is not good news for trump who keeps trying to pivot to slamming hillary clinton s clinton foundation  you know  the one that helps fight aids in nations globally trump  of course  likes to pretend that he s holier than thou  which might explain why trump foundation money was used to buy pictures of  well  himself and according to real clear politics  from  through   trump harnessed his eponymous foundation to send at least    to influential conservative or policy groups  a realclearpolitics review of the foundation s tax filings found  in many cases  this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible republican candidate for president  finding out trump is a scam artist using a shell charity with his same name really should come as no surprise  especially to fund his political ambitions of grandeur  however  it will be interesting to see how this story develops as the november election draws nearer featured photo by scott olson getty images
