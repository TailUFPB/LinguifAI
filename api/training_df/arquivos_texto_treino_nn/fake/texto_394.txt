the trump administration has been getting absolutely pummeled for its refusal to acknowledge climate change  even as it becomes more obvious in our surroundings on monday  cnn s jim acosta tore trump s homeland security advisor  tom bossert  apart in front of everyone for the administration s ignorance  acknowledging the fact that several massive hurricanes have been ravaging the united states  acosta cornered bossert  asking him if trump and his administration  saw a connection between climate change and homeland security and that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms like harvey and irma can pose a problem for future administrations  and if the storms were  giving the administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security  bossert was almost beside himself as he said  causality s something outside of my ability to analyze right now  we continue to take seriously the climate change  not the cause of it  but the things that we observe  then  acosta nailed him and the entire trump administration for their stupidity and ignorance  when you see three category  hurricanes all on the same map at the same time  does the thought occur to you   jeez  you know  maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes   or do you just separate the two and say   boy  these are a lot of hurricanes coming our way  bossert  nearly crumbling in front of the entire room of reporters  responded  there is a cyclical nature to the hurricane seasons and i thank the scientists for their forecast on this particular one  they were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall  so we ll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date  trump s administration is being challenged by the obvious evidence for climate change  and now they re being called out for it  no one can ignore what is currently happening in our environment  and the enormous impact it will have if trump s administration doesn t wake up  you can watch acosta destroy bossert below featured image via video screen capture
