the media  and to a certain extent  the pollsters  got it seriously wrong when they predicted an easy win for hillary clinton in last year s election  okay  technically it was  but our electoral college said otherwise  one professor  though  warned the united states that trump was going to win  now  that same professor is predicting that trump will be impeached allan lichtman  a professor at american university  reached meme status last fall for predicting long before anyone else that trump would win  using a formula based on the popularity of the party in control of the white house that accurately predicted the eight previous presidential elections  now lichtman wants everyone to pay attention to the rest of what came through his crystal ball   that trump will now be impeached source  politicotrump  naturally  loved lichtman s initial prediction    elect even sent him a note  taking time out of preparing to become the world s most powerful leader  he wrote me a personal note  saying  professor   congrats   good call   lichtman writes in  the case for impeachment   an advance copy of which was shared with politico   what trump overlooked  however  was my  next big prediction   that  after winning the presidency  he would be impeached  trump  of course  didn t investigate any further  if he had  he would realize that lichtman may have predicted trump  but that doesn t mean he supports him  in fact  he calls the despot  my word   an existential threat to humanity  lichtman s list of possible offenses that could get trump to that point are familiar  charges of treason with russia  abuse of power and emoluments violations  lichtman also cites now attorney general jeff sessions  then a senator  who argued that a president could be impeached for offenses committed before he took office  among those potential offenses  lichtman lists trump s housing violations  charity problems  potential violations of the cuba embargo and trump university it s all part of a brief   designed to be damning   tour through trump s history  it includes section headings like  trump towers become vacant lots  and  lying his way to the presidency   it eventually leads lichtman to the conclusion that trump might serve himself up for impeachment   trump s disregard for lying in sworn testimony  examined in the context of the bill clinton precedent  shows how trump s opponents could set an impeachment trap for him through a civil lawsuit  it wouldn t take much  if democrats regain the house in   trump s impeachment is all but guaranteed  but even now  if enough republicans turn on him  it could easily happen featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
