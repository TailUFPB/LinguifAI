there may have been a time  many years ago  when the republican party gave a crap about its constituents  but those days are long gone  if you haven t seen enough proof of that yet  all you have to do is watch this snippet from a rep  darrell issa town hall in san diego  california to see where he mocks a constituent who claimed to be assaulted by one of issa s staff the woman  who said she is a member of california s bar  a lawyer  and that she was holding a sign at the town hall which was taken away from her by issa s  bodyguard   whom she said assaulted her  i had a very small sign that said  investigate russia now   she explained to the congressman standing on the stage   there are many other people with signs here  you bodyguard  security guard  came over and took my sign away from me forcibly  i asserted my  amendment rights of free speech  i told him it was suppression of speech  source  raw storyissa tried blaming it on the size of her sign  apparently  oversized signs were banned from the event  but the woman insisted it was small  he did apologize  but the woman persisted  mine was small and it was forcibly taken from me and it constituted a battery   the woman asserted   it was your staff  they committed a criminal offense against me  at that point  ryan had had enough with the woman and said   well  okay   while grabbing the mic and said   we ll go on to somebody who doesn t have a pending lawsuit  the crowd  thankfully  booed here s the video sadly  this seems to be common behavior among republicans  dissent is no longer welcome  they re even attempting to make protesting illegal  or at least very difficult  in many states  in michigan  for example  lawmakers tried to pass a law that would make picketing illegal by charging a    fine for each day of picketing  fortunately  the state senate didn t pass it  but other bills are even more frightening in north dakota  for example  republicans introduced a bill that would make it legal to run down protesters with cars of course  we have an oval office occupier who believes that all dissent is  fake  and needs to be shut down  should it be any surprise that his party follows his example featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
