president donald trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel  while this is left most pundits perplexed  the reasoning is clear  trump wants to divert attention from robert mueller s investigation  it is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that deutsche bank has received subpoenas for information on the trump family s assets  that this jerusalem decision was announced  what could be a bigger news story than getting this information  a blow up in the middle east look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement  american allies throughout the middle east and europe have asked trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is  us news and world report put this out today  the mere consideration of trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed u s  security warning on tuesday  america s consulate in jerusalem ordered u s  personnel and their families to avoid visiting jerusalem s old city or the west bank  and urged american citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence  it is worth noting that while trump will formally announce that the u s  will recognize jerusalem as israel s capital  there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from tel aviv  in fact  he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months  this move is necessary due to the  jerusalem embassy act  which mandated the embassy be moved  it also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way the atlantic has even compared this decision to trump  wagging the dog   a reference to a movie where a u s  president goes to war with albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress  the film was viewed as a parody of president bill clinton s military actions in afghanistan and sudan after he acknowledged an affair with monica lewinsky while whether or not clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate  it is clear that trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention  catherine rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the washington post  she wrote  welcome to   the ouroboros of distractions  where every terrible thing is a head fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much  much worse  trump makes announcements  sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow  experts in the middle east fear that the jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths  many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war  his thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many by making such a move  for such purely personal reasons  trump is proving  once again  that he is not fit to be president of a condo association  much less of the united states featured image by andrew burton getty images
