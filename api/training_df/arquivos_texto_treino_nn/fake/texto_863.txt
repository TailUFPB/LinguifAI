if you ve been living under a rock for the past few days  you re probably unaware that donald trump jr  committed treason  after lying about it and realizing that wouldn t work  he tweeted out evidence of his guilt   something that for some reason doesn t have the right up in arms like it would if anyone else did it trump jr  received an email from a friend of his father s who helped the trump family with the miss universe pageant in moscow in   trump jr  was told that a kremlin connected lawyer was offering him damaging information about hillary clinton on behalf of the russian government according to donald trump  this is perfectly normal  you or i  he says  would have made the decision to knowingly collude with a hostile foreign government for personal gain  i think from a practical standpoint  most people would have taken that meeting  it s called opposition research or even research into your opponent   trump told reporters at a press conference in paris thursday the new york times reports that this is not standard  and that the only parallel in u s  history involves richard nixon there is only one known historical parallel to the trump campaign s contacts with the russians  and it involves richard m  nixon  running for president in   nixon told h  r  haldeman  his eventual white house chief of staff  to  monkey wrench  peace talks in vietnam in order to scuttle any deal that would have handed hubert humphrey  the democratic nominee  a political victory in the closing days of the election nixon  a former senator and vice president  had a relationship with the south vietnamese government  earlier in the year  he had met with the country s ambassador and brought along anna chennault  a prominent chinese american republican  as the author john a  farrell writes in his new book   richard nixon  the life   which reports the  monkey wrench  instructions  the call between nixon and haldeman took place on oct      and haldeman dutifully jotted down what he was told a group of aides to ronald reagan did meet in the fall of  with an individual claiming to be an emissary from the iranian government  but that person s legitimacy was never determined the trump family says that the meeting was not important because no usable information came from it  though trump himself tweeted about hillary clinton s emails for the first time about  minutes after the meeting ended    like if you rushed into a store with a gun to rob it and had to retreat after slipping on the freshly mopped floor  to trump  your intentions nor the gun matter   only that it didn t benefit you this sort of thing doesn t happen with respectable politicians  when a russian ambassador reached out to john f  kennedy and his democratic primary opponent adlai stevenson in   both candidates rebuked him this is not normal  this is not acceptable  trump must be impeached before the damage he does is irreversible watch trump talk out of his ass below featured image via screengrab
