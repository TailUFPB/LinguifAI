when donald trump s cnn stooges tried to defend his remarks about whether he would accept the results of the election or not  van jones scolded them into humiliation donald trump s debate performance once again suffered because of his big mouth and his refusal to stop claiming that the election is  rigged  against him when asked by moderator chris wallace on wednesday night if he will concede defeat if the election results favor hillary clinton  trump stunned everyone by basically leaving the question into an election day cliffhanger  i will look at it at the time   trump said   i will keep you in suspense  trump s refusal to accept the democratic process is dangerous and is totally unprecedented in the history of our country  whoever loses the election has always conceded defeat and acknowledged the winner as the president elect but trump may do the opposite and refuse to accept the results  which could touch off a constitutional crisis as well as riots and acts of violence by trump supporters in protest of their candidate s defeat trump supporters jeffrey lord and kayleigh mcenany  however  actually tried defending trump s toddler like behavior during cnn s post debate discussion  and van jones was having none of it he ripped both of trump s mouthpieces to shreds and shamed them for defending a man who is unpatriotic and a disgrace to american democracy  this is a really sad night   jones said   this is a very sad night for the country  you can t polish this turd  i m going to be very  very clear about this  al gore respected the constitution  respected the process  respected every voter  he went to our supreme court  asked for a resolution on his own terms as did george w  bush  and when the election results were certified  he told his party and base to stand down and accept this  even though a lot of us were very  very upset  what you just got now was the nominee of a major party for the first time in our history signaling to the american people that he has so little faith in our institutions  that he has so little faith in our people  and so little faith in our courts  and so little faith in the republican governors  the republican secretaries of state across this country that he will not stand in front of his own country  in front of his own nation and say that he respects the process and the outcome  indeed  despite a close race in  that could have gone gore s way had the supreme court allowed the recount to continue  the former vice president accepting the court s decision and conceded the race  something trump may actually refuse to do on november  even if he loses by a landslide trump s refusal to say that he will accept the results of the election if he loses angered jones tremendously  enough that he called trump  unpatriotic  and told lord and mcenany that they should be ashamed of themselves for defending him  that is an outrage  the appalling lack of patriotism from this man  the appalling lack of patriotism of this man to say this and praise putin and assad more than he has ever praised any american president  he doesn t talk about george washington  he doesn t talk about ronald reagan the way he talks about putin and assad  this man has demonstrated an appalling lack of patriotism and you should be ashamed to defend it  here s the video via vidme at this point  anyone who has defended trump should be ashamed of themselves  and frankly  none of them should be able to get a job after this election is over  the things donald trump has said over the course of this campaign are indefensible and embarrassing  as americans  lord and mcenany should be embarrassed by their candidate s temper tantrums and outrageous claims  but they are not  and that s why van jones took it upon himself to put them in their place featured image  screenshot
