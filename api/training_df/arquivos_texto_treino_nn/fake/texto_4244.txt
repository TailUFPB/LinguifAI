the republican civil war is heating up as members of the party have begun an all out campaign to stop their own presidential nominee from causing harm to the country  that  probably futile  battle is taking shape as republicans are now asking trump to stop claiming that the election is  rigged  somebody claiming in the election   i was defrauded   that isn t going to cut it   said former sen  kit bond  a missouri republican who earlier in the campaign had endorsed jeb bush and then marco rubio   they re going to have to say how  where  why  when  i don t think leading candidates for the presidency should undercut the process unless you have a really good reason   sen  lindsey graham  the south carolina republican who gained little support for his own  white house run  told politico like the trump campaign itself  this is another case of republicans now being forced to reap what they have sown  for years they have pushed the idea that voter fraud is rampant  when in reality it is almost nonexistent now trump is using those fears   especially of black voters in urban areas   to scare his supporters and set up a reason to wail and cry if he loses the election in fact  the current polling indicates that hillary clinton is favored to win  and in all the swing states key to an election victory she has a far bigger and better funded operation to get out the vote  trump has tried to create a national political operation on the cheap  preferring to spend money on his own companies rather than invest in a  ground game  as a result  trump is heavily relying on state parties  who tend to prioritize house and senate races over the presidential contest  and do not have the kind of money on hand to properly equip a presidential campaign featured image via flickr
