the russians have wanted a puppet in the white house for decades  and now they have one after successfully helping donald trump win the election last week  the cia concluded along with over a dozen other intelligence agencies that russia interfered in the election to get trump elected  trump refused to acknowledge that russia meddled  in fact  he has been desperately defending russia as his legitimacy is increasingly doubted  republicans have largely sat on their hands because they don t care if a foreign power rigged our election as long as their candidate wins but now russia has a measure of control over the united states that they have never had before and that means vladimir putin was able to execute a coup in this nation without firing a single shot   and the unwillingness of trump and republicans to do anything about it enraged keith olbermann  who tore them to shreds for it  we are at war with russia   olbermann began   or perhaps more correctly  we have lost a war with russia without a battle  we are no longer a sovereign nation  we are no longer a democracy  we are no longer a free people  we are the victims of a bloodless coup  indeed  if russia and the gop are allowed to get away with this coup  nothing stops republicans from seeking help from foreign powers in any election  democracy would be dead  and our government would no longer be chosen by the people olbermann shamed republicans for not taking russia s espionage seriously and wondered  if the russians hacked the rnc and have kept what they found there to make sure trump and the republicans obeyed  that would certainly be an explanation for why republicans have been defending russia and that s why olbermann called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor and called for preventing trump from taking office until we know what trump knew and when he knew it  after all  trump did encourage russia to continue hacking our political process during the campaign  there is no time for a full review or a measured analysis or recommendations to prevent interference in our future elections  because permitting donald trump to assume the office of president reduces the chance that we will have any future elections  the nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread  and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum   russian scum  trump is already stocking his cabinet with pro russia officials  including putin s personal friend rex tillerson as secretary of state  and because trump wants to build a hotel in moscow and owes russia for getting him elected  it s likely trump will be beholden to putin  which means a weaker nato and a weaker america as russia grabs for power around the world with no united states to challenge them  it will not be a peaceful change of power   it will be a usurpation   olbermann concluded   and the usurper has no validity  no credibility and no authority under the constitution  this is a reality  and this will be the only reality until this country rids itself of donald john trump  he is not a president   he is a puppet  here s the video via youtube donald trump and the republican party are ignoring russia s meddling because they won the election  if the situation were reversed and hillary clinton has won with russia s help there is no denying that republicans would be crying foul right now  so they need to stop being hypocrites and start standing up for the integrity of our election system  they need to keep trump from taking office and the best way to do that is to get the electoral college to vote against him  our nation s future is at stake featured image via screenshot
