what is with the gop accusing protesters of being paid to protest their events  do they think it s impossible that so many people are actually upset  maybe they re taking lessons from donald trump on that issue last week  jason chaffetz found himself on the wrong side of people who are angry that he attacked hillary so aggressively  but won t even raise the question of investigating trump for much worse transgressions  he told salt lake city based deseret news that he knew people were paid to try and bully and intimidate him at his town hall all that kind of an accusation does is galvanize those who are protesting  and these people found a unique way to respond  they re sending him invoices for their appearances at his town hall  the invoice is circulating online and charges chaffetz   per hour for  paid protest   and two additional   charges for  being callously dismissed by representative   and  being labeled out of state radical  check it out if you re one of the constituents  jasoninthehouse has accused of being a paid protester  follow this person s lead   send him an invoice  pic twitter com   kevin m  kruse   kevinmkruse  february    denigrated the protesters at his town hall further when he said  you could see it online a couple days before  a concerted effort in part to just cause chaos  democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to defend this  i ll never satisfy their desire to bring down  donald trump  considering how he vowed to continue investigating hillary clinton even after she lost the election because of some emails  it s pretty clear that he considers it his job to bring down democrats  not investigate possible government abuses  security breaches  etc featured image by alex wong via getty images
