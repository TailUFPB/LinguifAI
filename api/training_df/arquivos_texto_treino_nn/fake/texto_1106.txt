donald trump is literally the old man who yells at his television set  only he is doing it in the white house every time a certain story airs as trump confirmed on friday morning  he is under investigation for obstruction of justice as well as for his role in russia s interference in the  election i am being investigated for firing the fbi director by the man who told me to fire the fbi director  witch hunt  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    s right  clearly  trump is the leaker he has been complaining about all these months as we all know  trump s mental health has been a hot topic since long before election day  and now that trump has been in office for five months  we can say for sure that he is mentally unfit to be president  even the army field manual says that trump has no business being commander in chief of the armed forces for instance  trump has outbursts of anger and is obsessed with promoting himself  he makes unfounded accusations and attacks anyone who criticizes him  he lies constantly and makes promises he does not keep  he also lacks self control and is incredibly selfish and hateful while taking paranoia to whole new level and now we are learning from trump s own advisers that whenever news about the russia and obstruction of justice investigations appear on any television inside the white house  trump stops and yells at it and rants about how he is the victim of a conspiracy according to the associated press trump advisers and confidants describe the president as increasingly angry over the investigation  yelling at television sets in the white house carrying coverage and insisting he is the target of a conspiracy to discredit   and potentially end   his presidency  some of his ire is aimed at  rosenstein and investigative special counsel robert mueller  both of whom the president believes are biased against him  associates say can you imagine being an employee at the white house just sitting there minding your own business and all of sudden this senile old man walks up and starts yelling at the television just because a certain story is on  that has to be scary and worrying  and it should definitely worry the american people enough to call for trump s ouster  trump should be in a retirement home where he can get medication and restricted television access  not the white house featured image via david becker getty images
