donald trump really doesn t make sticky situations any better for himself trump s entanglements with russia continue to be a growing story  and a more recent piece to this puzzle came into play as trump s attorney general jeff sessions was accused of perjury over his communications with russia  but if trump was somehow trying to clean up his image and maintain a low profile  the fact that he  liked  a tweet about senator al franken accusing sessions of perjury certainly isn t going to help the fact that trump would publicly  like  a story about one of his biggest scandals only proves how insane he is  every part of the fox news story that trump is calling attention to is negative  and portrays sessions as someone who lied under oath because all of his arguments were so weak  and that s not all  the story shows that there was a third time sessions made contact with russia  when before only two had been reported to make this even more bizarre  trump decided to like this story on the very day a poll was released that revealed most americans were in agreement that sessions lied under oath and should resign either trump really thinks he s going to get away with all of this no matter how bold he is  or he s really that stupid  considering that these actions are coming from the same man that bragged about how he could go out on a popular new york street and shoot someone without losing any votes  he really just might be that confident that he is going to skate by all of these accusations and investigations  trump has never been one for subtlety  and he probably enjoys pushing the envelope and seeing what he can actually get away with  he needs to stop making fools out of the american people  and he must be held accountable for his actions
