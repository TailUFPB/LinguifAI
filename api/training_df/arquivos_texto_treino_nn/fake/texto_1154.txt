some people believe that trump is  journaling  his thoughts by posting on twitter  he s being transparent  they say what these people fail to realize is  maybe sharing his thoughts to the entire world isn t the best idea or  maybe it is a good idea  we get to really see what kind of man trump is while he shoots himself in the foot according to fortune  donald trump s tweets about his  travel ban  helped convince an appeals court to block the controversial plan once again  it s the second time his own comments have helped the courts knock down the executive order the  circuit court of appeals came to a decision on monday  ruling that trump s attempt to block immigration from six predominantly muslim countries  exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by congress  in their ruling  the judges cited a tweet from the president that was posted after the recent terrorist attack in london  in this tweet  trump stated that the u s  needed a travel ban  for certain dangerous countries  president trump s tweets continue to be cited in court decisions  this from the  circuit just now  pic twitter com   matt viser   mviser  june     i wonder which countries he means trump didn t stop at one tweet about the ban  either  trump also tweeted that he supported his original order  not the  watered down  politically correct version  that his own advisers had convinced him to sign the justice dept  should have stayed with the original travel ban  not the watered down  politically correct version they submitted to s c   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    matter what way they try to spin it  we all know that trump means a disgusting muslim ban  he even outright admitted it by saying he does not support the  politically correct version   and even that  politically correct version  was a bunch of crap  too luckily  the courts recognize this  the order seeks to ban people from specific countries  but it does not provide any link between an individual s nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness   the judges said   in short  the order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries  would be detrimental  source  fortunekicking yourself now for stating that trump s tweets are official white house statements  aren t you  spicer like i said   there s obvious good from trump s twittering  trump helped stopped his travel ban executive order once again featured image by alex wong getty images
