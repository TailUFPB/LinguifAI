monday night s debate between donald trump and hillary clinton was so one sided that virtually everyone  short of the most ardent trump supporters  thinks the gop candidate tanked  bigly social media isn t pretty for trump  even his white supremacist base is doubting him after his subpar performance in monday s debate  here are just some from stormfront  if you aren t familiar with stormfront  they are proud  white nationalists  and they are very pro trump  they re still pro trump  but they know that their candidate dug himself a hole on monday night  here are a few of their posts  courtesy of the concourse stormfront isn t the only group that believes hillary  mopped the floor  with trump    the alt right message board  was filled with disheartened white supremacists  our favorite kind   they were filled with excuses  but the overwhelming opinion seemed to be that their candidate was beaten by a woman some were offended when trump said the dnc hack could have been orchestrated by someone weighing  pounds and sitting on his bed white nationalists aren t the only conservative voters complaining that their candidate lost  i m not positive hillary actually won the debate  but i m sure trump lost it  he choked   writes weekly standard editor bill kristol ouch  when bill kristol turns on you even if you are a trump supporter  you have to think that he left a lot on the table   writes gop supper lobbyist ed rogers  a veteran of the reagan and bush  white houses   he didn t see the openings and he didn t swing at the softballs that came his way  he never used the word  change   he didn t bore in on hillary s email scandal and he never got around to the clinton foundation and hillary s suspect integrity  trump was inarticulate and rarely hit the bull s eye  not exactly giving props to hillary  but after the first  minutes  it may have been the most lopsided debate i ve ever seen   and not because clinton was particularly effective  but you don t need to be good when your opponent is bad   writes national review s david french  who considered running for president as an independent   why didn t he have a better answer ready for the birther nonsense  has he still not done any homework on foreign policy  i felt like i was watching the political titanic hit the iceberg  back up  and hit it again  just for fun  the washington post has a bunch of other conservative reactions while it s doubtful the white supremacists or any of the other quoted conservatives will pull the lever for hillary clinton  it is clear that trump showed his vulnerabilities last night and he proved that he s not fit  at all  to be commander in chief featured image via michael bocchieri getty images
