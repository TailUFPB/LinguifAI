despite claiming to look forward to the second day of g  meetings  donald trump decided to let his daughter take his place instead that s right  trump literally let ivanka take his place at the g  summit on friday even though she is not in any position to represent america on the world stage she is not an elected official  nor is she the secretary of state  she doesn t even have diplomatic status  yet ivanka took her daddy s place at the round table meeting  sitting beside british prime minister theresa may and chinese president xi jinping here s a photo via twitter ivanka trump  unelected  unqualified  daughter in chief  is representing the us at the  summit next to may  xi  merkel  photo  lanalukash pic twitter com   brian klaas   brianklaas  july    s the video via youtube the decision to let ivanka do his job caused national outrage as americans demanded to know why a failed shoe designer who has zero political and diplomatic experience was tapped to take on such an important role at a major international meeting how the hell is this acceptable   tanya     july    trump sitting in at  instead of her father is breathtakingly insane  she designs shoes     dom joly   domjoly  july    is she allowed at the   she s not even allowed at nordstroms   george reinblatt   georgereinblatt  july    rest of the world leaders must be wondering what the f  k has happened to the usa  irish elt   irishelt  july    embarrassment didn t end there  a photo of trump clearly being ignored as other leaders talk to each other while he sits by himself at the table has been widely circulated agreed pic twitter com   phil jones     july    s pretty damn clear that the other world leaders want nothing to do with trump or ivanka trump later praised ivanka and claimed that she s only getting criticized because she s his daughter  if she weren t my daughter it would be so much easier for her   trump said   it might be the only bad thing she has going if you want to know the truth  trump s remarks received a mere golf clap from a few people in the room just imagine the reaction from republicans if president obama had let his daughter malia take his place at the g  summit  they would have been uncontrollably enraged  they would have called obama irresponsible  they would have accused him of nepotism  they would have called him a dictator  but trump lets his daughter take his place and republicans don t say a word because they are hypocrites america deserves to be represented by the president at the g   at the very least  a state department official should have replaced trump  ivanka is only trump s adviser because he ignored government ethics rules  she has no experience as a public official  she certainly has no experience in diplomacy this only serves as yet another embarrassing trump moment abroad that makes our country look like even more of a joke on the world stage featured image  twitter
