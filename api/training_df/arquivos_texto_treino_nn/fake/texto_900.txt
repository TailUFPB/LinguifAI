the narrative regarding the trump russia connection seems to be  nothing to see here  when it comes to supporters of the so called  president   donald trump cannot abide anyone even suggesting that he had help to win in   but the amount of smoke there with regards to the russian hacking is too thick for there to be no fire  hell  his own son just admitted something extraordinary  donald trump jr  actually came out and said that he  trump s son in law jared kushner  and former campaign manager paul manafort actually met with a lawyer with connections to the kremlin apparently  this little secret pow wow occurred after trump clinched the gop nomination  and long before his many general election controversies  during a time where it seemed sure that he would lose  of course  trump jr  is saying that this meeting had nothing to with the election and everything to do with adopting russian orphans  he said of the encounter  we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of russian children that was active and popular with american families years ago and was since ended by the russian government  but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up  was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance  but was not told the name of the person i would be meeting with beforehand  of course  this is likely a lie  trump  his kids  and everyone else in his orbit lie routinely  further  think about who this meeting took place with   paul manafort  who was the campaign manager at the time has known ties to pro russia ukrainian politicians that he has worked for in the past  in fact  it is what forced him to abruptly step aside further  the lawyer they met with at trump tower during the campaign  natalia veselnitskaya  is known around circles who promote sanctioning russia for their many human rights abuses  veselnitskaya opposes said sanctions  and that was likely her reason for wanting to meet with team trump during the campaign  the reason for the bizarre claims about adopting russian children is the fact that in   russian dictator vladimir putin halted american adoption of russian children  due to sanctions that specifically related to human rights violations  this was called the magnitsky act  after a man who perished in an untimely and shady manner for blowing the whistle on russian corruption  it makes for a convenient   but hardly believable   cover story all in all  this is shady and nobody in their right minds believes that trump jr   paul manafort  or anyone else on that campaign was meeting with a kremlin backed lawyer over anything but money and sanctions  these people are filthy as hell  and we need to get them out of our government featured image via david becker getty images
