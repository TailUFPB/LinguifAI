the bright side of the russian trump investigation  if you can find one  is that a lot of political stars are being born  al franken  while not a newbie to most  is separating himself from the chaff  as are adam schiff  kamala harris and a handful of other democrats  one major rising star  though  isn t a democrat at all   he s a former counter intelligence officer  he considers himself a colin powell republican and if he were to run for president  there s little doubt he d be a force to be reckoned with  regardless of party after friday night s overtime with bill maher  the part of the show that s on youtube instead of on tv   nance confirmed his badass status when he stood up to breitbart editor in chief  alex marlow  demanding an apology for a story that ran a few years ago that resulted in death threats to nance and his family on the subject of fake news  which marlow tried to redefine as a liberal invention  nance said this  there was this article about a  year counterterrorism expert who claimed they wanted trump tower attacked that was written in breitbart   nance began   i got  death threats and that came from your website you gonna apologize to me  marlow responded that he respected nance and his service to the country  but nance shot back by saying   your followers threatened my family  my children  my wife  the breitbart chief tried turning the tables   are you really suggesting that breitbart doesn t get death threats  that our lives aren t put in danger  marlow claimed he didn t remember the story  but if nance would show it to him  he d apologize  apparently  marlow hasn t heard of the google nance responded that he will  come to  his  office and see that retraction  marlow then called nance  who is incredibly calm   hysterical   which seems to be the go to insult for anyone speaking out against the trump administration here s the video featured image via video screenshots
