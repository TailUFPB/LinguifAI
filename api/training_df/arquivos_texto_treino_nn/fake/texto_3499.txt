it s the lame duck session for ohio s legislature  which means they re going bananas pushing  christmas tree  bills   and measures added to bills   through before their term ends  this process tends to favor the majority party  which is the republican party  and they ve already made headlines for two unconstitutionally restrictive anti abortion bills  as well as an aptly named  guns everywhere  bill and that s still not enough for ohio republicans  in their latest act of legislative war  they ve taken aim at labor and local democracy  how  by adding a measure banning local municipalities from raising the minimum wage to a bill against bestiality  of all things  governor kasich has not yet stated whether or not he will sign  but republican legislators are optimistic it should be noted that an anti bestiality bill passed the ohio senate with bipartisan support earlier in the term this measure appears mostly aimed at the city of cleveland  which is about to vote on whether to raise the minimum wage locally to   over the next few years  a local group in cincinnati  cincinnatians for a strong economy  wants to do the same republicans generally claim to be in favor of local government   after all  who knows the needs of a given city or state better than the people that live there  however  incidents like this have made it clear that individual matters of ideological concern trump  principles  every time in the gop it should be noted that this is merely coming from a place of ideological support and politics   there is absolutely no evidence that banning cities from raising the minimum wage is good for the economy  see  until   only five local districts in the entire country had minimum wage laws  since then  dozens more have followed suit  allowing for numerous case studies on whether or not a local minimum wage raise  kills jobs   as republicans claim  as opposed to accomplishing that dastardly progressive agenda of keeping workers out of poverty in many cases  large cities   which typically have higher cost to live and unique economic considerations   are a better choice for a minimum wage raise than an entire state  anyway  take seattle  for example  which saw the nation s first   minimum wage law  although san francisco will get there faster  as one of my colleagues wrote last week  the  unemployment rate in the city of seattle   the tip of the spear when it comes to minimum wage experiments   has now hit a new cycle low of      meanwhile  a university of washington study on the minimum wage law found little or no evidence of job losses or business closings although you can never declare a game over until the final whistle  this experiment is starting to look like a rout  i continue to believe that we should assess the data as it comes in  honestly and as free of bias as possible  this is a complex issue   seattle  with its vibrant tech industry  high median household income and growing population  is different from many u s  cities  states and cities must adjust their minimum wages to fit their local conditions  this is why a national minimum wage should rise at a pace different from the most economically vibrant locales taking away the ability of local cities to determine their own economic needs is bad policy  and allowing state officials to interfere in municipal democracy is undemocratic  not only that  but workers deserve a raise  minimum wage nationally is     frequently referred to as  poverty wages   and the minimum wage in ohio        is not much higher  republicans who are against welfare for human beings seem to have no trouble picking up the tab for deadbeat businesses that refuse to pay workers their fair share from qz it could be that the fears of minimum wage opponents are overstated  one innovative  study examined prices at online menus from local restaurants in san jose  california  after the city enacted a   increase in minimum wages  and found that restaurants were able to accommodate higher costs of doing business through minor price increases  by looking at restaurants within a half mile of the city s border  they were also able to demonstrate results  challenging the suggestion that local minimum wages disadvantage a city s economic competitiveness   these experiments  however  have benefitted from the steady growth of the obama economy  with its record  months of labor market expansion with donald trump s presidency on the horizon  democrats locked out of national influence will no doubt continue to press a progressive agenda locally  in the cities and states where they have more sway  but as wage floors rise  especially in jurisdictions with older or shrinking populations  they will have to be pragmatic about overreach  keeping in mind the lesson of kansas  republican governor sam brownback  who enacted a radical agenda in his state as an example to the nation a conservative one  rather than a progressive one  it should be noted and saw the local economy crumble it s just a fact   liberals are better at managing the economy  that s what history and the facts show  this is undemocratic and anti labor   in other words  everything the gop stands
