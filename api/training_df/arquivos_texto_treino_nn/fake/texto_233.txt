if you re sitting at your computer  take a deep breath  if you re reading this on your phone  have a seat  everything you think you know about how bad the trump administration s response to hurricane maria in puerto rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse on rachel maddow s show monday night  she discussed a small town in the mountains of puerto rico called aibonito  roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of san juan  if it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately  that s good   even if it is because of listening to trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels showing video taken from a moving vehicle  rachel describes the roads from the capital to aibonito  clear  unblocked  as the cameras travel with the msnbc team  you hear the point of rachel s report  which is that after almost three weeks since the storm  fema still has not brought relief to the mountain town  and to hear them tell it  there s a reason it s not their job fema still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town  and make no mistake  fema knows that aibonito is accessible at this point  because they ve been there three times  all three times  fema was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid  let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for  the federal emergency management agency  heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me rachel first ran a profile on aibonito on friday  which is how she knew that fema had been there three times  after she ran that report  fema contacted her show  desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to aibonito on saturday  this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community  still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks the death toll in puerto rico has more than doubled since donald trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died but the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in texas and florida  shipping restrictions are back in place in puerto rico  making what little aid is coming hard to receive  the administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready to eat food  despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week  and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices  that s not how it went in the mainland us  where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase mcdonald s on day one  and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging there can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in puerto rico has suffered from a lack of compassion  and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with texans and floridians   american citizenship  basic humanity  dire need   what s left is that they are a spanish speaking people  they are brown and seem foreign  they are underdogs  with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual united states that fly at the same height  just below the american flag featured image via joe raedle getty images
