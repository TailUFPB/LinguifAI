gop presidential nominee donald trump has been steadily ripping the republican party apart at the seams due to the embarrassing travesty of a campaign he s been running  this is especially true since the surfacing of a tape of trump and former access hollywood host billy bush having what is quite possibly the most lewd  offensive conversation two men could have about women  as if that weren t enough  nearly a dozen women have come forward claiming trump did to them just what he bragged about being able to do on that tape trump s scandals are literally doing something that no one thought possible  turning certain reliably red states into battleground states  according to the polling organization realclearpolitics  trump s lack of acceptability could actually turn texas  of all places  blue  as of sunday  trump is within the margin of error   just three points ahead of democratic nominee hillary clinton  the average of all of the available polling is a   point divide  this is likely due to the fact that there are some things that are just not partisan   open misogyny  narcissism  racism  xenophobia  and all of the other characteristics that make for huge deal breakers on the basis of basic decency  regardless of political leanings other red states that could be within striking distance for hillary include arizona  utah and georgia  this would be why trump  who is simply unable to accept losing at anything  is now talking of a  rigged election   it s an effort to make his already angry  disillusioned supporters become even more aggrieved  this makes for a dangerous situation  and therefore it is definitely a good thing if hillary can not only win  but run up the score around the nation and completely annihilate trump featured image via justin sullivan via getty images
