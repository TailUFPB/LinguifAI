i ll bet if you go to your kitchen and look at the calendar by your fridge  in tiny letters at the bottom of today s date it says  patriot day   if not  don t worry   the official title for today s remembrance only began in   the year after the terrorist attack that changed almost everything about the way our nation conducts itself  the word  patriot  means different things to different people  and we won t pretend to speak for them all here  but we know it when we see it  and we know the opposite of it  as well patriotism is what we see when we watched americans coming together in grief and solidarity  helping each other in the aftermath of the attack  the opposite of it is what we saw when former new york mayor rudy giuliani politically invoked the attacks so much that vice president joe biden once remarked that all giuliani needed  to make a sentence is a noun  a verb  and     patriotism was on the face of our last president  holding a soup ladle in a national day of service in   the opposite is what you call it when rush limbaugh attacked him and said he was  visiting the beneficiaries of his policies  patriotism  in the words of clarence darrow   hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else  what it does not do is tout itself as superior  we see nothing but that from donald trump  when trump lied on national television   one of more than a thousand times he s done so since his election   and said that he heard muslims  cheering  the fall of the towers  perhaps what he was actually doing was projecting a little bit of his own guilt onto adherents of a religion he doesn t and has no desire to understand maybe  just maybe  donald trump felt a tiny bit bad for saying the worst thing anyone in america said on that fateful day in    wall street actually was the second tallest building in downtown manhattan  and it was actually  before the world trade center  was the tallest and then  when they built the world trade center  it became known as the second tallest  and now it s the tallest  what s at  wall street  the  story trump building listen here  if you can featured image via john moore getty images
