she was there to learn more about donald trump in order to decide who to vote for  but after the way trump s fans treated her in front of her disabled daughter it s clear she won t be voting for him jennifer mau took her daughter chloe to a trump rally in colorado in an effort to make a more informed decision on election day  mau is an independent voter and is unsure about who she wants to vote for  so she decided to attend the rally to hear trump speak mau and her daughter sat with a group of disabled people during the rally  but mau didn t stay long after  minutes  it became clear that trump wasn t the right candidate for her  but when she attempted to leave with her daughter  she was soon under siege from some really hateful supporters of the republican nominee  some of whom were also disabled  when we were leaving  somebody said   why are you leaving   and basically struck a nerve   mau recounted in an interview with denver  news   i said   why are you here  he makes fun of people like you  mau was referencing an outrageous incident of trump mocking a disabled reporter according to mau  trump s supporters tried to make excuses for their candidate  but mau s mind remained unchanged trump s supporters harassed her and yelled at her  and one even went so far as to tell her that she doesn t love her daughter if she doesn t support trump  this lady is following me  screaming and yelling at me that if i loved my daughter i would vote for trump and i need to get educated because he didn t mock somebody on purpose  it made me sad  made me want to vomit  here s the video via youtube the secret service was forced to step in and escort mau and her daughter out of the rally safely  but the ordeal left her daughter shaken however  trump lost more than one potential voter that day  as it turns out  some people actually walked out of the rally with mau in disgust on how his hardcore supporters treated her and while we don t know for sure who mau will be voting for on november   we can be sure that it won t be for donald trump once again  trump s supporters prove that hillary clinton was right to call them deplorable featured image  screenshot
