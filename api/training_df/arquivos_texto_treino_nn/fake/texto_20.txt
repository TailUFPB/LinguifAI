it almost seems like donald trump is trolling america at this point  in the beginning  when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at  then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in  we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected after  months of donald trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near  i think it s time we address what s happening  dude is a straight up troll  he gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress  he actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous his latest stunt is one of the grossest yet everyone is  by now  used to trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about  and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about  so it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the sandy hook shooting of  on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event  what was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the white house christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place  along with others who share those concerns in each of the past  years  president obama invited gun violence prevention activists  gun violence survivors  including the sandy hook families  and supportive lawmakers to his christmas party  zero gun lobbyists were in attendance  pic twitter com   shannon watts   shannonrwatts  december    last sentence of that tweet is important  because that s exactly who donald trump did invite to the white house christmas party  instead of victims  on the anniversary day yesterday was the  year mark of the mass shooting at sandy hook school  which went unacknowledged by the president  on the same day  he hosted a white house christmas party to which he invited  nra ceo wayne lapierre  here he is at the party with  danpatrick  pic twitter com mubkciwgxb  shannon watts   shannonrwatts  december    lapierre is the man who  in response to the sandy hook massacre  finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music  movies  and video games  and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of  isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography  yes  yes  it is  wayne anyway  happy holidays merry christmas from donald trump  everyone featured image via alex wong getty images
