now that donald trump has completed his disastrous first overseas trip  white house press secretary sean spicer must once again answer to the u s  media as trump continues to disgrace the country on its own soil following the memorial day holiday  it was back to business as usual with spicer nearly losing his mind at a press briefing earlier today  when reporters asked spicer about trump s claims about  fake news   spicer pretty much imploded as he sparred with reporters spicer tried to defend his mentally incompetent boss by pointing out a tweet in which a bbc reported had made a mistake  claiming that trump had not been wearing a translation earpiece when he met with foreign leaders  this mistake was quickly and publicly corrected by the reporter as soon as it was realized  but spicer pathetically latched onto that one incident as proof of  fake news   spicer whined  on friday  the president was having a great discussion at the  and someone from the bbc  and ultimately an incoming reporter for the new york times retweeted that the president was being rude by disrespecting the italian prime minister  when in fact  you all in all of the meetings watched the president with that one earpiece that s been used by all the other presidents  that s just fake  spicer s example was beyond ridiculous  and reporters not only reminded him that the inaccurate tweet had been corrected  but that it hadn t gone any further to major newspapers  but spicer was beyond reasoning with  he fired back  looking as if a meltdown was just moments away  i was asked to give an example  and i did it  and when another reporter said the bbc reporter s tweet didn t affect how trump s overseas trip was covered  spicer s reply was nothing but disrespectful and dismissive  he replied sarcastically  well  thank you  i appreciate it  you get to decide what is big and what is not  a lot of things have been pushed out based on unnamed unaccountable sources that is very troubling  clearly  spicer forgot that his own boss is the king of using anonymous sources and perpetuating fake news  you can watch spicer fight with reporters below featured image via win mcnamee getty images
