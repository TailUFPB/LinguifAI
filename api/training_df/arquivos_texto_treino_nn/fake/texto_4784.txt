donald trump recently attended a conservative  black church in detroit in an effort to reach out to black voters  as expected  it was an embarrassment  and the black community was not fooled by trump s pandering photo op perhaps one of the mast damning of all criticism comes from across the board religious leaders  all of them black  from the detroit metropolitan are  they all had the same message for trump   we aren t fooled the council of baptist pastors of detroit and vicinity penned a scathing letter signed by representatives of  different christian denominations on saturday  blasting the opportunism of the trump campaign and its brazen language and exploitation we   have been avoided and overlooked in regards to the upcoming appearance of republican presidential nominee donald trump in detroit   racism  bigotry  misogyny  hate speech  sexism  divisiveness  threats  a call to harm  discrimination  bullying  and fearmongering have no place in the white house in the greatest country in the world in addition to the baptist leadership  representatives from the metropolitan organizing strategy enabling strength  the michigan chapter of church of god in christ  the evangelical lutheran  and episcopal church all signed on in total  these religious organizations represent over  african american churches in southeastern michigan alone the president of the baptist pastor s council  rev  lawrence glass  blasted trump as an insult to the african americans and minorities  saying his attacks on muslims  immigrants and hispanics glass also pointed out that trump  has no history of helping minorities  of going to the inner city to help out people of color  he has done absolutely nothing   and  he wants us to believe him  he must think we re really  really naive and ignorant of his past practices  although these churches and their leaders have a huge  disdain  for trump  they have said that doesn t necessarily mean they re all in for hillary clinton the chairman of detroit ecumenical ministers  the rev  horace sheffield  accused trump of using blacks as  political props  trump and his campaign thought they could trick black voters into supporting him by appealing to their religious convictions  unlike the rabid  faux christian evangelicals represented by people like billy graham and michele bachmann  black religious leaders actually follow by example  and trump certainly does not fit their mold here s an important reminder for trump  the most religious group in america are black women  black women are also democratic voters  and for good reason  they aren t so easily tricked by a predatory white nationalist another trump  pivot  gone horribly wrong featured image via mario tama getty images
