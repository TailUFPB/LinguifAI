for months donald trump and his top staffers have sworn that no one in the campaign had contact with the russian government while it was in the middle of engaging in a cyber attack against democrats  trump s new attorney general  jeff sessions  even testified under oath that he had not spoke to russian officials while working on trump s campaign and that lie just got exposed now high ranking democrats including house minority leader nancy pelosi and ranking member of the house oversight committee elijah cummings have both called on sessions to immediately step down  pelosi s statement was a scorched earth condemnation of sessions  trump  and the entire administration which seems hell bent on covering up its connections to russia no matter what  jeff sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing before the senate  under penalty of perjury  he told the senate judiciary committee   i have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and i did not have communications with the russians   we know that statement is false attorney general sessions has never had the credibility to oversee the fbi investigation of senior trump officials  ties to the russians  this is why democrats have consistently called for sessions to recuse himself from any oversight of the investigation now  after lying under oath about his own communications with the russians  the attorney general must resign  there must be an independent  bipartisan  outside commission to investigate the trump political  personal  and financial connection to the russians  cummings was equally forceful in calling for sessions to resign  citing the fact that michael flynn  trump s disgraced former national security advisor  had already resigned for a similar offense and sessions  was that much worse because he kept quiet about it even after that scandal sessions should have the self respect to resign  because he may be also be facing a conviction  at least one former white house ethics lawyer has already stated that he believes what sessions did could easily send him to prison misleading the senate in sworn testimony about one own contacts with the russians is a good way to go to jail https   t co   richard w  painter   rwpusa  march    pelosi noted  sessions  credibility was already zero and now it s under water  in a trump administration bursting at the seams with corruption  session has managed to stand out as particularly appalling  republicans now need to join with speaker pelosi and rep  cummings and demand sessions leave in disgrace featured image via zach gibson getty image
