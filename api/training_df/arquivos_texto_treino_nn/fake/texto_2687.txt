this is unbelievably outrageous republicans are literally pretending that the last eight years never happened in february   justice antonin scalia passed away  leaving a vacancy on the supreme court that president obama was responsible to fill  but scalia s body was not even cold before republicans vowed to block any nominee he selected for the position and so  republicans did just that and refused to even grant merrick garland a hearing despite the fact that he is a moderate centrist who enjoyed support from republicans in the past republicans excused their unprecedented behavior by claiming that lame duck presidents can t pick supreme court nominees and claimed that the american people should get a say in november about who should pick the next supreme court justice th gop has three problems here  first  president obama was elected twice by the american people and therefore had the right to choose the nominee  second  there is plenty of historical examples of presidents picking supreme court nominees and getting them confirmed during their final year in office  ronald reagan is one of them  and finally  the american people did not vote for donald trump  they voted for hillary clinton by nearly  million votes so trump definitely does not have a mandate and republicans do not have any excuses for their obstruction but democrats certainly do have a really good excuse to block trump s nomination of neil gorsuch to the high court  after all  republicans created the new precedent last year by refusing to confirm garland  republicans literally stole a supreme court seat from president obama and the democratic party but mike pence claims that even threatening to obstruct trump s nominee is  unprecedented  during a speech to the federalist society  pence promised that gorsuch  will pick up where scalia left off   in other words  he ll be a complete dick who wants to repeal every supreme court ruling that protects the rights of women  minorities  gay people  the environment  etc until this nation is taken all the way back to the  and then he said this  several announced their opposition within minutes of his nomination  and now they re even threatening to use the filibuster procedure in the senate to stop him  make no mistake about it  this is an unwise and an unprecedented act  this seat does not belong to any party or any ideology or any interest group  this seat on the supreme court belongs to the american people  and the american people deserve a vote on the floor of the united states senate  here s the video via youtube democrats should block trump s supreme court pick at all costs  turnabout is fair play and republicans are hypocrites for whining about obstruction when they are the ones who totally disrespected president obama and merrick garland in the first place  they only have themselves to blame for what democrats are threatening to do and they have no right to complain after the way they acted last year  if republicans wanted democrats to cooperate with trump  they should have thought about that before acting like complete traitors toward president obama republicans wanted the supreme court to just have eight justices and that has lasted for a year now  it s time for democrats to extend that wait to another four years  and if republicans change the rules to force gorsuch on the supreme court  democrats should impeach him and trump when they get control of congress and show republicans what the word  unprecedented  really means featured image via screenshot
