the absolute hatred conservatives have for first lady michelle obama knows no bounds and now we are being treated to another example of it  in   mrs  obama planted a garden on the white house lawn in an effort to promote healthy eating and to encourage others to plant their own home gardens as well but conservatives have complained ever since because for some reason they oppose healthy eating it s been seven years since the garden was planted and it has flourished  expanding from   square feet to   square feet and now michelle is protecting what she and the white house staff have spent years developing by making it permanent as we all know  donald trump has vowed to reverse or overturn everything president obama and the first lady have ever done over the last eight years  that means michelle obama s garden could very well be plowed over just to spite democrats and the obama family  conservatives would certainly cheer on this petty act  but michelle has taken steps to ensure that the garden remains on the grounds for future first families to enjoy by setting it in stone with a stone walkway running through it and stone walls surrounding the plots consisting of steel and concrete  michelle obama officially dedicated the garden on wednesday in a ceremony at the white house  this little garden will live on as a symbol of the hopes that we all hold of growing a healthier nation for our children   obama said   i am hopeful that future first families will cherish this garden like we have  and that it will become one of our enduring white house traditions  in addition  a message etched in the stone reads   white house kitchen garden  established in  by first lady michelle obama with the hope of growing a healthier nation for our children  now the garden is a historic symbol representing president obama and his family s time in the white house  which makes it far more difficult  if not impossible  for the next president to get rid of  and racist conservatives are enraged so much about it that they lost their shit and spewed hateful and racist remarks all over the internet here are some screenshots and here are some tweets via twitter  gatewaypundit i ll bet her gardening is done by others   will stop in her privileged life outside of wh  deplorable      october    gatewaypundit woman grew up privileged but acts like she grew up poor in the ghetto  disgraceful person   jrader   zzbluecomet  october      gatewaypundit plow it under  no reminders of destruction of our constitution by obama  trumplican     october    nprpolitics bulldoze it and put in a putting green   bill ferrin   wferrin  october    from facebook as usual  conservatives have zero class and only have a capacity for hatred  president obama should seriously sign an executive order praising oxygen so we can watch right wingers hold their breath in protest featured image via wikimedia
