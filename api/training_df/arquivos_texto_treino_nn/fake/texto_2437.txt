since donald trump began his run for the president  there has been one clear message  if you aren t white  preferably male  and christian  you aren t a true american  add that to the tea party  which started when barack obama was elected president  they didn t care about taxation enough to organize when there were white presidents   and we have a recipe for violence  in north carolina  the tea party is threatening just that toward muslims and the trump administration  at least so far  is silent about a third of americans believe that if we let muslim immigrants in  our country will be subjected to  sharia law   which is about the equivalent of biblical law  which those americans have no problem with  sharia law  like biblical law  would be a direct violation of the constitution  but the only part they know of is the second amendment  which brings us to what these tea partiers want to do to muslims they want to  kill the hell out of  them the meeting was held in a north carolina seafood restaurant and it included about two dozen tea partiers  many of whom are part of right wing militia groups  do you have any recommendations as to how we could stop this   asked frank del valle  a winston salem resident whose facebook page identifies him as a retired federal employee and native of cuba  near the end of the hourlong presentation   because my only recommendation is to start killing the hell out them  source  triad city beataccording to the group  they aren t the only ones  political correctness is being thrown away   he said   a lot of people are meeting like this  we re making progress in the positive direction   he argued for supporting reformers in the muslim faith  adding   we need to talk about how we can get things done peacefully  be ready for the worst  i am beyond that point   del valle replied   i m ready to start taking people out  that damned sharia law is everywhere  the muslim brotherhood is behind all that terrorism and violent acts  but they re also here operating in america in a very stealthy mode   he said   they ve infiltrated the judiciary  they have judges that are elected to the bench  these judges are expected to make rulings from the bench here in america according to sharia law even though it s not a sharia court  if you ve got a muslim judge he s required to try you under sharia law  these people are in high positions of influence often behind the scenes in government  academia  medicine  the media  how many of you have been to a hospital and seen the doctors that are running around in the hospital  actually  judges are required to not try people under sharia law and the vast majority of doctors are white  but the tea party has never been good with facts these tea partiers are feeling empowered these days  for good reason  trump has all but eliminated any references to right wing terrorism  which is very real and already underreported  if trump denounces right wing extremism  he will be denouncing his most loyal base and that isn t going to happen featured image via phillipp guelland getty images
