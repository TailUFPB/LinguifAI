during the election  when donald trump wasn t bellowing  lock her up  about hillary clinton  he was manufacturing a narrative in which president obama had turned our country into a dystopia in which we ve lost all respectability throughout the world we need a president who isn t a laughing stock to the entire world  we need a truly great leader  a genius at strategy and winning  respect   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  august     as usual  trump was more about projection than the truth  we can t be sure if he knew he was going to destroy our reputation around the world  but he did  in a survey released on thursday  our standing in the world tumbled all the way from number one to number six  the power and quality of each country s  brand image  was measured by the nation brands index  nbi  survey  which was conducted by german based market research firm gfk and british political consultant simon anholt  the final nbi score was decided after collecting public opinion on  different countries on primarily six categories  its  people    governance    exports    tourism    investment and immigration   and  culture and heritage  according to popular public opinion  the u s  dropped to the sixth place while germany rose to claim the prestigious first spot  germany stood second in the same survey last year while the first place was held by the u s  after just a year  the u s  is lagging behind germany  france  britain  canada and japan source  ibtimesthis isn t the first time the world has taken notice of the fact that we have a greedy  uncivilized  unethical half wit at the helm of the largest economy and the largest military in the world in september  a pew poll found that the world favored obama over trump by a significant number  out of  countries  only two liked trump better  only russia  hmmmm  and israel were happier with trump  as for the rest of the world  the drop in popularity wasn t just in double digits  it was  as trump might say  huuuuge  only  percent of swedes trust trump not to start world war iii   percent of swedish people trusted obama  okay  the survey didn t specify world war but it did ask if they trusted the u s  president to handle world affairs the rest of the world wasn t quite as dramatic  but as you can see from this chart below  the world really hates trump in july  his results were somewhat better  but he was still wildly hated by the majority of the world s citizens this is a lot bigger deal than just a few statistics  it took a long time to build our standing in the world  since world war ii  right or wrong  the united states has been seen as a moral leader  we are certainly an economic leader  now we have no leg to stand on  even when fighting for own interests  we may be witnessing the death of the world s longest living democracy and it s all because millions of people threw a temper tantrum over the fact that a black man was president and that a woman wanted to be president featured image via pool getty images
