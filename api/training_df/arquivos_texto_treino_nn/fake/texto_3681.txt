perhaps the green party isn t so useless after all  jill stein s push for recounts in some battleground states is gaining momentum  stein raised   million to cover the costs of recounts over the thanksgiving holiday  and as soon as the green party pays its fee  the wisconsin elections board is prepared to go forward with a statewide recount the elections board has already put an internal team together  they ve been working with their county clerks  and they ve arranged for the necessary legal counsel from the wisconsin department of justice  michael haas  the election board s administrator  said  we plan to hold a teleconference meeting for county clerks next week and anticipate the recount will begin late in the week after the stein campaign has paid the recount fee  which we are still calculating  this is unlike the florida recounts in   where the vote was so close it automatically triggered a machine recount  from there  well  we all remember how it spiraled out of control  al gore won the popular vote that year  but not nearly to the degree that hillary has won this year s popular vote also  wisconsin does not have an automatic recount trigger   a candidate has to request a recount no matter how close the vote is a battleground state recount isn t going to help jill stein any  and she knows that  so what s her game here  she says she s worried that foreign hackers skewed our votes and elected trump for us  the green party is actually asking wisconsin for a reconciliation of paper records  which goes a step beyond a simple vote recount   it s an audit of paper ballots and paper trails from electronic voting machines  they re focusing on the substantial increase of absentee ballots in wisconsin  along with the electronic voting systems that have been under scrutiny since we began seeing massive cyberattacks from parties interested in influencing our election results stein s fundraising website makes it clear that they know there s no guarantee any states in which the greens are petitioning will actually move on to a recount  and she does admit that they don t have a smoking gun that proves trump s win is illegitimate in fact  wisconsin actually doesn t believe a recount will change anything  despite the fact that some major vote discrepancies have already been found  howver  provided all paperwork is filed properly  they will generally proceed with their recounts regardless hillary is now leading the national popular vote by   million  and is approaching a  percent margin  that s a greater margin than john f  kennedy  richard nixon  grover cleveland  james a  garfield  and james k  polk had when they were elected  if her lead continues to grow  she could approach jimmy carter s margin  and perhaps george w  bush s margin of victory in  hillary and her campaign have stayed quietly out of the recount debate thus far  stein and the green party are pushing for recounts in both michigan and pennsylvania as well  but it s not yet known whether those two states will actually do it  it s also not clear whether this could flip the election  what wisconsin does in the coming days could set an interesting tone photo of donald trump by bill pugliano getty images  photo of hillary clinton by chip somodevilla getty images
