donald trump  at the second presidential debate  invoked laughs when he claimed to respect women  and that no one respects women more than him there s a reason people laughed   they don t believe him  and for good reason in a new poll from nbc surveymonkey shows that a huge majority of the american people   percent  do not believe trump respects women  compared to  percent who said he does when it comes to female voters  nearly  percent responded that trump does not respect women  up from  percent pre leaked audio even more telling is the difference in this question pre tape leak  before the bombshell audio recording leaked   percent  still a majority  said trump did not respect women  since the recording leaked  we ve seen an eight percent increase in those that agree that donald trump is a sexist pig but the poll also took into account trump s post first debate meltdown over alicia machado  in which he degraded the weight of the former miss universe and asked voters to watch her sex tape  which doesn t exist  donald trump currently trails hillary clinton in what s being seen as the biggest gender gap in presidential politics the fact that trump wrote off the leaked audio as  locker room talk  multiple times  and denied that he said the things he did   shows that he really doesn t care about the issues that women care about  and it shows that he is unable to take responsibility for his actions  one can simply say  i made a mistake and i m sorry   but it takes a real man to fully own up to what was said   and trump didn t do that john mccain and mitt romney lost their respective elections  in big part  because of the gender gap  if trump thinks he can win a national election in  days with the historic gap he has now he s got another thing coming his way featured image via scott olson getty images
