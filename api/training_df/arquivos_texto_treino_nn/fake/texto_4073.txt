donald trump s recent talk of a  rigged election  is dangerous  as it undermines the trust of americans in the electoral process  there has been bipartisan condemnation of his continuing to poison the minds of his brainwashed supporters  elected officials and leadership on both sides of the political aisle have expressed confidence in the election results  and some have even gone on television to explain the process in great detail  to show just how impossible it is to rig a national level election  there seems to be one trump supporter  though  who isn t being as forceful with regards to pushing back against this narrative  republican national committee chair reince priebus priebus seems to be the only member of the gop leadership who is closely helping the trump campaign these days  and he seems to be afraid to anger trump  on cbs s face the nation on sunday  priebus said to host john dickerson with regards to trump s willingness to concede if he loses  he s saying he wants to reserve all options  and  if there is grounds for a recount  i will exercise my options  he is not willing to not concede if he loses and there s no fraud  dickerson reminded priebus that trump had told his supporters that fraud is the only way he could possibly lose pennsylvania  instead of taking the usual line that voter fraud is not widespread  priebus said  that s not where we re at  losing by  votes is one thing  losing by   is another thing  sure  there have been contested elections  but that is not what trump has been saying to his rabid base of supporters  he has instead been telling them that there is a vast conspiracy  a huge  sweeping  nationwide effort to make sure he doesn t win  party leaders like priebus  whether they are in trump s camp or not  have a responsibility to put a lid on this dangerous rhetoric  instead  priebus is giving shameful responses to something that could cause many  many problems indeed featured image via alex wong getty images
