donald trump is literally ordering the government to take two steps back for every step forward regulations protect the american people  there are regulations that give us clean water and clean air  regulations that keep workers safe at work with fair wages  regulations that prevent dangerous or poisonous products from being sold to consumers  regulations that keep our food safe  regulations that protect us from predatory banking  and regulations that protect endangered species  and those are just the tip of the iceberg  without regulations  companies could pollute whenever and wherever they want  our country would be a disaster  there s a reason why we have regulations but donald trump promised during his first week to kill  percent of regulations   the regulations are going to be cut massively   he said during a meeting with corporate ceos on his third full day in office last week and now he is following through by signing an executive order that requires federal agencies to kill two existing regulations for every new one created and guts funding for new regulations for the entire year according to reuters trump plans to sign an executive order on monday that will require that for every new federal regulation proposed  two must be revoked  an administration official said the order says federal agencies will propose rules they want to eliminate and the white house will review those decisions  the order sets a budget of   for new regulations in  and the administration will set a regulation budget each year basically  trump s cabinet could propose a useless regulation and then use it as an excuse to cut two crucial regulations like a food safety rule or rules that regulate pollution while there surely are regulations that could be loosened to help small business owners  waging total war against regulations and mandating that two be repealed for every new one created is completely asinine and does nothing but hurt the american people and take the country backwards again  most regulations on the books were created for a reason and need to remain to protect the environment  our health  and our lives this is not a game  but donald trump sure seems to think it is featured image via shawn thew pool getty images
