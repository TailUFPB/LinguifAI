you know all that buzz you are hearing about a  likely  hillary clinton fbi indictment  this may be the shocker of all shockers  but it s completely made up before right wing pundits popped the corks on their champagne bottles  this lie was uttered by fox news  bret baier  who claimed that  two separate sources with intimate knowledge of the fbi investigations  ha confirmed not only that the  clinton foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far  but that  there is a lot of evidence  and that the sources say it will end in  likely an indictment  this would be a bombshell revelation   if it were true  on thursday  however  baier explained that his claims were  inartful  martha maccallum  co host   the fbi sources that you spoke with suggest that an indictment is likely  that would prove   go ahead bret baier  i want to be clear   i want to be clear about this  and this was   came from a q and a that i did with brit hume after my show and after we went through everything  he asked me if  after the election  if hillary clinton wins  will this investigation continue  and i said   yes absolutely   i pressed the sources again and again what would happen  i got to the end of that and said   they have a lot of evidence that would  likely lead to an indictment   but that s not  that s inartfully answered  that s not the process  that s not how you do it  you have to have a prosecutor  if they don t move forward with a prosecutor with the doj  there would be  i m told  a very public call for an independent prosecutor to move forward  there is confidence in the evidence  but for me to phrase it like i did  of course that got picked up everywhere  but the process is different than that that s his way of saying he was lying  the next time one of your right wing friends  if you have any left at this point  parrots his ridiculous claims  show them his retraction   that their absolute best argument against hillary clinton is based on a lie watch it below featured image via screengrab
