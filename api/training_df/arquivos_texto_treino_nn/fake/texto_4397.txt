trump has been having a very  very bad week  first  he humiliated himself in front of millions of viewers in monday night s debate  then he reacted by fat shaming and slut shaming a former miss universe  just when you thought things couldn t get worse for trump  some of his tax returns were uncovered  showing that trump has likely not paid a penny in federal income tax for nearly two decades in his latest rally in lancaster  pennsylvania on saturday night  he completely lost it  several times  reverting to childish antics and mockery  this is how the washington post recapped it it took trump nearly  minutes to read the brief statement because he kept going off on one angry tangent after another   ignoring his teleprompters and accusing clinton of not being  loyal  to her husband  imitating her buckling at a memorial service last month  suggesting that she is  crazy  and saying she should be in prison  he urged his mostly white crowd of supporters to go to polling places in  certain areas  on election day to  watch  the voters there  he also repeatedly complained about having a  bum mic  at the first presidential debate and wondered if he should have done another season of  the apprentice  first  he mocked hillary clinton for having pneumonia there s nothing particularly new there  though  his favorite attack is mockery of those who dare be human  like when he mocked a disabled reporter it gets worse  though  in another part of the speech  the thrice married  serial philanderer trump accused hillary clinton of cheating on bill is that my imagination  or did his crowd actually boo him perhaps the worst part of that rally was trump s not so subtle dog whistle instructing his followers to go into black neighborhoods  certain areas  and monitor the polls for a couple weeks after trump hired campaign manager kellyanne conway  trump seemed to be following his script and he appeared to be running a more disciplined message  that discipline is not only out the window  saturday s rally proves he s far more unhinged than he s ever been  trump is not used to losing  and to borrow a term from him  he s losing  bigly  featured image via spencer platt getty images
