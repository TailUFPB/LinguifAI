the federal judge overseeing two of the three fraud cases against donald trump has advised all parties to settle  given all else that s involved   presumably  he s talking about trump s disgustingly shocking win on election day  it looked a lot like trump might actually be held accountable for his actions despite the win  but now the trial might not even take place curiel said  it would be wise for the plaintiffs  for the defendants  to look closely at trying to resolve this case given all else that s involved  he also said he d allow trump to testify via video due to his new obligations in washington  besides that  he told trump s lawyers that they could again request that specific campaign statements be withheld from both the jury and himself earlier  addicting info writer wendy gittleson reported that a lawyer believes trump could be impeached very quickly after taking office because of these lawsuits  all three suits involve charges of fraud and racketeering  the reasoning was that there s a question of whether the legal aspects involved in these cases could  rise to the level of impeachment  if they did  it would probably be goodbye trump since congress wasn t too keen on him anyway however  with curiel advising the parties involved in the suits in his court to settle  it could actually quietly go away with trump paying less than he might have otherwise  and it could remove a potential block to four years of trump in the white house earlier this month  the woman who was suing trump for rape dropped her case after receiving death threats  she had canceled a press conference  too  out of fear for her safety and life  this is the woman that accused trump of raping her when she was   and it s very  very likely she was terrorized into dropping the suit there s still a fraud case relating to trump u  pending in the new york attorney general s office  other than that  it s entirely possible that trump will  more or less  get away with a slap on the wrist for this  depending on whether the plaintiffs agree to settle and agree to whatever trump proposes as a settlement featured image by mark wilson via getty images
