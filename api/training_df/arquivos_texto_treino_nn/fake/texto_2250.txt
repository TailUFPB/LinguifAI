republicans are delusional if they really believe forgoing a new cell phone will allow poor people to afford healthcare but that s exactly what utah gop rep  jason chaffetz believes on monday  house republicans passed a monstrous bill to repeal the affordable care act which pretty much leaves  million americans out in the cold without insurance  republicans stripped subsidies away from low income americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid  the bill also wipes out the medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage  furthermore  the bill kills the insurance mandate  which guaranteed that enough americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre existing conditions  the bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds planned parenthood  which would strip low income women of the health services they need  including cancer screenings during an interview to defend his party s evil bill on tuesday morning  chaffetz actually had the gall to claim that poor people could afford health insurance if they didn t go out and purchase iphones seriously  he literally used this as an excuse to strip  million people of their health insurance  you know what  americans have choices  and they ve got to make a choice   chaffetz said   and so maybe  rather than getting that new iphone that they just love and want to go spend hundreds of dollars on  maybe they should invest in their own health care  here s the video via twitter gop rep  chaffetz  americans may need to choose between  new iphone  they just love  and investing in health care https   t co   new day   newday  march    s ignorant remarks make it clear that he doesn t know anything about the cost of healthcare  probably because his healthcare is free courtesy of american taxpayers as raw story points out  the average cost of a health insurance plan is   per month while an iphone costs just   a month with a two year payment plan in short  choosing not to buy an iphone will not do anything to help poor americans afford healthcare meanwhile  republicans like chaffetz can actually afford to buy their own health insurance because they make    a year  but they don t have to buy their own insurance because they get government healthcare along with the best hospitals all on the taxpayer dime chaffetz  and every republican who voted for this bill  is a hypocrite and they should be ashamed of themselves featured image via screenshot
