the republican party has had it rough  not only have they had to admit that their presidential candidate  donald trump  is an absolute nut job who can t do anything right  but their attempt to replace obamacare has been just as much of a failure the gop has spent several years whining and moaning about how they would like to replace obama s affordable care act  despite the fact that a majority of americans are in favor of keeping it  but once they finally had their chance to prove they could do better with trump in the white house  they blew it recently at his weekly press conference  house speaker paul ryan was asked if the house would vote on trumpcare before trump reached his first  day marker  ryan s response was nothing short of absolute defeat and despair as he admitted that the gop s horrible healthcare bill didn t have enough votes to pass  ryan said  we want to go when we re ready to go  this has been a very organic bottom up process  it takes time to do that  we re doing big things  and you know me  i talked about  days because i thought the kind of agenda we re attempting to put together here overhauling health care  overhauling the tax system  rebuilding our military  securing the border  those take more than just a few months  they take a long time  at least a year  so that s why we re working on the path to get it right  and not constrain it to some artificial deadline  what ryan gave was a lot of excuses  along with his admission that he can t pass trumpcare because there aren t enough votes to support a disastrous bill that would strip millions of americans of their life saving health insurance  it s entirely possible that the gop will never have enough votes to make trumpcare a thing  and ryan s words are just as much empty promises as trump s are you can watch ryan admit defeat below featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
