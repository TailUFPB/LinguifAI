donald trump is being graded on a curve  he always has been  as he has broken every rule in the political handbook and still managed to lie  cheat  and insult his way to the presidency  however  on tuesday night  he delivered a speech to a joint session of congress   his first  for the most part  he stuck to his prepared remarks  and he seemed to keep his attention span and his temperament in check  there were no nasty insults to the press  to democrats  or to republicans who have been critical of him  compared to the wild  unhinged antics we ve been treated to from trump since the day he launched his disgusting presidential campaign  this speech was surprisingly normal by trumpian standards  this seems to be good enough for cable news personalities at this point but  one  nevertrump conservative  charlie sykes  has news for said pundits  they are looking too hard for trump to act like a normal president   or even a normal human being   and in turn they are behaving like abused spouses  appearing on msnbc  sykes said of the punditry surrounding trump s speech  there s almost a  battered pundit syndrome  going on out there  he comes home and he s not abusive  and he s not drunk  and so we re just so incredibly grateful  it s just so incredibly good  sykes went on to remind people that trump s  new tone  is unlikely to go beyond that speech  he ll be back to his old  unruly self again in no time   just like a drunken  abusive spouse  to that end  we  the american people  need to treat him like an abuser  because that is just what he is  only on a grand scale thank you  mr  sykes  for reminding everyone just who and what trump is  splashes of seeming normalcy from him should not be treated as if the storm has passed  it will never pass with this man watch the exchange below featured image via video screen capture
