apparently  in donald trump s america  you can t even be nice to someone if your skin is darker than a piece of chalk  after he was elected  we saw a spike in hate crimes that would make anyone   especially people who already faced discrimination beforehand  nervous on sunday   that s the christmas that donald trump says he saved if you re keeping score  ijan davonte  a black transgender man  decided to show some holiday spirit by offering his seat to a woman who was entering his train car  while most would view this as an act of generosity   especially at almost midnight on christmas   stephanie pazmino decided that she was offended by someone being nice to her  i don t want to sit next to a black person   were the words that came out of her mouth  according to police  i got up anyway and said to her that she didn t have to sit next to me   said jarrett  who had just gotten done working his shift as a hair stylist   i took a seat across from her and just forgot all about it   when pazmino got up to leave the train  a simple insult became much  much worse when she began punching jarrett  it was not until later when another man rushed to his aid that he realized that pazmino had slashed his face and stabbed him in the arm with a  inch knife  she stabbed me right under my left eye  on the back of my hand and on my left arm  she was screaming and hollering the whole time   he recalled  i ran to the ticket booth to ask the attendant to call the police  she stated that she did and that i should sit down  and i passed out after that   jarrett said  he was transported to harlem hospital where he was treated and is in stable condition  according to   pazmino was arrested and charged with a hate crime jarrett says he doesn t know if he was targeted because he is transgender  as well  though the racial component is bad enough  i don t know why she did it because i didn t do anything to provoke her   jarrett says unfortunately  we re going to be seeing more of this with donald trump as president  at this point  it s safe to assume that if you are a group that regularly faces discrimination  you are in danger   always featured image via screengrab
