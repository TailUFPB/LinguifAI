the kuwaiti embassy in washington  d c   tends to book their annual national day celebration at the four seasons  and this year was supposed to be no exception  however  now this year is an exception because they ve moved it from the four seasons to trump s hotel in the old post office building  and they didn t do that on a lark a diplomatic source  who wasn t authorized to speak publicly and therefore wasn t named  told thinkprogress that the decision was political  the trump organization reportedly contacted the ambassador of kuwait and put pressure on him to move the event  they may have done the same to bahrain earlier this month apparently  there are a lot of foreign governments who are thinking of taking their business to trump s hotel as a way to curry favor with him  and trump himself seems to be refusing to completely divest himself of his businesses  could this be why  surely an upstanding citizen such as trump would never use his position as president to continue enriching himself  right  right har de har har trump s greed  along with the hotel s slow start  give him an incentive to continue being totally unethical  about a month after the hotel opened  there were many travel agents and event planners who felt the place wasn t worth the trouble it takes to plan events at fancy hotels  at the time  trump s name and brand were badly tarnished  and that was reflected in the business at the hotel  and elsewhere  too  this might be a different story if trump was sincere in his promise to divest  and focus on the issues facing america  sure  he s open to  limits  on his involvement  but he doesn t want anyone outside his family to have rights to his name  and he wants to be able to return to his company once his term as president is over there s no way for this to look good as long as trump even appears to still be involved with his businesses  there s no way for it not to look like he s trading favors for money  it won t stop with kuwait and bahrain featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
