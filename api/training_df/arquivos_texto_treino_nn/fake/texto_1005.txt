last tuesday  georgia held a special election for its atlanta house seat  which was vacated by tom price  who joined the trump administration  price won the seat in  by nearly  percent  but still  democrats were hoping that it would be a referendum on the trump administration and democrats would pull it out  they didn t  ossoff lost to anti choice  anti lgbtq  ber christian businesswoman  karen handel  the margin  though  was a slim   percent narrowing that gap by more than  percent didn t keep liberals from hand wringing and doling out blame  democrats blamed nancy pelosi  who has very little input over congressional candidates  but was nonetheless subjected to right wing misogynistic and anti gay smears  pelosi is straight but  according to right wingers  she has  san francisco values   ossoff s loss  some say  is a sign that democrats are doomed in   democrats have bad candidates and we need a new message  say others while it s true that ossoff was somewhat less than inspiring  come on  not every candidate can be barack obama or even bernie sanders   democrats  favorite hobby of self flagellation is a bit unwarranted  the turnout numbers are in and they are one of the most encouraging numbers we ve seen in years one of the arguments of doom and gloom include the fact that ossoff got nearly the same vote as hillary clinton  which somehow must mean that absolutely nothing has changed in the  plus days trump has been in office  while that statistic  in a vacuum  is quite discouraging  it s apples and oranges  special elections tend to have very low turnouts  democrats tend to have the lowest turnouts   partly because of voter suppression  which georgia had in spades  and partly because we re lazy  we cynically refuse to vote for candidates who are less than perfect and we re generally disengaged in georgia  though  democrats had the largest off year election turnout in over a decade  it even broke recent mid term records  which is pretty amazing for a special election the records indicate that past democratic primary voters turned out at nearly the same rate as past republican primary voters  primary vote history is the most readily available measure of partisanship in a state without party registration  like georgia  over all   percent of voters who last voted in a democratic primary turned out in the second round of voting  compared with  percent of those who last voted in a republican primary  the turnout rate among voters who have never voted in a primary was  percent this might not sound like a great democratic turnout  but it is pretty rare for the democratic turnout rate to roughly match the republican turnout rate  at least in a high turnout election  certainly  that s been true in georgia s sixth  in   republican primary voters turned out at an eight point higher rate than democratic primary voters did   percent to  percent  in the  election  it was a three point gap   percent to  percent source  washington postthat trend isn t just in georgia either  percentage of democratic turnout is rivaling republican turnout in all the special elections no  we have not had good luck in the special elections  but all of them have been in heavily red districts  do you really think paul ryan would let trump take one of his congressmen if he didn t think republicans would hold on to that seat  we were supposed to lose that election  it s republicans who should be sweating because as the numbers prove  democratic mobilization is working  just wait till there s an election in a competitive district featured image via joe readle getty images
