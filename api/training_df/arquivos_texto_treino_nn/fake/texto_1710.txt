it s time for sean hannity to join bill o reilly in the unemployment line on saturday  the new york times published an article reporting that donald trump gets policy advise from sean hannity among many others outside the white house  sean hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core republican issues is crucial presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points  but mr  trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like mr  hannity who also serve as advisers  mr  hannity  the fox news host  defends mr  trump s most controversial behavior in public  but privately  according to people close to mr  trump  he urges the president not to get distracted  and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the affordable care act  indeed  hannity served as trump s chief propagandist during the  campaign and often did interviews with hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment of course  hannity had a complete meltdown on twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the new york times of  colluding  with hillary clinton and referred to them as  fake news   which is something trump would do  nytimes you colluded with hrc in   it s none of your business who i do or do not talk too  total fake news speculation about me  potus  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    even accused the times of spying on his private conversations  nytimes any conversation i have with anyone is supposed to be private  i have never talked to you  was i surveilled and unmasked by u nsa   sean hannity   seanhannity  april    s when several new york times writers jumped in to defend their publication maggie haberman fired back by informing hannity that sourced cited him as a person trump talks to for advise and further informed hannity that fox news did not object to the story when the new york times reached out to the network w all due respect  we were interested in who potus talks to  not you  and several ppl close to him cited you https   t co   maggie haberman   maggienyt  april    reached out to fox news pr  who took no issue w it  and it was hardly critical of you  not sure why the reax https   t co   maggie haberman   maggienyt  april    then claimed that he doesn t talk to the new york times and said that he doubts trump does either the  nytimes has no clue who i talk to as i refuse to ever talk to them   potus knows you are fake news and i doubt he talks to u either   sean hannity   seanhannity  april    he s wrong  it turns out trump has done two in depth interviews with the new york times in the last month then glenn thrush chimed in i was once sitting with a republican elected official preparing for an interview when he got an email from u giving him political advice https   t co   glenn thrush   glennthrush  april     hannity forgot about that  he also forgot that he has  indeed  spoken with the new york times and nick corasaniti was kind enough to provide a link to the interview here s an interview i did with sean last year  https   t co  https   t co qznfgnxsmi  nick corasaniti   nytnickc  april     that has to be embarrassing anyway  the night passed and hannity was apparently still pissed off so he imploded on sunday morning in a series of tweets directed at the trio of writers maggie have you ever publicly commented on how  wikileaks revealed the  nytimes colluded with hrc  and then hired  glennthrush also exposed https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april     why should people ever accept  several people close to him  as a source  especially when you never contacted me  did you ask  potus https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april    several people close to him  everyone knows people at every wh and every corp  have agendas and leak  maybe a new standard   on the record  https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april    critical of me  but  nytimes has a  biased anti trump  agenda  and by suggesting  potus takes advice from me  is meant to diminish him  https   t co vxonrckzux  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    the campaign i can confirm i and   others suggested he stop tweeting  he never did  he is his own man  in retrospect i now agree  https   t co vxonrckzux  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    nick  i did talk you  frankly one of the few times the  nytimes was fair to me at some point i decided the  nytimes is fake news gave up https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april    that s called  humor   i don t believe the  nytimes surveilled me  but i am happy people at the  nytimes believe in the lord  amen  https   t co ocrvoxvsvz  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    krm is brilliant and successful  but he also runs fnc  hated by  nytimes  and according to  nytimes yesterday he is old school on issues https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april     anonymous sources  should be taken with a grain of salt  people might manipulate say the  nytimes by offering such quotes  we agree   https   t co hghqjfatgk  sean hannity   seanhannity  april    highlight of your career   best sean https   t co   sean hannity   seanhannity  april     fox news should ditch sean hannity as well  he has far too many embarrassing meltdowns in public featured image  joe raedle getty images
