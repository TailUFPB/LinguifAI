while trump says he s  like  a smart person   and so doesn t need the president s daily intelligence briefings  he s taking security and intelligence briefings from spy agencies from other countries  in this case  he actually got a secret briefing from one of israel s spy chiefs  yossi cohen  director of the mossad  the mossad is israel s top intelligence agency  analogous to the cia in many ways  and none other than benjamin netanyahu organized this secret meeting with trump and his people as if that wasn t suspicious enough  the meeting included discussions of the iran nuclear deal  which israel claims is a clear and present threat to its existence  along with discussions of syria s civil war and terrorism this is all stuff he could and should be getting from our own intelligence officials  but he s alienated our intelligence community twice now   first by shunning briefings  and second by insulting the cia after they said they were confident that russia hacked our election to help trump win it s quite clear that he looks upon our intelligence community with severe disdain  that s problematic  because if he s planning on getting a lot of intelligence this way  then it s also clear that he doesn t realize these foreign envoys don t have our best interests at heart  they have their own  and they will take advantage of him this way if they can when it comes to the russian hacking scandal  trump is getting most of his intel from military generals who probably don t have the complex knowledge of digital espionage that trump needs to be able to put a solid cybersecurity plan forward  so it wouldn t be surprising to find that he s getting more intelligence briefings from more sources  like this secret one from the mossad  what s worse is wondering what role trump s ego played here  it wouldn t be surprising to find out that trump took that meeting more because it made him feel special  and less because it was something he truly believes in  for reference  the mossad secretly helped supply iran with weapons in their war against iraq as part of the iran contra affair that embroiled president reagan s administration in a deep scandal  now they re reaching out to our president elect not just for help with iran and syria  but also for help with palestine  as netanyahu has said in the past  israel must occupy all the land for the foreseeable future  they see this as essential to their security  it s actually essential to their expansion  but they d never say that  israel also wants trump to stand against obama on a u n  resolution that israel and its supporters see as advocating pro palestinian rights the horror it s just terrible when someone wants equal rights   a  problem  with which we here in the u s  have some experience  and obama is expected to speak out in support of this resolution and of restarting peace talks between israel and palestine trump has tapped his own bankruptcy lawyer  david friedman  as the u s  ambassador to israel  friedman a hardliner who doesn t believe in a two state solution and wants to declare israel s settlements in the west bank legal  no wonder israel sent a secret envoy to meet with trump regardless  trump needs to get his intelligence briefings on these subjects from u s  intelligence officials  because he needs to see these things from our point of view  israel isn t thinking about us  they re thinking about themselves  and could seriously undermine any efforts we re making in the middle east  this meeting was for them  not for us  if this is how trump plans on getting intelligence  then we re in a lot of trouble featured image by drew angerer via getty images
