cnn is now reporting that  after months of confusion over the scope of the investigation into russian election interference  the irs is now working with special counsel robert mueller and his team  the irs had previously also balked at the no knock raid on former trump campaign chairman paul manafort s home at the beginning of august those concerns are clearly resolved at this point  as the independent government tax agency is now voluntarily sharing information with mueller s squad mueller and the irs worked jointly with the treasury department to come to an agreement over the matter  which was in question because of the specifics of assistant attorney general rod rosenstein s written order for the special counsel  which allowed for mueller to look into  any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation   mueller s interpretation of that order included years of tax filings  as possible evidence of financial crimes according to cnn  the irs had already been working with the fbi on a probe of manafort before the election  sending criminal investigators to look into potential tax evasion and money laundering  the irs is also sharing information with mueller about michael flynn  although it is uncertain if flynn was being investigated for anything similar prior to november to be perfectly clear  the irs s previous objections to the manafort raid were not over its propriety  but whether or not it would interfere with their own investigation of manafort  whose dealings with former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych made him suspect in almost every way back here on american soil  irs agents declined to participate in the raid  which mueller elected to go ahead with using only fbi agents for assistance  once inside  the team gathered up tax and other financial documents  which have since prompted mueller s team to warn manafort that they intend to charge him with tax and financial crimes all of this  of course  brings back the question of whether or not robert mueller will have   or whether he already does have   access to donald trump s tax returns  there is little doubt that if the investigation turns up evidence of financial crimes committed by either manafort or flynn  the next logical place to look for evidence of collusion is in trump s own returns and that  ladies and gentlemen  is the last thing donald trump wants featured image via andrew burton getty images
