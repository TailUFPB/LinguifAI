on his  day in office  a listless donald trump sat down with reuters to talk about his accomplishments  as fate would have it  trump had just been told that two servicemembers had been killed in an anti isis raid in afghanistan  his re re remade healthcare bill was dead on arrival  and his plans to build a wall were going up in flames  but he had other things on his mind  for donald trump  every day is november    to the three reporters  trump passed out a printed picture of the united states  with counties he won in the election colored in red more than five months after his victory and two days shy of the  day mark of his presidency  the election is still on trump s mind  midway through a discussion about chinese president xi jinping  the president paused to hand out copies of what he said were the latest figures from the  electoral map  here  you can take that  that s the final map of the numbers   the republican president said from his desk in the oval office  handing out maps of the united states with areas he won marked in red   it s pretty good  right  the red is obviously us  later he posed for photos  insisting on holding up the map   note  trump s white house photographer  who formerly worked in the bush white house  likes to take pictures of trump from really far away  it s unclear exactly why  so this happened today  pic twitter com uqtgvoyirj  salenazito   salenazito  april    s a pic from reuters of trump with the electoral maps he showed to reporters yesterday pic twitter com   gideon resnick   gideonresnick  april    jeff mason recounted the surreal moment the president of the united states interrupted questions on north korea and china to brag about a map of the election he had won more than  months earlier  his expressions cycle from disbelief to pity to humor and back to disbelief cnn s chris cuomo asked the reporters the obvious question  is trump really so insecure that he still feels he has to prove that he won the election  mason said it could be a lot of factors  all troubling from a mental health standpoint   i think that s a good question and it s hard for me to answer that  i think he just wanted to relish in the fact that this map  uh  looks good for him and he said  the red is obviously us  and the red are areas in the country that he won  so he s just very proud of it  and whether that s rooted in a sense that he still has to prove that he won or that he s upset that the media got it wrong in terms of the predictions ahead of time it s hard for me to say  trump  a  year old billionaire  craves the attention one might give a child for a project they made in art class  he may as well have asked the reporters to pin the map up on their refrigerator doors making it even more clear that trump is suddenly feeling very small  he later admitted that being president is really hard  and it s not as fun as his old life  the fact that running the country wouldn t be as easy as being a semi retired billionaire and reality tv show host was something that apparently never occurred to trump prior to being elected  i loved my previous life  i had so many things going  this is more work than in my previous life  i thought it would be easier  at least he s got his map featured image via cnn
