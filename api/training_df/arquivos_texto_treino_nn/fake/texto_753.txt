it s tough sometimes to imagine that donald trump has five children since it s clear from monday s speech in front of   boy scouts and other attendees at the boy scouts jamboree in west virginia that he has absolutely no idea what kind of talk is appropriate for children while most adults would take this opportunity to offer some pearls of adult wisdom or cheerlead the boy scouts toward their futures  trump chose to deliver a tirade of trumpisms like almost any time trump has tried to string together more than a couple of words at a time  most of his speech was an inarticulate mess which consisted of his trademark whining  a wee bit of swearing and a pointless anecdote about a burned out rich guy at a cocktail party in a string of what we might want to call trump s greatest hits  toward the very beginning of his speech  he insulted president obama and said he didn t want to talk about politics   who the hell wants to talk about politics when i m in front of the boy scouts   trump asked  but the answer  apparently  was donald trump  he talked about a lot of politics trump  to kids at scout jamboree   who the hell wants to speak about politics when i m in front of the boy scouts   https   t co   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  july    by the way  just a question  did president obama ever come to a jamboree   he asked as the crowd of scouts  scoutmasters  and various other adults gathered in west virginia yelled the word  no  the answer is no   trump continued   but we ll be back    obama did address a  anniversary scouting event in  by video  source  usa todaypresident obama did not attend in person out of protest for the boy scouts  policy of not admitting gay scouts  that policy has since changed trump talked about killing obamacare and said he was going to fire secretary of health and human services tom price if that didn t happen at boy scouts jamboree  trump jokes about firing his hhs secretary if he doesn t get the votes for health care bill https   t co   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  july    also regaled the audience of people who are mostly too young to drink with a story of a friend of his at a cocktail party trump tells kids at boy scout jamboree about his friend who got tired of yachting  lost his      a ny cocktail party https   t co vbnrcrvpgb  bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  july    also whined about loyalty  or his perceived lack of it naturally  trump complained about the  fake media   he said me might re name washington  d c  a  cesspool   instead of a  swamp  after hearing that speech  or the snippets  it was obvious that trump had no idea he wasn t at one of his campaign rallies  if this is an example of how he speaks to children  it explains a lot about his children featured image via drew angerer getty images
