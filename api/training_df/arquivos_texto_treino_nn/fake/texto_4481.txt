in discussing shootings and crime in the first of three presidential debates  donald trump not only greatly exaggerated the number of shootings in chicago  and claimed that stop and frisk was both constitutional and effective  he also advocated taking guns away from people without due process  of course  he thinks that the police would only take guns away from criminals  and that the constitution is different for criminals  but everyone has a constitutional right to due process  doesn t matter to trump  though  we have to take guns away from bad people that shouldn t have them  those were trump s words in the debate  where he defended stop and frisk as constitutional despite the fact that it was literally ruled otherwise  and has also been deemed ineffective  how the nra can possibly support a candidate that would take guns away from anybody at all without due process is beyond us  that s especially true given the fact that this isn t the first time trump has said this   proactive  and if they see a person possibly with a gun or they think they have a gun  they will see the person and they ll look and they ll take the gun away  they ll stop  they ll frisk and they ll take the gun away  and they won t have anything to shoot with  the  amendment cannot exist without due process  the nra is literally supporting a candidate who would take guns away from law abiding citizens  literally featured image by drew angerer getty images
