cnn host poppy harlow absolutely humiliated a republican supporter of donald trump for lying about the muslim ban that trump ordered on friday the immigration ban is currently causing chaos in the united states and around the world  and has been condemned by leaders across the globe  but trump and his supporters insist that the executive order is working and keeping americans safe from terrorism during an appearance on cnn to defend the ban  former gop rep  jack kingston repeatedly made claims that harlow fact checked on the air  and it didn t go well for the congressman  what data can you point to that justifies that these seven nations have a tie to u s  terror attacks or a higher incidence of bringing terror to this country   harlow asked kingston  of course  blamed the nations  including iraq  syria  iran  libya  yemen  sudan  and somalia  for forcing trump s hand because they supposedly don t love america  which is somehow part of the criteria now for who we have dealings with  i think maybe the idea that i would say  the evidence is that the countries themselves don t really have a standard that would preclude enemies of the united states from emigrating here  these are not countries that are known to love the united states of america  but that doesn t explain why countries like russia  which launched cyberattacks against the united states during the  election  is not on the list  and harlow made sure she asked  so you say these are not countries that love the united states and therefore this is justified  so  what about russia  kingston tried to spin that by claiming that sudan is a bigger threat to america than russia  well  i think in russia   you know  there s a lot of other islamic countries and other countries that aren t always fond of america  but i don t think you have necessarily the concerns and the vigilance that you need if you re talking about sudan  after harlow explained that emigrating into this country is a difficult and complicated process  she dropped the hammer on kingston with a single question  congressman  can you point to a single terrorist attack in this country that was carried out by a syrian refugee  i think you could look at dhs records and see that refugees in general have often been the cloak under which terrorists do move from country to country   kingston replied   and we do not know who s coming in to our country  harlow countered kingston s bullshit by asking the question again  but congressman  i asked if you could point to an event that you feel justifies this ban  that has endangered or killed american people  this time  kingston replied by naming places where mass shootings have taken place  including ft  hood  orlando  and san bernardino  as well as terrorist attacks in europe and other parts of the world harlow called out kingston for making  unfactual  claims  and proceeded to inform kingston that all the shooters who committed massacres in those american cities were all american citizens who were born here  and none of them  including those who committed terrorist attacks in europe  were syrian refugees here s the video via youtube in fact  no citizens from any of the countries listed in trump s ban have ever murdered an american on our own soil  however  there are nations trump left off the list that are at least partly responsible for the murders of thousands of americans  including saudi arabia  which helped fund the   attacks and was the nation from which most of the attackers came  tomkingtk pic twitter com   rafael esteban   rafaelesteban  january    bottom line is that trump and his supporters are lying about the muslim ban  and as long as the media does what poppy harlow did  they ll nail them for it in real time instead of letting them get away with lying on the air only to call them out later  because at this time  catching them later is too late featured image via screen capture from embedded video
