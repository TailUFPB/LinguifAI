donald trump is clearly a threat to our national security and our intelligence agents know it in order to keep america safe  american spies are now withholding intelligence from the white house because they don t want the russians to know what we know throughout the campaign  trump openly praised vladimir putin  who now has a puppet in the white house after helping trump win the election and trump has been friendly with putin ever since  refusing to believe our intelligence agencies who all agree that russia hacked our political system and interfered with our election process because trump trusts russia so much  our intelligence agents do not trust trump and certainly do not want to give him sensitive information that could end up in russian hands  our intelligence community is so worried by the unprecedented problems of the trump administration   not only do senior officials possess troubling ties to the kremlin  there are nagging questions about basic competence regarding team trump   that it is beginning to withhold intelligence from a white house which our spies do not trust   nsa analyst jack r  schindler reported for the new york observer most frighteningly  a pentagon official told schindler that  the kremlin has ears inside  the white house situation room that means the russians are privy to america s most guarded secrets  and the official lamented that  there s not much the russians don t know at this point  that is absolutely terrifying and demonstrates clearly why donald trump and his entire administration need to be removed from office immediately before all is lost we are talking about critical intel that could prevent nuclear war or give the united states a heads up about what russia is up to  if the russians find out we know something about them because trump gets the intel and discusses it in the situation room or with one of his team members who have cozy dealings with putin  the united states would lose the advantage and as russia prepares for war against europe  it has never been more important that the white house get the intelligence it needs  the problem is that trump is inept and in league with putin  so how does the united states military respond to russian aggression if the so called  commander in chief  is nothing more than putin s puppet  by making putin aware of the information we have  trump would be putting our troops in danger as the intel becomes useless  none of this has happened in washington before   schindler wrote   a white house with unsettling links to moscow wasn t something anybody in the pentagon or the intelligence community even considered a possibility until a few months ago  until team trump clarifies its strange relationship with the kremlin  and starts working on its professional honesty  the ic will approach the administration with caution and concern  it s time for donald trump and his administration to be removed from power  the security and future of the united states is at stake  and as long as trump is in office the country is less safe than ever before photo of donald trump by joe raedle getty images  photo of vladimir putin by thierry chesnot getty images
