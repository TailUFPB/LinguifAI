with reince priebus out as white house chief of staff  and general john kelly in  trump and others are probably hoping that things will quickly fall in line  but kelly doesn t see his biggest job as managing the white house staff   he sees it as managing donald trump  specifically  one of his biggest jobs  in his view  is controlling trump s twitter habit trump uses his twitter account to tweet everything from childish temper tantrums over the russia probe and  fake news   to lying in order to appear totally great and awesome and like he s the best person ever to walk the earth  to creating actual policy  the most recent example of his problems with creating policy on social media is when he tried to reinstate the military s ban on transgender people serving via twitter  catching the pentagon off guard despite his lie that he d come to that decision after heavy consultation with his military generals  in fact  lawyers from the department of defense had repeatedly tried to warn him off that ban while they worked on the best way to do things  apparently  he was impatient and thought he would force the dod to work faster if he just came out with it he s also insulted our allies and made blatantly false accusations on twitter  despite that  sean spicer said back in early june that trump s tweets are official white house statements  some say that trump is blurring the lines between opinion and policy whether he s making official statements or not and this is what general kelly sees as his biggest job   reining this kind of behavior  or at least  pushing his tweets in the right direction   as it was put to politico  kelly has given up on trying to keep trump off of twitter entirely  but he does believe he should work to keep trump from using twitter like a spoiled rotten toddler who s mad that he s not getting his way on everything in other words  his biggest job is taking on the role of parent or babysitter working to limit what a poorly behaved child can do  and he s taking on this role for a  year old man baby kelly wants to know what trump is going to tweet before he tweets it  he wants to put a system in place where aides and advisers don t find out about policy decisions via twitter  but trump s worst  most frustrated  and most damaging tweets often come late at night or early in the morning   times kelly says he can t monitor  so he s got his work cut out for him if he thinks he can rein in trump s tweeting featured image via chris kleponis pool getty images
