it s gotten to the point where if donald trump doesn t fire sean spicer for his egregious remarks about the holocaust  assad and syria  he should be seen as agreeing with spicer s sentiment as well as condoning it it s disgusting  to say the least  and the legendary dan rather just released a statement that should summarize what every person with a decent moral compass is thinking right now rather wrote  it is with sadness that i do not know where to begin  today in a briefing  white house press secretary sean spicer issued a statement that is so far beyond the pale  so tone deaf and blind to history and our precarious moment in world affairs  that it is with only a heavy heart that i even bring attention to it  there can be no joy in such incompetence in trying to make the case for the administration s policy in syria and vis a vis russia which is confused to be generous  and wildly chaotic to be more precise  mr  spicer said   we didn t use chemical weapons in world war ii  you know  you had someone as despicable as hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons   he continued   so you have to  if you are russia  ask yourself  is this a country and a regime that you want to align yourself with   when asked to clarify  mr  spicer said   i think when you come to sarin gas  he  hitler  was not using the gas on his own people the same way that assad is doing   mr  spicer went on to mention  holocaust centers   in an apparent reference to the nazi concentration camps this line of rhetoric is so unhinged  so amateurish  so lacking in the context and perspective necessary for statesmanship and diplomacy that i do not see how mr  spicer can be allowed to continue in his current position  but in the end  this is less about him and more about an administration that is inserting itself in a civil war and now is plunging into a drastic reformulation of american foreign policy without any clear sense that they have a plan  when you try to explain such a situation  it is understandable that your words don t make sense a bar  already set low  continues to drop  if trump doesn t fire spicer then he is fully condoning holocaust denial within his administration  this shouldn t only outrage america  but cause a massive resistance against the current administration that has never been seen before  this must not be condoned or accepted  it is not okay featured photo by kirk irwin getty images for siriusxm
