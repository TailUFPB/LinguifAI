if you re on medicare or close to qualifying for medicare and you voted for donald trump  you re a special kind of stupid who just got screwed house speaker paul ryan can t wait for rubber stamp puppet donald trump to take over the white house he and his fellow republicans have waited for years to throw hard working americans off a cliff and now they are about to get what they always wanted the gop has hated medicare since president lyndon johnson signed the program into law in   medicare is a single payer system that americans pay into every time they get a paycheck  and when they turn  they can enroll and get a large part of their healthcare coverage taken care of by the federal government  over  million americans currently rely on medicare  the program is fiscally solvent through  and a simple way to make it infinitely solvent would be to apply the payroll tax to all income over    but none of those facts matter to trump and the republicans in congress you see  they want to privatize the program  which is code for giving it to wall street  and as we all know  wall street isn t exactly the best place to keep our money  if president bush had privatized social security  something republicans also want to do while trump is in charge  the recession would have wiped out the funds and millions of senior citizens would have been left in dire straits but trump minion kellyanne conway told pbs on tuesday that trump is willing to consider ryan s plan to dismantle medicare  president elect trump has made very clear that he wants to make good on the promises that we as a nation have made to the seniors who rely upon medicare  and certainly the lower income americans who rely upon medicaid and other entitlements like social security  frankly  for those who receive that   she claimed ryan s plan however would raise the the retirement age of medicare and turn it into a voucher system that won t be guaranteed like the system that we have now  he will  i m sure  take a look at speaker ryan s proposal and other proposals   conway continued   in this case  he will go ahead and look at alternatives as long as it does not interfere with what he has said  his commitment to keep the promises to those currently relying on them  here s the video via pbs  the medicare remarks are at the   mark trump is already backing away from just about every campaign promise he has made and medicare is no different according to talking points memo during the campaign trump had vowed that he was  not going to cut medicare or medicaid   now  his transition website states that he will  modernize  medicare   so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the baby boom generation   and beyond  and  aximize flexibility for states  in administering medicaid  in other words  gutting medicare and handing what s left to wall street is on the table  and if republicans have their way the program will be dead within the next four years that means every senior citizen who relies on medicare for their healthcare needs should start preparing for the higher costs  less care  and less government oversight that comes with handing large government programs that work to vultures  and while seniors may get a half assed version of medicare  anyone else who hasn t reached retirement will get nothing but a voucher that isn t worth shit frankly  if you are a senior citizen or a worker who has paid into medicare in hopes that it will be there for you when you need it  you re out of luck  and if you voted for donald trump and the gop  you deserve the reaming you are about to receive featured image  mark wilson getty images
