things started to fall apart faster than ever just hours before donald trump would face off against hillary clinton in the final presidential debate as everyone geared up and prepared for one of the most monumental moments of this election cycle  ivanka trump was stuck trying to defend her father s ridiculous whiney complaints at the fortune most powerful women summit this afternoon  while the event was certainly not focused on trump  he would undoubtedly come up in conversation  as america has never had a candidate that hates and disrespects women to the degree that trump has however  it seems that even ivanka may be fed up with defending her father s outrageous acts and comments  when ivanka was questioned about her father s insistence that this election has been rigged against him  ivanka refused to back up his claims and instead tried to pivot the conversation away from the donald s voter fraud conspiracy  instead  trump s favorite  and most lusted after  daughter avoided the question and said  i will tell you that the media has been vicious  ivanka then went into a cringe worthy rant about how the media s reports weren t  fair and fact checked  and that trump s campaign has been held to  a different level  than what is normally allowed  did she mean a much lower level   as her embarrassing response dragged on  ivanka also tried to insist that somehow her father s campaign hasn t permanently ruined the trump brand  which is pretty preposterous  while trump may have attracted racists  misogynists and white power advocates  the majority of america is appalled by trump and his views and this will undoubtedly be reflected in the future of trump s businesses  you can watch ivanka try to get out of answering the trump question below poor ivanka  always being forced to clean up the messes of daddy dearest  trump has destroyed everything his family built during this election  and we won t be surprised if they also abandon him   along with the majority of americans   in november featured image via joe scarnici   getty images
