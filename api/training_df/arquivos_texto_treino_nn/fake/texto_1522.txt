it s interesting that donald trump  in his letter terminating fbi director james comey  noted that mr  comey had allegedly told the president  on three separate occasions that he is not being investigated for two reasons  the fbi admitted in a legal filing recently that they are  indeed  directly investigating donald trump s public plea for russia to hack his opponents  and another little tidbit of information that surfaced in a wall street journal report   comey did indeed suspect collusion  in fact  there is evidence while trump  who has said that comey did hillary clinton a huge favor in not charging her for crimes she did not commit  claims that the firing was because of how oh so terribly unfair the former director was to his former opponent  the same one he asked russia to hack   cnn reports that the firing was because comey refused to provide trump with an assurance of personal loyalty and because the investigation was  accelerating   comey had requested additional funds for the investigation just before he was terminated  the wsj reports that at the time of his firing  contrary to trump s assertion  comey had become increasingly concerned to the point of requesting daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation mr  comey started receiving daily instead of weekly updates on the investigation  beginning at least three weeks ago  according to people with knowledge of the matter and the progress of the federal bureau of investigation probe  mr  comey was concerned by information showing possible evidence of collusion  according to these people white house officials said wednesday that mr  trump had for months been contemplating the possibility of removing mr  comey  and that the dismissal this week wasn t connected to the russian probe comey had been asked by lawmakers to  accelerate  the investigation  according to the wsj  and had briefed them on monday on his plan to do so   yes  right before he was fired donald trump is getting worried  recently  he changed his twitter header to a quote of one of his own tweets  that tweet was a lie claiming that james clapper had confirmed that there was  no evidence  to support claims of collusion the investigation is heating up  subpoenas have been issued  and every animal   even especially stupid  especially orange ones   can sense its end featured image via getty images  pool
