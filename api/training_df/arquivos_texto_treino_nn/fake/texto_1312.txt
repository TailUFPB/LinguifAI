a new politico morning consult poll is out  and it shows that trump s approval rating among registered voters is continuing to occupy the dregs of presidential approval ratings  it was conducted during his allegedly successful foreign trip  showing that pretending to be presidential by traveling abroad for conferences and summits didn t serve to impress voters what s worse  better    though  is the number of people who want him impeached  that number jumped five points over the last week  one week ago  only  percent of voters wanted to see him impeached  morning consult s founder and chief researcher  kyle dropp  says  if president trump was hoping his foreign trip would shift the conversation away from scandals  he may be out of luck  over the last week  support for beginning impeachment proceedings among voters rose from  percent to  percent  while it s true that most democrats want to see trump impeached  and most republicans don t want to see him impeached  the fact that this number is rising shows just how growing segments of america view trump as unfit to serve  in fact  of those who want trump impeached  a majority see trump as  unfit to serve and should be removed from office  regardless of whether he committed an impeachable offense or not  trump went to europe and made complete fools out of us by calling germany  bad  very bad   and threatening to cut off german cars  despite the fact that most german cars sold here are built here  he literally shoved montenegro s prime minister out of his way  he scolded our nato allies like a bunch of children over something he does not understand  and he s withdrawing us from the paris climate agreement couple that with his ongoing obsession with the media including continuing to call them  the enemy  because they keep calling him out on his stupidity and his lies and his sheer comfort with being a lying ignoramus on the world stage  and yes  he s wholly unfit to serve congress probably won t bow to any political pressure on this  trump s list of impeachable offenses  like obstructing an official investigation a la richard nixon  has to be extensive and inexcusable for the gop controlled congress to draw up articles of impeachment  but when they find themselves backed into that corner  they ll have to listen to the growing public outcry this poll demonstrates featured image by aaron p  bernstein via getty images
