rudy giuliani not only insulted the intelligence of americans who pay their taxes every year like good citizens are supposed to do  he insulted women  too during an appearance on abc s this week  the former nyc mayor responded to the bombshell new york times report that trump avoided paying federal income taxes for nearly two decades by calling him a  genius   while suggesting that hillary clinton is a stupid woman because she paid her fair share  absolute genius   giuliani told george stephanopoulos before going on to excuse trump s failure to contribute to the general welfare of this country  the man  in the art of the deal this is described  first of all we are talking about  years ago  perfectly legal  we should get that straight immediately  it s a perfectly legal application of the tax code and he would have been a fool not to take advantage of it  not only that  but he would have probably breached his fiduciary duty to his investors  to his business  you have an obligation when you run a business to maximize the profits and if there is a tax law that says i can deduct this  you deduct it  if you fail to deduct it  people can sue you  your investors can sue you  giuliani seemed to think that trump only wrote off a    million loss on his taxes in   but stephanopoulos had to inform him that he actually wrote off   million nevertheless  giuliani had no problem with that either and claimed that trump not paying his taxes is a good thing that makes him the most qualified for the presidency  but he began by bragging about how much money trump makes now  and it turns out trump could have paid off his losses in under a couple years but chose to let taxpayers foot the bill instead    million  well  last year for example he made   million  so if he had one year in which he made   billion  he would have wiped it out the last  one year  so it s unlikely that it carried forward with  years  that is the amount of income he was making  second  every great man has had failures and the art of the deal  he explains it  churchill was thrown out of office twice  steve jobs was fired from apple and had nothing  the reality is  this man   years ago  had some failures and then he built an empire  i would like that working for me for the united states  oh  but giuliani didn t shut up after that  he had to insult hillary clinton and women everywhere according to giuliani  trump should be president because hillary clinton is a stupid woman for actually doing her civic duty by paying taxes  this a genius that had to take advantage of legal remedies that can help your company survive and grow  i want a man who is genius for figuring out how to take this country  moving in the wrong direction  where we have had a basically jobless recovery  where we ve had a growth of less than  percent for two years  that is pathetic  don t you think a man who has this kind of economic genius is a lot better for the united states than a woman and the only thing she has ever produced is a lot of work for the fbi checking out her emails  stephanopoulos would go on to hit giuliani with trump s past hypocrisy because the republican nominee has whined about the conservative talking point that  percent of americans don t pay income taxes and has complained about  hedge fund guys getting away with murder  by not paying taxes here s the video via media matters donald trump is a complete fraud who lies to the american people  he is coward for not releasing his tax returns and now we know why he doesn t want to release them  because they would destroy his campaign and republicans know it the fact is that while hillary clinton released her tax returns to the public and revealed that she actually pays her taxes  donald trump is enjoying all of the benefits of our society without contributing to the revenues that pay for them  that s unfair and un american and he should not be rewarded for it featured image via screenshot
