unable to spew her lies and excuses on cnn  kellyanne conway appeared on fox news instead on sunday to defend her  bowling green massacre  remarks and lash out at her critics during an interview with chris matthews on msnbc last week  conway referenced an investigation that occurred during the obama administration in order to donald trump s unconstitutional muslim ban that he signed over a week ago and caused worldwide chaos ever since conway claimed that president obama banned immigration from iraq for six months after two iraqi immigrants were caught plotting a terrorist attack and were arrested in bowling green  kentucky  i bet it s brand new information to people that president obama had a  month ban on the iraqi refugee program after two iraqis came here to this country  were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the bowling green massacre  it didn t get covered  donald trump used the same claim to defend his ban however  politifact pointed out that trump s claim that his ban is the same is a lie trump said   my policy is similar to what president obama did in  when he banned visas for refugees from iraq for six months  the obama administration in  delayed processing iraqi refugees for six months following evidence of a failed plot by two iraqi refugees trump s executive order temporarily bars travel to the united states for all citizens from seven countries  and it is not in direct response to actions from citizens of those countries furthermore  iraqi refugees were nonetheless admitted to the united states during the  suspension while trump has put an indefinite ban on syrian refugees we rate trump s claim mostly false so conway just got busted for lying  and she proceeded to lie more during her interview on fox  they re masterminds  i had said that before   conway said   i should have said plot or i should have just called them terrorists  i clarified immediately  i should have said terrorists and not massacre  i m sure it will live on for a week  first of all  switching words would make conway s statement to chris matthews make even less sense  they were the masterminds behind the bowling green terrorists   is how it would read second  conway did not  immediately  correct her own claim  she waited  hours and by the time she corrected herself  her comments were all over the news  she literally made up a fake terrorist attack to justify trump s travel ban conway called her critics  haters  and complained that she only misspoke by one word  i misspoke one word  the corrections in the newspapers that are attacking me are three paragraphs long every day  seriously  and trump supporters think liberals are  snowflakes  kellyanne conway s skin is just as thin as trump s featured image via yana paskova getty images
