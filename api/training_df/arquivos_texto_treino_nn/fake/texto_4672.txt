wikileaks  which is more a conspiracy enterprise than it is a whistleblowing watchdog these days  put up a poll on twitter that asked users to tell them which health issue they thought was causing hillary s coughing fits and  unusual body movements   all four of their answers have been bandied about by conservatives everywhere  as they try and diagnose hillary in a frantic attempt to prove she s unfit to be president they ve since deleted the poll and put a tweet in its place that s supposed to be a sort of retraction and apology  or as close as wikileaks will ever get to admitting they royally screwed up  however  the internet is keeping the poll and publishing it everywhere they can  buzzfeed s andrew kaczynski republished a screencap of it while needling wikileaks about transparency  since that s what wikileaks was supposed to be about before they turned into conspiracy theorists with a hate on for hillary   wikileaks deleted their tweet  obviously in the nature of openness   transparency i have preserved it right here  pic twitter com   andrew kaczynski   buzzfeedandrew  september     apparently didn t like the flack they were catching for that poll  though  and tweeted out their non apology accordingly  we removed our earlier poll on what people perceive are the reasons for clinton s medical issues as the possibilities are too speculative   wikileaks   wikileaks  september    should know that poll is never going to die  though  and their non apology is almost as insulting as the poll  they revel in this kind of thing  along with the backlash involved   in fact  they have yet to remove the credit card information of dnc donors from their collection of the hacked emails  despite the outrage over that hillary left the   event she was attending early and appeared to collapse before being helped into a van  her campaign later revealed that she d been diagnosed with pneumonia  and that she was overheated and dehydrated  which can happen when someone s sick and in the sun  her doctor later said that she was recovering nicely from this episode seeing as how a lot of people have completely forgotten  here s a little reminder that this isn t unprecedented  in   george w  bush passed out in the white house after eating a pretzel  after eating a pretzel  apparently  it went down wrong and  stimulated a nerve that decreased his heart rate   enough for him to faint but hillary momentarily succumbing to an illness while standing in the sun is some sort of scandal  right the medical term for what happened to bush is vasovagal syncope  and it s actually quite common  so are run of the mill respiratory infections that lead to pneumonia when left unchecked  even in presidential candidates  hillary s schedule has been grueling  to say the least  and yet she s supposed to either be a super woman and never get sick  or admit that even the merest cold means she s too sick to run for president the haters  however  are looking for any shred of evidence they can find that  proves  hillary is unfit to serve  wikileaks decided to take it too far featured image by carl court getty images
