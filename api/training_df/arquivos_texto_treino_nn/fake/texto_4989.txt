donald trump gave his first ever apology on thursday  it was half assed and the work of a teleprompter  but regardless  he did manage to spit out the words  the republican nominee told the crowd at a rally in charlotte  north carolina that he  regrets it  if he at times has said the  wrong thing  and  caused personal pain   at the same time  he said that this should all be excused and ignored because  too much is at stake  as you know  i am not a politician  i have worked in business  creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life  i ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders  and i ve never been politically correct   it takes far too much time  and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory sometimes  in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues  you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing  i have done that  and i regret it  particularly where it may have caused personal pain  too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues  trump then attacked the honesty of his rival  hillary clinton  and swore that he would  never lie  and would always put the interests of his voters first  in this journey  i will never lie to you   trump promised the crowd  i will never tell you something i do not believe myself  i will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours trump said that clinton  has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time   which is particularly ironic coming from a man who was awarded lie of the year by politifact in   so while sometimes i can be too honest  hillary clinton is the exact opposite  she never tells the truth  one lie after another  and getting worse each passing day   he said so those  wrong things  he has said  the ones he regrets so much  like when he said that all mexicans are rapists  yeah  well  that was just him being  too honest   what a great apology  the best apology featured image via video screen capture
