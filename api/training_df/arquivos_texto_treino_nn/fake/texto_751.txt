by now  we all know that upon having emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last week  it was discovered that senator john mccain  r az  has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer  of course  senator mccain is a giant in the senate and around the world who wields massive amounts of influence   and for very good reason  few in washington right now have served more valiantly than he has  this is true regardless of whether one agrees with the man s politics  therefore  he deserves our well wishes  and he and his family should be left in peace to deal with his illness in peace and privacy  this is not true  though  when it comes to the vultures in the senate gop conference instead of leaving senator mccain and his family alone  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  with such a slim majority in the senate  has decided to drag the ailing arizona senator back to washington just days after his devastating diagnosis and surgery  mcconnell needs john mccain s vote on his disastrous healthcare legislation  without mccain  mcconnell could only lose one vote before the whole thing goes down in flames again for the umpteenth time  dealing yet another blow to the republican party and to the trump administration of course  since john mccain is such a fighter and a great american public servant  he has released a cordial statement saying that he will be looking forward to returning to work  even though it is obvious that the senate is the last place he should be at such a critical time for his health  mccain s office released the following statement regarding the matter after getting medical clearance to go help mcconnell out  senator mccain looks forward to returning to the united states senate tomorrow to continue working on important legislation  including health care reform  the national defense authorization act  and new sanctions on russia  iran and north korea  the senator himself tweeted look forward to returning to senate tomorrow to continue work on health care reform  defense bill    russiasanctions https   t co   john mccain   senjohnmccain  july    course  this is being spun as john mccain s own choice  made without pressure by those in the ranks of elected republicans  however  considering the fact that there is enormous pressure for them to pass something   anything   on healthcare after campaigning for seven years to get rid of the affordable care act  it s hard to believe that all the media attention to mccain s precious vote and the political risk of failure to mcconnell didn t play a role here  further  you can bet your bottom dollar mcconnell himself probably told mccain to get his ass back to washington come hell or high water in time for this vote this is a new low  even for that vulturous turtle mitch mcconnell  he needs to leave john mccain and his family be  it also says a hell of a lot about the level of desperation he and his gop senate colleagues are feeling that they would pull a stunt like this in order to take healthcare from millions while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthiest americans john mccain is a better human than i  because if it were me  i d have told mitch mcconnell to go f ck himself  and announced my retirement all in the same breath featured image via alex wong getty images
