donald trump is back to shutting down reporters for trying to get to the bottom of his lies and scandals earlier today  trump gave an absolutely disastrous press conference in the wake of his russia scandal blowing up over the last several days  during the press conference  peter baker from the new york times tried to get trump s insight into the investigation of michael flynn  and trump basically lost it and had a meltdown  baker started off by priming trump  in the light of a very busy news week  a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things   give you a chance to go on record here  trump had somehow avoided any questions about russia and flynn until that moment  and everyone was on the edge of their seats waiting for what would come next  baker continued  did you at any time urge former fbi director james comey in any way shape or form to close or to back down the investigation into michael flynn  trump s response was nothing but cowardly  as he interrupted baker and barely waited for the reporter to finish his sentence  trump snapped back at baker  no  no  next question  baker then asked trump if he thinks he s done anything that could be worthy of criminal charges or impeachment   trump responded  i think it is totally ridiculous  everybody thinks so  obviously  trump is ignoring the fact that most americans want him the hell out of the white house  and believe he s guilty  you can watch trump lash out at baker below  no  no   next question  says president trump when asked if he told comey to stand down in russia probe  pic twitter com   pbs newshour   newshour  may     trump has no intention of mending his relationship with the press featured image via mark wilson   getty images
