as president obama is threatening and acting out on retaliation for russia s hack of the united states election  it s becoming evident that the hack was even bigger  according to a report in the washington post  the vermont electric utility was also hacked while the russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations  according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter  the discovery underlines the vulnerabilities of the nation s electrical grid  officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country s medical and emergency services no one is sure at this point why the russians hacked the small utility  but it s possible that they did it just to show us they can  it could also have been a test  similar to the way credit card thieves start with small charges to test the card this is also far from out of character for russia  earlier in   russia allegedly hacked the power grid in the ukraine the hackers who struck the power centers in ukraine the first confirmed hack to take down a power grid weren t opportunists who just happened upon the networks and launched an attack to test their abilities  according to new details from an extensive investigation into the hack  they were skilled and stealthy strategists who carefully planned their assault over many months  first doing reconnaissance to study the networks and siphon operator credentials  then launching a synchronized assault in a well choreographed dance  it was brilliant   says robert m  lee  who assisted in the investigation  lee is a former cyber warfare operations officer for the us air force and is co founder of dragos security  a critical infrastructure security company   in terms of sophistication  most people always  malware    he says   to me what makes sophistication is logistics and planning and operations and   what s going on during the length of it  and this was highly sophisticated  source  wiredwhile lee couldn t say for sure it was russia  the ukraine is convinced it was  nonetheless  lee said  it was a very well funded operation and it could have been from a nation state as wired notes  the electrical infrastructure in the ukraine is more secure than it is overall in the united states  beyond that  many of our electrical grids don t have backup  which means that it could be hours  days  or even longer before we get power back even more frightening  the entire nation could be without power indefinitely if just nine of its   substations were hit by terrorists or by hackers a coordinated attack on just nine of the united states    electric transmission substations on the right day could cause a blackout from los angeles to new york city  according to the study conducted by the federal energy regulatory commission  the study s results have been known for months to select people in federal agencies  congress and the white house  but were reported publicly for the first time wednesday  the wsj did not publish a list of the  most critical substations identified by the ferc study one particularly troubling memo reviewed by the journal described a scenario in which a highly coordinated but relatively small scale attack could send the country into a long term literal dark age   destroy nine interconnection substations and a transformer manufacturer and the entire united states grid would be down for at least  months  probably longer   the memo said source  timeone of donald trump s campaign promises has been to improve the infrastructure  obama has been trying to do that for most of his time in office  but congress has blocked that  still  even if trump does get an infrastructure bill signed  his relationship with russia is troubling  will his loyalty be with the united states or is he indebted enough to russia that he will leave the doors open for them to attack us where we are the most vulnerable  it s a disconcerting question  to say the least  and it s why the hacking of the election  along with trump s praise of putin  is a big f cking deal update  the washington post has issued a correction  the utility was hacked  but that vermont utility is not corrected to the grid  an earlier version of this story incorrectly said that russian hackers had penetrated the u s  electric grid  authorities say there is no indication of that so far  the computer at burlington electric that was hacked was not attached to the grid   an editor s note attached to the original article said featured image via pool getty images
