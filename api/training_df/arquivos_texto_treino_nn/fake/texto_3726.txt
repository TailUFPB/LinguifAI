on cnn s  state of the union  yesterday  reince priebus fielded a question about gen  michael flynn s insistence that it s perfectly rational to fear muslims  poor priebus tried to deflect and failed miserably  there are some people within that particular religion that we do fear  so what are we going to do about it  we re going to cause massive immigration delays and blow yet another hole in the deficit by going forward with the muslim ban  or rather  we re potentially going to piss off some allies by suspending all immigration from certain countries  we don t believe in religious tests and   are not blanketly judging an entire religion  but  in fact  we will try to pinpoint the problems and temporarily suspend those areas from coming into the united states until a better vetting system is in place  and yet  they want to implement a  values test   through which people can lie to their heart s content  given the trump train s islamophobia  such a values test could actually look like a religious test he s targeting both refugees and other immigrants from areas where there might be a problem with terrorism that could end up getting exported here  and will use both dhs and the department of state to pinpoint these countries  and we ll develop our  extreme vetting  and all will be right with the world as reported everywhere about five million times  we already have an extensive vetting system in place for refugees  whatever trump  priebus  and the rest of the fear mongerers keep pushing we likewise have a very lengthy  complex  and extensive vetting process in place for other immigrants  most applicants need a u s  sponsor a relative or potential employer as assurance that they aren t coming here to be a burden on our system  the whole process starts with a petition  and then goes to national visa center screening if the petition is approved there are also in depth interviews that take place  along with about a squillion forms that must be filled out and submitted to the nvc  when they finally come to the u s   they generally have a packet about an inch thick which u s  customs and border protection evaluates before granting entry into the u s  from there  immigrants get sent to customs and immigration services for processing trump would add a  values test  to this already lengthy and complex process  this is to ensure that no potential muslim extremists could successfully immigrate here  and is actually not entirely without precedent here  however  our current law states that we will not apply values tests to potential immigrants other parts of the plan  including the rest of his  extreme vetting   could actually strain state department and dhs resources and cause major delays  how bad the whole thing will be depends heavily on what countries they plan to target  which could be limited to the middle east  but could just as easily stretch into europe and parts of africa  many of our immigrants come from africa   who knows who this will piss off all of this could also become quite expensive  but it seems the deficit is suddenly not a major issue to the gop  after all  we re supposed to get this yuuuuuuge influx of jobs  which means a yuuuuuge influx of tax dollars despite the tax cuts  this is so not going to work featured image by alex wong via getty images
