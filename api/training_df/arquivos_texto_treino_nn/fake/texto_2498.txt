there is certainly no love lost between cnn and the trump administration  indeed  donald trump himself has called the mainstream news outlet   one of the most credible and trusted in the nation and world    fake news  for daring to report on the chaos coming out of the trump white house  this hairy relationship is definitely  on full display on a regular basis when it comes to the host of the lead and and state of the union on cnn  jake tapper joining fellow cnn host wolf blitzer  tapper took to the airwaves on thursday to blast the bizarre and chaotic mess that passed for trump s first presidential press conference since his inauguration  tapper said of the spectacle  in which trump was supposed to discuss his new nominee for secretary of labor alexander acosta  it was a wild press conference  he talked about  jim acosta more than he talked about alexander acosta  he talked about hillary clinton more than he talked about alexander acosta  tapper then went on to say that the presser was really just a way for trump to rant  lamenting that trump stepped on his own messages and activities in his first month as president and  instead of focusing on these accomplishments   it was an airing of grievances  it was festivus  it was complaints about the media  at one point he said the leaks were real but the news is fake  which doesn t make any sense what so ever  he said things that were not true  if you are a soldier in harm s way right now  if you are a hungry child in appalachia or the inner city  if you are an unemployed worker in the hallowed shell of a steel town  that s not a president who seemed rather focused on your particular needs and wants  that s a president that s focused on his bad press  tapper then went one to sum it up thusly  it was unhinged  it was wild  a lot of americans are going to watch that press conference and think  that guy wasn t focused on me and i don t know what he was focused on  tapper is exactly right  trump is clearly losing it in a fit of rage  and there s absolutely nothing to do but to conclude that he held that press conference to attack the media and other people he perceives to be enemies  he wanted to unload in front of a national and international audience  because he cannot accept the fact that most of what is going so wrong in his fledgling administration is the fault of his own ill tempered  impulsive actions  and of the incompetence of his white house staff in short  this man is in way over his head  he is most definitely unhinged   and he has the nuclear codes watch tapper annihilate trump below featured image via video screen capture
