don t compare black lives matter to the kkk or daily show host trevor noah will rip you a new one  just ask tomi lahren white nationalist darling tomi lahren has frequently used her show on the blaze to whine about and attack black lives matter  going so far as to compare the organization to the kkk of course  unlike the kkk  black lives matter protesters do not hide like cowards under sheets and they do not lynch people  they are also not racist like the kkk because black lives matter is inclusive and works with law enforcement it s true that some protesters go too far by rioting and looting  but most of the time they are unaffiliated with the group so when lahren appeared on the daily show for an interview with trevor noah on wednesday night  the fireworks were sure to fly but lahren was the one who got burned  for somebody who is not racist  you have to spend a lot of time saying  i am not racist   noah pointed out  lahren responded by labeling black lives matter as a group of cop killers who are violent and racist against white people just because of the actions of a few people who claimed to be with black lives matter noah struck back by hitting lahren with her own words   you re the same person who argued on your show that just because donald trump has supporters from the kkk doesn t mean he s in the kkk   he said as lahren tried to defend herself by trashing black people  the crowd repeatedly gasped in shock  including when lahren said she doesn t see color  but she also claimed that a black man is    times more likely to shoot a police officer than a police officer is to shoot a black man  however  it should be pointed out that white people kill more police officers than black people do anyway  noah quipped that lahren must have trouble at traffic lights since she doesn t see color and went on to say that  how we treat color is more important  noah then took lahren to the woodshed for calling black lives matter the  new kkk  by pointing out that the kkk still exists and that it s  incendiary  to make such a claim knowing the acts of terrorism and murder the kkk has committed lahren then blindly compared black lives matter to the kkk again by blaming protesters for looting and burning before asking   what did the kkk do   which shocked the audience and noah   did you say   what did the kkk do   noah asked in disbelief   wow  lahren then embarrassed herself by ranting about san francisco quarterback colin kaepernick s refusal to stand during the national anthem and suggested that she s being criticized for attacking him because she is white  so because i don t disagree with what he did  i should shut up   she asked noah   because i m white so i should shut up  i shouldn t be able to talk about black issues  cause i m white  but again  noah was able to humiliate lahren with her own words  no one brought up whites at all i never said that  i don t see color  here s the video via vid me tomi lahren got her ass handed to her by trveor noah  so now we can expect her to whine about it on her show very soon because getting schooled by a black man who is also an immigrant must be hard for her fragile racist mind to accept featured image  screenshot
