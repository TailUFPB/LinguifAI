the media everywhere seems to be jumping on the new revelation of hillary clinton s emails without actually reading what was written by fbi director james comey while donald trump  alongside pretty much every mainstream media branch  is saying that the fbi is  reopening  the investigation  that s not at all what was written comey  doing his due diligence and informing congress that new emails had been discovered  sent the following letter  in previous congressional testimony  i referred to the fact that the federal bureau of investigation  fbi  had completed its investigation of former secretary clinton s personal email server  due to recent developments  i am writing to supplement my previous testimony  note the word  supplement  he continued  in connection with an unrelated case  the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  i am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday  and i agreed that they fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information  as well as to assess their importance to out investigation  in other words  they are looking at them to determine if they should include them in the previous investigation  which is solidified with this next point  although the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant  and i cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work  i believe it is important to update your committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony  in other words  comey is being completely transparent as the emails are looked at  but he never said the investigation is being reopened  rather  the additional emails that were found are being assessed to see if they need to be subject to further scrutiny in addition breaking  us official  newly discovered emails related to clinton investigation did not come from her private server   the associated press   ap  october    williams has sources saying not about clinton world w holding emails  not about podesta emails  not emails from clinton   sam stein   samsteinhp  october    s really disappointing to see the lack of reading comprehension in the media that thus gave trump the go ahead to use a new attack line that is built purely from hyperbolic fabrication no  this is not trump s  october surprise  but rather an over reaction to someone actually showing the government can do its job watch pete williams be the person to actually explain the story with facts   nbc s pete williams  sr  officials say during separate investigation  a device  led to add l emails not from clinton https   t co qmmnoxxhox  bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  october    photo by joe raedle via getty images
