trump  not surprisingly  took the bait during the first showdown between him and hillary clinton at the first presidential debate  he admitted to not paying income taxes  because it makes him  smart    and a recent bombshell report from the new york times may confirm what we already know  he doesn t pay a time in federal income taxes because he  as a  brilliant business man   lost almost   billion  allowing him to forgo paying federal income taxes for almost  years  however  because he refuses to release the rest of his tax returns  no one can confirm nor deny this when you allegedly skip out on paying your federal income taxes  especially for  years   that doesn t make you a  smart businessman   that makes you a shameless freeloader  when you skip out on paying your income taxes  you don t pay for the list goes on and on  it doesn t matter what party one is from  that includes you  al sharpton   or how you feel about taxes  we all owe them and we all contribute to this great country called the united states  and to have a presidential candidate be smug enough to say that not contributing to these programs make him  smart  is an insult to the millions of business owners who play by the rules and pay their fair share  while even illegal immigrants pay    billion a year in personal income taxes  out of   billion overall   the trump campaign and its merry band of deplorables still think he s done nothing wrong  maybe he didn t do anything illegal  but just because something is legal doesn t make it right or ethical  we ve heard that for years from republicans  and the last  years aren t the only times trump has skipped out on paying his fair share  according to the clinton campaign website  trump  payed zero  or nearly zero  in federal income taxes in         and    so these  years  plus alleged  years from  to   means there have been at least  years trump paid virtually nothing  ask the middle class and lower class how much they paid in  years so don t ever tell me trump cares about our troops  vets or military ever again  don t ever tell me trump cares about tackling the national debt ever again  don t ever tell me trump cares about social security or our retirees  because if he really  truly did  he wouldn t take his irresponsible budgeting and turn it into a personal gain for himself at the expense of the american taxpayers  if he truly cared  he would have stepped up and fulfilled his obligation to the country that has given him so much  people who have less than him  and who aren t even citizens  are giving more than he is people from both sides do this  but the man is running as president of the united states  the other person  she pays her taxes  go on her website  there s over  years of full tax returns on there i might be able to look past trump s skipping on taxes for over  years if he wasn t such a sleazy businessman  if trump was actually charitable  when there isn t legal contingencies attached to it   i might be forgiving  if he actually paid his independent contractors  which he doesn t   i might look the other way  if he didn t decimate local economies with his mishandling of money  he s done that several times   this wouldn t be as big an issue for decades  local communities and economies have been cleaning up the messes he s made with his destructive  greedy behavior  for decades  small businesses have closed up shop  resulting in thousands of job losses  because he refused to pay them what they earned  and all the while this has been going on  we the taxpayers have been subsidizing his tax free lifestyle while he makes billions more  that right there is what s at the heart of this   it s not the fact that he used an unfair tax system to his advantage  it s that it s unethical  and it s un american  and he puts on a facade of caring when everyone knows he d do it again in a heartbeat there is no difference between donald trump and the common small town snake oil salesman  and his supporters are the townspeople   being manipulated into believing what he did  and will continue to do  is actually good for them  it s amazing that the same people who complain about  lazy minorities  and working poor not paying their taxes are all of a sudden a ok with this guy skipping out on paying billions in taxes for  years some people can t afford to pay their taxes  some people misfile their taxes and owe back pay  but you want to know the difference between these people and donald trump  in trump s own words  these people don t have  seven billion fucking dollars in the bank  that little zinger was said in  at his comedy central roast     one of the years trump wasn t paying federal income taxes  yet he had seven billion f ing dollars in the bank  good to know the  republican presidential candidate is officially the freeloader candidate  and we re all paying for his  smart  business savvy  i hope it was worth it  and if you think trump is going to eliminate this little loophole  knowing who his friends in business are  you ve got another thing coming to you featured image via jessica kourkounis getty images
