senator lindsey graham has had an on again  off again relationship with donald trump  having first condemned and opposed the republican nominee  then endorsed  un endorsed  tried to get his other gop buddies to also stop supporting him  and now he seems to be back on the trump bandwagon in hopes that by getting the donald elected  republicans can keep the senate that s why graham is particularly thrilled about a recent report on the clinton foundation that outlines that  more than half of the private individuals who met with hillary clinton during her tenure as secretary of state were also donors to the clinton foundation in some capacity  and that clinton had given those donors favorable treatment in an interview with fox news on wednesday  graham celebrated this  gift from the political gods   claiming that this might actually help trump  close the gap  with the democratic nominee   but only if trump plays his cards right  and we all know what the slim chances of that happening are   graham said  if mr  trump can up his game   and he is  he s doing much better  if he can control   if he can close the gap i think the chance of keeping the senate goes up  graham also criticized the clinton report  saying that it reeks of wrong  it reeks of insider benefits  the inside versus the outside  and trump represents the outside and he s in a pretty good spot   obviously  graham isn t considering that trump s own business and charity record is filled with unethical  fraudulent activity this interview gets somewhat comical when graham said  with a straight face  that if only trump could harness his  temperament   demonstrate  judgment  and show that he was  qualified  to be the next president of the united states  he might be able to make the republican party proud  unfortunately  we all know that trump is just going to disappoint graham and break his heart   again you can watch the interview below featured image via darren mccollester   getty images
