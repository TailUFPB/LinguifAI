donald trump s list of allies is getting shorter because of his outrageous accusation against president obama during the campaign  marco rubio fiercely opposed trump but soon chose to kiss his ass and endorse him rubio has been reluctant to say anything against trump ever since  but that changed over the weekend after trump openly accused president obama of wiretapping trump tower in a saturday morning twitter rant terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    offered zero evidence to back up his claims and both former director of national intelligence james clapper and current fbi director james comey have forcefully refuted trump s accusation and now rubio  who is on the senate intelligence committee  says that trump will have to answer for his lies  i have no evidence and no one has presented anything to me that indicates anything like that   rubio told meet the press on sunday   suffice it to say i don t have any basis  i ve never heard that allegation made before by anybody  i ve never seen anything about that anywhere before  but again  the president put that out there  and now the white house will have to answer as to exactly what he was referring to  chuck todd went on t ask rubio if he would concede that if trump is lying that it would be a huge political scandal and rubio agreed here s the video via youtube trump is desperate to distract everyone from focusing on his ever growing russia scandal  so he made up this lie based on a conspiracy theory he read on breitbart in the hopes that congress and the media will shift their focus this is a serious accusation against a former president and trump should be severely punished for it  he has offered no evidence to prove his claim and that means he is slandering president obama  which should result in a lawsuit and impeachment  but we all know that republicans in congress have zero credibility so they will more than likely shield trump and pursue a witch hunt against obama  who was a more honorable and respected president than trump will ever be featured image via screenshot
