it s no secret that donald trump hates the mainstream media  and specifically cnn  but our constitution is set up in a way that there s nothing he can do about it  trump  though  isn t about to let a quaint old piece of parchment paper stand in his way  the white house is threatening to prevent a planned merger between cnn and time warner if cnn doesn t start being nice to him white house advisers have discussed a potential point of leverage over their adversary  a senior administration official said  a pending merger between cnn s parent company  time warner  and at t  mr  trump s justice department will decide whether to approve the merger  and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward  the president s animus toward cnn remains a wild card source  ny timeswhat s particularly interesting about this is that it comes at the exact same time as the right is accusing cnn of extortion  as you probably recall  trump tweeted a gif of him in a wrestling match beating the crap out of a man whose face had been covered by the cnn logo cnn found the source of that gif  which was a middle aged man who has a habit of posting racist and anti semitic posts on reddit  right wingers were opposed to this statement from cnn in the story  reporter andrew kaczynski wrote that cnn had found   but would not identify   the reddit user  whose other posts included racist and anti semitic memes   ecause he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology  showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts  and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again  but it was the next line that would leave the pro trump internet inflamed and the journalism community scratching its head   cnn reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change  source  buzzfeedthe right wing media and some politicians are full of claims of extortion by cnn  of course  this is all happening at a time when the trump administration is trying to get states to reveal sensitive data on all its voters  but it s the privacy of a racist internet troll that s sacrosanct now  the trump administration s response to cnn is an actual threat of extortion  perhaps he needs to read the constitution before he burns it this puts liberals in an uncomfortable position  virtually no one favors the proposed merger between cnn and time warner and there are numerous reasons to stop it  but if the price for stopping it is to severely damage our free press  it s not worth it  contact cnn and demand that they stay strong featured image via mark wilson getty images
