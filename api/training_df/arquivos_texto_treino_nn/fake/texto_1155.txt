the u s  supreme court has struck down a backward  gender discriminating federal law based on shocking stereotypes   one being that most men hardly care about their children born out of wedlock under this law  a child born abroad to an unwed american mother automatically becomes a u s  citizen if the mother previously lived in the u s  for a minimum of one year under the very same law  a child of an unwed father can t become a u s  citizen unless the father has lived in the u s  for a continuous period of five years  two of them when he was over the age of  how could this law have such requirements  who would think this  how did that even pass originally  it s sad and disgusting thankfully  the u s  supreme court agrees  they have ruled that these horrid gender lines drawn by congress violate the constitution s guarantee to equal protection of the law the problems with this law were brought forward for scrutiny by luis ram n morales santana who born in the dominican republic to unwed parents  his mother was from the dominican republic while his father was a u s  citizen at the time of morales santana s birth  his father was in the dominican republic working on a construction project morales santana came to the u s  with his parents as a permanent resident  in   after he was convicted of several felonies  the government wanted to deport him with the law in place  morales santana s father fell short of the requirements for morales santana to qualify for automatic u s  citizenship  this meant deportation looked plausible according to npr  the rule in a typical case would be to extend the favorable treatment of one sex   in this case  women   to men  but with this case  ginsburg observed  favorable treatment for mothers was the exception to the general rule in the statute though the u s  supreme court saw the law s requirements as unconstitutional gender discrimination  justice ruth bader ginsburg said the court was not free to make the exception into the general rule  instead  she said  it is up to congress to set the same rule for everyone yep  now it s a matter of convincing congress to fix their mess of a law  and it gets even worse  according to ginsburg  the law would have to be equalized by making unwed mothers abide by the tougher citizenship rules that apply to unwed fathers so there you have it   equality between unwed mothers and unwed fathers for their children s u s  citizenship  not what we were all expecting  but it is indeed equal featured image via robert nickelsberg getty images
