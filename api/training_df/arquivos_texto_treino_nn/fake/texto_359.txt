when americans think about state run television  we don t expect it to happen here  when we turn on the local news at night  we expect straight news  a rundown of the facts regarding local and national events  if we want opinion shows  we know where to go  if you re a conservative  there s a plethora of shows to watch on fox news that offer soothing confirmation bias  such as tucker carlson tonight  hannity  or fox and friends  if you re a liberal  you can get the same on your side of the aisle on msnbc with the last word with lawrence o donnell  the rachel maddow show  or all in with chris hayes  though  to be fair  while they are opinion shows  the latter network doesn t lie  while fox does   however  all of that could be changing it turns out that many of america s local stations are owned by a company called sinclair broadcasting  that company happens to be pro trump  they are now going to have  stations around the country that will now be airing pro trump items on a daily basis  and those shows will be broadcast to the unsuspecting viewing public as actual news  according to politicus usa  those shows will consist of the following   the terrorism alert desk  advertised as a daily news update about terrorist activity   news pieces from epshteyn  sinclair s chief political analyst   a clearly labeled opinion show featuring mark hyman  a former vice president of the company this is especially dangerous  because americans do not expect to be forced to watch propaganda mixed in with their news  they just want the truth  or shows that are clear opinion  that is not what this is  though  this is nothing more than the kind of stuff kim jung un s regime is feeding his people in order to brainwash them  this is the kind of thing we see in authoritarian states  and it is incredibly dangerous for democracy people keep saying not to compare trump to a dictator  but it is becoming more and more clear that this is exactly what he is aiming to be   and he has plenty of help from his blind followers in high places in short  beware  folks  because you re about to get a big dose of america s very own state run propaganda featured image via william thomas cain getty images
