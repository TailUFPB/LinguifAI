donald trump expects unwavering loyalty from everyone around him  that is likely why there has been radio silence from his daughter ivanka  who is a jewish convert  and his son in law jared kushner  who is a genetic jew  trump s grandchildren are jewish as well  of course  however  that did not stop him from defending the white nationalists  neo nazis  hitler sympathizers  and other assorted racists who marched with torches through the streets of charlottesville  virginia shouting racist and anti semitic slogans therefore  it should come as no surprise that the rabbi who helped ivanka convert to judaism is not impressed  in fact  he seems to be quite outraged  rabbi emeritus haskel lookstein is beside himself with rage at trump s response to the charlottesville tragedy  and rightly so  he wrote a letter condemning trump s remarks  saying  we are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism  and the renewed vigor of the neo nazis  kkk  and alt right  while we avoid politics  we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation president trump has offered in his response to this act of violence  rabbi lookstein released the letter publicly  and likely will be attacked by trump  the divider in chief may have done the unthinkable with this one and divided his own family  ivanka and jared take their faith very seriously  and ivanka has been a devout jew since  and is raising her children in a seriously observant jewish home  they likely already have a hard time working in trump s white house  which is chock full of open racists  neo nazis  and anti semites  jared has family members who died in the nazi holocaust  there is simply no way  he is happy with trump s equating white supremacists with those fighting against that kind of hate this is especially evident considering the fact that ivanka immediately denounced the hate and called the groups perpetuating it out by name in ways her father has repeatedly refused to do ivanka and jared  do you really want your jewish children growing up in this environment  loyalty to your nazi father simply is not worth it  take a stand and resign from his white house featured image via sean gallup getty images
