trump has been on a  hour freak out with the hosts of msnbc s  morning joe  and his clear incoherence has everyone from mental health experts to average americans once again concerned that the president is seriously mentally ill  the evidence that our president is indeed mentally unfit for office is circumstantial but persuasive   and trump keeps digging the hole deeper most people would agree that a man who can t stop himself from fabricating a rumor of a bleeding facelift to publicly attack the host of a cable show he doesn t like is unfit for office  in normal times  that alone would be grounds for invoking the  amendment s clause on the president s mental capacity  for trump  that s only the tip of the iceberg  the latest in a seemingly unending string of incidents that should raise serious concerns the white house seems to be painfully aware that the questions swirling around his stability are undermining the credibility of his role as president  consequently  and for the first time in u s  history  the white house has to run with the narrative that you cannot question the president s mental health  trump is sane because they say he is sane and shut up about it just hours after trump got into a public fight with the hosts of  morning joe  on twitter while he watched the show live  kellyanne conway went on abc s  good morning america  to say it was unpatriotic to ever question whether trump has lost his mind  even while he continues to provide evidence that he has had some sort of mental breakdown after summarizing an  incomplete  list of the things trump has been called online  kellyanne said  it doesn t help the american people to have a president covered in this light  i m sorry  it s neither productive nor patriotic  the toxicity is over the top  in short  kellyanne wants us to believe trump is the victim in all of this  meanwhile  he continues to play the part of the bully worth remembering  trump s favorite network  fox news  once aired glenn beck claiming obama hated white people  its star anchor  sean hannity  repeatedly accused obama of being a pathological  narcissist   and its resident mental health  expert   repeatedly diagnosed both barack and michelle obama with various pathologies  including once saying michelle needed to lose weight  none of that irrational hatred or vitriol caused obama to live tweet a rant about fox news hosts or personally smear them on social media but then  obama wasn t mentally ill  so why would he featured image via youtube
