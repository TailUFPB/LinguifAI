with their puppet firmly secured in the white house  russia is now poised to take full advantage of it throughout the campaign  donald trump threatened to pull the united states out of nato and suggested that america would not help defend our european allies against an attack unless they pay what amounts to a ransom  trump has also gotten really cozy with vladimir putin  who launched an attack against ukraine and seized the crimea in  and now that putin has trump as his puppet  russia could probably march military forces throughout europe without having to worry about the united states retaliating that s certainly the fear of many eastern european nations  including lithuania  whose president is now warning that russia is preparing for war on a massive scale president dalia grybauskaite is concerned about an upcoming russian military exercise with belarus that appears to be a preparation for an invasion  we witness various threats growing and we are awaiting with concern the zapad  exercise   she said   at a time when many numerous and aggressive forces will amass together a demonstrative preparation for war with the west is coming  indeed  russia is building up its military and belarus just so happens to border latvia  lithuania  and poland  all of which the soviet union once had control of behind the iron curtain according to newsweek the security committee chief in lithuania s parliament  vytautas bakas  said he believed zapad  would be the largest foreign military drill at his country s borders  according to russia s ministry of defence  its heavy duty railway traffic to belarus will increase by  percent this year  suggesting a transfer of a lot of cargo if russia is preparing for war against europe the only power on earth capable of stopping them is the united states  but with trump fawning over putin and perhaps owing a debt to the russian leader for putting him in the white house  it s looking more unlikely that trump would do anything to anger his new best friend  trump has even considering loosening economic sanctions which will free up finances for russia to use for their military buildup donald trump is abandoning our european allies and that should worry every single american in this country  because if russia does launch an attack on europe  it s going to be massive  and if trump did decide to intervene  it will be late because he is an incompetent decision maker  that means our military would have a disadvantage and thousands could die  it may even take a military draft  the very kind that donald trump himself dodged to get out of fighting for this country  to stop russia  and that means even more american blood could be spilled in europe because donald trump cares more about putin liking him than he does about america  our allies  and our citizens featured image via greg baker pool getty images and joe raedle getty images
