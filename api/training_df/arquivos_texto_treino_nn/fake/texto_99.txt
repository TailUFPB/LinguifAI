donald trump probably wishes the united states was more like the philippines trump was downright chummy with mass murderer and human rights violator rodrigo duterte on monday during the association of southeast asian nations summit in manila not only did trump refuse to nail duterte for violating human rights  he laughed when duterte accused journalists of being  spies  when they peppered the dictatorial duo with questions about human rights  we would be talking on matters that are of interest of both the philippines and  with you around guys  you are the spies   duterte said  drawing laughter from trump bloomber reporter jennifer jacobs chronicled how duterte and trump treated journalists at the summit duterte made a joke at end of trump bilat as press being shooed out  duterte said   we will be talking on matters of interest to both the philippines and then he said   with you around  guys  you are the spies  trump chuckled  pic twitter com   jennifer jacobs   jenniferjjacobs  november    reporters asked pres trump if he would bring up human rights with duterte  duterte shut it down saying this was not a news conference   steve holland     november    i would like for the media to leave us alone  you may leave the room   duterte says  just minutes into summit meeting press ushered out  pic twitter com   jennifer jacobs   jenniferjjacobs  november    has been attacking the media since he announced his candidacy back in   and he has relentlessly attacked the media since taking office  accusing journalists of writing or reporting  fake news  ever since he became the philippine leader  duterte has been responsible for the killing of   people  casualties of a war on drugs duterte promised to wage during his campaign president obama was a sharp critic of duterte  and duterte retaliated by calling him the  son of a whore  and sought closer ties with china and russia  of course  trump likes duterte and has avoided calling him out for his abuse of power  trump even invited duterte to the white house trump s amusement at duterte s remarks about journalists are particularly alarming since the philippines is one of the most deadly places on earth for journalists newsweek reports that  journalists have been killed there since  and trump added further insult to injury by not even discussing duterte s terrible human rights record  instead  he let duterte do all the talking and merely nodded in agreement with him  once again  trump demonstrates that he is a coward who can be walked over by other world leaders  conservatives bitched and moaned whenever president obama bowed to greet some world leaders  but apparently they are okay with trump just laying down featured image  justin sullivan getty images
