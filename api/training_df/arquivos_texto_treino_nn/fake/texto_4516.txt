while charlotte  north carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police  mike pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation  to him  it s annoying   but not in the way one might think as black people   who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed   lie dead in the street  pence and trump are annoyed hearing about it  how do we know  because pence was  smart  enough to admit it to reporters trump and i believe there s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement gee  sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much  pence  sorry the plight of black america is a burden to your message of  build that wall  thirty eight percent of the u s  population is non white  when a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement  the conversation  or  talk  as pence puts it  is extremely important  sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices  but it needs to happen  skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn t make it go away the statistics tell us all we need to know so  even with all these glaring statistics  mike pence thinks talking about it has been  far too much  for his and trump s comfort newsflash  pence  you re running for vice president of the united states  not vice president of the white community  if the talk is too much  get out of the race we already know trump doesn t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it  but pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential trump administration would care  that s been shattered good luck getting the black vote in november when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most  systemic racism featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
