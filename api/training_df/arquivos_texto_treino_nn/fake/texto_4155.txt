if republicans want to lose congress  there s one surefire way  let americans know that they will be in for at least two more years of gridlock and obstruction if they win  john mccain  in a stunning admission  promised exactly that in a radio interview on philadelphia s  wpht radio on monday  mccain wasn t able to say with certainty that donald trump would be better at nominating supreme court justices than hillary clinton would be  but he does promise that if clinton wins  there s no way the senate will ever vote on one of her supreme court nominees later in the interview  mccain used the opportunity to make the case for fellow republican sen  pat toomey  who is locked in a close battle to retain his senate seat in pennsylvania  mccain promised that republicans would be  united against any supreme court nominee  put forth by clinton  i promise you that we will be united against any supreme court nominee that hillary clinton  if she were president  would put up   mccain said   i promise you  this is where we need the majority and pat toomey is probably as articulate and effective on the floor of the senate as anyone i have encountered  source  cnnhere s the audio voters won t buy it  while mccain s seat is pretty safe  the senate as a whole is not  republicans have to win at least  seats to retain their majority in the senate  democrats only need   it s not just that  either  voters know that it s congress  not president obama  who is responsible for the gridlock in washington  and they are sick of it  most americans want the senate to give obama s supreme court nominee  merrick garland  a hearing and ultimately  an up or down vote  instead  mccain and republicans are promising more of the same  which is absolutely nothing  trust me  americans will punish them at the polls  especially as donald trump s campaign continues its downward spiral featured image via win mcnamee getty images
