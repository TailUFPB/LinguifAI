history   maddow https   t co wppvdprekk  markevans     january    it turns out   the feds   in this case  the justice department  have already been there and have diagnosed the problem with violence in chicago  police brutality and racism  but trump and his republican compatriots typically dismiss such well research opinions in favor of licking the badges of cops who make the rest look bad what will happen when trump  sends in the feds   well  we don t need to look past what hitler did after the reichstag fire using emergency constitutional powers  adolf hitler s cabinet had issued a decree for the protection of the german people on february     this decree placed constraints on the press and authorized the police to ban political meetings and marches  effectively hindering electoral campaigning  a temporary measure  it was followed by a more dramatic and permanent suspension of civil rights following the february  burning of the parliament building though the origins of the fire are still unclear  in a propaganda maneuver  the coalition government  nazis and the german nationalist people s party  blamed the communists  they exploited the reichstag fire to secure president von hindenburg s approval for an emergency decree  the decree for the protection of the people and the state of february   popularly known as the reichstag fire decree  the regulations suspended the right to assembly  freedom of speech  freedom of the press  and other constitutional protections  including all restraints on police investigations justified on the false premise that the communists were planning an uprising to overthrow the state  the reichstag fire decree permitted the regime to arrest and incarcerate political opponents without specific charge  dissolve political organizations  and to suppress publications  it also gave the central government the authority to overrule state and local laws and overthrow state and local governments donald trump is moving quickly  and we can no longer ignore the threat he poses  write your legislators right now   seriously  do it right now   and demand that someone  anyone  begin organizing his impeachment immediately  the longer we wait  the more we lose featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla  screengrab
