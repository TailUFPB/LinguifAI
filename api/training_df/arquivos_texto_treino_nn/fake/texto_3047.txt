it seems that in some ways at least  congress doesn t quite know what to do with itself now that they ve got control of absolutely everything at the federal level  senate democrats seem to know that and have been using it to force republicans to vote for things they might not otherwise vote for out of fear of pissing off their constituents last night  and into this morning  in fact  the democrats of the senate forced the gop s hand on healthcare  no  they didn t force republicans to admit they want to destroy obamacare   we already know that  they engaged in a  vote a rama  of sorts to force republicans to vote to gut things that their constituents will hate  they forced republicans to admit that they re perfectly fine gutting medicare  medicaid  mental healthcare  women s healthcare  and more how did they do it  they engaged in a  vote a rama   in which they presented a series of amendments to a budget resolution intended to allow congress to repeal obamacare with simple majorities in both houses every one of those amendments failed  quelle surprise  though several democrats in the senate made a point of voicing their objections as they cast their  no  votes on the budget resolution measure  for instance  sen  claire mccaskill  r missouri  said   because there is no replace  i vote no  the vote a rama lasted nearly seven hours  and included not only democratic amendments to protect medicare and medicaid  but also  late wednesday evening  senate minority leader chuck schumer said  put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside  work with us democrats on a way to improve health care in america  not put chaos in place of affordable care  mitch mcconnell  however  had his own statement to issue when the vote was complete  the senate just took an important step toward repealing and replacing obamacare by passing the resolution that provides the legislative tools necessary to actually repeal this failed law while we move ahead with smarter health care policies  republicans have never actually been able to point to anything that proves the aca  which  yes  is obamacare  is a failed policy  does it have problems  yes  name one thing that doesn t  though  especially a program this complex that s only in its fledgling years but repealing obamacare means so much more than just ending a so called  failed  law  it means harming millions of people in pursuit of a political goal   one that their constituents don t believe will hurt them because they literally think that obamacare and the affordable care act are two different things republicans don t care about collateral damage  though  they got their repeal measure through over and above the efforts of democrats to stop it  but stopping it wasn t the democrats  only objective  they seemed to know that  if they couldn t stop this  they could either embarrass republicans with their votes  or force them to admit to things they don t want to admit to photo of chuck schumer by win mcnamee getty images  photo of mitch mcconnell zach gibson getty images
