the american legislative exchange council  otherwise known as alec  is a corporate funded project whose agenda is to give republicans even more of an advantage  starting at the very top and working their way down  part of their right wing agenda now is to go  years back in time and get rid of an elected senate  instead reverting to senators being decided by deals between wealthy campaign donors  corporate lobbyists  and legislators trying to bring an end to representative democracy in the us isn t a particularly new idea  it s one that has been getting proposed for decades  however  nobody has come as close to making it a reality as alec  in fact  last year they circulated a document entitled draft resolution recommending constitutional amendment restoring election of us senators to the legislatures of the sovereign states  something that will most likely be discussed at great length at alec s annual meeting this week  if the article is approved by alec members  becomes part of their official agenda and is eventually instated  it will take a step backward and return the us to the corrupt and undemocratic practice of state legislators bartering off senate seats  which was ended in  when you take a look at that document you can tell these guys aren t fooling around  as it goes almost immediately to their ultimate goal section   the seventeenth article of amendment to the constitution of the united states is hereby repealed section   senators shall be elected exclusively by the state legislature  upon a majority vote of legislators present and voting in a joint session  if a vacancy shall exist for more than one hundred eighty days  then the governor shall appoint the senator to serve the remainder of the vacant term  this procedure may not be modified by state initiative or referendum section   state legislatures may issue instructions to  or recall  their senators at any time by doing this  congress will become more representative of corporations than citizens of the united states and also the imbalance in the upper chamber would almost certainly grow  fortunately  overturning the seventeenth amendment would be no easy task  but it is a terrifying prospect that there are organizations trying to stifle democracy in the united states of america featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
