it s the first day of black history month and donald trump was quick to celebrate it inappropriately february is the month when our country recognizes the long history of african americans  their achievements and struggles are america s achievements and struggles and we must recognize both to move forward and create a better future but rather than honor black history month with the dignity it deserves  donald trump made it all about him instead during a breakfast in the white house cabinet room  trump said a few words about black history month during this month we honor the tremendous history of the african americans throughout our country  throughout the world if you think about it  right  and this story is one of unimaginable sacrifice  hard work  and faith in america  and then after giving a shout out to his token black cabinet member ben carson  who heads housing and urban development despite having zero experience  he started bitching about and attacking the media over a report on trump s first day that the martin luther king bust had been removed from the oval office  a mistake that was quickly corrected the same day but trump still whines about  the statue is cherished  it s one of the favorite things  and we have some good ones  we have lincoln and we have jefferson  we have dr  martin luther king   he said trump then praised fox news for kissing his ass and once again talked about inner cities as if they are crime ridden war zones  i don t like watching fake news  fox has treated me very nice  i don t know where fox is  thank you  we need more jobs  better wages  we re going to work very hard in the inner city  ben will be doing that  one of his big things  we need safer communities  we re going to do that with law enforcement  we re going to make it safe  we re going to make it much better than it is right now  right now it s terrible  not content to just use black history month as an excuse to air his petty grievances  trump chose to pat himself on the back as well  if you remember  i wasn t going to do well with the african american community  and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things  we ended up getting   i won t go into details but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years  hillary clinton received  percent of the black vote on election day while trump only received  percent  hardly something to brag about trump then gave permission to his black supporters to lavish him with praise an ohio pastor told trump that  we love you  and actually dared to mention trump and god in the same breath  he also somehow kept a straight face while claiming that trump is a good listener trump then returned to bashing the media and whining  so much of the media is opposition party  knowingly saying incorrect things  it s a very sad situation  but we seem to be doing well  you know  it s almost like  in the meantime we won  so maybe they don t have the influence they think  they really have to straighten out their act  they re very dishonest people  here s the unbelievable video via youtube basically  trump said more about omarosa and his black media surrogates than he did about black history  reducing the names of king  rosa parks  and frederick douglass to mere footnotes in his remarks and once again demonstrating that he is a disgrace featured image via screenshot
