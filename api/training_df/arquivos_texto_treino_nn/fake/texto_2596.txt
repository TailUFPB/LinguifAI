republicans are now gunning for the ninth circuit court in an effort to kill courts that don t have a strictly conservative viewpoint not long after the ninth circuit court ruled against reinstating donald trump s executive order banning travel into the united states from seven countries  republicans made a bill written by gop senators jeff flake and john mccain a top priority conservatives have long despised the ninth circuit  which is based in san francisco  for issuing rulings they don t like if the bill were to pass  the ninth circuit court would be split in two and a  circuit court would be created  the ninth would continue to have jurisdiction over california  oregon  hawaii  guam and the northern mariana islands while the  would have jurisdiction over republican controlled states like arizona  idaho  montana  and alaska with washington and nevada thrown in basically  republicans are trying to rig the judicial branch in their favor flake and mccain are whining that the ninth is too liberal and that it has jurisdiction over too much of the country   it represents  percent of the population   and  percent of the land mass is in that jurisdiction  it s just too big   flake told fox news on wednesday   we have a bedrock principle of swift justice and if you live in arizona or anywhere in the  circuit  you just don t have it  fox news also used the fact that the ninth circuit court holds the record for most decisions overturned by the supreme court as an excuse to justify the split however  it should also be pointed out that the ninth also holds the record for the most decisions upheld of course  considering that conservatives have held a majority on the supreme court for decades  it s pretty obvious why many decisions of the ninth have been reversed conservatives have been trying to split up the ninth circuit for many years  flake claims that liberal judges on the court are at fault but a commission formed by congress in  recommended against splitting it up  both chambers had republican majorities at the time it s not unprecedented for congress to split a court  but this time it s different  republicans are only targeting the ninth because they hate the rulings that come out of it  so now they aim to kill rulings they don t like by preventing them altogether this is a republican ploy to seize power in the judicial branch to prevent rulings against their agenda like the one handed down against trump on thursday it s eerily similar to the  court packing  scheme conservatives opposed when franklin roosevelt tried to add more judges to the supreme court  now conservatives apparently have no problem with such schemes as long as they favor their side this is something the american people must oppose  rigging the court system is totally un american and undemocratic  especially since it is very clear that republicans are doing this for partisan reasons donald trump is not a king  and the judicial branch serves as a crucial check on executive power to keep the government balanced  but if republicans have their way  there will be one less check and the balance will tip overwhelmingly their way read more featured image via wikimedia
