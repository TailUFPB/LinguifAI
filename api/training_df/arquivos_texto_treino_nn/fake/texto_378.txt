in a pair of tweets on thursday afternoon  donald trump proved once again how out of touch he is with the american public  just three months ago  pew research published a study showing that a substantial majority of americans   some  percent  feel the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage for all citizens  not only that  but the formerly controversial idea of a  single payer  system  like the medicare for all bill just introduced with wide democratic support by senator bernie sanders  was favored by a third of americans trump  however  sees universal coverage  enjoyed by every highly developed nation in the world except the united states  as a  curse  on the citizens of this country bernie sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan   a curse on the u s    its people  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    i told republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen  but don t worry  i will veto because i love our country   its people   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    coverage was long considered a pipe dream  even as recently as during the primary campaign between hillary clinton and bernie sanders  secretary clinton dismissed it as an  idea that will never  ever come to pass   but buoyed by the popularity of senator sanders after the disastrous win by donald trump in november  the democratic party has moved decidedly left on the issue at the time of sanders  introduction of his bill  painted as the sane alternative to the republican frenzy to strip all americans of non private health coverage  there were a number of democratic senators signed on  including those widely considered to be front runners for the democratic nomination in   cory booker  elizabeth warren  and even the favorites among clinton loyalists  kamala harris and kirsten gillibrand  all joined senator sanders in introducing medicare for all  they were joined by tammy baldwin  richard blumenthal  martin heinrich  mazie hirono  pat leahy  ed markey  jeff merkley  brian schatz  jeanne shaheen  tom udall  and sheldon whitehouse the irony  of course  is that even if one considers universal coverage a  curse  as donald trump does  the bill stands essentially no chance of passage in the first place  trump would love to portray himself as a savior of conservative principles  but with republicans in firm control of congress  at least until    the odds of trump even needing to look through his plethora of gold plated pens to find the one for vetoes are slim to none
