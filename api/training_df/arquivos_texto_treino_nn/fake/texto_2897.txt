san antonio spurs coach gregg popovich is no fan of donald trump  he sharply criticized trump in the run up to the election  and now that trump is officially in office  he seems to have no interest in giving the orange one so much as an inch  in a recent interview  popovich openly called trump a liar  and specifically criticized his activities when he went to speak to the cia   especially trump s speaking about the size of his crowds in front of a wall representing fallen operatives  he also said that the massive women s march was  great   popovich said  that message is important  and it could have been a whole lot of groups marching  and somebody said on tv   what s their message   well  their message is obvious  that our president comes in with the lowest  rating of anybody who ever came into the office  and there s a majority of people out there  since hillary  won the popular vote  that don t buy his act  popovich then went on to criticize trump s bigoted remarks against any number of groups of americans during the campaign and since  he could talk to the groups that he disrespected and maligned during the primary and really make somebody believe it  but so far  we ve got  a point where you really can t believe anything that comes out of his mouth  you really can t  the coach then moved on trump s speech at the cia  and called him emotionally immature and a liar  that s worrisome  that s worrisome  i d just feel better if somebody was in that position that showed the maturity and psychological and emotional level of somebody that was his age  it does boggle the mind how somebody can be so thin skinned  it s all obvious   it s about him  if anything affects him  if it s  saturday night live  or  hamilton  or she got  more million votes than you   they re illegal   it doesn t matter what it is  there s a pattern there  and that s dangerous  i d like to have someone with gravitas  but he got there through the electoral college  which is part of our system  and i hope he does some good things  hopefully  people with megaphones continue to speak out against trump and his dishonest  autocratic administration  if we hold their feet to the fire  we just might survive the next four years featured image by alex wong via getty images
