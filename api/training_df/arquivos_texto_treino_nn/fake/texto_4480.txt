after monday s debate  donald trump almost certainly wishes he had been covered in honey  placed on top of a colony of fire ants  and kicked in his surely gold plated testicles repeatedly as someone reads  twilight  to him rather than face hillary clinton in a head to head matchup moderator lester holt reminded trump that he said clinton doesn t have a  presidential look  and asked him what he meant by that  she doesn t have the look   trump replied   she doesn t have the stamina  i said she doesn t have the stamina and i don t believe she does have the stamina  to be president of this country  you need tremendous stamina  clinton  who was an absolute badass the entire debate  just stood there  and laughed  and smiled  and let him talk  then  when it was her turn  she turned the burn up to   degrees  well  as soon as he travels to  countries and negotiates a peace deal  a ceasefire  a release of dissidents  or even spends  hours testifying in front of a congressional committee  he can talk to me about stamina  watch clinton bring down the hammer below featured image via getty images drew angerer
