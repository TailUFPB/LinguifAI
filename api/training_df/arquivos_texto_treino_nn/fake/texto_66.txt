former reality show star donald trump has repeatedly refused to be held responsible for the words that come out of his own mouth  even when it s on tape  for example  the infamous access hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful  he can just grab women by their p ssies  trump defended sexual harasser and fox news host  yeah  i know that s redundant  bill o reilly in the recent past and even more recently  he has defended alleged pedophile and alabama senate candidate roy moore  so  defending perverts is just another day for donald trump here s a quick reminder of what trump said on the p ssy grabbing tape  you know i m automatically attracted to beautiful    i just start kissing them  it s like a magnet  just kiss  i don t even wait  and when you re a star  they let you do it  you can do anything  grab them by the pussy  you can do anything  the new york times reports that even after trump made an almost apology after the tape was revealed  he still told a senator and an adviser that the access hollywood tape may not be authentic but something deeper has been consuming mr  trump  he sees the calls for mr  moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now famous  access hollywood  tape  in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia  and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after  he suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic  and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently so  to reiterate  trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news  and he also told that to a senator after it was released we see a pattern here  maybe trump s cult like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well  that tape was an indicating factor that donald j  trump is unfit for office  morally and intellectually photo by chip somodevilla getty images
