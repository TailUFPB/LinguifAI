bill clinton finally spoke up about donald trump  and trump is not going to like what he said the former president has been quiet since election day  but a journalist bumped into him at a local bookstore and got the scoop of a lifetime as clinton fielded questions from some customers who noticed him as we all know  the cia and  intelligence agencies and the fbi have all concluded that russia interfered with our political process to help trump win  but trump and his team continue to defend russia and insist that we should all ignore the facts and move on as if a cyber attack against our country by a foreign state isn t important well  bill clinton was asked about trump s reaction to the assessment and he replied by questioning trump intelligence  you would need to have a single digit iq not to recognize what was going on   clinton said when asked if trump is smart  clinton said   he doesn t know much  one thing he does know is how to get angry  white men to vote for him  let s keep in mind that bill clinton and trump know each other  so when bill clinton says that trump  doesn t know much  he knows what he s talking about rather than run a campaign based on policy and facts  trump ran a campaign designed to divide the american people along racial lines  trump used hate and fear to the point where his supporters didn t care about his lack of knowledge about the issues clinton even took a shot at trump for calling his win a landslide  despite losing the popular vote by nearly  millions votes and capturing less electoral votes than most presidents in the last  years  including president obama s victories in  and   and bill clinton s in   landslide  i got something like  electoral votes   clinton quipped   that was a landslide  in the end  clinton told the people around him to remain vigilant and alert because we are entering a  post truth era where facts don t matter  here are images of the editorial as it appeared in the bedford pound ridge record review and now we wait for the temper tantrum that trump is likely to throw on twitter featured image  flickr
