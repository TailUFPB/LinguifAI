daniel pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on eric garner  killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes  there was a lengthy investigation  but ultimately no indictment  despite public outrage and widespread protests  now  a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the nypd was with pantaleo and his deadly actions ever since pantaleo killed garner on that new york city street  he has consistently gotten raise after raise  even while being actively investigated for garner s death  and is now making upwards of    a year a report from politico reads  pantaleo earned    in fiscal year   which includes earnings between july    and june     his base pay was    and he earned    in overtime  according to a review of payroll records  he received an additional    in unspecified pay  which could include retroactive pay or bonuses pantaleo s earnings in  represent a  percent increase in overtime pay  and a  percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year  which began shortly before garner s death on july    in that  month period  ending june     pantaleo earned     with    base pay     in overtime and    in additional earnings  records show in fiscal year   which was completed before garner s death and pantaleo s subsequent reassignment  he made     which included    in overtime  an investigation into garner s killing by the department of justice is ongoing and the nypd has still not released the results of their investigation  mayor bill deblasio insists that state law prevents pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released  this claim prompted governor andrew cuomo to call bullshit and he told deblasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge  so far  this is what we do know about pantaleo s record as one of new york s finest  according to latest com   pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a  black  citizen s civil rights  he was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the nypd banned the practice  in april he was named as a defendant with the nypd for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver  so in america  when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof  not only does he get a paid vacation  he also gets one hell of a pay raise  something is very wrong with this picture featured image via latest com
