on friday  donald trump finally got the chance to be in the same room as his favorite world leader  russian president vladimir putin  giddy with the chance to speak with a global leader whom he truly admired  trump made putin meet with him for over two hours  according to secretary of state rex tillerson tillerson also reported that trump brought up the russian interference in the election  opening the meeting by asking putin if he d done any meddling  no one knows why the hell trump would do this  but putin responded exactly as we all expected him to   by denying it reporters at the briefing also seemed stunned that trump actually thought putin would admit to such a thing  especially since trump has defended russia and denied the interference so extensively  even at the expense of america s intelligence agencies and free press   apparently  trump asked putin about the election several times  each time getting a denial from putin  and according to russian foreign minister sergey lavrov  that was all trump needed to convince him or satisfy his need to prove his own innocence in the russian scandal in a report about the meeting  tillerson said  what the two presidents i think rightly focused on is how to we move forward  because it s not clear to me that we will ever come to some agreed upon resolution of that question between the two nations  you can listen to tillerson s recap of what happened between putin and trump below putin and trump s relationship is highly problematic  and their meeting was the focus of the  summit this week  as trump s russia scandal continues to heat up  it was almost too predictable that america s corrupt potus would ask a question like this  which would of course be denied  trump is  once again  trying to make fools out of us all   and we re not buying it featured image via handout   getty images
