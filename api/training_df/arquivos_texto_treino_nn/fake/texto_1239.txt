donald trump probably did not enjoy watching fox news this time around because when neil cavuto went on the air on tuesday he addressed trump s angry rant against the media and will likely be labeled  fake news  in retaliation for the way he did it earlier in the day  trump attacked the media instead of honoring the   american soldiers who died on d day  years ago the fake msm is working so hard trying to get me not to use social media  they hate that i can get the honest and unfiltered message out   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    folks  but if i would have relied on the fake news of cnn  nbc  abc  cbs  washpost or nytimes  i would have had zero chance winning wh  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    course  fox news was not included on that list but cavuto decided to sort of speak out against trump s rant anyway  and he not only informed trump that he is the problem  he accused trump of scapegoating  mr  president  it s not the fake news media that s your problem   cavuto said   it s you  it s not just your tweeting  it s your scapegoating  it s your refusal to see that sometimes you re the one who s feeding your own beast and acting beastly with your own guys  cavuto pointed out that trump focuses too much on settling  endless scores  and that the people around him want him to stop shooting himself in the foot all the time by lashing out on social media and going on these ridiculous rants  trump is only embarrassing himself  if trump really wants the media to stop reporting on his tweets  he should stop tweeting stupid things like attacks on the media and insulting london s mayor in the wake of a terrorist attack  look at the critiques you re now hearing from usually friendly and supportive allies as sort of like an intervention   cavuto concluded   because firing off these angry missives and tweets risks your political destruction  here s the video via youtube donald trump just got called out by fox news  will he listen or will he put them on his enemies list  too featured image  screenshot
