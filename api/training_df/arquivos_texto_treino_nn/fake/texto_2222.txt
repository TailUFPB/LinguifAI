amateur president donald trump loves trumpcare  the gop replacement for obamacare even though everyone hates it  conservative groups  liberals and hospitals are all opposed to trumpcare  it benefits the wealthy while omitting the elderly and sick and if a health care plan doesn t help those who are not feeling well then what good is it  well  if it helps to keep republicans in power  then there s a chance that the sh tty replacement plan will pass anyway  while most of americans were sleeping  the house committee scored an initial triumph in their effort to scuttle former president barack obama s health care overhaul  using a pre dawn vote  and while that took place  congress members were literally giggling  that happened at   a m meanwhile  trump has warned republicans that there will be an  electoral bloodbath  in  if the bill isn t passed  trump is so proud of the crappy health care plan that white house counselor kellyanne conway doesn t want trump s name attached to it  they know it s that bad but eradicating former president barack obama s legacy is more important than the welfare of american citizens trump s newest move is to throw more rallies  just as one does after winning an election  wink wink   after the election  trump went on a thank you tour  then instead of getting to work  the  year old twitter addicted ragey screamy guy held another rally in florida jim acosta  cnn s white house correspondent  tweeted   trump confident health care will pass house but for senate he plans  football stadium rallies  in red states to prod vulnerable dems  trump confident health care will pass house but for senate he plans  football stadium rallies  in red states to prod vulnerable dems  https   t co   jim acosta   acosta  march    if that doesn t work  just blame democrats trump told tea party groups at wh if gop health care plan dies  he will let obamacare fail and let dems take the blame  i m told   jim acosta   acosta  march    don t think trump has thought this out even though obviously what this country needs is never ending rallies to feed his massive ego  it s not just democrats opposing the bill  it s republicans  too  trump  you cannot threaten us with more rallies  we think the dwindling number of supporters at his rallies is hysterical  trump supporters stand to be affected more if and when obamacare is dismantled photo by scott olson getty images
