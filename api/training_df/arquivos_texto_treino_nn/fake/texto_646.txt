donald trump s chief economic adviser and director of the national economic council is gary cohn  trump s secretary of the treasury is steven mnuchin  dina powell is his deputy national security adviser  and steve bannon is the president s chief strategist  what do all of these people have in common  aside from terrible taste in employers they all came from goldman sachs  the wall street powerhouse that made billions of dollars during the subprime mortgage crisis that tanked the american economy beginning in  much has been made of the hypocrisy of donald trump s claims of  draining the swamp   he simultaneously hired and promoted many of the same  and some even worse  swamp dwellers that made washington  d c  into the quagmire of grift  corruption  and greed that constituted the bog that needed its plug pulled  but all we knew until now was that those assholes were still in positions of authority  we had no idea what kind of impact they were having on trump s presidency  outside of tax proposals that screw ordinary americans and drastically reduce rates for people like themselves but now an analysis from the wall street journal is shedding some light on a more nefarious aspect of their influence on trump policy wall street regulators have imposed far lower penalties in the first six months of donald trump s presidency than they did during the first six months of   a comparable period in the obama administration if you re like me  you know that wall street isn t suddenly behaving itself   so why the change it comes from another of trump s campaign promises  to destroy dodd frank  the now  year old bill signed by barack obama that aimed to  reform  wall street after the fallout from the massive recession they were essentially solely responsible for  life savings were lost  the housing market was upended  and ultimately the us economy tanked  resulting in bailouts for the big banks that both parties hated  back on april   trump met with a bunch of ceos and told them they didn t have to worry much longer for the bankers in the room  they ll be very happy because we re really doing a major streamlining and  perhaps  elimination  and replacing it with something else but trump s drive to dismantle the landmark legislation still hasn t taken effect  so in the meantime  what his administration can do to make life easier for wall street   literally the only people who will benefit from the destruction of dodd frank   is to back off the penalty part of the  horrendous  regulations dodd frank imposed  and boy  have they  from the wsj penalties levied against firms and individuals by the securities and exchange commission  the commodity futures trading commission  and the financial industry regulatory authority in the first half of  were down nearly two thirds compared with the first half of    put regulators on track for the lowest annual level of fines since at least    back when dodd frank was signed featured image via drew angerer getty images
