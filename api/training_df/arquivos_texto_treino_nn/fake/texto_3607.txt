someone isn t happy with the current possibilities for secretary of state and is expanding the search  apparently  there are two new candidates  and they aren t politicians  they aren t former or current military  they aren t everyday joes  they aren t even wall street execs  but they might as well be  they re big oil executives and they aren t just any big oil execs  one is rex tillerson  the current ceo of exxonmobil  and the other  lee raymond  is the former ceo of exxonmobil  exxonmobil is our biggest oil giant how bloody fantastic is that  putting big oil in charge of the department of state  arguably the most important cabinet position there is  there could be any number of reasons for this  but trump s insistence that we should have taken iraq s oil is one that comes to mind that s not very likely  though  exxonmobil is partnered with rosneft  russia s state owned oil company  so ultimately  putin is in charge of rosneft and exxonmobil is putin s partner  it could be that trump is trying to tie us more closely to russia  and that seems far more plausible it s also entirely possible trump thinks he might be able to use the department of state to further his own business interests if he nominates a ceo  although the ceo of an oil company isn t exactly who we d think of if this were the case  not to mention that he d be putting someone in a position that could potentially be abused for the purpose of furthering their own business interests abroad tillerson supports the idea of man made climate change  and exxonmobil s position on the paris climate accord is favorable  however  tillerson also made more than   million last year  so there s another wealthy business insider to build that levee on trump s swamp higher so it floods  rather than drains trump kicked off his victory tour today by saying  america first   in an indiana speech  perhaps he s deluded himself into thinking that expanding his search for a secretary of state to big oil executives is exactly that  however  it doesn t really mesh well with what everyday americans thought he meant when he said   america first   it smacks of serious cronyism filling his cabinet with wealthy wall street financiers  ceos  and washington insiders is the polar opposite of what he campaigned on  there s no telling what an exxonmobil ceo would do as secretary of state  there s no telling whether he d even be able to do the job  trump is either continuing to serve his own ends  curry favor somewhere  or he really is completely clueless watch a short report from rachel maddow on this below msnbc has learned that donald trump has expanded his secretary of state search to exxon executives  https   t co   maddow blog   maddowblog  december    image via screen capture from embedded video
