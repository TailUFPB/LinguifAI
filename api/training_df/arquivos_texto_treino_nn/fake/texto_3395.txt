in retaliation for losing the north carolina governor s race  republicans are quickly moving to strip all power from the executive branch democratic candidate roy cooper won a hard fought gubernatorial campaign against cry baby pat mccrory  who refused to concede defeat and challenged the election results in every possible way so now republicans are responding by trying to turn the governorship into a powerless position in one of the most baldfaced power grabs this nation has ever witnessed republicans are literally using the floods and hurricane damage as cover to convene a special session of the legislature to pass bills designed to give themselves more power while taking power away from the governor s office simply because the new governor will be a democrat one bill would merge the ethics and elections boards into one body and would change the overall makeup of the combined board so that republicans control the whole thing  current law gives democrats the majority because cooper is going to be governor another bill would eliminate  percent of the governor s staff  from   employees to only   which would make cooper s job excruciatingly difficult furthermore  republicans are trying to pass a bill requiring state senate approval for cooper s cabinet picks  which means the state of north carolina will likely be denied leadership in various state agencies because republicans will more than likely refuse to approve of anyone cooper picks republicans are literally trying to cripple cooper s administration before he even takes office  but that s not all republicans also introduced a bill that would prevent the state supreme court from reviewing cases for years by requiring cases to go through the state court of appeals first  democrats gained the majority on the supreme court in november while republicans have the majority on the appeals court  so  it s pretty clear what republicans are doing  instead of a court packing bill  it appears we got a court denial bill   southern coalition for social justice director anita earls told the charlotte observer   this proposal seems to delay supreme court review of cases  including those involving citizens  constitutional rights  unconstitutional laws could be in effect for years before the state supreme court would finally get the case and rule  republicans are also trying to take cabinet positions away by turning them into independent agencies whose leaders would be appointed by the lieutenant governor  who happens to be a republican in short  north carolina republicans are screwing over the people and the state because they can t handle losing an election  they are pathetic losers who should be forced out of office before they do any more damage north carolina pastor william barber is reporting that republicans have introduced  bills in all targeting the power of the governor and he is organizing protests against the gop power grab  this is extremism gone amuck   barber told joy reid on wednesday night   these folks are not even republicans  they re on some other world  i mean  my great grandfather was a republican  they are just power hungry  here s the video via youtube the people of north carolina should be outraged by what republicans are doing  they voted for roy cooper as their governor but republicans are trying to sabotage him to prevent him from doing the job the voters elected him to do  republicans are acting like petulant children because they lost the governor s race  if democrats did this  they would be throwing a temper tantrum featured image  wikimedia
