former house speaker and trump supporter newt gingrich has gone completely delusional  having somehow convinced himself that donald trump could somehow manage to get more of the africa american vote  than any republican in modern times   go ahead and laugh  i ll wait   donald trump is the first republican i can remember who is explicitly saying to the african american community   things can be better  but not with democrats in charge    gingrich said during an interview with fox news  if  continues to say it  and if he has the courage to go back to places like chicago and say it  i think he s going get far more votes from the black community than any republican in modern times  the gop nominee has kicked off  minority outreach  efforts in recent weeks  but by all accounts  this has done him little if any favors  trump s grand scheme so far has been to say that people of color should vote for him because their lives suck so bad that they don t really have anything to lose anyway  so why not give him a shot and see what happens  mind you  he has primarily said this to predominately white crowds  which has also drawn criticism on saturday  trump attended a service at a black church in detroit  which turned out to be as much of a failure as the rest of his attempts to pander to african americans  the bigoted billionaire s speech was carefully scripted  but judging by the empty church  nobody really wanted to hear his schpeel anyway  however  looking at how many protesters turned out for the event  it is pretty clear that nobody is buying his latest line of bullsh t watch gingrich lose all touch with reality  here featured image via video screen capture
