comedian bill maher is no fan of republican presidential nominee donald trump  while  during the democratic primary  maher was a supporter of vermont senator bernie sanders  he has urged everyone to get in line behind hillary clinton  and has been singing her praises   and slamming trump   ever since we are all aware by now that hillary  like any human being does at times  has gotten sick  her campaign announced that she has been diagnosed with pneumonia  and she left a   memorial service in new york city abruptly because she was dehydrated and overheated  this stirred up the feverish hopes on the right that she is somehow unfit to be president due to health concerns  of course  this is ridiculous  she ll be fine  her doctor has examined her and she is recovering nicely that is where comedian bill maher comes in  he tweeted that he would vote for  dead hillary  over trump pneumonia  i d vote for dead hillary in this race  she could be patient zero for bubonic plague  still better than  tangerinenightmare  bill maher   billmaher  september    will be seen as inappropriate by some  as joking about death isn t necessarily the best thing to do  but maher s message is clear  hillary in any condition is a much better choice than trump on his best day  with his best behavior  in short  sane people know that donald trump is in no way fit for the presidency  and he is  in fact  nothing more than a dangerous demagogue who should have never gotten this close to the white house do as maher says  for the sake of the nation   vote blue in november featured image via david becker wireimage
