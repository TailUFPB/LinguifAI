the congressional budget office  tasked with providing congress with a nonpartisan assessment of the effects of proposed legislation  has finally released its analysis of the republican healthcare replacement plan   and it s abundantly clearly why paul ryan tried to pass the bill before the cbo was able to take a look  it s a bloodbath for starters  the cbo calculates that as many as  million people will lose their insurance within the year  many of which only recently started having health insurance thanks to the aca  as a  replacement  this plan is clearly inferior  even worse  by    million more people will be uninsured as compared to this very moment  america will see a near total collapse of the health care system as we currently understand it republicans argue that tens of millions more without health insurance is okay because they are saving america money  the cbo suggests the savings would be almost nonexistent relative to the costs  not to mention the human suffering   they calculate that gop s bill will only save around   billion over a decade  compared to the trillions of dollars that are budgeted out each year  that s a rounding error  cbo is out    million more uninsured by     billion of budget savings over a decade  https   t co   marc goldwein   marcgoldwein  march    also argue that this disruption will actually cost america around a trillion dollars in lost revenue  offsetting much of the savings it hopes to gain by cutting spending cbo and jct estimate that enacting the legislation would reduce federal deficits by   billion over the   period  that total consists of   billion in on budget savings and   billion in off budget savings  outlays  would be reduced by    trillion over the period  and revenues would be reduced by    trillion yeah  this is very  very bad and republicans did not want the american people to see this wh reading cbo pic twitter com llkwpxkzei  eric boehlert   ericboehlert  march    s response will likely be the same one that he s been giving all week  the tens of millions who are about to lose their insurance are actually enjoying the  benefits  of choice   choice   in his mind  translates to being rich and having health insurance  also a tax break  or poor and not having health insurance  that s freedom to paul ryan  what a guy the cbo s review only reinforces the fact that the republicans had  years to come up with a replacement plan  failed to do so  and when pressed quickly created one that is inferior to the aca in every single way  the level of incompetence and cruelty required to draft something like this continues to remain astonishing featured image via win mcnamee getty images
