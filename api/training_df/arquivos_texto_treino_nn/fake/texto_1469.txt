following a pattern of handing jobs to the wives of his best friends  trump is set to name callista gingrich the united states ambassador to the vatican   a job she is  naturally  completely unqualified for callista gingrich  the wife of former house speaker newt gingrich  is the preferred nominee to be the next ambassador to the vatican as is typical of trump  he seems to have given little thought to callista s actual experience before deciding to hook her up with the job  gingrich s entire  career  section on wikipedia is three sentences  she hasn t held a job in over a decade  she s never worked in diplomacy  the last of one she had  as a clerk at the house agriculture committee  erupted in scandal when it was exposed that gingrich   so instrumental in pushing for bill clinton s impeachment   had been having a six year affair with callista while the pair worked in washington her only real qualification is that she is a devout catholic  in fact  despite her starting a relationship with newt in a lengthy affair  she made him get an annulment of his last marriage in order to get right in the eyes of the catholic church  because newt had been married for  years  the couple came up with a particularly disgusting way to justify it  they claimed the  year marriage was never valid because newt s ex wife had been previously married   indeed  newt had also been previously married but a mixture of misogyny and hypocrisy allowed them to ignore that  as trump s corruption scandals continue to grow  he is reportedly retreating further into his close circle of  loyal  enablers  after firing the fbi director for  in part  not pledging loyalty to trump or listening to his order to drop the russia investigation  sources in the white house have said that the replacement prospects are being assessed based on their willingness to be trump s lapdog here s a typical rundown mr  trump and his advisers have asked some people whether they believe mr  kelly  the former new york police commissioner  would be  loyal   language similar to what he used in questioning mr  comey s effectiveness  according to people briefed on the discussions hiring the family members of his allies helps keep those allies loyal  mitch mcconnell s wife  elaine chou  is now the secretary of transportation  mike huckabee s daughter is the deputy press secretary  trump s own closest adviser is married to his daughter as a man who walks a very tight rope between impeachment  trump s impulse seems to be to keep his friends so locked up in his administration that they wouldn t dare move against him  if newt or mitch mcconnell tried to call for his removal  they would be dooming their own wives along with him  it s a bold play  and corrupt as hell featured image via drew angerer getty images
