throughout america  tens of thousands of people who live with disabilities have been stripped of their right to vote  usually because someone has been awarded guardianship  but now  some disabled americans are fighting back and demanding that their voting rights be restored in   california resident david rector suffered a traumatic brain injury and was left unable to walk or talk  his fiance  rosalind alexander kasparik was appointed as his conservator  which under state law meant rector also lost his right to vote now  rector has filed a request with the superior court in san diego to have his voting rights restored  alexander kasparik said that despite his disability  rector is fully capable of expressing his wishes to a court clerk  outside of the courthouse  she told supporters that he had been able to communicate his desire to vote while speaking to the judge  he did manage to say through his electronic voice on his eye tracking device   i  david rector  want my voting rights restored  immediately    alexander kasparik said the importance of this cannot be overstated since california law requires that people with disabilities express their desire to vote before they are granted the right to do so rector  who was a producer for npr  is one of at least   people in california who have been stripped of their right to vote because they have a disability  nationally  the number of people who have lost their voting rights under state guardianship laws is not even known david rector and rosalind alexander kasparik  image via the root jennifer mathis  director of policy and legal advocacy at the judge david l  bazelon center for mental health law in washington dc  explained the problem with the current systems that are in place  the problem with those laws is that a determination of guardianship or competence really has nothing to do with someone s ability to vote  they have to do with someone s ability to ensure their basic health and safety needs   she said mathis added that just because a person isn t able to do one thing  that doesn t necessarily mean that they can t do another  however  that isn t a distinction that courts across the country tend to consider  only eleven states do not automatically strip a disabled person of their voting rights when someone is awarded guardianship  but each state has different laws on the issue  some automatically revoke a person s right to vote when someone is awarded guardianship other states make people with disabilities prove that they want to vote  according to mathis  this amounts to disabled people being held to a higher standard and violates the voting rights act  those people end up having to answer questions like  who s the governor  who s the president  who s the mayor  why do you want to vote  how would you vote on a particular issue  and those are exactly the type of questions we never would impose on voters without disabilities   she said mathis noted that a lot of times  people are not even aware that their rights have been stripped because of the complicated nature of the guardianship process last year  californa softened its law  allowing for rights to be restored if a person expressed a desire to vote  republican state senator jeff stone oppposed the measure and argued that  desire  does not necessarily equal  competency  i think this bill is equating desire to vote with the competency to vote  a conservatee may want to drive a car  but may not be competent or able to drive a car and get a license is a perfect example   stone said on aug    the judge in rector s case decided that she wasn t yet convinced that he really wants his right to vote back  despite the fact that he stood in her courtroom and told her point blank to her face that he did alexander kasparik said she s hopeful rector will win his case but said she is still disappointed that he will have to wait even longer  that hurts  i think that hurts david  i know it hurt me  it hurt me for david   she said   and it hurt me for  you know  all those people out   as she spoke  rector let out a loud moan  that s david s response  did you hear it   she asked alexander kasparik said that rector is better informed than most voters and follows the news closely  like the rest of us paying attention the current state of politics in america  rector is eager to vote in november so his voice can be heard  whether or not they can convince a judge of that remains to be seen  though listen to more here  via npr featured image via npr
