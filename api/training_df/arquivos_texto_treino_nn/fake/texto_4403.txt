donald trump s economic proposals would be disastrous for the economy  that s the conclusion that germany s economic ministry concluded in an internal memo  first reported on by the german magazine der spiegel according to the memo  if trump were to be elected president of the united states his economic policies would lead to  a shrinking gross domestic product  fewer jobs and higher unemployment   what s more  the memo says that trump s economic policies violate both u s  and international law  in a more blunt statement  the memo says that trump s proposals are  not feasible  and that they do not  provide the foundation for a realistic economic policy  so to summarize  germany s economics ministry has officially concluded that trump s proposals would destroy the u s  economy and are completely divorced from reality  that s an incredibly strong condemnation from one of the united states  strongest allies  and one of the most powerful economies in the world  and according to analysis by the tax policy center  trump s proposals would reduce income revenue by    and    trillion dollars over the next  years  in september  the economics research firm oxford economics found that if elected president  trump s economic proposals would cause the economy to be   trillion dollars smaller in the year  than experts are currently expecting it isn t particularly easy for economists to create a complete prediction of what the future would look like after a trump administration  there are many factors  such as his policies regarding immigration  that contribute to the various possible outcomes  obviously  it s not yet clear what policies he will put into place when  that being said  it appears more and more to be a matter of finding out exactly just how bad these possible outcomes are than a matter of whether they re bad or not   a trump presidency would unquestionably be an economic disaster for the united states featured image from  alex wong getty images
