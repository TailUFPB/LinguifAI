donald trump reportedly no longer likes being president because he thought he would be able to act like a king thanks to brave staffers  we now know what life is like in the white house for trump trump has had a very tough first three weeks as reality has made it clear that he can t run the government like a business  in a business  when the boss makes a policy it goes into effect and can t be held up or blocked  but trump is finding out that his orders as president can be blocked and trump learned that the hard way after the ninth circuit court ruled against reinstating his travel ban on thursday a business owner can also hire their staff without any interference  but a president s staff is different  cabinet positions must be approved by the senate and democrats are showing republicans that turnabout is fair play by delaying and blocking trump s nominees trump has also had to learn on the job  proving that he should have been paying more attention to briefings and studying rather than posting on twitter  of course  it doesn t really help that he is seeking help answering his questions from people like steve bannon and jared kushner  both of whom are just as inexperienced as trump according to politico in interviews  nearly two dozen people who ve spent time with trump in the three weeks since his inauguration said that his mood has careened between surprise and anger as he s faced the predictable realities of governing  from congressional delays over his cabinet nominations and legal fights holding up his aggressive initiatives to staff in fighting and leaks  trump often asks simple questions about policies  proposals and personnel  and  when discussions get bogged down in details  the president has been known to quickly change the subject   to  seem in control at all times   one senior government official said   or direct questions about details to his chief strategist steve bannon  his son in law jared kushner or house speaker paul ryan  trump has privately expressed disbelief over the ability of judges  bureaucrats or lawmakers to delay   or even stop   him from filling positions and implementing policies paranoia is also running rampant in the trump white house  trump would rather the public not know details of his phone calls to world leaders even though such information has been incredibly revealing in that it has exposed trump s bullying of our allies and his continued sucking up to russia trump has even ordered a witch hunt to find the staffers who are leaking information unlike president obama  who could be leader of the free world and play golf at the same time  trump apparently would rather leave running the country to others so he can play golf with his rich buddies at his mar a lago resort in florida seriously  trump should resign if he can t handle being president  it has only been three weeks and he already hates his new job  and it s only going to get worse for him as he continues to do things that the american people oppose featured image via scott olson getty images
