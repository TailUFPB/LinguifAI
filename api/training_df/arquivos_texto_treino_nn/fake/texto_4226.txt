following a horribly disastrous weekend for donald trump  his campaign manager  kellyanne conway  seems to have found her feet again  she s back on the airwaves trying to tear down hillary clinton in her usual desperate attempts to deflect attention away from her lord and savior s terrible character  in doing so  she brought up hillary s poll numbers with anderson cooper  and the conversation is just absurd kellyanne conway  well  i think hillary clinton s been depressing democratic turnout  my goodness  why is this woman at  percent  she s like the magic   she s  percent in the new nbc news wall street journal poll  she s  percent in a lot of the swing states  cooper  she s ahead of your candidate  though conway  pardon me  well  anderson  she s running as the first female president who has a sitting president and first lady much more popular than she ll ever be  she s got a  cooper  your candidate is below  percent conway  is that a question  you re asking me about  cooper  well  you re saying  percent is bad  but  percent is worse conway  you asked me about hillary clinton  you asked me if i thought   right  one need not be a pollster to know that pardon us while we clear our ears and rapidly blink our eyes to be sure we heard what we think we heard  how on earth does an experienced pollster like conway bring up her deity s opponent s poll numbers as though they re terrible when trump s are considerably worse  how does she not know how math works how does a presidential campaign manager go on national television and make that much of a fool of herself it s both hilarious and sad that cooper had to give her a math lesson that s so basic pre schoolers already know it  watch below conway is actually a perfect match for trump because she s just like him  she gives non answers to questions  and when the conversation starts heading over towards facts  she gets upset  and even throws a fit if she can t turn it around  case in point  speaking on cnn again today  she tried to deflect  deflect  deflect by saying trump bragging about sexual assault happened  to  years ago  then  like a good little trumpkin  she brought up bill clinton s affairs and accusations of sexual assault  which were never proven  which were even longer ago and she called trump a gentleman  har de har har  don t make us laugh too hard   it hurts that she needed a math lesson in order to keep a conversation on track is laughable  at best  she might fancy herself a spin master  but the media s patience with her and her spin is wearing very thin featured image via screen capture from embedded video
