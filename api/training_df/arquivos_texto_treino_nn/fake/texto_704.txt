was it just a slip of the tongue or a sign that donald trump is mentally unfit to be president because it certainly appears to be the latter after trump referred to the cabinet room as his  boardroom  on monday morning days after firing reince priebus and leaving him all by himself on the tarmac after landing at andrews air force base  trump introduced general john kelly to reporters as his new chief of staff after the formal introduction  trump had a cabinet meeting to attend and told reporters  we ll see you in the boardroom  anyone who has seen  the apprentice   which trump formerly hosted  knows that the boardroom is the main set of that reality show where trump grades contestants and fires them seriously so  it really does look like trump actually thinks he is still on  the apprentice  and that he thinks of the presidency as nothing more than reality television here s the video via twitter  we ll see you in the boardroom   president trump tells reporters ahead of cabinet meeting https   t co   nbc politics   nbcpolitics  july    if this  boardroom  meeting is anything like a previous one  you can bet that trump is going to go around the room calling on each and every one of his lackeys to publicly kiss his ass twitter users weren t impressed not surprised  he runs w h like the fake show he was a part of  he still lives in his t v  fantasy boardroom   melissa chandler   kealohalanichun  july    just in  trump has no idea who or where he is   wordlass     july     are we watching the apprentice   wh edition   realdonaldtrump   ann laabs   annlaabs  july    trump disrespects the office of the presidency and the white house by calling the cabinet room the  boardroom   america is not a business  it s a nation  the government is also not a business  running the country and government like a business is not a good idea it s also a bad idea to run the country and government like a reality show  but trump clearly thinks he is on the set of  the apprentice   which demonstrates that he has mental problems that justify invoking the  amendment to remove him from office  because if he really wants to be on reality tv again  leaving office is the only way to do it featured image via screenshot
