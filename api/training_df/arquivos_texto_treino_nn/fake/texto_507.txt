by now we re all familiar with donald trump s speech in front of   boy scouts at their national jamboree last month  when the president rambled like a drunken stepfather  straying from the usual topics of diplomacy and citizenship and turning an  year presidential tradition into a campaign rally before a crowd of adolescents  but the madness didn t stop there according to reports  white house aides told republican senator shelley moore capito of west virginia  host state of this year s quadrennial boy scouts of america national jamboree  that she could fly with him on air force one when he addressed the boy scouts  but only on one condition  that she vote in favor of senate republicans  healthcare bill  at the time the offer was made to capito  republicans were clutching at straws and doing anything possible to salvage their overhaul in the senate in an effort to actually try and come through on one of the main promises donald trump made the entire time he was on the campaign trail  to repeal and replace  the disaster that is obamacare  naturally  capito took the high road and turned down the offer  mainly due to the fact that she hadn t even read the actual text of the bill at the time  however  capito was also one of several republicans senators who had made their doubts clear about it in the first place there were several versions of the plan that failed so the republicans ultimately threw together a  skinny repeal   but that also failed when  voted for it while  voted against  with arizona senator john mccain casting the deciding negative vote  capito also voted against the republican s skinny repeal  sending them back to the drawing board president trump still vows to repeal and replace the affordable care act and is adamant that he will get his bill passed  however  it may take a little more than a ride on air force one to get the votes featured image via joe raedle getty images
