this weekend  donald trump will visit saudi arabia   and the country is going out of its way to make him comfortable everyone knows that donald trump basically has the diet of an unhealthy toddler   he survives entirely on fast food and junk  it s previously been reported that trump prefers burgers and meatloaf  caesar salads and spaghetti  see s candies and diet coke  and he shuns tea  coffee  and alcohol  this was a concern for the potus  first trip overseas  but saudi arabia has come to the rescue  during trump s visit  he will be served steak   which trump likes burnt to a crisp   with ketchup  his favorite  after all the associated press reported on the preparations that must be made for trump s visit  stating that there were extra steps that needed to be taken just for trump  people with knowledge of the planning for trump s trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu  all the meat will have been butchered in a shariah compliant halal manner as per islamic custom  and of course  trump will probably still find a way to be difficult and ungrateful  the associated press wrote  trump s hosts on his upcoming trip are well aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy  even if things are going perfectly  we re sure trump will find a way to complain  he has made outlandish requests before  and just recently canceled a trip to israel because he wasn t allowed to land his helicopter on top of the mountain fortress of masada  this kind of diva behavior is humiliating for the country  and we can bank on trump have some sort of issue while he s overseas featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
