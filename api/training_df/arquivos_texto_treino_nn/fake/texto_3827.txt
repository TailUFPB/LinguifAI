in the wake of election day and donald trump s win  many americans have been left scratching their heads and wondering just what the heck happened  according to a report by mcclatchy  some civil rights groups say that voter suppression is what happened kristen clarke  the president and executive director of the lawyers  committee for civil rights under law  said that in hindsight   we will find that voter suppression figured prominently in the story surrounding the  presidential election  while voter suppression is hardly the only factor that brought us to this point  as mcclatchy explains  it did play an important role  fourteen states had restrictive new voting laws on the books for the first time in a presidential election this year  according to the brennan center for justice at nyu school of law  alabama  arizona  indiana  kansas  mississippi  nebraska  new hampshire  ohio  rhode island  south carolina  tennessee  texas  virginia and wisconsin the laws included a mix of photo id requirements for voters  cuts to early voting opportunities and curbs on voter registration activity  these laws began to spread across the country after the midterm elections of   supposedly to protect against voter fraud  which is virtually nonexistent by the way the brennan center reports that   states have imposed stricter voter id laws  seven made registration more difficult  six have cut early voting opportunities and three have made it harder to restore voting rights to people with criminal convictions   the center explains that these laws  which have been fueled by race and partisanship  disproportionately affect minorities  the poor  and younger voters  all groups who tend to lean to the left clarke said on thursday that systemic barriers weren t the only obstacles voters faced this year  long lines at polling places  voters whose names were missing from registration lists  a lack of assistance for non english speaking voters  and  poll workers who requested strict photo id in states where no such id was required  also made it much harder to cast a ballot than it should have been wade henderson  the president of the leadership conference on civil and human rights  said that groups monitoring the election  have documented beyond any doubt that voter suppression and a conscious effort to shave off  or  percent of the vote in key states  in all likelihood  influenced the outcome of this election  activists also voiced concerns about purges of  inactive  voters from registration rolls in numerous states and a drastic reduction in polling places across the country a report by the leadership conference found that voting locations were reduced in about  percent   or    of  counties that were previously covered by section  of the voting rights act  the result  there were  fewer sites in which to cast a ballot in those jurisdictions with histories of discriminatory voting practices it is worth noting that many of these laws were only able to be enacted because of the gutting of the voting rights act  while voter suppression is hardly the only factor responsible for trump s win  it very well may have been what tipped the scales in his favor featured image via sandbox news
