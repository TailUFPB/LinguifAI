earlier today  donald trump whined about being held to a  ridiculous standard  in his first  days as potus  despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first  days  by now most of us know that trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the white house  and there have been far more failures than successes now  the white house is joining in on the mounting pressure for trump to actually do something before his first  days come to an end  the trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is   and of course they had to lie to make that possible the white house has just claimed that congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week  and that the government will be open despite the fact that the republicans don t have any votes lined up and congress will only be in session for half the week  according to cnbc  the white house hopes language on a possible health care deal can come as early as friday or saturday  leaving the potential for an agreement next week  a white house official told cnbc  the senate budget committee is assisting with the draft  which would be introduced first in the house  this is absolutely insane  and clearly a response to the fact that trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first  days and the trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it  in just  days  trump expects the house to vote on health care  examine trump s tax plan  and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win  that s not going to happen  and the american people know it  here s the overwhelmingly negative response to trump and his  accomplishments        featured image via pool   getty images
