we have really got to stop allowing donald trump to control the conversation  every time anything negative about him comes out in the media  he somehow  in someway  usually via twitter  is able to pivot even the most expert journalist away from what we should actually be focusing on trump did this throughout his entire election  and he continues to do this now for instance  right after the trump university settlement came out  where trump seemingly admitted to fraud by paying out   million  he quickly went crazy on twitter attacking the broadway hit musical hamilton and saturday night live to shift the focus to that instead  he knows he s going to be scrutinized  so he s masterfully figured out how to control what is scrutinized some people  however  are figuring this all out  albeit  a little too late  because trump already manipulated himself into the white house for example  adam khan just tweeted out hey journalists distracted by trump s hamilton shenanigans he lied to federal election commission underreported his debt to bank of china https   t co ifhvdjwhpy  adam khan   khanoisseur  november    explaining it further new  trump owes   million to bank of china  goldman sachs  more than twice the amount he has publicly claimed pic twitter com   adam khan   khanoisseur  august     under normal circumstances  that alone would have disqualified mr  trump from running for office  yet this year was anything but normal while hillary clinton was treated by the media like the spawn of satan for having a private server at home like many  many people and businesses do for security purposes  trump was able to get away with admitting to sexual assault  not showing his taxes  having a fraud case going to court  insulting the disabled and prisoners of war  being as racist and misogynistic as his heart desired  and he was still untouchable until the media stops allowing themselves to be manipulated by trump  nothing is going to change  he s a smarmy businessman who conned his way into the white house  and the media played his game which helped pave the way we need to wake up  call him out  do our due diligence  and hold that man accountable for his actions featured photo by chip somodevilla getty images
