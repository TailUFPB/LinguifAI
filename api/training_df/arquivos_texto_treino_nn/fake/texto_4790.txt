breibart editor milo yiannopoulos is the obnoxious little twerp who got banned from twitter for inciting his fans to viciously attack comedian leslie jones in an effort to humiliate her now karma has finally turned the tables on yiannopoulos during an interview with abc s terry moran that will air on nightline this friday  yiannopoulos was the one who got humiliated this time as moran took this asshole who has the maturity of a  year old boy to school yiannopoulos began by calling himself a  virtuous troll  who is  doing god s work  if leslie jones were right here  would you say   you look like a dude    moran asked  yeah  probably   yiannopoulos replied  you would say that to her   a disgusted moran said once again  yiannopoulos has zero remorse for his ugly attack and said he would do it again  which led to moran smacking the breitbart bully down  then you re an idiot   moran told him yiannopoulos argued that he is not responsible for what his fans do even though it was his sexism and hate that made jones a target for harassment in the first place  does justin bieber have an obligation to his fans  i m sorry for being popular  but i am not responsible for what   people on the internet say  i m responsible for what i say  yeah  and what you said incited your fans to attack as if they were your own personal army of internet trolls  if justin beiber launched a twitter tirade against selena gomez that resulted in his fans attacking her  he would be responsible for it  just like yiannopoulos is responsible for the attack on jones words have consequences and yiannopoulos is finding that out the hard way moran responded by putting yiannopoulis in his place with an epic smackdown that is incredibly enjoyable to watch  you re going to go after somebody s body to denigrate their ideas  what grade are you in  are you a  year old boy  because somebody doesn t have a weight that you think is proper  that s revolting  and yiannopoulos responded by being a misogynist asshole  i ll tell you what s revolting  what s revolting is the body positivity movement  what s revolting is this idea now that you can tell women that they ll be healthy at any size  here s the video via youtube trolls like yiannopoulos should be banned from using the internet entirely  he should not have a platform to bully others and spread his hate  and of course  he s a supporter of donald trump  which makes him even more of a prick  but you can bet that sexist trolls like yiannopoulos will become even more emboldened if the republican nominee should win in november  which makes it even more important that he lose by a humiliating landslide featured image  screenshot
