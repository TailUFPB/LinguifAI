on monday obama used his clemency powers to grant  pardons and  commutations according to the white house  which was the most individual acts of clemency in a single day by a president in us history today obama doubled the amount of pardons he s given  but he still has pardoned less prisoners than any other modern president  however  he s still used his powers of clemency over   times  just a less powerful version  commutations  including those that were done today  obama has now commuted the sentences of   people  including  life sentences  most of the sentences he shortened were federal prison inmates with lengthy  mandatory minimum drug sentences convicted during the war on drugs that s been happening over the last three decades  now obama s completed more acts of clemency since any other president of the us since president truman last year obama granted  pardons and commutations around the same time of year  which at the time was the largest single day use of his clemency power  he s continued this pattern of granting  holiday  pardons  and has received criticism for it  with critics calling it a  broken process   according to obama  it s another step forward in upholding our fundamental ideals of justice and fairness   besides the iranian nuclear deal  the last four rounds of pardons obama s granted it s been this time of year however  there may possibly more pardons coming  in august obama said  by the time i leave office  the number of pardons that we grant will be roughly in line with what other presidents have done   with only  days left in obama s term  and  pardon s short of being in  roughly in line  it s quite possible we ll see more pardons before obama leaves featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
