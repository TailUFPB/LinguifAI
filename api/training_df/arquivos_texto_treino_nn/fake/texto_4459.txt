since   the arizona republic  now the state s largest and most popular newspaper  has seen over  presidential elections  and every time  they have endorsed the republican contender   eisenhower  nixon  goldwater  ford  reagan  h w  bush  dole  bush  mccain  and romney this year  something changed dramatically for the editorial board   they put country over party  and endorsed hillary clinton  the democrat  over donald trump  the republican once again  hillary has broken a glass ceiling writing that hillary clinton is the only candidate who can lead america forward  the editorial board did not mince words with their hatred for donald trump   the  republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified   the board writes just after pointing out that they have a deep admiration for conservative principles the board also pointed out that hillary is by no means a conservative  rather a centrist   but in the grand scheme of things  trump s bombastic  offensive  divisive and racial language is contrary to what america stands for  and this against what they argue to be real conservatism trump s conversion to conservatism is recent and unconvincing  there is no guarantee he will name solid conservatives to the supreme court  trump s inability to control himself or be controlled by others represents a real threat to our national security  his recent efforts to stay on script are not reassuring  they are phony ouch  not only is trump a faux conservative in their eyes  he s a con man who s trying to lie his way into the presidency  luckily  the arizona republic sees right through his xenophobic nonsense while chiding trump for his bromance with russia and complete lack of world knowledge and foreign diplomacy  the paper highlights hillary s ability to take a composed and headstrong approach to the issues facing america abroad clinton has argued america s case before friendly and unfriendly foreign leaders with tenacity  diplomacy and skill  she earned respect by knowing the issues  the history and the facts  she is intimately familiar with the challenges we face in our relations with russia  china  the middle east  north korea and elsewhere  she ll stand by our friends and she s not afraid to confront our enemies quite possibly the biggest factor in the republic s decision was trump s treatment of mexico and the hardworking  honest people that live there and the immigrants that  enrich  arizona culturally  economically and diplomatically when you i aunt mexico and its people  you insult arizona and its people trump is learning the hard way that words have consequences  and that decent people and decent entities will stand up to his bully pulpit that is why the arizona republic put people over party and made the right decision featured image via justin sullivan getty images
