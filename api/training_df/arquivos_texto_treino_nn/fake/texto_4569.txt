a dallas police officer  seeing red after several shootings of police officers  has decided he s had enough and he and his lawyer  are going to punish everyone they absolutely can for allegedly conspiring to create a race war  yes  this is the same  race war  that the entire right sees whenever people call attention to the racism that permeates our justice system police sergeant demetrick pennie  a  year veteran of the dallas police force  is suing leaders of the black lives matter movement   along with the rev  al sharpton  billionaire george soros  louis farrakhan  former attorney general eric holder  president obama  hillary clinton  and many more  the bizarre part is that he and his attorney  right wing nut larry klayman  actually see an active conspiracy here  this is a civil action for the deprivation of plaintiffs and other members of the class herein of their civil rights  conspiracy against the plaintiffs and other members of the class herein civil rights and obstruction of justice to prevent the enforcement of civil rights  the complaint also says this  klayman received a call from defendant new black panther party and black lives matter acting in concert with the other defendants  all of whom are working together to ignite and continue the race war they have fomented  threatening to kill him and his family   in discussing the july  murders of dallas police officers  the lawsuit states that the shooting suspect claimed he was acting alone  and was not affiliated with black lives matter or anything else  an investigation into his background allegedly revealed that he was a member of the nation of islam and the new black panther party apparently  that s enough to tie him and these groups directly to hillary  obama  holder  and everyone else  although it s hard to see how klayman and pennie actually know there s a conspiracy here it s like they just know   the complaint repeatedly states something along these lines  defendants  acting in concert  and each and every one of them are inciting the imminent serious bodily injury and killing of police officers and other law enforcement persons acting in concert  means there s a knowing cooperation between two or more people to accomplish something  there s no real  concrete evidence that anybody is actively working with anyone else to incite violence against police officers  yet  they keep using that phrase  we do not think it means what they think it means  either that  or a frightening amount of paranoia fueled this  or both it s probably both the complaint also accuses everyone of spreading the fiction that police officers  are intentionally and systematically targeting and hunting blacks and other minorities to kill them for no reason other than racism or sport   exaggerate much  klayman  lords  gods and minor deities  it s amazing these conclusions are in an actual complaint filed in an actual court other known problems  such as arresting or shooting black people not guilty of any crimes  and that minorities are arrested and prosecuted disproportionately to the general population  are fiction on the planet from whence this complaint arose  too klayman  however  has been looking for a reason to file a suit like this for some time  back in july  he threatened to sue obama  farrakhan  sharpton and black lives matter for putting his life in danger  as a white person   at the time  he said things like this  it is no wonder some cops  fearing for their lives in this anti white  anti semitic and anti christian environment  sometimes are prone to literally pull the trigger too quickly  he s not exactly the most credible person here  he has an axe to grind  and it doesn t make pennie look good for retaining him for this suit  or did klayman persuade pennie to finally give him what he needs to make a suit stick  we may never know  the discovery phase of this lawsuit ought to be interesting the entire  page complaint is below featured image by spencer platt getty images
