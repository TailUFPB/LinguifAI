while donald trump is urging gun owners to assassinate hillary clinton before the election  kentucky gop governor matt bevin is suggesting a bloody rebellion if she is elected in a move that should make kentucky voters hang their heads in shame  bevin appeared before a crowd at the values voter summit on saturday and instantly made conservative  christians  even more paranoid and bloodthirsty than they already were by claiming that hillary clinton is a tyrant who will destroy america if she is allowed to be in charge for very long  we don t have multiple options   he said   we re going one way or we re going the other way  politically  spiritually  morally  economically  from a liberty standpoint  we re going one way or we re going the other way  bevin painted liberals as un american for preventing conservative  christians  from declaring america a christian nation and instituting the bible as the law of the land in place of the constitution  they try to silence us  they try to get us to shut our mouths  they try to embarrass us  don t be embarrassed  we were not redeemed to have a spirit of timidity  be bold  there s enough neville chamberlains in the world  be a winston churchill there are quite enough sheep already  be a shepherd  after declaring that  america is worth fighting for  ideologically   bevin suggested spilling blood if that s what it takes to keep hillary clinton and the democrats out of power  somebody asked me yesterday  i did an interview and they said   do you think it s possible  if hillary clinton were to win the election  do you think it s possible that we ll be able to survive  that we would ever be able to recover as a nation  and while there are people who have stood on this stage and said we would not  i would beg to differ  but i will tell you this  i do think it would be possible  but at what price  at what price  the roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what  the blood  of who  the tyrants to be sure  but who else  the patriots  whose blood will be shed  it may be that of those in this room  it might be that of our children and grandchildren  i have nine children  it breaks my heart to think that it might be their blood that is needed to redeem something  to reclaim something  that we through our apathy and our indifference have given away  here s the video via youtube earlier this year at one of his rallies  donald trump suggested that  second amendment people  could do something to prevent hillary clinton from picking supreme court nominees  if she gets to pick her judges  nothing you can do  folks  although the second amendment people   maybe there is  i don t know  and now a very extreme conservative republican governor is taking that idea and running with it  proving that hillary was right to call trump supporters deplorable featured image  screenshot
