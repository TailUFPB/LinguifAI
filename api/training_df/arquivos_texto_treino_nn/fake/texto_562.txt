donald trump has not been having a good weekend  he was blasted by congressional members on both sides of the aisle due to his failure to immediately condemn white supremacists  the ku klux klan  neo nazis  and other hate groups who caused murderous riots in charlottesville  virginia  he was finally forced to do so days later  but many are still saying it is too little too late  therefore  it comes as no surprise that trump wanted to go to the place he feels most comfortable  trump tower in new york city now  it s no secret that new yorkers hate trump  therefore  one would think that he wouldn t want to go there  but  alas  go there he did  as was to be expected  protesters awaited him  their display this time was so over the top that trump has to be fuming  the  resistance folks in new york city really outdid themselves this time  by presenting trump with a large likeness of himself as a rat  here is an image of what they did this is absolute gold  and is sure to get under trump s very  very thin skin  we might be stuck with the orange fascist for now  but that won t stop  resistance minded patriots from heckling him whenever we can keep it up  new york city  resistance  make trump squirm on his own turf featured image via spencer platt getty images
