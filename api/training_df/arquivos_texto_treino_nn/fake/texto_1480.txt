donald trump has had what is arguably the most bizarre week in the history of the american presidency  he has careened from outrage to outrage  lie to lie  and lawless action to lawless action   all in the span of five days  starting with his firing of fbi director james comey because he threw a massive tantrum over the trump russia collusion investigation  well  there is one respected american who has had about enough of trump s acting as if he is above the law  journalist dan rather rather took to his facebook page to rip trump to shreds as only he can  he begins by talking about how long he s lived and how many presidencies he s lived through   including richard nixon s   and then moves on to the extraordinary disgrace that is the donald trump presidency  rather says  in part but i have never seen a week where a president of our nation has behaved with such a cavalier disregard for the norms and institutions of our democracy  and it now seems like the investigation is expanding into trump s business dealings  the comparisons with richard nixon are plentiful these days  but even he did not seem so untethered from our basic governance  and i have never seen so many members of a political party rally around incompetence  intemperance  and inanity dan rather is correct  donald trump makes richard nixon look like a boy scout  trump is downright dangerous  and he must be restrained  if only the congress would do their jobs and speak out  and act as the check on this president that they are supposed to be  hell  they were more than happy to be a check on president obama   and he didn t even do anything that was lawless this is the republican party putting partisan politics and their own political futures above the good of the republic  it is shameful  and that is why we must vote them out of congress in  mr  rather  thank you for speaking truth to power  we need voices like yours in these dark and dire times read the entire brilliant post below featured image via kirk irwin getty images for siriusxm
