hurricane matthew isn t the only hurricane  nor the biggest one  hitting the united states right now because hurricane trump struck again on friday  looks like we dodged the bullet a little bit with that storm   maher began in reference to the hurricane in florida   however  with donald trump talking about women  it has been upgraded to a category five shitstorm  newly discovered audio caught the republican nominee having an incredibly offensive conversation in the  with billy bush on a hot mic about women during an appearance on access hollywood  trump bragged about how he is so famous that he can walk up to any woman and just  grab them by the p ssy  and that whenever he sees a beautiful woman he just starts kissing them  apparently even when they don t want him to do so maher said that not knowing that the mic was still on  is one indication that you re a fucking idiot  and proceeded to quote trump s remarks while talking like him  you know i m automatically attracted to beautiful  i just start kissing them  i don t even wait  when you re a star you can do anything  you can grab them by the pussy  grab them by the pussy    maher exasperatingly repeated before using the words to hit trump where it hurts the most   sounds like what hillary did to trump at the first debate  is this really happening   maher asked again  the guy who s running for president says  grab them by the p ssy    maher said he can t wait for the sunday talk shows to hear how the trump surrogates are going to spin this   look  george  people are tired of washington politicians who won t grab the voters by the p ssy  donald trump and mike pence are making sexual assault great again  maher spent the remainder of his epic monologue slamming mike pence  informing the  family values  conservative who believe marriage is  the glue that holds societies together  that when trump hugs pence s wife   that s not glue  here s the video via youtube donald trump is a sexual predator who should be in prison  not the white house  this latest revelation is so bad that paul ryan disinvited trump to his campaign rally in wisconsin  the question is whether they will have the balls to remove trump from the ticket entirely  because if they continue to stick with him as their nominee  every republican on the ballot in november should be defeated  featured image via screenshot
