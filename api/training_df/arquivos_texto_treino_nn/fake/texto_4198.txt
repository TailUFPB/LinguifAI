appearing on cbs this morning  republican vice presidential nominee mike pence was left floundering for responses to questions he clearly did not want to be asked for one  he was asked to respond to michelle obama s remarks surrounding his running mate donald trump being a sexual predator yesterday  while speaking at a clinton campaign event in new hampshire  the first lady stated  this is not something that we can ignore  it s not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season  because this was not just a lewd conversation  this wasn t just locker room banter  this was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior and actually bragging about kissing and groping women using language so obscene that many of us worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the tv  and to make matters worse  it now seems very clear that this isn t an isolated incident   it s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life  she added  too many are treating this as just another day s headline  as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted  as if this is normal  be clear  this is not normal  this is not politics as usual  this is disgraceful  it is intolerable  and it doesn t matter what party you belong to  democrat  independent  republican   no woman deserves to be treated this way  none of us deserves this kind of abuse  this isn t about politics  it s about basic human decency  this morning co host norah o donnell asked pence about these remarks  but pence decided to respond with this  look i have a lot of respect for the first lady  but i don t understand the basis of her claim  someone flabbergasted that pence was seemingly saying that michelle obama went too far  o donnell followed up with  you don t believe his language was  sexually predatory  he was then left to put together words  in no particular order  that tried to defend trump and his actions  keep in mind pence condemned trump s remarks that came out of the leaked access hollywood tape  but now he doesn t seem to believe any of the victims coming forward that state trump did exactly what he stated on that leaked tape someone should let him know he can t talk out of both sides of his mouth on this issue  someone else should let him know that you don t halfass insult first lady michelle obama and think he can get away with it pence then pivoted fast away from the questions that left him flat on his face if pence wasn t such a jerk himself  you could almost feel bad for the guy for needing to defend his sexual predator running mate  but this is might just be sweet karma for all the sh tty things pence has done legislatively to women and the lgbt community over the years watch the video here mike pence is so pathetic   patheticpence pic twitter com   sarah wood   sarahwoodwriter  october    image via video screen capture
