donald trump s rollout of trumpcare is already crashing and burning  just like everything he tries to do    and his white house press secretary certainly isn t helping him  earlier today  sean spicer tried to address the questions surrounding the much hated trumpcare plan  and accidentally admitted that tons of people are going to lose their health care coverage because of it spicer basically said that it didn t matter how many people would be covered under the new horrible obamacare replacement you can watch spicer f  k up in the video below spicer went off on obamacare  incorrectly stating that people had cards under the affordable care act  yet they were not receiving care  this is absolutely false  as obamacare had measures put in place to guarantee that people would be covered by insurance companies   unlike trumpcare  which doesn t have any of those regulations so far  the gop has fallen silent over how many people would be covered under their obamacare replacement measure  they purposely avoided running trumpcare past the congressional budget office   a move that is being highly criticized for its lack of transparency  leader nancy pelosi suggested that this secrecy was to prevent word getting out that millions of americans will lose their coverage under the new plan  this looks like yet another thing that trump won t be able to deliver  let s not forget that trump promised again and again that his new health care plan would cover everyone  he once said  i am going to take care of everybody everybody s going to be taken care of  much better than they re taken care of now  trump also promised america that he was so good at making deals that the government would basically pay for everyone s coverage how do we go from everyone being covered to not being able to even say how many people were going to be covered   and trying to spin the issue to be about people not getting care  what spicer is doing is trying to reframe trump s campaign promises  because the white house knows they can t be delivered  trumpcare is an abomination compared to obamacare  and millions of americans are going to suffer because of the gop s incompetence featured image is a screenshot
