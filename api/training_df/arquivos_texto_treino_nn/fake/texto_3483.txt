republicans  won  the  presidential election  why  well  besides an avalanche of racial demagoguery  they  appealed  the white working class in rust belt america  they became the unsung heroes  of the middle class struggle to survive  economic anxiety  as they called it  ran rampant well  their commitment to the white working class lasted roughly three weeks  and now it s back to square one  and the first victims of the republicans newfound power  coal miners yes  coal miners  the very people that represent the backbone of manual labor in the united states  from the hills of west virginia all the way down to kentucky  coal miners are what keeps america s energy bills under control and our electricity efficient  democrats  like hillary clinton  lost big in coal country because of a  failure  to  connect with them  even though she was the only candidate to offer them alternative programs to the dying industry   trump and the republicans pounced  promising them revitalization and a basket of goodies to make them great again and now the united states may face a looming shutdown because of them  why  republicans don t want to pay their healthcare and pension plans that s right  the same people who promised to be their champions are now turning their backs labeling the plan a  bailout   republicans are stonewalling democratic senator joe manchin  who offered an amendment to the chief funding bill of the united states government that will revitalize the united mine workers  health and pension system  which went broke because of the   financial crisis if republicans continue to block the legislation   which would lead to a shutdown   over   retired coal miners and their families will lose their healthcare and pension plans  manchin s amendment would offer temporary assistance until april  when another budget would have to be considered  working with manchin is west virginia s other senator  republican shelly moore capito and democrat sherrod brown of ohio  majority leader mitch mcconnell also supports the amendment being added but blocked it from consideration last year mcconnell  however  has asked that democrats step aside and not block the continuing resolution over the miner s benefits aside from moore capito and mitch mcconnell  no republicans have expressed support for the measure  and the opponents have called it a  government bailout  that sets a precedent to  bail out  other troubled pension systems and healthcare benefits if republicans want to see what a precedent looks like  they should ask trump about his carrier deal so democrats are accused of turning their backs on the working class  meanwhile  democrats joe manchin and sherrod brown are spearheading an amendment that helps that very class of workers  and republicans are slamming it as a  government bailout   if republicans don t get manchin  moore capito and brown on board with a continuing resolution  it won t pass so bankers can get a trillion dollars in tax payer bailouts  but coal miners  who were promised their pensions and healthcare and who power our country  get squat and demonized democrats have been  are  and will be for the working class  they may not be as theatrical and slick as republicans  but let today s example show who really has the back of the working class  only one party is instilling economic anxiety in them   and it isn t the democrats every pundit better be reassessing this issue watch senator manchin deliver remarks featured image via alex wong getty images
