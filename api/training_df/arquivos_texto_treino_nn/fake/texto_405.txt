despite the fact that donald trump and his fanbase try to convince everyone that they re not racist whenever they get called out  the verdict is in   and it s exactly as we suspected conservatives have been trying to convince everyone that their politics and values are about lowering taxes and minimizing big government  glossing over the fact that most of the time their policies will hurt minorities  well  there s finally a proven reason for that   it s because  plain and simple  conservatives are racist as hell  and even worse  they have a particular fear of african americans in a study reported by vox  trump supporters can be set off just by looking at a picture of a black person  and just seeing one can significantly change how they feel about a policy  this was discovered thanks to a new study by political scientists at colgate and the university of minnesota  which shed light on some of trump supporters  most racist behaviors in the study  conservative participants were asked how they feel about housing assistance  the participants were divided in their support  however  when the researchers threw in a twist  it was discovered that trump voters were way more likely to support housing assistance when they were shown an image of a white person  when they were shown a picture of a black person  it was a completely different story and it gets worse   not only were the trump supporters less supportive  but they actually became angry  just by looking at an african american person  trump supporters got mad  the authors of this study  which was called supporters and opponents of donald trump respond differently to racial cues  an experimental analysis   wrote we find that white trump supporters randomly exposed to a black  versus a white  man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing assistance policy were more opposed to the policy  angrier about the policy  and more likely to blame beneficiaries for their situation so now we know that no matter how conservatives try to twist their justifications for not supporting certain causes that directly affect black people  the underlying issue is really that they re racist featured image via mark wallheiser    getty images
