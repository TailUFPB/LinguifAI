donald trump and his team are not only some of the most corrupt people we ve ever had infiltrate our government  but they re also some of the most cowardly   and trump has just set an example to his team that will likely give way to even more spineless behavior in an interview with cbs s face the nation  trump actually cut the interview short  ending it abruptly by literally fleeing from reporter john dickerson when dickerson dared to question trump about his unfounded claims that former potus barack obama wiretapped him  trump has still not been able to prove this  dickerson was speaking to trump inside the oval office when the discussion turned to trump s relationship with obama  and trump made some extremely disrespectful  inflammatory remarks  trump said he d  had some difficulties  with obama over  what happened with surveillance   when dickerson cornered trump on why he d called his predecessor  sick  and  bad  in his wiretapping accusations in march  trump practically had a breakdown from being put on the spot while the cameras rolled  trump gave this incoherent response  i don t stand by anything  i just  you can take it the way you want  i think our side s been proven very strongly  and everybody s talking about it  and frankly it should be discussed  i think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens  i think it s a very big topic  and it s a topic that should be number one  and we should find out what the hell is going on  trump only seemed to get more frustrated and edgy as dickerson tried to get to the bottom of trump s babbling  trump said  you don t have to ask me because i have my own opinions  you can have your own opinions  dickerson had tried to hold trump accountable  and it was just too much for the man baby  trump suddenly ended the interview by straight up walking away from dickerson  saying  okay  that s enough  thank you  thank you very much  you can watch this awkward  highly unpresidential exchange below featured image is a screenshot
