trump is panicking to the point where he s not sleeping and he even tried to hold five rallies across half the country on sunday  and failed miserably   he s panicking so much that he filed what s possibly the most frivolous election lawsuit ever against clark county for violating nevada election law by allowing a polling place in a market in vegas to stay open until the line was gone nevada law allows anyone who was in line at the time the polls close to still vote  and when lines are exceptionally long  that means polling places stay open late  trump tried to claim that the cardenas market  which was serving primarily latino voters  was allowing people to get in line after the  p m  close he also wanted records from that particular polling place  information about specific poll workers  and for ballots to be kept away from machines that were supposedly problematic and he got shot down  royally  district judge gloria sturman not only rejected all his requests  but she voiced concern that revealing that information could put poll workers in danger  have you watched twitter  do you watch any cable news shows  people can get information and harass them  she also said  why would i order  to make available to you information about people who work at polls when its not already a public requirement to do so  so that those people can be harassed for doing their civic duty i m just puzzled how you think you will use this evidence anyway  and she said she couldn t force the election judges to do what they were already doing by law  which is keeping records and preserving ballots trump was playing innocent about this  saying at the time he filed that complaint  we have to keep the system honest  oh please  he wouldn t know what honest was if it smacked him upside the head  this was probably one of the more dishonest things he s done since voting started  and it was likely with a goal of invalidating the votes of latinos who were probably voting for hillary clinton  whether that could actually happen or not  that was probably the goal on trump s warped planet  doing something about those votes could have given him an edge  in reality  probably not  but we re not talking reality here  tonight s impending drubbing must really be terrifying him to pull something like this featured image by scott eisen via getty images
