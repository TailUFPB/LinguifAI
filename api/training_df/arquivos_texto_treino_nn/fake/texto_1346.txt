during the presidential campaign  donald trump was thrilled when great britain voted to leave the european union  now that he s on his first world trip as blotus and after calling one of our greatest allies  bad  very bad   he finally fessed up his real beef with the european union  and if you haven t guessed  it s that it s too hard for him to get richer while trump did love one thing about europe  the belgian chocolates  which he called  the best   which is high praise coming from the man who claims to know a lot about chocolate  at least in cake form our national laughing stock didn t leave it there  though  he admitted that the real problem he has with europe has nothing to do with global economics or even immigration  trump s problem with europe is that it takes him too long to open golf courses according to one source to the guardian  he made a lot of references to his personal journey  he explained  for example  the functioning of europe on the basis of his difficulties in doing business in ireland   one source told the francophone paper a second source told the newspaper   every time we talk about a country  he remembered the things he had done  scotland  he said he had opened a club  ireland  he said it took him two and a half years to get a licence and that did not give him a very good image of the european union  one feels that he wants a system where everything can be realised very quickly and without formalities  this  in a nutshell  perfectly encapsulates most of what is wrong with trump  while he s playing the role of world leader  in reality  his world view is so small that if it s not directly about him  he tunes out  he won t even read his national security briefings unless the authors pepper his name frequently throughout  even then  the briefings have to be short and it s best if they contain pictures even beyond that  trump is a businessman  and regardless of the fact that he technically works for us  he s still only working to enrich himself featured image via franco origilia getty images
