after weeks of blubbering on twitter and into every microphone he could find about how un american nfl players who kneel during the national anthem are  donald trump just did the un american equivalent of drunkenly slapping his dick on the table in the middle of a black tie dinner during a self congratulatory interview with his number one sycophant  sean hannity  trump found himself absolutely bewildered by a military ceremony that his supporters have been breathlessly posting on facebook and referring to as  what respect for the military looks like   the playing of  retreat  on the bugle  the song is played as the american flag is brought down the pole at the end of the day and secured for the night the commander in chief of nine months had no idea what was happening as the song began to play  as it begins  he first jokes with the human pile of shit he s sitting across from  then turns to play to the audience  what a nice sound that is  are they playing that for you or for me  they re playing that in honor of his ratings  did you see how good his ratings were  he s beating everybody  now  it s not like donald trump was  in uniform  as the official leader of america s military while he sat there with the second biggest  asshole on television  but the fact remains that it s his title  especially in a setting where servicemembers are present  one military newspaper  georgia s fort gordon globe  describes expected behavior like so screen capturei think you ll note i didn t describe donald trump doing anything even close to any of that whatsoever as the bugle played its end of day call  you can watch for yourself complete ignorance of military custom is nothing less than exactly what i would expect out of hypocritical donald trump  he s been freaking out about nfl players   who are protesting for their very lives   silently kneeling or sitting during the national anthem for weeks now  he s appealed to their bosses  he s attempted to turn america against them  and he s generally been the most racist asshat on the planet about the whole process now we see that his offense at the nfl protests had nothing to do with patriotism  but with trying to dictate where and when it was okay for black people to protest  the biggest asshole on television without question is pat robertsonfeatured image via stephen chernin getty images
