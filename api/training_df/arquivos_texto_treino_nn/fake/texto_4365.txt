no matter how much they don t want to admit it to be true  many republicans  especially in congress  know hillary clinton is the better choice for president despite what they may say publicly oh sure  they ll fall in line behind donald trump for the sake of the party  but do they really believe the reality television host and floundering businessman will make a good commander in chief proving this point  several gop senators are even admitting that they know hillary will be good to work with senator johnny isakson  r ga  told the atlanta journal constitution that he s worked with hillary in the past and sees a similar future  the one thing you have to remember is that for five years she was secretary of state while we were in the senate  we had to work together an awful lot while members of the foreign relations committee and also as members of the senate armed services committee  adding that it will be much different than when president obama took office  barack obama was somewhat of an unknown   he was a senator  but only for a year and a half before he was elected president  she is a known commodity  and i think there ll be more camaraderie in terms of working together  than there might have been in the early days of obama  as we can all probably recall  there was little to no respect for president obama from the republican side of the aisle in both the house and the senate  in fact  it seemed their number one priority was to block any and everything he tried to get accomplished senator john cornyn  r tx  said of a hillary clinton presidency  we ll do our duty  you know regardless of who is president  the people we serve want us to to work together for their benefit so that s certainly my posture  even senator lindsey graham  r sc  admitted that he s worked with hillary in the past and that she d be a  willing partner  on things such as immigration reform and federal spending now  of course  most republicans will still tell you that donald trump will win  but they are clearly  and rightfully  preparing for a hillary clinton presidency  because let s be real  that s not only the most likely case scenario but also what will be best for the nation overall featured photo by drew angerer getty images
