many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that donald trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat  the thing is  democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses  because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases  this was explained by republican david frum just a couple of months into donald trump s presidency  in a piece in the atlantic called  how to build an autocracy  in fact  if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the federal bureau of investigation as well the direct weaponization of the department of justice in order to go after trump s former political opponent   democratic nominee hillary clinton  and you have the makings of an autocracy  we are more than well on our way  further  one chamber of congress  the house of representatives  already has a rogue band of republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official russian collusion investigation  with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the russians in order to swing the  election in his favor all of that is just for starters  too  now  we have trump making united nations ambassador nikki haley bully and threaten other countries in the united nations who voted against trump s decision to change u s  policy when it comes to recognition of jerusalem as the capital of the jewish state  well  one expert  who is usually quite measured  has had enough of trump s autocratic antics  former cia director john o  brennan  the seasoned spy took to trump s favorite platform  twitter  and blasted the decision trump admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in un to oppose us position on jerusalem is beyond outrageous  shows  realdonaldtrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic  vengeful autocrats   john o  brennan   johnbrennan  december    brennan is correct  of course  trump is behaving just like an autocrat  and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age  in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the american president  fellow americans  we know the gop led congress will not be the check on trump that they are supposed to be  it s time to get out and flip the house and possibly the senate in   and resist in the meantime  if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like russia or north korea than the america we have always know  we re already well on our way featured image via brendan smialowski afp getty images
