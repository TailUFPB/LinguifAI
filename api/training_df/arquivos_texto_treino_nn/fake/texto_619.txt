two man children with access to nuclear weapons are having a pissing match and the world is hoping and praying that like much of what donald trump says  it s all talk  a resurfaced video from   though  shows that trump has wanted to send nukes to north korea since at least then  even though that s not what he thinks he wanted this is what the world saw today from donald trump  after reports indicated that north korea had miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could  in theory  reach the united states  north korea best not make any more threats to the united states   trump said  arms crossed  from his golf resort in bedminster  new jersey  on tuesday   they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen  source  cnnwe don t actually know for sure that north korea has miniaturized the warhead  or that it s been tested  but nonetheless  trump seems ready to push that button we could try to console ourselves by saying that like with his supposed wall  trump is just talking tough  but this kind of tough talk has been going on for at least  years from trump a recently resurfaced video of a meet the press episode from  shows a far more articulate trump talking to tim russert about north korea  why the hell was tim russert talking to donald trump about north korea is still a mystery   trump was full of tough talk even then he began the segment by saying he would  negotiate like crazy  with north korea then trump just had to throw in a barely veiled racist jab at washington  d c  look tim  if a man walks up to you in a street in washington because this doesn t happen of course in new york and puts a gun to your head and says  give me your money   wouldn t you rather know where he was coming from before he had the gun in his hand  trump went on to predict that in three to four years  north korea would have nuclear weapons pointed at the united states  they didn t  they still don t  he then said   we can talk about the economy  we can talk about social security  but the biggest problem the world has is nuclear proliferation   of course  that was before dt took over the oval office trump quickly pivoted from negotiation to a preemptive strike  to which russert noted that a former secretary of defense  les aspin  said that the nuclear fallout from a preemptive strike would be  devastating to the asian peninsula  trump then clutched his chest  saying   i m not talking about us using nuclear weapons  i m saying that they have areas where they re developing missiles  russert interrupted trump to say that by taking out their nuclear missiles  it would create the fallout  no matter who sent the weapons trump then began to get belligerent  saying we need to do something or in five years  they would have nuclear weapons  all over the place   again  they didn t and they don t  but trump now has access to the largest military in the world and one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world  every asian country  including our largest trading partner  china  is now either publicly or privately terrified and now that we know that trump has been sitting on this fantasy for at least  years  we should all be here s the video tim russert interviewing  realdonaldtrump in  about launching a pre emptive strike against north korea  could be key to his thinking  pic twitter com   sven henrich   northmantrader  june    more featured image via video screen grab
