donald trump can brag all he wants  but rachel maddow knows that trump s presidency has been nothing but a disastrous failure despite the constant bragging  trump has proven himself to be a historic failure usually  the first  days of an administration is productive and with republicans in control of the senate and house  it should be easier to get things done but trump has only governed via bad executive orders and has taken a vacation every weekend while accusing everyone from president obama to democrats to the media to other government officials of somehow sabotaging him on sunday  maddow discussed trump s failure with al sharpton and made a strong case that trump s has been one policy disaster after another  if you just look at what they ve done in terms of policy it s interesting they haven t been able to do anything successfully on any of the stuff they like to brag about  they like to talk about  that he campaigned on   maddow began for example  trump s muslim bans have failed to pass muster as federal courts are blocking it because it violates the constitution  trump s border wall has also failed because he promised that mexico would pay for it but it turns out that was a total lie  in fact  trump s wall would actually cost us dearly because it would weaken our national security  the muslim ban has been a disaster   maddow continued before noting that mitch mcconnell admitted that mexico won t pay for the wall  she also referred to trump s plan to gut the coast guard  airport security  and fema to pay for it maddow also mentioned that trump is allowing mentally ill people to buy guns and is refusing to fight a texas voter suppression law in court and then she brought up the gop healthcare bill that they dubiously call the  american healthcare act  even though is definitely not american nor is it healthcare  the health care roll out is an absolute disaster  politically  it s absolutely dead  i don t think anybody believes it will ever pass the senate  they never tried anything on taxes  remember  they were going to do a trillion dollar infrastructure plan  nothing that they like to talk about  nothing they like to brag about  none of their big stuff is working or  in many cases  they re not even trying to make it work  here s the video via twitter democrats would be wise to echo argument maddow makes here  it s incredibly effective  and conveniently truthful  https   t co   matt mcdermott   mattmfm  march    short  donald trump continues to be a failure and a disaster for our country and it will only get worse featured image  screenshot
