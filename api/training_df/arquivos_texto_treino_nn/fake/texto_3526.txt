ever since matt lauer threw donald trump some majorly softball questions during his q a with the president elect during the campaign  many people have been criticizing how he didn t go hard enough on trump to get some real answers well  lauer clearly got the message  albeit a little too late  because he just absolutely went after trump during a phone interview on the today show wednesday morning lauer said  you seem to understand that perhaps having fights on twitter would not be appropriate for the president  i have not seen you backing off fights on twitter  in the time since you were elected  you ve targeted the cast of hamilton  the new york times  china  boeing  the media  and snl  which  of course  put trump on the defense pathetically trying to explain how going after snl and a broadway show are somehow justified  the president elect also seems to think that twitter is an appropriate form of communication  no matter how immature the tweets  he also  again  went after snl  and when lauer brought up the fact that he had previously hosted the show  trump whined that it s gone downhill since then sure  donald  that s it good on lauer for finally being tough on trump watch lauer really press trump here  watch   i like alec  but his imitation of me is really mean spirited and not very good    realdonaldtrump on  snl https   t co neslxlzjus  today   todayshow  december    image via video screen capture
