since disgusting revelations came to light that show the republicans  horse crap covered  diseased nutsack of a nominee is actually a sexual predator  trump has been frantically trying to cover his ass in every way imaginable  there is no line he will not cross  no level to which he will not sink  in order to turn the whole thing around in a pathetic attempt to come out smelling like roses  that includes pushing ever wilder conspiracy theories about how the nefarious hillary clinton is behind all of this yes  trump wants people to believe that this is all a worldwide smear campaign specifically intended to derail his candidacy  his asinine cease and desist letter to the new york times revealed that  along with the true intent of the lawsuit threat   and so do the growing  nutty conspiracy theories he was touting in west palm beach today  the most powerful weapon deployed by the clintons is the corporate media  the press  let s be clear on one thing  the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism  they re a political special interest  no different than any lobbyist or any other financial entity with a total political agenda and the agenda is not for you  it s for themselves their agenda is to elect crooked hillary clinton at any costs  at any price  no matter how many lives they destroy  for them  it s a war  and for them  nothing at all is out of bounds  this is a struggle for the survival of our nation  believe me  and this will be our last chance to save it  oh  it s a war all right  but it s a war against the evil that pervades trump and his loyal  minion y followers  nobody s destroyed trump s life but trump himself  when it comes to the women he s assaulted   he s out to destroy their lives  and the lives of members of the press  for daring to report the truth about him  he is so not a victim trump s followers are dead certain that this election will be stolen from them  and trump is playing that like a master violinist  for trump  it s simple  the election is stolen if he loses  the election is fair if he wins  end of story his minionish cult of followers see it the exact same way but wait  it gets better  he also drew connections between his assault victims coming forward  wikileaks  and hillary  these claims are all fabricated  they are pure fiction  and they are outright lies it s not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as wikileaks releases documents exposing the massive international corruption of the clinton machine  coincidence or not  nothing changes the fact that he s a sexual predator who has no business being anywhere near a position of such power and responsibility as the presidency as he continued to speak  his descent into madness became clearer  we ve seen this  first hand in the wikileaks documents in which hillary clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of u s  sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers  her special interest friends  and her donors  the funny thing is that those emails reveal nothing of the sort  time pointed out that a lot of things he said there are  invented   as the atlantic put it  they show a political candidate being political  is that good  not necessarily  however  they don t reveal anything nearly as horrific as what s come out about trump recently it s time for the cowardly gop to actually come forward as a unified party and do something about this man  he s beyond help at this point featured image by joe raedle via getty images
