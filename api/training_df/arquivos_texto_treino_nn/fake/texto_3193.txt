donald trump s team certainly doesn t make it easy for the people who have to interview them  in a typical interview with trump s team  news anchors have to constantly fact check and repeatedly bring trump s minions back to the original questions and topics as they deflect blame and avoid answering every question on monday s  new day   cnn host alisyn camerota had to interview trump spokesman sean spicer  and it was basically an interview from hell as spicer wouldn t give her any responses to the most pressing questions  camerota had tried to ask spicer just what special information trump claimed he knows about russia s involvement in the us election  spicer s response couldn t have been more insane as he said trump gets a lot of  classified information  intelligence reports  on a daily basis  despite the fact that trump s team once said the president elect only gets briefings once per week   spicer then went off topic and said trump will wait to make conclusions about the hacking  ignoring the fact that trump has defended russia extensively from all blame camerota was unwilling to let spicer avoid the question  and she said  i want to get back to my question  is mr  trump  who said he s going to reveal something  he says he knows things  spicer again refused to give a response  stating that trump would talk about it himself right before blaming obama for not talking about china s  hacking  camerota responded by fact checking spicer right then and there  she said  sean  just to correct you  you say not a single statement was ever issued or made after the chinese hacking  i have the statement right here in my hands  spicer s response was pathetic  as he admitted to being wrong but still continued to blame obama  accusing obama of responding too late  camerota tirelessly tried to bring spicer back to her question  sean  i m more interested in what mr  trump is going to do  we re not electing president obama again  you are representing mr  trump  camerota asked about trump s plans  and spicer couldn t provide her with anything  all he did was confess that trump didn t have a final report  spicer then stunned camerota by admitting that he had lied earlier when he said trump had been briefed  the report is not final  he s not been briefed by the heads of the intelligence community  a stunned camerota said in disbelief   he has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe russia is behind the hacking  spicer began to fall apart when camerota told him to  hold on  after he accused anyone who believed  non final  reports of being irresponsible  spicer shouted  no  not  hold on  the idea we re asking people and making assumptions on a report that s not final is unbelievable  the rest of the interview  camerota was forced to constantly counter spicer s moronic remarks  spicer practically ended the interview by completely disrespecting camerota for expecting that trump and his team might at least be exploring the possibility that reports about the russian hacking are correct  spicer said condescendingly  i know it s frustrating for you that we re doing it in a logical way  no  we re going to get all the information  get briefed properly and make a decision  we re not going to put the cart before the horse  camerota couldn t believe her ears  you can watch this disastrous interview below featured image via screenshot
