other nations are stepping up to play larger roles in the world because of donald trump  proving that he is destroying american respect and power abroad one of trump s first acts after taking over the white house was to issue a global gag rule on abortion the executive order bans groups that receive funding from the united states from giving women information on abortion  reversal of president obama s policy that had been in effect for the last eight years apparently  conservatives believe they not only have the right to tell american women what to do with their bodies  they believe they have the right to tell all women around the world what to do with their bodies as well trump s policy is an embarrassing shift  women around the world will now see america as a hostile enemy of women s rights and bodily autonomy and as a result of of the united states abandoning women around the world  other nations are sticking it to trump by filling the gaps according to reuters norway has joined an international initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls left by u s  president donald trump s ban on u s  funded groups worldwide providing information on abortion in january  the netherlands started a global fund to help women access abortion services  saying trump s  global gag rule  meant a funding gap of   million over the next four years  and has pledged   million to the initiative to replace that sweden  denmark  belgium  luxembourg  finland  canada and cape verde have all also lent their support norway is also chipping in   million  the government is increasing its support for family planning and safe abortion  prime minister erna solberg said in a statement   at a time when this agenda has come under pressure  a joint effort is particularly important  so donald trump just hurt american prestige by doing something that will hurt women around the globe  but other nations are boosting their own prestige by filling the funding gap abortion is a medically necessary procedure that women should have access to no matter where they live  by trying to deny women that access  donald trump is putting lives at risk and taking rights away from women after our country has fought for years to lift up women around the world trump and republicans should realize that as they continue to shrink america s role in the world  other nations will take advantage of it and increase their own prestige and power  as long as trump and republicans continue down this path  respect for us will plummet and our influence will wane featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
