despite claims to the contrary  donald trump has made it crystal clear that he is no friend to minorities  but members of the congressional black caucus intend to fight him tooth and nail to protect people of color  as such  they have formulated a battle plan to resist policies that may be harmful to these communities the stakes are incredibly high and our community is counting on us as the last line of defense between donald trump and the worst of what america could offer   rep  hakeem jeffries  d n y   said throughout his campaign  trump proposed policies targeting specific minority groups  such as banning all muslims from entering the u s  and building a wall to keep out all the rapey mexicans  he was also the champion of the  birther  movement  which was nothing more than a racially motivated attack on the country s first african american president  the campaign that we saw over the last  months is very frightening  and there s been no effort on his part to even temper his comments since being elected   said outgoing cbc chairman g k  butterfield  d n c     it s going to be very contentious  i suspect  if mr  trump even follows through on half of his promises during the campaign  incoming cbc chairman cedric richmond  d la   plans to lay out the cbc s plan in more detail when he officially takes office on tuesday  but he says that the people trump has appointed to his cabinet are highly concerning  we speak for vulnerable people  we speak for the disenfranchised   and we take that seriously   richmond said   and those appointments seem to be tone deaf to sensitivity and to  i think  just common sense  at the top of the worrisome list of cabinet appointments are alabama senator and open racist jeff sessions  who is trump s attorney general pick  and alt right hero and former breitbart bigwig  steve bannon  trump s senior adviser  the appointments should concern not just minorities but all americans   said rep  elijah cummings  d md     when you look at sessions  i mean he doesn t have the most stellar reputation for civil rights and voting rights  it s rough  members of the cbc note that this is a first  having a battle plan to resist the racist policies of an incoming president is hardly business as usual  this is not the normal incoming president   added rep  emanuel cleaver  d mo     we had no plan for george bush  i think charlie rangel and john conyers would tell you they didn t even have a plan for richard nixon  but this is not the norm  featured image via mark wilson getty images
