we ve all seen pictures of the trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor  complete with their young son barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents  it s a life most of us can never imagine while we re paying our monthly bills  so what s it like growing up with donald trump as a father  according to scott melker  a former classmate of donald trump jr  s  at the university of pennsylvania  being the former reality show star s son wasn t what one might imagine  or  given trump s temperament  it might be exactly what you d imagine on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trump s son had for this father  i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends  next door to donald jr  s room  i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his son s door  there to pick him up for a baseball game   he recalls   there were quite a few students standing around watching  trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate  don jr  opened the door  wearing a yankee jersey  then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others  without saying a word  his father slapped him across the face  knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates  he simply said  put on a suit and meet me outside   and closed the door   melker wrote  donald jr  was a drunk in college  every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public  with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking   he continued   he absolutely despised his father  and hated the attention that his last name afforded him  his nickname was  diaper don   because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people s beds and urinate    i always felt terrible for him   he continued mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because  in light of what i saw that day  it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country  to be clear  we are not demonizing trump s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days  whether melker s story is accurate or not  we re not sure  but given trump s awful temper  it s difficult to discount it photo by saul loeb pool via getty
