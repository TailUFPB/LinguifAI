donald trump is no stranger to doing business in the middle east  yet for some unknown reason  he could never quite crack the qatar market  sure  he had been dealing in the hotel business with the saudis for at least two decades and has his name on quite a few golf courses in the uae  however  no matter how hard he tried  business deals in qatar always seemed unattainable for him now a feud between these three gulf nations broke out on june   when saudi arabia  the united arab emirates and arab allies all broke off trade  travel and diplomatic relations with qatar as punishment for what they said was its support of terrorism  many scholars  however  believe that the fallout is the result of a struggle for power and autonomy  but it didn t take long for trump to throw his support behind the united arab emirates and saudi arabia in the dispute  the two countries out of the three where he has business interests  trump said his reason for backing saudi arabia and the uae is that qatar is a  funder of terror at a very high level   but was this his only reason the pentagon and the state department have a different opinion on the issue to the alleged president  with the secretaries of defence and state trying to encourage unity against a common enemy in isis by staying completely neutral on the topic of qatar  but unlike donald trump  the pentagon and the state department don t have personal assets in the area  that s right  trump is the first u s  president in  years to maintain private business interests after entering the white house and many critics believe maintaining a business empire will skew the president s ability to make rational diplomatic decisions that truly are for the good of the people  trump may have signed his business empire over to his sons at a press conference in january  but as the director of the office of government ethics warned  stepping away from management without giving up ownership does not diminish his financial incentives or conflicts other countries in the middle east see what is happening and may think   we should be opening golf courses  or  we should be buying rooms at the trump international   said brian egan  a state department legal adviser under the obama administration   even if there is no nefarious intent on behalf of the president or the trumps  for a president to be making money from business holdings in sensitive places around the world is likely to have an impact  when the trouble between saudi arabia  uae and qatar kicked off  dana smith  the american ambassador to qatar  retweeted a treasury department article praising qatar for cracking down on extremist financing  which you can read below this is so important  i m sharing it again  great partnership  real progress to counter terrorist financing   qatar https   t co   dana shell smith   ambdana  october    long after smith s tweet  secretary of state rex tillerson urged qatar  to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors   while also adding   we call on the kingdom of saudi arabia  the united arab emirates  bahrain and egypt to ease the blockade against qatar  then there s trump s response  he was completely in favor of the blockade the second it started  declaring on twitter that his visit  was already paying off  and he continued to defend it even after tillerson had called for it to be eased  saying that  the time had come to call on qatar to end its funding  of terrorism  remember  this is the man who said of the saudis back in  that he likes them because they buy apartments from him   they spend   million    million  am i supposed to dislike them  i like them very much  it s not just the purchasing of apartments that trump has to thank saudi arabia for   in   donald trump sold the plaza hotel to a partnership consisting of a saudi prince  the same prince that paid   million for trump s yacht in  and a singaporean investor  this   million deal on the plaza enabled trump to escape a default on his loans so next time you hear trump weigh in on the middle east  ask yourself if he is thinking of the safety of the american people or his own back pocket featured image via chris kleponis pool getty images
