donald trump has been bragging about his inaugural address all week  and even claimed that he wrote it himself  today  trump s own white house admitted he lied earlier this week  trump posted a staged photo of himself with pen and paper in hand  writing  the divisive and negative inaugural address that is now known as the worst in american history writing my inaugural address at the winter white house  mar a lago  three weeks ago  looking forward to friday   inauguration pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    cnn reported that  trump told guests at his mar a lago estate in florida  as well as presidential historian douglas brinkley  that he planned to write the speech himself  trump delivered the speech on friday  portraying america as a post apocalyptic wasteland  where inner cities are full of crime and criminals  and the citizenry suffers in great poverty while our military is crippled  all of which are complete lies and now the negative reviews of trump s speech are bruising trump s fragile ego so much that he allowed the white house to confirm that he didn t write it himself the blame is now on trump s white supremacist chief adviser  steve bannon  and adviser stephen miller according to the wall street journal much of the speech was written by stephen miller and steve bannon  two of mr  trump s top advisers  a white house official said  i don t think we ve had a speech like that since andrew jackson came to the white house   said mr  bannon  mr  trump s chief strategist and senior counselor   it s got a deep  deep root of patriotism  so trump is literally starting his presidency with a lie  which shows the country and the world what kind of a president he will be one has to wonder if trump actually contributed anything to that speech  or if he just let others do his job for him like he is going to do over the next four years let s be honest  there was nothing patriotic about that speech  it was a depressing and divisive speech that hurt america s image around the world it was a pathetic inaugural address delivered in front of an equally pathetic inauguration audience that will go down in history as a horribly pathetic moment  which  hopefully  we can live long enough to put behind us in four years when we have a chance to oust trump and put someone in office who will fix the disastrous mess he and the republican congress will cause featured image via twitter
