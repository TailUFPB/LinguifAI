if you had any doubt left about whether fbi director james comey intentionally helped trump during the time leading up to the election  you can consider that doubt removed  on tuesday  comey came under fire from a democratic senator for refusing to say if the agency is investigating donald trump s campaign connection to the hacking operation spearheaded by vladimir putin  as you know  the russian foreign minister was quoted in various news reports saying that the russians had had contacts with people associated with the trump campaign   oregon senator ron wyden said during comey s appearance before the senate intelligence committee   now that may or may not be true   my question to director comey is  has the fbi investigated these reported relationships and  if so  what are the agencies finding  i would never comment on investigation whether we have one or not in an open forum like this   comey replied   i really can t answer one way or another  unless you have a very short memory  you are probably aware that comey broke justice department protocol when he sent a letter to republicans last year indicating that the fbi had discovered emails  pertinent  to an investigation of hillary clinton s private email server  after right wing media and donald trump used comey s controversial letter to create a false narrative that evidence had been uncovered of some sort of wrongdoing  comey was forced to admit that clinton committed no criminal wrongdoing  unfortunately  the damage was already done  will you provide an unclassified response to these questions and release it to the american people prior to january    wyden asked  sir  i will answer any question you ask  but the answer will likely be the same as i just gave you  i can t talk about it   comey told the senator  who had finally had enough of the suddenly evasive comey   a man who only a little over a month ago was willing to break protocol in what was clearly an attempt to hurt hillary clinton  i will tell you that i think the american people have a right to know this  and if there is delay in declassifying this information and relaying it to the american people  releasing it to the american people  that doesn t happen before january   i m not sure it s going to happen  if information is not released before january   it is likely that senator wyden is correct that it may never happen   and comey s evasiveness only lends to the fairly concrete theory that he knowingly interfered with the election by helping trump build his propaganda campaign watch it happen below featured image via screengrab
