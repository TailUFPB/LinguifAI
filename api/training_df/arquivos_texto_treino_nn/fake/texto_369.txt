one thing that most conservatives have in common with donald trump   and perhaps contributes to the reason they relate to him and supported him for potus   is chronic misogyny and sexism  we saw this play out on friday during a panel discussion on cnn  when an anchor had to shut the segment down abruptly due to a highly inappropriate comment from her fox guest cnn s brooke baldwin had fox sports radio host clay travis as a guest  and the exchange went downhill very quickly  the panel was addressing the incident in which espn s jemele hill had called trump a white supremacist  causing the white house to demand her be fired  when clay travis had his turn to give his opinion on the matter  he made baldwin wish she d never asked him  travis said this  i believe in the first amendment and boobs  baldwin was practically speechless  and had to do a double take  asking him if he d actually just said the word  boobs   travis only made it worse  boobs  two things that never let me down  the first amendment and boobs  those are the two things i believe in absolutely in the country  baldwin still couldn t believe her ears  and wanted to give travis another chance and the benefit of the doubt  she asked him once more to clarify that he d said  boobs  instead of  booze   once she confirmed that travis had definitely said  boobs   she shut the interview down right then and there  she said  i m done  i m sorry  i m done  this conversation is over  yanking mikes  bye  forgive me  live television happens and you think you heard something  you are not sure and then you realize it happened  so i apologize for him on that  right after the segment  baldwin and travis were both seen on twitter  reacting to what had happened in two totally different ways  baldwin seemed horrified and shocked  and travis was  of course  proud of himself what travis said is not okay  and must be condemned  we re not at all surprised that this would come from a fox employee  considering how prevalent misogyny  sexual assault  and support for our sexist potus is featured image via video screen capture
