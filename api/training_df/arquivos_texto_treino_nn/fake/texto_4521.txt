president obama is right   it appears the people running the trump campaign skipped their history and civics classes after donald trump got a lashing from black activists after claiming it s  never been worse  for them than it is right now  one would think the campaign would have gotten the message and moved on accordingly wrong as usual  no one in the trump campaign learns their lesson  and their sheer ignorance has cost them a key staff member in a key swing state trump s campaign chair in the prominent mahoning county in ohio  kathy miller  has resigned from her position after denying there was any racism in the  and that if black people weren t successful in the last  years  it s their own fault  she also said there wasn t  any racism until obama got elected  and skirted problems under the table if you re black and you haven t been successful in the last  years  it s your own fault  you ve had every opportunity  it was given to you  you ve had the same schools everybody else went to  you had benefits to go to college that white kids didn t have  you had all the advantages and didn t take advantage of it  it s not our fault  certainly miller then doubled down  calling the black lives matter movement a  stupid waste of time  and said low voter turnout in the african american community as due to  the way they re raised  what does  the way they re raised   supposed to mean  maybe miller should take a look at the fact that the trump kids didn t vote  and couldn t even vote for their dad  before speculating on how an entire race raises their kids miller resigned  gave a half ass apology  and distanced herself from the campaign  of course trump s ohio state director  bob paduchik stressed that miller s comments were not reflective of the campaign  and reduced her position to that of a simple  volunteer  to steer away any influence she once held once again  the trump campaign deflects  blames  and dodges responsibility  oh  and it once again shows that it s being run by a bunch of entitled white racists featured image a screen grab
