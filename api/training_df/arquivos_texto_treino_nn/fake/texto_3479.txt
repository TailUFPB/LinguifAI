trump s transition team is certainly doing a good job of keeping things moving along  but that s about the only thing they re doing well  what they re busy doing  while keeping things humming along  is another story entirely  trump s pick for head of the environmental protection agency is enough to send alarm bells ringing  but then his transition team had to go and make things considerably worse trump s team has contacted the department of energy with some unusual requests that would worry pretty much anyone  they want to know who had attended the u n  s climate summits over the last five years  as we all know  there was a major climate change summit in paris at the end of   and we eventually ended up signing onto the agreement that emerged  much to the dismay of climate deniers who want to derail all the progress we ve made as a global climate leader their questionnaire  which has  questions  more than many tests  employment exams  etc    also asked who had attended any meetings on the social cost of carbon  which is what our government uses to determine the costs and benefits of new climate and energy regulations  they also want a list of all publications from employees who are at the  national laboratories run by the dept  of energy for the last three years  dan reicher  a professor at stanford university  said  they re certainly sending an aggressive signal here with some of these questions and they need to be careful  yeah well  trump and his cronies  his lapdogs  and the people who are giving him blow jobs and sucking his balls don t really want to be careful  they want to prove they re on cheetolini s side  why  likely because trump is a massive climate denier  regardless of what he says now  and because everyone he s choosing to run the agencies in charge of both energy production and environmental protection are avid climate deniers if you re not a climate denier  good luck keeping your job  trump and his cabinet picks could undo every environmental regulation we ve implemented in the last  well  who knows   years    the people who oppose that  and the people who are just dying to sleep with king cheeto  would rather perform fellatio than stick by the truth of climate change some employees at the dept  of energy feel like this is an  enemies list   of sorts  when donald trump said he wanted to drain the swamp it apparently was just to make room for witch hunts and it s starting here at the doe and our  national labs  yup  most likely  energy and environmental policy are good places to start since not many people really think about those things  care  absolutely  but not think about on a daily basis  which is sad considering the fact that we still need this planet to survive  and if it changes faster than we can adapt  we ll all die but who cares about that  right  climate change is always happening  and it s not man made because man can t be so arrogant as to thwart the almighty christian god  so trying to save the environment is dumb since businesses need profit and man will either survive or die anyway or that s how they sound anyway the dept  of energy should be afraid because they might be the start of a government wide purging of people who don t agree with every single syllable trump utters  either in front of a mic or on his twitter account  they ll be first  but who might follow featured image by drew angerer via getty images
