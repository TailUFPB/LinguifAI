all over the western world  we have seen a wave of nationalistic  xenophobic fascism take hold in the last year or so  it is what gave great britain its exit from the european union  or brexit  it is also what gave the united states donald trump  however  as the rest of europe sees the results and suffering of these tragic mistakes  the tide is turning away from fascistic nationalism and back toward democracy  the netherlands rejected geert wilders  a staunchly nationalistic  far right candidate who wanted to ban islam outright from the netherlands  and who was also endorsed by u s  congressman steve king  r ia   he of the infamous  somebody else s babies  tweet  the same happened in austria  where the voters there rejected another right wing nut  now  france has become the latest to prove that democracy trumps fascism  as their voters rejoice in the election of centrist candidate emmanuel macron over far right  anti immigrant lunatic marine le pen this was no squeaker  either  this was firm rejection of le pen s fascistic  bigoted rhetoric and anti immigrant  nationalistic policies  macron won with   of the french vote  and will hopefully now go quietly into the night now that the she can clearly see that the french people did not want her craziness to become law there is another side to this  though  perhaps the french people are seeing what the  change  election has done to us here in america  after all  marine le pen has often been referred to as the french donald trump  hell  le pen herself has admitted that trump s election here in america has given her legitimacy  and she was spotted at trump tower in new york city earlier this year  therefore it should come as no surprise that trump endorsed her candidacy  they are two of a kind however  le pen s sound defeat should give us all hope  as trump s disastrous presidency unfolds and his failures mount  perhaps america will come to her senses in  if we happen to survive this  and reject this nationalism and xenophobia  it s the only sensible thing to do featured image via video screen capture from twitter
