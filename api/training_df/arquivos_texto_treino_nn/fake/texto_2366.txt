trump s young administration is fraught with trouble  but we all knew that already  most of us probably haven t thought of just how to frame trump s behavior since assuming the white house  but an enterprising writer at the washington post just did  eugene robinson  an opinion writer for the post  wrote an entire op ed based around the following question  does trump know he s president  well  does he  one of the things that robinson points to as evidence that he doesn t  or  at least  doesn t know what he s doing at all  is the fact that we had a bunch of government executives tell europe  tell iraq  even tell the u n   not to listen to what trump says  for instance  he said we re going to take iraq s oil  defense secretary jim mattis told the press in baghdad that we were absolutely not there to do that u n  ambassador nikki haley said that we absolutely support a two state solution after trump said we didn t  mike pence told nato that we re fully devoted to them  after trump has said repeatedly that nato is obsolete and wants to cozy up to russia he said that rounding up undocumented immigrants is  a military operation   which supposedly means a  non military operation   and he was just using  military  as an adjective  according to sean spicer not mentioned in robinson s article is trump s neverending twitter temper tantrum  though he does mention trump s feud with the press   there s also the fact that trump loves hobnobbing with his rich buddies in florida  to the point where he had a meeting on north korea in plain view of his vips  who pay him a ton of money  he won t divest from his businesses  which is creating massive conflicts of interest and may even be in violation of the constitution he rushed out his muslim ban and the courts promptly halted it  and we have to wonder if he even consulted with anyone knowledgeable about the law with that  the  circuit just rejected the justice department s request to put that case on hold pending a new order so when the post has to ask if trump even knows he s president  we have to wonder the same thing  we also have to assume that trump will be pissed if he hears about this op ed because it makes him look like the buffoon he is  and he already hates the post  not as much as the new york times or cnn  but he hates them enough  the answer to robinson s question is   no  he doesn t know he s president  especially not in the same way every other president we ve had knew they were president  featured image by aude guerrucci via getty images
