trump s address to a joint session of congress last night was long on old and tired talking points  and short on substance and concrete plans  many lawmakers present had invited guests  and  of course  trump invited his own guests  too  which presidents do  one of his guests was carryn owens  wife of slain navy seal ryan owens  who was lost during the botched raid in yemen the press fawned all over trump for that  talking about the emotional  touching moment in which trump actually became presidential  then there were veterans on social media who felt differently  many feel that trump did nothing but exploit ms  owens  her grief  and the death of her husband  they were quite clear in how they saw it        then there s u s  army veteran charles clymer  who was so livid he went on a mini tweetstorm about it       but here s the press  reaction  the fawning is gag inducing  especially  from those who routinely speak out against trump          that s a stark difference  trump used ms  owens like he always uses people  he was trying to puff himself up  score points  and distract attention from the poorly planned and executed yemen raid  which even dhs says yielded no useful intelligence our fighting men and women put their lives on the line for us  it would be one thing if the intelligence for the yemen raid was confirmed to be good  and the raid itself was as carefully planned and executed as it could possibly be  things go wrong with even the best planned missions   that s a fact  but that s not what happened in yemen  and our military members shouldn t have to die for an administration that hastily throws an operation together  and then lies about the result  owens deserves so much more than this  and his blood is on trump s hands featured image by jim lo scalzo via getty images
