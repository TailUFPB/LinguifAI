david letterman may be retired but his opinion about donald trump still carries a lot of weight  especially when you consider that he has interviewed him many times over the years in an interview with the new york times  the legendary comedian who formerly hosted the late show talked about the republican nominee and how the two used to interact on the program whenever trump was a guest  nobody took him seriously  and people loved him when he would come on the show   letterman said   i would make fun of his hair  i would call him a slumlord  i would make fun of his ties   and he could just take a punch like nothing  he was the perfect guest  that s a complete flip from the trump the public has seen over the last year and a half  trump is known for having a thin skin and he often lashes out over the smallest slights against him  just a simple criticism is enough to send him over the edge  whether it s on twitter or during his rallies it was during one such rally when trump attacked a reporter critical of his campaign by mocking his disability on stage in one of the most disgraceful moments of the  election season and it s a moment letterman says should have disqualified trump and made him a pariah in our society  i can remember him doing an impression  behind a podium  of a reporter for the new york times who has a congenital disorder  and then i thought  if this was somebody else   if this was a member of your family or a next door neighbor  a guy at work   you would immediately distance yourself from that person  and that s what i thought would happen  because if you can do that in a national forum  that says to me that you are a damaged human being  if you can do that  and not apologize  you re a person to be shunned  letterman then suggested that trump is behaving so badly that he should get his head examined  i don t know anything about politics  i don t know anything about trade agreements  i don t know anything about china devaluing the yuan  but if you see somebody who s not behaving like any other human you ve known  that means something  they need an appointment with a psychiatrist  they need a diagnosis and they need a prescription  indeed  trump s mental health has been a great concern to many people  even dr  drew and board certified psychiatrist and fox pundit charles krauthammer have weighed in on the subject but regardless of why trump is acting the way he is  the point is that it is far from presidential and should disqualify him from ever holding the office  america does not need a president who is easily provoked  especially when he will have the nuclear codes  we need a president who is good at working with others and has a calm steady hand  that person is not donald trump featured image via salon
