if hillary clinton were in the white house and she hired her daughter  chelsea  to work in the west wing and then let her fundraise for the clinton foundation  the gop house would be drawing up articles of impeachment  that is exactly what is happening in president donald trump s white house  first daughter  ivanka  is currently in germany representing him  she works in the west wing and is one of the main people the president listens to many have been wondering what ivanka has been up to in her job at the white house  now at least some of her time can be accounted for  she has set up a fund to help female entrepreneurs and has been soliciting funds from foreign countries  axios is reporting that several have already donated  they include several middle east countries axios is also reporting that her father is a big supporter of the idea  this is curious  given the president s problems with the clinton foundation  which also did a lot of good work and asked for money from foreigners and foreign governments  trump and others brought up the idea that donations were made in order to gain access to the then secretary of state  during the campaign  he went as far as to call the clinton foundation a  criminal enterprise  trump told fox news  chris wallace   saudi arabia given   million  qatar  all of these countries  you talk about women and women s rights  these are people that push gays off business  off buildings  these are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money  so i d like to ask you right now why don t you give back the money that you ve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly  it is hard to see any difference between what trump accused hillary of doing and what his daughter is doing now  it s going to be interesting seeing how white house press secretary sean spicer tries to explain this one featured image via aaron p  bernstein getty images
