on monday  news broke that trump s onetime campaign manager  paul manafort  had been indicted in connection with robert mueller s investigation into russian interference in our election  ever since then  everyone s been buzzing about just how dangerous manafort can be to trump now  however  we also learned that another trump associate by the name of george papadopoulos had been arrested over the summer and pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi and papadopoulos may well be more important to this investigation than manafort  despite the fact that he isn t that well known  why  because contrary to what sarah h  sanders tries telling the media  he was a foreign policy adviser on trump s campaign who did  in fact  try colluding with the russians  and it s his testimony and documents that could bring trump s presidency crashing down around him one official connected to the campaign  and who reportedly witnessed papadopoulos  efforts to get trump to meet with russian officials  says that trump didn t dismiss the idea of working with russia when it was brought up  if papadopoulos can show that s what actually happened  trump himself will be in a lot of trouble sooner than expected during his confirmation hearing back in january  sessions told senator al franken that he wasn t aware of any evidence that anyone colluded with russia  he later walked that back  but papadopoulos apparently told various foreign policy committee members about his contact with russia   a committee which sessions chaired  now  sessions can claim that he opposed the collusion that papadopoulos was trying to set up  but then he opens himself up to a perjury charge  either way  he s fucked it looks like papadopoulos was meeting with russians because they claimed to have dirt on hillary  his contacts go back to before don jr   jared kushner and paul manafort met with a russian attorney who claimed to have dirt on hillary   don jr  originally lied  saying that the meeting was about reinstating adoptions between us and russia  but then released his own emails that proved he d lied  then the dnc was hacked  and the hack was traced back to russia  trump even called on russia to release hillary s missing emails during the rnc convention  a comment that has been analyzed again and again with some dismissing it as a joke and others saying it was evidence of something deeper there s currently no evidence that anything actually came of that june  meeting  however  if papadopoulos can back up what he said in his plea agreement about the campaign knowing  then it stops being a scandal and becomes active collusion manafort and gates have been charged with things like money laundering  failure to register as foreign agents  etc  the key with these two is whether mueller can get them to roll over on trump and other highly placed officials in exchange for lesser charges papadopoulos  on the other hand  told the fbi that his russian contacts weren t anyone important and that they had nothing to do with trump  his campaign  or the election  we now know he was in europe  meeting with russians and trying arrange meetings between none other than vladimir putin and donald trump  there s a direct line back to the campaign there  whereas the charges against manafort and gates could be seen as only tangentially related papadopoulos is already a cooperating witness in mueller s investigation  and there is no evidence yet that manafort or gates have flipped  or will flip  and since everything about papadopoulos  arrest has to do with his activities on the campaign  that makes him far more dangerous to trump right now than gates and manafort featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
