apparently  fox news hosts do not want their viewers to realize that donald trump is an embarrassment to america and a complete hypocrite on saturday  trump arrived in saudi arabia  a majority islamic nation where sharia law is widely practiced  and a nation that trump has trashed in the past when president obama visited saudi arabia  he bowed to show respect to the saudi king  and trump repeatedly whined about it and claimed that obama was making america look weak well  trump s meeting with the saudi king proved that trump is a hypocrite trump not only bowed to accept a gift from saudi king salman  he curtsied like a princess here s the footage via youtube trump s curtsy did not go down well with conservatives  who spent years complaining about president obama bowing  and liberals were quick to point out the hypocrisy and of course  fox news is desperately trying to keep footage of trump s curtsy off the air so when footage did pop up during fox host jeanine pirro s show on saturday  she clearly became annoyed and gestured furiously with her hand in an effort to get her staff to cut the tape and switch to something else  and that s why fox viewers ended up getting a full screen view of kellyanne conway instead of the split screen that had been playing here s the video via youtube trump s bow to the saudi king is embarrassing to fox hosts  who also spent years criticizing president obama for showing respect to the leaders of other nations therefore  trump is not the only hypocrite here  fox news hosts are hypocrites  too  for refusing to criticize trump in the exact same way they criticized president obama donald trump and fox news had better buckle up and prepare for hell to rain down upon them  because every time trump does something that he criticized president obama for doing he is going to get called out for it  and fox will be reminded of how they treated him featured image  screenshot
