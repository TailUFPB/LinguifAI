fox news found themselves in a really uncomfortable position on friday because of donald trump s gullibility during a fox news broadcast on tuesday  andrew napolitano attempted to defend trump s continuing insistence that president obama wiretapped him by accusing the british intelligence agency gchq of wiretapping trump after being ordered to do so by obama just like trump s original accusation  napolitano s accusation was just as wild and baseless  yet  white house mouthpiece sean spicer repeated it as gospel without providing any evidence to back up the claim in a rare statement issued by the gchq  the agency angrily refuted the accusation  recent allegations made by media commentator judge andrew napolitano about gchq being asked to conduct  wiretapping  against the then president elect are nonsense  they are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored  the international incident reportedly forced spicer and national security adviser mcmaster to issue a formal apology to the united kingdom  even though spicer and trump have not publicly backed away from the accusation in the united states the embarrassing incident was rightfully brought up by reporters during a joint press conference on friday attended by trump and german chancellor angela merkel when asked if the white house made a mistake blaming the british  trump literally blamed his favorite propaganda network for the an accusation his team repeated  thus throwing them under the bus  trump also had the audacity to claim his team made no such allegation even though his team openly repeated it as if it somehow proved trump s original accusation  we said nothing   trump said   all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television  that was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on fox  so you shouldn t be talking to me  you should be talking to fox  here s the video via twitter wow  trump to merkel about alleged wiretapping by obama   at least we have something in common  perhaps   she appears to be very confused  pic twitter com   bradd jaffy   braddjaffy  march    immediately  fox news rushed to reverse the damage as anchor shep smith told the world that napolitano was full of shit  fox news cannot confirm judge napolitano s commentary   smith said   fox news knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the united states was surveilled at any time in any way  full stop  and then fox anchor bret baier chimed in later in the day by repeating that napolitano s claim cannot be confirmed  we love the judge  we love him here at fox  but the fox news division was never able to back up those claims and was never reported on this show   baier reported while napolitano was irresponsible for pitching such an accusation  donald trump was even more irresponsible by letting spicer repeat it without any verification of the accuracy of the claim  all trump had to do is direct his team to make contact with british intelligence and ask if the claim is true or not  but trump failed to do so because he is flailing for anything that could even suggest in the slightest that his accusation against president obama is true  but the accusation is clearly false because if trump really had any proof he would have released it by now  even republican leaders in congress have confirmed that trump s claim is a lie so it looks like the honeymoon may be over between trump and fox news  it s probably safe to say that fox news will put a leash on what their commentators say about trump s wiretapping fiasco  now we just have to wait and see if fox news starts to turn on trump featured image  scott olson getty images
