after two months of an administration that gives literal meaning to the term  bully pulpit   it becomes easy to forget what a real president sounds like how a real president discusses disagreements  on thursday  though  we received a brief reminder as president obama took a break from his retirement to talk about health care and not once did he use the words  fake news  or even  sad  today is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the affordable care act  a law  that despite republicans  claims otherwise  took months and months to draft  debate and eventually pass  obama  as well as anyone  knows that the law isn t perfect  but he does recognize some very basic facts  which boil down to we re much better with it than without it  obama said it better in a statement on thursday  so the reality is clear  america is stronger because of the affordable care act   obama said he s right  the uninsured rate has been cut almost in half since the law s inception and it goes down every year republicans want to change that and obama didn t let that go  in his very diplomatic style that we so desperately miss  the president urged republicans to pass a bill that would improve upon the affordable care act  not make it worse  so if republicans are serious about lowering costs while expanding coverage to those who need it  and if they re prepared to work with democrats and objective evaluators in finding solutions that accomplish those goals   that s something we all should welcome   he said   but we should start from the baseline that any changes will make our health care system better  not worse for hardworking americans  that should always be our priority   only  as we know  republicans don t give a crap about making the law better  unless by better  you mean giving rich people a huge tax cut while leaving older poor people much  much poorer fortunately  the fate of this bill  which will go up for a vote on the anniversary of obama s signature healthcare law  is uncertain to say the least  at this point  it s far more likely to fail than to pass featured image via sean gallup getty images
