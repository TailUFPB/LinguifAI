trump supporter and fox host stuart varney has finally had enough if trump s petty twitter insults donald trump s attack on meryl streep was a step too far for fox business host stuart varney and his guests on monday during the golden globe awards on sunday night  streep delivered an amazing defense of hollywood  the press  disabled people  and foreigners without mentioning trump by name  there was nothing good about it   streep said of trump s campaign   but it was effective  and it did its job  it made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth  it was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter  someone he outranked in privilege  power  and the capacity to fight back  it kind of broke my heart  when the powerful use their position to bully others  we all lose  predictably  instead of letting it go  trump lashed out at streep on twitter meryl streep  one of the most over rated actresses in hollywood  doesn t know me but attacked last night at the golden globes  she is a     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    flunky who lost big  for the  time  i never  mocked  a disabled reporter  would never do that  but simply showed him    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    groveling  when he totally changed a  year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad  just more very dishonest media   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     trump has been throwing these little hissy fits for quite some time now  especially after becoming president elect  which is really embarrassing because presidents usually do not hurl insults like a petulant child at people who disagree with them and fox business host stuart varney  who is a big supporter of trump  agrees that he crossed the line and only hurt himself and the office he will hold on january  during his show  journalist elizabeth macdonald expressed her thoughts about trump s tirade  how does name calling make american great again   she asked   doesn t that undercut mr  trump s agenda by responding in ways like this  i mean  he demeans himself  you cannot expect people to climb on board with your agenda when your judgement is so poor in making attacks like that  indeed  such attacks only divide our country and reflect poorly on trump as he continued to destroy the dignity of the presidency even though he s not even the president yet  i got it and i think you re right   varney replied simply before moving on to a new story here s the video via youtube every time donald trump lashes out at someone on twitter he embarrasses himself  the office of the presidency  and this nation  he needs to learn to ignore criticism  or better yet  listen to it and learn from it instead of throwing a temper tantrum featured image via screenshot
