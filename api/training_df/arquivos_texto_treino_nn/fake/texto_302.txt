donald trump went all in for his man luther strange  i mean  he tweeted   in between other pressing matters  of course   at least a dozen times in support of the incumbent senator in alabama or at least  strange was the incumbent  until former chief justice of the alabama supreme court and all around douchebag roy moore beat him in a runoff primary last night trump did everything but attach himself at the hip to strange  for a reason i ll get into in a minute  but it just wasn t enough to overcome moore  who was backed by trump s former right hand man steve bannon  as well as a bevy of other prominent dumbass conservatives  sarah palin  sebastian gorka  laura ingraham and even sean hannity lent their support to the ultra conservative moore  while simultaneously being careful to tell voters that a vote against strange wasn t a vote against donald trump  bannon went so far as to say that a vote for moore was a vote for trump they understand something that the president doesn t  and it s this i was alluding to as the reason trump rolled so deep with luther strange  donald trump knows he has some kind of power over his supporters  but he doesn t know what it is  he honestly believes that he can make them do whatever he wants them to do and that they will do it happily  and above all  he believes that he is infallible in his decisions trump has it all backwards in reality  it is donald trump who does the bidding of his fans  it s because he literally has no idea what he s doing  he has zero experience in politics  he doesn t know or even care what the people of alabama think about or want in a senate candidate  let me put this plainly if donald trump thought that a man like roy moore  who was removed from the supreme court of alabama only by outside forces  who never lost the support of his constituents  who is literally the bible thumping  gay hating  end times preaching senator that the most redneck state in america has been dreaming about since reconstruction was going to lose this election to a career politician  well  he s a whole lot dumber than any of us give him credit for trump s candidate lost because he was always going to lose  trump himself lost because he had no idea  prior to the election  trump was so confident of his star power and strange s ability to win by association that he hadn t bothered to learn moore s first name and one thing donald j  trump doesn t do is lose gracefully  the president went on a deleting spree of tweets he had posted in support of strange  he was so angry that he couldn t even remember when the general election was being held in alabama  so when he congratulated moore after his win  he even had to delete the first draft of that trump has  of course  quieted down  unfortunately for him  the slew of tweet deletions  which may actually be illegal  just makes his timeline look like literally all he can think about is big black men on their knees as long as nobody s sitting down during the national anthem  i suppose featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
