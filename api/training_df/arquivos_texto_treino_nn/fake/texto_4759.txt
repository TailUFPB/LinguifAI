back in june  on facebook  donald trump called on hillary clinton to return millions of dollars the clinton foundation received in donations from saudi arabia  crooked hillary says we must call on saudi arabia and other countries to stop funding hate  i am calling on her to immediately return the   million plus she got from them for the clinton foundation  for months now the right has used the saudi donations as definitive  proof  that clinton is beholden to oppressive regimes  and isn t serious about protecting women s rights and lgbt rights but while the right is hailing their newfound champion of women s rights and gay rights  maybe they should take a look at how much money he s taken from the saudi government   personally   and how he allowed osama bin laden s brother to live in the famous trump tower had hillary clinton allowed a bin laden such private access  the right wing media would have a field day  but since it s donald trump  he gets a free pass according to a new expos  by the daily news  trump has received over    million dollars from the saudi government after selling  sold the  floor of trump world tower to the kingdom  since   the government has had to pay the trump organization    for building amenities a year before the payoff of real estate  trump also allowed osama bin laden s half brother  shafiq bin laden  to live in the apartment for four months in  perhaps trump can follow his own example and can go ahead and give the    million back to the saudi government  and explain why he allowed the brother of the world s most dangerous and wanted terrorist to live at his crowning achievement how is trump going to hold the saudi government accountable when they have direct ownership in his business  trump has already hinted that he would not step down from the trump organization  raising high levels of potential conflicts of interest for the united states government but let s keep pretending hillary clinton hasn t done anything for women and lgbt people because donald trump has such a great track record when it comes to equality featured image via joe freso getty images
