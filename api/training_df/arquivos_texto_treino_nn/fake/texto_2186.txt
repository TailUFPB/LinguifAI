last saturday  donald trump woke at the crack of dawn and went on an extraordinary twitter tirade   even for him  he accused his predecessor  president barack obama  of illegally wiretapping trump tower during the hotly contested  election campaign  this is a most outrageous claim to make about a former president   especially since a president cannot legally order such surveillance on any american citizen  so  if indeed trump s claims were to turn out to be true  hint  they won t   it would have come first from a request by the fbi  and said request would have been reviewed and granted by a judge  in other words  if this did happen  it would mean that there was ample evidence that criminal activity was occurring in trump tower at that point in time the worst part of this whole claim is that it was said via twitter with absolutely no evidence whatsoever  if trump did have evidence  surely he would have produced it by now  well  he has also demanded that house and senate intelligence committees find the evidence that he clearly does not have  and they re tired of his lies and shenanigans surrounding this issue  they are so sick of it  in fact  that they have demanded evidence of trump s claims against president obama be presented to them by monday this request comes courtesy of house intelligence committee chair devin nunes  r ca  and ranking member adam schiff  d ca   schiff has called what trump did via twitter last saturday  outlandish  and  destructive   he s right  if any evidence were to exist  another hint  it doesn t  trump or someone within the federal government would have made said evidence public by now just to kill the story trump has really stepped in it with this one  he flat out lied about who is perhaps the most honorable man to ever occupy the white house  then again   lest we forget   trump started his political career by leading the racist birther crusade  so  we really shouldn t be surprised at his behavior here featured image via aude guerrucci pool getty images
