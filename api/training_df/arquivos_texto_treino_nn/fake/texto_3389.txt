at this point  it s no secret that russia   in a campaign directly spearheaded by vladimir putin himself   hacked donald trump s political opponents for him  at trump s request  and helped him use that information to secure victory against a clearly superior opponent  while it seems likely that trump inexplicably will get away with his role  putin and russia may not get off so easy if president obama has anything to say about it  i think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing   obama told npr on thursday  adding that   some of it may be explicit and publicized  some of it may not be  the president  the last legitimate one if trump has anything to say about it  did not go into more detail  but he seems to be ready to take action before he leaves office on january   obama s options vary  ranging from sanctions to giving russia a taste of their own medicine with a star spangled cyber attack of their own  there are still a whole range of assessments taking place among the agencies  and so when i receive a final report  you know  we ll be able to  i think  give us a comprehensive and best guess as to those motivations   obama told npr   but that does not in any way  i think  detract from the basic point that everyone during the election perceived accurately   that in fact what the russian hack had done was create more problems for the clinton campaign than it had for the trump campaign  obama says that he has directly confronted putin about the attack  mr  putin is well aware of my feelings about this  because i spoke to him directly about it   he told npr  officials confirm that the president made putin well aware of the many  many possible u s  responses an increase in sanctions or a cyberattack against russia could be very  very big  potentially crippling  if done right  and incredibly uncomfortable for both putin and his friend trump but here s the kicker   even though the white house acknowledges that the donald  obviously  was aware of and eager to take advantage of the hacks  unless something is done to stop trump from assuming office any action we take is for naught  trump  who once tweeted that he hopes putin will be his  new best friend  will be in a position to undo any sanctions or to stop any other u s  reaction on day one at this point  we as a nation need to turn to our electors whose one job at the moment is to ensure that a tyrant installed by a foreign power does not take office  if they fail us  may the various gods help us all watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
