donald trump has basically built his life around doing nothing and taking credit for the accomplishments and work of others   and that definitely has not changed since he won the election and got into the white house  the crazy thing is  he continues to claim the successes of his predecessor  former president barack obama  whom trump has repeatedly criticized and trashed in the past the gop has undermined obama s soaring track record for the past eight years  they ve trashed everything obama improved from the economy to his employment record   and now  they re more than happy to take credit for his hard work  earlier today  white house press secretary sean spicer showed just how desperate and pathetic the white house is when he tweeted this horrible message  great news for american workers  economy added   new jobs  unemployment rate drops to    in first report for  potus trump  trump hasn t even been in office for two full months  these numbers are not a reflection of his work  it s also worth nothing that those job numbers for february      are nearly identical to the ones in february       clearly  this is obama s doing   not trump s  according to the bureau of labor statistics  job gains have averaged   per month  trump and his team are so delusional  they seriously think they can take credit for the job numbers in february  when they didn t even get into the white house until january  under obama  america saw the longest consecutive job creation streak in  years  completely dismantling the gop s assertion that he didn t do anything for the country and left it worse than what he started with  despite the fact that data shows that obama greatly improved our country  trump has still promised the american people that he would  fix  our jobs  honestly  the best thing trump could do is just not mess up obama s work featured image via alex wong   getty images
