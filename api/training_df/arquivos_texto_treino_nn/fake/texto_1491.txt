remember when republicans were told to stop talking about rape because they were repeatedly sticking their foot in their mouths  well  now they are being told to stop talking about their attempt to repeal the affordable care act ever since republicans giddily started preparing to repeal the landmark healthcare law  they faced a sea of angry constituents at town hall events across the country  as the gop dug in their heels to strip healthcare from millions of americans  their own voting base began to realize that their own healthcare was threatened as well and that the law they referred to as obamacare wasn t so bad after all in fact  many realize that the law saved their lives and they don t want republicans to repeal it and put their lives back in jeopardy but republicans shoved their bill through the house without even reading it and getting the cbo to score it  the bill lets states opt out of requiring insurance companies to cover people with pre existing conditions  which have now been defined as including sexual assault  pregnancy  cancer  acne  asthma  diabetes  sleep apnea  alzheimer s disease  and a whole host of other conditions and medical problems  a list of which you can find here this pretty much would allow insurance companies to discriminate against millions of americans  conservatives included the bill also slashed   billion from medicaid  which covers millions of low income americans  in order to fund a tax gift for the wealthy  again  millions of americans  including conservatives in red states  got healthcare because the affordable care act expanded medicaid understandably  most americans are pissed at republicans  especially after house republicans celebrated taking healthcare from people by throwing a beer party on capitol hill and smiling and laughing about it at the white house rose garden while donald trump spiked the football and americans have been flocking to town halls ever since to shame republicans for their actions  many republicans have even been too cowardly to even attend their own town halls to face the music those who have shown up have only angered their constituents even more by lying about what s in the bill and making any lame excuse they can think of to justify stripping healthcare from millions that s why a conservative consulting firm in now telling republicans to stop talking about repealing the affordable care act according to raw story in a memo issued this week by conservative firm wpa intelligence  lawmakers were cautioned to avoid using the term  full repeal  because it is highly unpopular so  it appears that republicans may now go to their constituents and claim that their bill is only a partial repeal even though it is  in fact  a full repeal make no mistake  this consulting firm knows that republicans are committing political suicide  that s why they warned them to stop talking so much about the healthcare repeal but the damage has already been done and will get even worse if republicans send the bill to trump for his signature the american people  including conservative voters  now know that republicans were full of shit when they insisted that a full repeal was the only way to fix the affordable care act  the fact is that these problems can be easily fixed if republicans are willing to work with democrats  instead of admitting they were wrong  republicans doubled down and now they get to experience the consequences in  when a democratic wave could very well sweep them out of power in congress featured image  mark wilson getty images
