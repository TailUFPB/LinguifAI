in the age of oligarchy and near pandemic outbreaks of affluenza  it is truly refreshing to see a member of the rich and powerful class be held accountable for their crimes against humanity  on thursday  a house of representatives hearing with wells fargo ceo john stumpf provided the world with one of those rare and beautiful moments when a member of the bankster class was beaten into submission by our elected officials during the hearing  which could be described a more of a verbal execution  stumf was lambasted from all sides by those from the panel that he was brought before  lawmakers such as  rep  mick mulvaney  a republican  chastised stumpf for proving progressive democrats correct in their goal to see stronger regulations be put in place within the banking industry   to sit here and have to watch you essentially validate everything that the other side has said about you and your business and your industry  i don t know  for the last three or four generations  is extraordinarily disappointing to me   mulvaney said   the damage that you have done to the market  to your industry  far exceed the damage that you ve done to your own business  sean duffy  another congressional republican  even though he is a member of the gop  he is an ally with sen  elizabeth warren when it comes to certain financial industry reforms  perhaps provided one of the best moments in the hearing  where he forced stumf to admit that his company had stolen from the american people  stumpf tried to describe what wells fargo did in every single way he possibly could without using the word  steal   that is  of course until duffy laid into him  was it theft   duffy asked  pardon me   stumph responded  was it theft  did you steal   duffy pressed  our people did not do what was right   stumpf said evading the word  my question is  did you steal  i want to make sure you and i are on the same page  did wells fargo employees steal from a million to two million customers  yes or no    in some cases  they did  yes   stumph finally admitted here s a clip don t think for a moment that republicans were the only ones to hammer the ceo  massachusetts democratic representative mike capuano offered the coldest words of the panel members to stumph   you think today is tough  when the prosecutors get a hold of you  you re going to have a lot of fun   capuano said if the  election has proven one thing  it s that the people of the united states are out for blood  this new wave of populism has manifested itself in horrifying ways on the right wing  mostly in the form of donald trump s ascension as the gop s presidential nominee  that being said  congress needs to take a cue from the people and begin to work together to right the wrongs of banking and financial deregulation  center republicans and democrats must join together with progressive lawmakers today  the bipartisanship witnessed within thursday s hearing can be the start of a new movement within congress  after all  as mulvaney half heartedly conceded   the actions of wells fargo have proven that progressives have been correct in their calls for new regulations in the banking industry for decades  yesterday  i would have believed a unicorn sighting is more plausible than to hear those words  the bipartisanship witnessed within thursday s hearing can be the start of a new movement within congress  after all  as mulvaney half heartedly conceded   the actions of wells fargo have proven that progressives have been correct in their calls for new regulations in the banking industry for decades  yesterday  i would have believed a unicorn sighting is more plausible than to hear those words  you can watch the full hearing below featured image via video screen capture
