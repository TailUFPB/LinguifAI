it s time to start arresting trump supporters for this bullshit ernest walker is a proud veteran who served this country with the  infantry division in the   so he went to chili s on veteran s day for a free meal the restaurant chain offered to veterans as thanks for their service but while he was eating  a rude trump supporter confronted him and questioned his military service despite the fact that he was in uniform and had his discharge papers as proof that he served but because walker is a black man  this emboldened racist decided to cause trouble  i was approached by an old white guy  maybe in his   with a trump shirt  at chili s on veteran s day yesterday   walker explained on facebook   he asked if i was in the  unit  and i said  no the    trick question  he said he was in germany  and that they did not let blacks serve over there  he left to the back  and came back and rubbed my dog barack  who is a service dog  first of all  it s incredibly disrespectful to question a person s service to this country just because of the color of their skin  second  it s disrespectful to touch a disabled person s service animal  it s a dick move but this trump supporter took the extra step of going to the restaurant manager and told him that walker was faking his veteran creds and said the service animal is fake  too the manager  identified by walker as wesley patrick  interrogated walker and then took his food away from him even though walker once again showed proof of his military service  i was seated and eating my food  the waitress packed the rest of my food in a to go box because i had to go pick up my wife  i got my food and tipped the waitress  then the manager  mr  wesley patrick  comes from the same area in the back  walked up  and rudly informs me that a guest said that i was not a real soldier because i had my hat on indoors  other guests heard him  he asked for my military id  i was calm  and provided it to him  i also provided him with my  which is my discharge paperwork  at that point he should have just said  i am sorry sir  thank you for your service  instead he followed up with  the guest also said your dog is not a service dog   barack had his red service vest on  and his certified service tags  i was sitting for  minutes prior with barack beforehand  at this point i was grossly offended embarrassed dehumanized and started recording mr  wesley snatched my food away  made body contact  and because patrick took the word of a racist over the evidence walker should have never had to present but did so anyway  he is now out of a job and chili s has issued a formal apology  on a day where we served more than   free meals as a small gesture of our appreciation for our veterans and active military for their service  we fell short   said chili s president kelli valade this kind of behavior by trump supporters has become an epidemic in this country ever since donald trump won on election day  hundreds of incidents of violence  threats  defacing of property  racism  and sexism have been reported across the nation and people are terrified these trump supporters need to be arrested and a strong message needs to be sent that this behavior won t be tolerated featured image  facebook
