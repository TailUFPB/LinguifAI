you almost have to feel sorry for republicans  almost   they find themselves between a really unpopular president and a party that only rewards those who are perfectly loyal to dear orange leader ronna romney mcdaniel  the current head of the republican national committee and niece of the last republican presidential loser  mitt romney  says that not supporting donald trump should be a cautionary tale for any republican that ever hopes to win another election on cnn s laura ingraham show  mcdaniel tried to pretend that the rnc stays out of primaries  but that gop sen  jeff flake was sure to lose because  unlike the toy brown shirted robots in congress  he refused to march  at least on paper  to trump s xenophobic  and generally everything phobic  message flake wrote a book called  conscience of a conservative  a rejection of destructive politics and a return to principle   a title he only partly stole from barry goldwater flake dared take on trump and his own party  saying that trump is a symptom of a dying party  but make no mistake  as a governing philosophy  conservatism is indeed in crisis   and not in spite of this apparent success but because of it   later blasting self described conservatives for changing their political stripes  depending on fashion or the passions of the day or based on how much applause a line in a speech received at a rally  we have given in to the politics of anger   the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate   flake writes   these are the spasms of a dying party  source  nprnow the party is pissed  mcdaniel fell short of threatening flake  but the implication was clear as day   if republicans don t support trump  they will likely lose  they need to have another candidate that they supported and the three rnc members that have to agree on that other candidate for rule  to apply  but it is in their bylaws   mcdaniel said   it s just interesting from a party standpoint  we do have governance  we have  members that they make those decisions  sometimes you get in the nitty gritty  but i will say if you look at   the senators that did not support the president  and let s look at joe heck and kelly ayotte  they fell short in those senate races  so there is a cautionary tale there because voters want you to support the president in his agenda  source  cnnwe should note that flake votes with trump   percent of the time  i guess his conscience is that of a man who wants to sell books mcdaniel  of course  neglects to mention that during the election  trump s approval ratings were sort of close to  percent  now  he s below  percent  between his inability to negotiate deals of any kind and his efforts to take health insurance away from his own base  people are beginning to turn on him  it s not the same political climate as it was just a few months ago  so seeing the  election as a cautionary tale for anything  other than letting russians interfere  is pretty much moot what this does say  though  is that republicans aren t going to be turning on trump anytime soon and that impeachment will be an uphill battle  at least if they want the support of their party  which of course  is more important than their country featured image via mark wilson getty images
