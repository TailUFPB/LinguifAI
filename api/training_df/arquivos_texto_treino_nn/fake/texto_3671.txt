we ve known for more than a year that some republicans are less than thrilled with donald trump  and now they re even more irritated because he won and they get to put up with him  now the party must grapple with his extreme agenda  and there are actually several republican senators who are looking to block  or at least mitigate  some of what trump wants to do these aren t just any republican senators  either  many have a lot of influence and are seen as leaders  whether they re officially part of the leadership or not  they include sens  susan collins  maine   jeff flake and john mccain  arizona   rand paul  kentucky   lamar alexander  tennessee   ben sasse  nebraska  and lindsey graham  south carolina  and all of them have different agenda items against which they ll work one of the worst potential thorns in trump s side could be rand paul  in   he was part of the infuriating group that shut down the government for  days over the affordable care act  but later said it was a  dumb idea   he s been a terrible obstructionist  but he is willing and ready to use his obstructionism to filibuster trump s cabinet picks yes  he will turn against his own to prevent some of trump s cabinet nominations from getting confirmed if he has to  he spoke out against both john bolton and rudy giuliani for secretary of state  going so far as to call bolton  a menace   bolton doesn t seem to be in the running anymore  but giuliani is  there s a possibility that paul might oppose other potential picks as well  depending on who they are and how paul sees them it would only take three republicans to block trump s nominees on the floor  assuming democrats unite against any controversial picks susan collins of maine is more centrist than many of her republican colleagues  and she s very good at building bipartisan coalitions  along with others in this group  if need be  they can gain control over an issue and take some of the wind out of the leadership s sails ben sasse of nebraska is prepared to challenge trump on executive overreach  trump has said  in plain language  that he plans to use executive orders to accomplish some of his agenda on his very first day in office  he also used words like  reign   during his campaign  which sasse took major issue with  depending on what all those items are  trump could feel pushback from sasse and other conservatives looking to rein in the executive branch john mccain carries a deep distrust of trump s buddy putin  he  lindsey graham and even ben sasse don t believe it s a smart idea for us to try and work more closely with russia  especially if it comes at the expense of our european allies  that could mean opposing any effort to withdraw from nato and opposing joining forces with russia and syrian dictator bashar al assad we ve tried to  reset  relations with russia before  and putin decided to play conqueror and invade ukraine  mccain rightfully believes putin is not to be trusted  considering his and trump s bromance  trump may not be trustworthy in this arena either  making mccain and graham into major problems for him lamar alexander has been urging his colleagues to proceed cautiously with trying to repeal the aca because developing a replacement could take years  simply pulling it out  root and branch  as quickly as possible could be disastrous for the u s   particularly if it creates a vacuum while they re hashing out every idea imaginable for replacing it  it would especially hurt the working class  many of whom have been able to get healthcare thanks to expanded medicaid coverage and who trump claimed to represent alexander also has close relationships with democratic senators chuck schumer  the new minority leader   and patty murray  patty murray is the senior democrat on the senate health  education  labor and pensions committee  which alexander chairs  he can be a voice of reason sometimes  if for no other reason than he really doesn t like feeling like he must vote along party lines it s true that some of these issues will put these senators at odds with each other  however  the senate is split   right now  which could go to   depending on what happens in louisiana next month  the narrow margin means it doesn t take many to create a pseudo majority of democrats in this environment and while  yes  every one of these senators has been problematic for progress over the years  any republican opposition to trump could be extremely helpful every one of these senators has said that they ll take things issue by issue  rather than oppose trump unilaterally  it s also hard to say just how committed to their issues they are vs  how committed to toeing the party line they are  if they actually remain true to their consciences  they ll be the senators we need to keep checks on the more extreme house  and on trump s own insanity featured image by drew angerer via getty images
