following a traumatic election night and donald trump s unexpected win  of the electoral college   democrats have been scrambling to figure out what went wrong  beyond finding out where polling malfunctioned  liberals are struggling to understand what has happened within the party and how to go about fixing it  but as usual  there are some very different ideas about where the problem lies and how to remedy the situation   even when it comes to diversity two very different visions for the future of the democratic partyaccording to mark lilla of the new york times  we need to quit focusing on our individual identities if we hope to save the democratic party  in his piece the end of identity liberalism  he writes that we have been taught to celebrate  our differences  however  he argues that  this is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy   but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age  in recent years american liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial  gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism s message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing  our focus on teaching diversity in schools  lilla said   has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self defined groups  and indifferent to the task of reaching out to americans in every walk of life  lilla said that hillary clinton s great mistake was appealing to each individual group  which left out the white working class  national politics in healthy periods is not about  difference   it is about commonality  and it will be dominated by whoever best captures americans  imaginations about our shared destiny  he rejected the  whitelash  theory but also failed to acknowledge the blatant racism of trump s campaign  he writes   the whitelash thesis is convenient because it absolves liberals of not recognizing how their own obsession with diversity has encouraged white  rural  religious americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored  however  lilla said nothing about the racism  anti semitism  and islamophobia that was the basis of trump s campaign  trump used the racial tensions that resulted from having a black man in the white house and stoked the fires of bigotry  from the first day trump announced that he was running for president  he used xenophobia to rally white america behind him  he was endorsed by the ku klux klan and has now installed a white nationalist as his chief strategist trump never  at any point  offered a real plan for  making america great again  other than to promise that he would make life hell for anybody who isn t a straight white christian male  but bigotry was enough to rally white america behind him lilla then warned that  liberals should bear in mind that the first identity movement in american politics was the ku klux klan  which still exists  those who play the identity game should be prepared to lose it   he concludes that  we need a post identity liberalism   and argued that taking on the concerns of specific minorities can be risky we need a post identity liberalism  and it should draw from the past successes of pre identity liberalism  such a liberalism would concentrate on widening its base by appealing to americans as americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them  it would speak to the nation as a nation of citizens who are in this together and must help one another  as for narrower issues that are highly charged symbolically and can drive potential allies away  especially those touching on sexuality and religion  such a liberalism would work quietly  sensitively and with a proper sense of scale   to paraphrase bernie sanders  america is sick and tired of hearing about liberals  damn bathrooms  steve phillips at the nation has a radically different solution to what he feels is the problem facing progressives  as he wrote in his article  it s time to diversify the democratic party leadership  and this picture says it all phillips explains that  nearly the entire top level of progressive leadership that controlled    billion in spending was made up of white people    all of the individuals in the above table are good people  but none of them are from the hood  they don t hang out in black barbershops and beauty salons  they don t feel their hearts race when they see a police car s lights shining in their rear view mirror  they don t have family facing deportation to mexico  they ve never been told to  go back to where you came from   called a racial slur  or told to speak english  they ve never been detained at an airport because they look suspicious  they haven t lived the experiences of the people who comprise almost half of all democratic voters to win elections in an increasingly multiracial nation requires leadership and top staff who come from  understand  and are committed to the rapidly growing communities of color that are transforming the composition of the country  whereas lilla says we need to move away from identity  phillips argues that now is the time  more than ever  to embrace our diversity at the top level of the democratic party s leadership   as last week s election revealed  the foundation of the democratic home is structurally unsound  the time is now to focus on and fix the problem  and the first step in that direction is putting in place party leadership who understand how to build power and win elections in a racially combustible environment   phillips concluded i tend to think it is a mixture of both these philosophies  without a doubt  we need more diversity at the top  even though lilla got so much wrong  he was right in that we must find the common threads that unite us all as americans  yet  it is impossible to do that without acknowledging individuality and cultural diversity  to do that  we must do exactly as phillips said and make sure the leadership of our party reflects the ever more diverse makeup of the country featured image via insurestory com
