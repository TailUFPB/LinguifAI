apparently  donald trump has yet to learn his lesson about attacking former president barack obama last weekend  the disgraceful tweeter in chief decided to accuse his beloved predecessor of wiretapping his phones in the trump tower before the u s  election  he immediately regretted this  because his reckless lies ignited not only tons of backlash against him  but also prompted further investigations into the russia scandal america has not even recovered from the shock that a current potus would accuse a former leader of the free world of doing such a thing  regardless  trump took to twitter saturday morning to attack obama again  at around   am  trump exercised at least some self control and only tweeted one anti obama message  this time insulting obamacare while hyping up the gop s replacement bill  which by the way  is an absolute disaster and pretty much hated by everyone   trump tweeted trump s claim that obamacare is  imploding  is just as hilarious as it is ridiculous  of course  there are some things about obamacare that could use amending  but americans  for the most part  are very happy with obamacare and are pissed off that the republican party is going to repeal it  stripping millions of people of their health care  not to mention  the sloppy replacement plan that the gop is putting in place has already been highly criticized by democrats and republicans alike and is sure to be a death sentence for many americans fortunately  america isn t about to let trump forget that his ideas suck  once trump tweeted his attack on obamacare  twitter users rushed in to take trump right off his high horse and bring him back to reality  here are some of the best responses       trump is absolutely delusional if he thinks the gop s plan is going to put obamacare to shame   and americans will make sure he realizes it featured image via scott olson getty images
