democratic members of the congressional black caucus  cbc  condemned donald trump and his unbelievably tone deaf attempt at african american  outreach   slamming him as a racist who has spent his entire campaign cozying up to white supremacists the cbc convened a conference call on tuesday to denounce trump  and accused his campaign of not only perpetuating stereotypes but also deliberately dog whistling to white supremacists in an effort to turn their bigotry into votes rep  gregory meeks  d n y   said that the republican nominee is  one of the most racist  sexist and bigoted candidates  to launch a bid for the white house in modern history  and accused trump of having a  kinship with white supremacists  he knows the audience he s trying to reach out to and it s not african americans   meeks said   he s trying to appeal to david duke and the racists of the world with what they think are stereotypes    he s trying to appeal to the worst of the white supremacists and others he s been catering to in the campaign to try and help them with turnout  in the past few days  trump has attempted to pander to minority voters but has done an exceedingly poor job of it  in an effort to garner votes from african americans he claimed that their communities are  war zones  and that they live in fear of being shot at any moment  trump s big selling point was that since black americans live in poverty  have poor education  and a lack of job opportunities they might as well vote for him  after all  it isn t like they have anything to lose  right trump s blatant racism and p ss poor excuse for minority outreach aren t going over well with african american voters or lawmakers cbc chairman g k  butterfield  d n c   blasted trump for giving speeches supposedly meant to draw black voters to crowds that are overwhelmingly white and said that the gop nominee s so called outreach is  a slap in the face  to the african american community  if donald trump truly cared about african americans  he d disavow his long history of hateful and racist attacks against our community  he d apologize for having discriminated against black families   he d disavow his support for white supremacists and white supremacy   butterfield said the democrats taking part in tuesday s call ripped trump s past history of discriminatory housing practices during his years as a real estate investor and his habit of exploiting minority workers as a builder they noted that his campaign has been littered with bigotry from the very beginning when he announced his candidacy by calling all mexicans  rapists   since then  he has been reluctant to disavow the ku klux klan and david duke  called for all muslims to be banned from entering the united states  accused a judge of being incapable of impartiality because of his mexican heritage  and has refused to believe that president obama was born in america in response to trump and his racist rhetoric  democrats say they are pushing their minority voter registration efforts into overdrive and plan to set records with black and hispanic turnout at the polls in november  to say that minority voters are eager to cast their ballots for hillary clinton to make sure that trump never gets anywhere near the white house would be an understatement  donald trump is a voter registration machine and a citizenship advocating engine   said rep  luis guti rrez  d ill     this is a little bit of thank you  because our community has never been so united or energized since that moment you set foot in national arena  trump has said repeatedly that he will do great with african americans and hispanics  it is hard to know what in the world ever gave him that idea  but his  outreach  isn t helping his cause and surely won t convince minority voters to turn a blind eye to the fact that he has built his entire campaign on bigotry featured image via mark wilson getty images
