late monday night  cnn s don lemon had a phone guest who called in to the show from the apartment she was trapped in with her cousin and a one month old baby  ices bragg  in a pronounced southern drawl  described the scene around her  rising water  fires visible from the window nearby  and perhaps most disturbing of all  an upstairs neighbor taking advantage of the situation lemon asked the woman to repeat what she had told him previously about the neighbor lemon  you told us last hour that one of your neighbors was trying to go upstairs to another apartment  and what happened bragg  um  the lady had told her that if she had three hundred dollars to come in to her apartment  she would let her lemon  wow  unbelievable bragg  yes sir  it is the exchange was heart stopping  we saw price gouging on gas after hurricanes katrina and sandy  but watching big companies take advantage of desperate consumers is almost nothing new in this country  to hear an account of a neighbor  with the advantage of higher ground  threatening to let people die unless they pony up is nothing short of shocking an economy based on unbridled capitalism like we see in america almost guarantees that there will be price gouging in some areas during times of heightened demand for whatever someone s selling  but at the very least  there are laws prohibiting the practice during a state of emergency  that s little comfort to the poor  but it does mean that this upstairs neighbor could   no pun intended   pay a price this is not the first report of price gouging in the state  houston is currently deluged with trillions of gallons of water  when those waters recede  the complaints that have been pouring in to the texas attorney general s office will likely result in serious trouble for those they hold to account watch the cnn clip here featured image via video screen capture
