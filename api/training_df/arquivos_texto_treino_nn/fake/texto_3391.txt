if donald trump thinks he can use the presidency to make business deals for himself and his family  senate democrats are prepared to defend the sanctity of the office over the course of the campaign and after the election  trump has insisted that his many conflicts of interest surrounding his business empire do not matter  but the constitution says that officeholders in the united states government may not receive presents  emoluments  or titles from foreign states article i  section  states no title of nobility shall be granted by the united states  and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them  shall  without the consent of the congress  accept of any present  emolument  office  or title  of any kind whatever  from any king  prince  or foreign state and since trump s business receives money from foreign nations  he would be violating the constitution on the first day of his administration  and it s even worse when one considers that trump s businesses have ties to businesses backed by foreign governments such as in the philippines  and that foreign governments could blackmail trump by threatening his profits or his foreign business partners  trump could also use the presidency to extract business deals from nations in exchange for american support or aid  even if helping certain nations goes against the best interests of our country in short  trump should be forced to put his company in a blind trust or sell it altogether to avoid these problems and put these conflicts of interest to rest that s why senate democrats plan to introduce a bill to do just that  our president elect has significantly greater risk of business and financial conflicts of interest than any other president  yet has so far refused to follow the precedent set by previous presidents  to this day  president elect trump has refused to address his conflicts of interest   senator chris coons said coons  along with senators elizabeth warren  ben cardin  dick durbin  and jeff merkley have all endorsed the legislation and pointed out that presidents have divested their financial interests to avoid violating the constitution for decades  if trump is allowed to be president and keep his business decades of precedent would be wiped out  paving the way for anyone to use the presidency for personal profit  the american people deserve to know that the president of the united states is working to do what s best for the country   not using his office to do what s best for himself and his businesses   elizabeth warren said   the only way for president elect trump to truly eliminate conflicts of interest is to divest his financial interests and place them in a blind trust  this has been the standard for previous presidents  and our bill makes clear the continuing expectation that president elect trump do the same  republicans  of course  will probably refuse to bring the bill to a vote on the senate floor  and if they do they ll be helping trump violate the constitution that they claim to hold so dear senate democrat s are preparing for a war and they should be  after all  republicans have established precedent for obstructing and attacking a president over the last eight years and turnabout is fair play  anything less than fighting trump s agenda every second of every day over the next four years is unacceptable featured image  justin sullivan getty images
