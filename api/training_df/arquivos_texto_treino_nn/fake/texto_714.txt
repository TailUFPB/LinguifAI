jason brown  despite the  colorful  appellation  is about the whitest name i ve heard all day  except i didn t hear it today  not in the news anyway  not on that little  trending  bar on the side of my facebook feed  or with a hashtag in front of it on twitter  which is weird  because a dude named jason brown murdered a police officer in indianapolis on thursday i can t help but think if his skin matched his name  you d already know who i was talking about  in fact  if jason brown looked a little more like michael brown  you might already know he had previous drug charges  you might even have seen this picture of him by now image via twitteri know you haven t seen that picture until now  though  in fact  i know unless you clicked the link above  you still think i m just making some point about how white people can get away with all kinds of stuff people of color in america can t  i m not  of course  i m just here to provide some contrast for the very limited  very  very sanitized coverage available so far about jason brown  from the south side of indianapolis  indiana all that is according to literally everyone the news has bothered to contact so far about this guy who murdered a cop  perhaps if there was some footage of him selling loose cigarettes you see  when jason brown got in a terrible car accident and officers responded to the scene  they expected to find someone in need of assistance  the slain policeman  lieutenant aaron allan  certainly didn t expect to be met by a driver hanging upside down in the demolished car  ready to fire multiple shots into his torso lt  allan died later thursday so where is the wall to wall coverage of this cop murderer  it must be hiding behind this family provided picture that the news is running with all i can say is  i ve been working on this article for a while now  and i just came across the very first link that provided any insight as to why he might have completely broken character and started shooting at the officer  an indy nbc affiliate says the police recovered  small bags of weed   which of course is possession with intent to deliver  prison time i wonder if  when they finally do charge brown with the officer s murder  since they still haven t   they ll tack on those drug charges too  like they would if he was actually  um  brown featured image via joe raedle getty images
