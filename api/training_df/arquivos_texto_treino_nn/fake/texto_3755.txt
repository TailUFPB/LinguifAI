donald trump says he wants to be the president for all americans  but he has put a literal white supremacist steps from the oval office  and is busily surrounding himself with bigots of many stripes  now  he has picked racist alabama senator jeff sessions to be his attorney general  sessions is a guy who couldn t even get confirmed as a federal judge by the united states senate in  because he was too racist  well  progressive firebrand and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren is having none of it  and is demanding that trump dump sessions senator warren issues a blistering statement rebuking both sessions and trump  which read  instead of embracing the bigotry that fueled his campaign rallies  i urge president elect trump to reverse his apparent decision to nominate senator sessions to be attorney general of the united states  if he refuses  then it will fall to the senate to exercise fundamental moral leadership for our nation and all of its people  thirty years ago  a different republican senate rejected senator sessions  nomination to a federal judgeship  in doing so  that senate affirmed that there can be no compromise with racism  no negotiation with hate  today  a new republican senate must decide whether self interest and political cowardice will prevent them from once again doing what is right  the heart of this statement is what is important  after all  we know that trump has not the moral character to realize why picking sessions  white nationalist steve bannon  or any of the other appalling people in his inner circle to fill out his administration is such a huge problem  therefore  it will be up to the senate to do their jobs and to deny sessions his confirmation  unfortunately  bannon s appointment is all in trump s hands  so he s in the white house for the long haul  however  sessions is a different story  therefore  the senators who are elected to represent all of the people need to do their jobs and reject the bigots trump is busily nominating i know that donald trump values loyalty above all else   that goes back to the undeniable fact that he has serious authoritarian tendencies  sessions has been loyal  and this job is his reward  however  one of the most important jobs of the attorney general is to enforce civil rights laws and to protect minorities  therefore  sessions would be an absolute threat to minorities in that role  senate   no matter your party affiliation   do your jobs and follow in the footsteps of your honorable predecessors  and refuse to confirm jeff sessions as the top law enforcement officer of the united states featured image via justin sullivan getty images
