the gop has been having a field day spreading false rumors about hillary clinton s health  and it looks like karma has finally arrived  on tuesday morning  cnn medical correspondent sanjay gupta called out donald trump s personal  doctor  after noticing a questionable note about the  extraordinary  health of the republican nominee trump s doctor  dr  harold bornstein  had previously said that trump would  be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency    but gupta was here to dispel that statement  delving into bornstein s sketchy history  gupta told host chris cuomo  he s been a doctor with trump for  years  between him and his father  he says he s a fellow of the american college of gastroenterology  so a gi doc  interestingly  we called that particular organization  and  they said he was a member   but he hasn t been a member there in over  years  since   now  suddenly  trump s medical records and his physician seem just as untrustworthy as his campaign   and yet no one should be surprised because trump s campaign has been entirely comprised of lies and scams the letter gupta is referring to is a note which trump released instead of real medical records  not sketchy at all  right   bornsteinin examining the letter closely  gupta said his instincts were set off by the fact that the  doctor  had used the word  positive  as a synonym for normal and several other terms in the letter didn t seem right  to top it all off  gupta discovered that the younger bornstein wasn t telling the truth about his credentials  either  in fact  the hospital  lenox hill hospital  says he s part of the section of gastroenterology   he s not actually a member of that section  he does have admitting privileges at the hospital but he s not  part of that section   so there are some things in the letter with regard to his qualifications that are a little bit questionable  really  it was more  sort of  the language of this letter that i thought was quite surprising  it wasn t written the way that many typical medical letters are written  you can watch the segment where gupta exposes trump s con artist doctor below   drsanjaygupta digs into donald trump s health report  the doctor s  qualifications are a little bit questionable  https   t co   new day   newday  august    image via facebook
