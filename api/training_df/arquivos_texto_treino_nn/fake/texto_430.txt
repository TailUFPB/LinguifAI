ever since donald trump rode down the escalator at trump tower and announced his disgraceful bid for the white house  people have been making jokes about his alleged love affair with russian autocrat vladimir putin  this is more than fair  after all  putin is the one person trump refuses to criticize  the orange one has viciously attacked everyone from the cast of the hit broadway musical hamilton  to congresspeople and senators in both his own party and the opposing party  too many celebrities to mention  cable news hosts  and just about anyone else you could think of  but not vladimir putin  not ever  the only close second is trump s bizarre coddling of white supremacists and nazis therefore  it must be the ultimate humiliation to have putin do the unthinkable to trump in a very public way  and say  and i quote  that   is not my bride   according to the new york times  the russian dictator seems to be tiring of trump s chaos  at this point  putin has spent a lot of political capital on the world stage helping get trump elected  and yet trump has failed to deliver sanctions relief  a better u s  russia relationship  or anything else to the brutal dictator  putin reportedly said of trump   not my bride  and i am not his groom  of course  trump wants to be seen as a man s man  so to be emasculated by being referred to in the feminine by the man whose bitch everyone has accused him of being is really rubbing salt in that wound  apparently  putin made the remarks when being asked about what he thought of the idea that trump might be removed from office forcibly before his four year term is completed  of course  no matter how humiliating this is for trump  there will be no retaliation  he can t strike out at putin  after all  this is the one man on the face of the planet who likely has the major goods on trump now  if only putin would grow tired of this game and release the most damning information ever and help us end this embarrassing american nightmare featured image via sean gallup getty images
