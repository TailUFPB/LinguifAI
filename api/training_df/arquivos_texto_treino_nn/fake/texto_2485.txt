people who parrot and spread trump s claims that the media lies absolutely cannot stand it when they re asked to provide examples  they try and deflect  just like trump  except not all of them seem to be as skilled at twisting things around as trump tries to be  and trump himself becomes completely unhinged when someone in the media fact checks him while talking to him   one caller into a british show ranted and raved about how the media has been twisting all these leaks coming from the white house  and the host  james o brien  kept asking him for just one example of this the caller became increasingly agitated at that  because apparently one shouldn t have to have evidence and examples to make a claim like that  o brien first wanted to know how the leaks out of the white house could be real  but the news reporting the leaks was fake  the caller said  what he s trying to say to say is the media twist the leaks  if they ve just got one paragraph of the truth  they ll add another paragraph that s fake  when o brien began pressing him harder for an example  he turned all trumpian  saying he distrusts  and even hates  the media  but never answering o brien s questions  the ending has quite the kicker  though  and the caller s last words are just laughable  watch below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
