donald trump s roll back of actions designed to fight climate change horrified the legendary conservationist jane goodall is famous for her longtime studies of apes and chimpanzees during the  campaign  goodall put this expertise to good use by comparing trump to the chimpanzees she researched  in many ways the performances of donald trump remind me of male chimpanzees and their dominance rituals   goodall said   in order to impress rivals  males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays  stamping  slapping the ground  dragging branches  throwing rocks  the more vigorous and imaginative the display  the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy  and the longer he is likely to maintain that position  and she was right  trump s ape like behavior thrilled his supporters and sent him to the white house where he has embarrassed himself and the nation so much that many americans probably wish an actual chimpanzee had won instead of him  especially after what trump did earlier this week as a conservationist  goodall has traveled the world and witnessed the effects of climate change firsthand so when trump signed yet another executive order to reverse rules put in in place by president obama to slow down or reverse the effects of climate change  hr usual optimism soured referring to trump s executive order as  immensely depressing   goodall expressed how sad it is that the united states is declining to play its part to save the world  many of us  not just my institute but many  we ve been working really hard to create the paris agreement and global efforts to cut emissions   goodall told journalists   thinking that the usa isn t going to play its part  such an industrial country  is really very  very sad  and it means we re going to have to work harder  indeed  while the united states is not the only nation in the world  our influence on the international stage is critical to any agreement of between countries  especially when it comes to financial  technological  and military resources trump s irresponsible order to reverse our nation s involvement in fighting climate change not only threatens the rest of the world  it threatens america as well  especially our coastlines  which are in danger of being under several feet of water due to sea level rise caused by increasingly melting ice caps trump s beloved mar a lago resort in florida will be under water in the near future if we do not act now but trump had adopted the conservative line that climate change is not real and that science is fake  he s a climate change denier  and jane goodall has zero tolerance for that stance  i would not dream of refuting the science that shows climate change is happening   goodall said   it s happening everywhere  it s already having devastating effects in many parts of the world  the droughts are getting worse  flooding s getting worse  storms  hurricanes are getting more frequent and more violent  and the main thing is unpredictability  everywhere i go  people say   well it s not normally like that at this time of year  and trump s attack on climate action is causing scientists to lose hope  there is definitely a feeling of gloom and doom among all the people i know   goodall continued   if we allow this feeling of doom and gloom to continue  then it will be very  very bad  but my job is to give people hope  bu despite her high hopes that we can push back and reinstate the climate actions  even goodall conceded that she sees the future of our children and grandchildren  being unraveled  right before our eyes by a man who doesn t care about thing or anyone but himself  even a chimpanzee would have more compassion featured image  olivier douliery pool getty images
