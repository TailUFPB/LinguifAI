as donald trump continues to sink with female voters   including the crucial  white women with a college degree  who typically vote republican   his campaign has decided that the best way to court these important voters the only way they know how  blame hillary clinton for bill s infidelities after failing to bring up the issue at the debate  in which trump congratulated himself for not doing   surrogates like rudy giuliani told reporters clinton was  stupid  for staying with bill  because he has room to talk about cheating   and trump hinted that in future debates the issue will come up but it was trump s deputy campaign manager  david bossie  who had the most repugnant answer regarding bill s decades old infidelities i think that if you look at hillary clinton s background and if you look at her being an enabler  really  in the   and really attacking these women  it goes against everything that she now tries to spout as a candidate for president so because bill cheated that makes hillary an enabler  not leaving her husband in trying marital times somehow makes it all her fault and she should get the flack  does that mean ivana trump was an enabler  does that mean marla maples was an enabler  who knows  maybe melania is an enabler  given donald trump s track record  it wouldn t be so far fetched to assume he s cheated on her already and  my god  she attacked women who claimed to sleep with her husband while her husband was lying to her face  that never happens david bossie is what we would call a deplorable  his comments demonstrate a complete lack of sympathy  and an even deeper lack of political knowledge   women do not respond well to martial attacks  as realclearpolitics writes  donald trump is still a long shot candidate for the white house  why  female voters do not trust him and he s losing with them  badly what a great campaign strategy bossie has  lose women at a record rate and then blame the first female candidate for her husband s cheating  that should go over real well with female voters  who already view donald trump as the sexist pig he is newsflash to trump  having kellyanne conway  katrina pearson and hope hicks be the faces of your campaign won t save you when you have people like bossie  gingrich and giuliani flapping their gums about marriage and infidelities featured image via ben jackson getty images
