the men investigating the working conditions at the factory that makes  among other products  ivanka trump s shoe line  have either been arrested or have gone missing one of the three men has been arrested while the other two have gone missing  while there is currently no evidence to point the finger at donald trump  or even his buddy vladimir putin  this does bode badly for blotus in other ways first  the facts of the story  from cbs news hua haifeng was accused of illegal surveillance  according to his wife  deng guilian  who said the police called her tuesday afternoon  deng said the caller told her she didn t need to know the details  only that she would not be able to see  speak with or receive money from her husband  the family s breadwinner china labor watch executive director li qiang said he lost contact with hua haifeng and the other two men  li zhao and su heng  over the weekend  by tuesday  after dozens of unanswered calls  he had concluded   they must be held either by the factory or the police to be unreachable   officials at the public security bureau in ganzhou would not confirm to cbs news if hua was detained  but his wife was made aware of the charge tuesday afternoon china labor watch is an american human rights organization that tracks workplace abuses in china  they were planning on publishing a report about the factory s low wages  excessive overtime and alleged misuse of interns  next month  they have been investigating chinese factories for  years  and they say that it s never been more of a political hotbed than it is now  this is the first time that their investigators have gone missing or have been detained while this does sound like some putinesque tactics  it s pretty much indicative of any strong arm dictator  the chinese ruling communist party is feeling especially vulnerable right now and they re cracking down on all sorts of threats to the party we may never know whether these men were targeted because it s the factory that makes ivanka trump s shoes  but we do know that trump has an affinity for dictators and has even expressed that he had  great chemistry  with chinese president xi jinping  it also raises a lot of questions as to why this particular factory  one that manufactures shoes for the daughter of the american president  was targeted we also know that thanks to china  trump is about to get a lot richer  in february  the chinese government approved  trademarks that trump had been seeking for almost a year  they had been held up thanks to once he became president  the process seemed to move rather quickly  trump has also softened his stance toward china from what it was on the campaign trail  while still a candidate  trump accused china of manipulating currency there are four possibilities here  the chinese are solely behind it  the russians are behind it  or trump is behind it  which is pretty much the same as the russians being behind it  or it was a collaboration  when you follow the money  there are two clear losers when the violations are reported  while no one is accusing trump of orchestrating this  is he smart enough  anyway    he  along with the chinese government both benefit from this report not being released  for both trumps  it might just be a happy coincidence featured image via sean gallup getty images
