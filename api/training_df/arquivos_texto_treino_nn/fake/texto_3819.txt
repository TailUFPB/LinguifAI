this literally made me scream at my television in rage if there is one person who has been more hypocritical than donald trump throughout this election year  it s kellyanne conway time and time again  she has defended trump s claims that the election is rigged and supported him when he incited his protesters to threaten violence when he refused to say that he would concede the election if the results didn t go his way but there conway was on fox news on sunday morning whining to chris wallace about anti trump protesters and painting trump as an example of unity after being asked about outgoing senator harry reid s message that the responsibility for healing the nation rests at donald trump s feet because he divided the nation for a year and a half with bigoted and hateful rhetoric  conway reacted like the total hypocritical bitch she is  i find harry reid s public comments and insults about donald trump and other republicans to be beyond the pale  they re incredibly disappointing   conway said even though she never said the same thing about trump when he publicly insulted a long list of people and groups during his campaign  then she warned reid that there could be some retaliation  he should be very careful about characterizing somebody in a legal sense  he thinks he being some kind of political pundit there  but i would say be very careful about the way you characterize it  seriously  this is the kind of bullshit that petty tyrants display when something is said about them that they don t like and if that weren t enough  conway actually had the gall to attack the people who are protesting trump  i m calling for responsibility and maturity   conway began despite the fact that her boss never exercised either of those during the election  the hypocrite then complained about being allegedly booed and spit on at the protests and accused the protesters of being at trump tower for  nefarious  reasons  you know  because she would be saying the same thing about trump supporters had they lost the election  right  she then lectured reid that he  has a platform to do good here   completely ignoring the irony of her statement  for over a year  trump has had hundreds of opportunities to use his platform  to do good here  and he squandered it  instead  he promoted bigotry  incited violence and hate against others and was the complete opposite of a role model for children speaking of children  conway had this infuriating thing to say  i want the children of america to see decency and honor from our leaders and elected officials and they re seeing that in president elect trump  seriously  conway actually spewed this bullshit and then she suggested that president obama has not been a decent and honorable man until this week here s the video via youtube  try not to punch your computer or smash your phone as your anger rises donald trump and kellyanne conway have no right to expect unity when all they did throughout this campaign is divide  they certainly have no right lecturing anyone on the concepts of decency  responsibility  honor  or maturity  neither of these sorry excuses for a human being ever displayed an ounce of those concepts throughout the last year and a half  nor did they display these concepts at any point during the last eight years  for some reason  people like conway expect everyone to kiss donald trump s ass for the sake of unity but they conveniently forget the utter disrespect and contempt they had for president obama  they refused to unite behind president obama and they exercised nothing but immaturity  irresponsibility  indecency  and dishonor from day one  and now they expect the opposite for trump   unbelievable featured image  screenshot
