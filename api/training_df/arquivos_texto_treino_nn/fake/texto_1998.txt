 snitches get stitches  is kremlin s message to the united states   at least according to russian foreign ministry spokesperson maria zakharova  anyway  discussing rex tillerson s planned visit to russia  zakharova complained about the leaks coming out of the trump administration first  the us department of state asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute  until we coordinated the date  we did as they asked  but a day or two later the information was leaked by the us state department and sometimes by the us administration  frankly  this put russia and the media in a strange situation  because they didn t know who to believe   the official agencies or the many leaks if the trump administration continues leaking like a colander  she says  there will be consequences also  i would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the united states but also russia  which has become a tradition in washington in the past few years  continues  there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that washington asked us to keep secret  for example  things that happened during president obama s terms in office  believe me  this could be very interesting information recently  trump has been in a panic trying to contain leaks   particularly about his and his administration s relationship with russia at this point  it is fair to ask  what do they have on him and other republicans  is this threat to release obama era information a veiled warning to the donald to plug the holes through which facts are slipping featured image via getty images  mikhail svetlov pool
