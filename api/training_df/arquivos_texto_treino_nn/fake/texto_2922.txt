the department of the interior has a twitter account just like pretty much everyone else these days  including government agencies  but it seems that those agencies aren t immune to censorship from our dear  sweet  thin skinned  narcissistic cheeto in chief  the department of the interior was ordered to shut down its twitter accounts friday evening after the national park service had the gall to post two  ahem  unflattering tweets the first has been flying around social media  and has to do with trump s pathetically dismal crowds  particularly in comparison to obama s crowds for both of his inaugurations the second tweet made note of gaps in policy on the new white house website  including scrubbing the site of anything having to do with civil rights  lgbtq rights  climate change and the aca apparently  it was a park service employee who retweeted these things  and either trump himself couldn t handle it and wanted to show them who s really boss now  or the dept  of the interior is afraid enough of trump to not only delete those two tweets  but comply with an order to shut down their entire twitter presence  the washington post got hold of the email with that order  all bureaus and the department have been directed by incoming administration to shut down twitter platforms immediately until further notice  it would actually be understandable for them to delete the offending tweets and reprimand  reassign  or even fire the employee responsible  but to have to shut down their entire twitter presence because of two goddamn tweets from one agency welcome to trump s america the department has dozens of official twitter accounts across ten agencies  but that email was described as an  urgent directive  with which they had to comply an official with knowledge of the incident sounds a bit like he s been cowed a government official familiar with the stand down said the agency is investigating whether the retweets were purposeful   errant  or  whether we ve been hacked  they were not reflective of park service policy   said the official  who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the directive  the stand down was  precautionary  until the agency completes a review of its twitter accounts  the official said this is terrifying  this is dictatorial behavior  not the behavior of an incoming president who believes in democracy featured image by alex wong via getty images
