there s a lot being said about football players across the nfl standing together in unity against police brutality  this is even more pertinent now  as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than seattle seahawks  star cornerback richard sherman  he said  i m not going to answer any questions today  and it s no offense to you guys  but the state of things in the world today is very interesting  i think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they re being ignored  whether they re taking a knee or whether they re locking arms  you know  they re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause  and i think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed  and i think people are still missing the point the reason these guys are kneeling  the reason we re locking arms is to bring people together  to make people aware that this is not right  you know  it s not right for people to get killed in the street  sherman then explains how he s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police  but still being fearful that they might get shot  he says   that s an unfortunate time to be living   especially when people are being killed for no reason he then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their first amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight  sherman says  when a guy takes a knee  you can ignore it  you can say he s not being patriotic  he s not honoring the flag  i m doing none of those things  i m saying straight up  this is wrong and we need to do something  and something most certainly needs to be done  and done now watch sherman speak here wow  this is a must watch seattle seahawks  richard sherman addresses police killings of african american men at presser  then walks out  pic twitter com goaosgufax  kyle griffin     september    image via video screen capture
