by now  we ve all seen the tweet where trump said that he won the popular vote in a landslide if  millions of illegal votes  are taken out of the count  we also all know that trump wouldn t be saying a damn thing if he were confident that possible recounts didn t have a hope in hell of overturning the election results  regardless  where in the name of all that s profane is he getting this idea that millions of illegal votes were cast trump is a conspiracy theorist  he believes people like alex jones  and alex jones is probably the most prominent person to  report  on these supposedly illegal votes right now  according to politifact  about six days after the election  infowars published a story with a headline that reading   report   million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens  that s a rather serious claim to make  this is alex jones  though  so wondering if he has legitimate supporting evidence for that claim is pointless  he actually got his number from a pair of tweets from gregg phillips  the founder of votestand  votestand is a voter fraud detection app  and he says he s gone through  million voter registrations and found  million  non citizens  on the rolls completed analysis of database of  million voter registrations number of non citizen votes exceeds  million consulting legal team   gregg phillips   jumpvote  november    have verified more than three million votes cast by non citizens we are joining   truethevote to initiate legal action   unrigged  gregg phillips   jumpvote  november    throughout phillips  twitter feed are more tweets claiming he s got the evidence  but he won t release it to politifact or anybody else  yet  just the existence of tweets from an app founder who s paranoid as all fuck about voter fraud is enough for jones  which is enough for trump  so trump will loudly proclaim he won the popular vote  because obviously and there you have it  we have a president who s likely to turn the next four years into a giant infowars episode  it s enough to make us want to put our fists through a window featured image via drew angerer getty images
