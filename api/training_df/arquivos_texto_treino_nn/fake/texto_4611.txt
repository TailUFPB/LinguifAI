republican presidential nominee donald trump refused to admit that his belief and promotion of the racist and inaccurate birther conspiracy theory was wrong  the candidate doubled down on the false idea that has been promoted by conservatives for almost a decade now in an interview with the washington post in the interview  conducted late wednesday aboard his private plane as it idled on the tarmac here  trump suggested he is not eager to change his pitch or his positions even as he works to reach out to minority voters  many of whom are deeply offended by his long refuted suggestion that obama is not a u s  citizen  trump refused to say whether he believes obama was born in hawaii  i ll answer that question at the right time  i just don t want to answer it yet   trump said when asked about claims in the media from campaign manager kellyanne conway that he is no longer a birther  trump told the paper   it s okay  she s allowed to speak what she thinks  i want to focus on jobs  i want to focus on other things  he added   i don t talk about it anymore  trump has been promoting the birther conspiracy since   and has never renounced it in the ensuing  years  he is on the verge of   straight days of supporting the conspiracy president barack obama was born in honolulu  hawaii  on august     his birth there has been certified at the federal level when he was first elected to the u s  senate in  and when he was elected president of the united states in november  despite this  as the first black president in u s  history  conservatives have consistently pushed the idea that obama is not a natural born citizen and instead was born in kenya  where his father is from  the story is completely false  but has been a running theme in conservative politics trump was the most prominent and well known person pushing the conspiracy theory  and even since running for president  has never renounced nor condemned it featured image via flickr
