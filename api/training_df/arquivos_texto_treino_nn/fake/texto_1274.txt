the way donald trump responded on twitter to saturday s terrorist attack in central london that left seven dead and injured at least  others has ruffled more than a few feathers  especially those of the british  including london mayor sadiq khan and harry potter author j k  rowling  who had this epic response to trump it s called  leadership   donald  the terrorists were dead  minutes after police got the call  if we need an alarmist blowhard  we ll call  https   t co   j k  rowling   jkrowling  june    on sunday afternoon  an msnbc anchor raised an interesting question  is it possible that trump might be a little jealous that nobody is trying to attack the usa at the moment  because  despite how horrible yet another atrocity like that on us soil would be  it would also most definitely be of a tremendous benefit to the trump and his questionable agenda if somebody were trump had tweeted after the attack that the time for political correctness was over and msnbc anchor thomas roberts used the same approach while interviewing democratic atlanta mayor kasim reed  let s not be pc about this   roberts prefixed his question the first time round   is the president trying to provoke a domestic terrorist attack with this twitter rant because   only to prove himself right  reed didn t directly acknowledge the question  but rather responded   not being politically correct doesn t mean being misinformed or leaking intelligence that harms one of our most important allies   going on to add   the way to handle a matter of this kind is not through the form of tweet  it s form of leader to leader direct conversations often handled in a confidential manner  fortunately for roberts  reed wasn t his only guest that day so he figured he might be able to get a more direct response out of his second visitor  former vermont governor and democratic national committee chairman howard dean  but again  roberts  efforts were in vain  i asked this of mayor reed  but it seems like the president is trying to provoke something that he can politicize more for his own gain in america  do you feel that way   roberts asked dean also avoided the question but didn t hold back on giving his candid opinion of the american president or his ability to do his job  well  i think he s totally incompetent   said dean  soon changing the topic to trump pulling out of the paris accord  i m tired of this crap  let him do what he wants  he s not the president of what the american dream stands for  he s not the president of the greatest nation on the face of the earth   later adding   he can be his own president and get whatever he wants out of that  we ll speak for america  he can speak for whoever he wants  thomas roberts has come up with an interesting question  one which makes sense and worth considering  but definitely a dangerous one for a democrat to give a direct and honest response to featured image via  alex wong getty images
