donald trump s executive order to ban travelers from muslim majority countries has been met with an onslaught of criticism one of the people continuing to speak out against trump is former secretary of state madeleine albright  who slammed trump in an interview with chris cuomo earlier today  criticizing trump s ban and the team that helped move it forward  albright made a suggestion that could save america from this doomed  terrifying presidency  it would be helpful if the people at the top of our government actually read the constitution  because clearly  trump knows nothing about it  albright smacked down trump s  unprepared plan   stating that what he was doing was actually putting america in danger instead of making  america safe again   she said  it has actually created more danger  because there are countries that are now  in fact  not able to cooperate with us in terms of intelligence sharing or generally mistrust  and there s going to be tit for tat  where we have troops in iraq and we have to worry how they are going to be treated  albright also stated that trump created chaos and turmoil not only within the u s   but on an international level as well  i think it s one of the worst decisions  and then blaming a whole religion for this is truly outrageous and un american  i think the question is  there s danger in the world  no question about it  but all the facts that you have been presenting in terms of who are the ones that commit terrorist attacks  it s not people that come from those seven countries  albright posed the critical question  why weren t the countries that are actually a danger on the banned list  she stated that trump s ban was  not based on facts    because no refugee has actually attacked the u s  in over  years  trump didn t even put the countries that the   hijackers came from on the list  albright said  there are lots of questions that have not been answered  part of what really bothers me is that this country is based on diversity and respecting diverse opinions  what is happening is that this administration is making decisions based on the decisions of people that are uninformed about what is going on in the world  albright herself was a refugee  having escaped then czechoslovakia shortly after nazi occupation started  her parents were jewish and she lost many family members due to the holocaust  albright condemned trump for leaving jews out of his holocaust remembrance day proclamation  she said  i think that it was really unbelievable  in terms of what day it was issued  on holocaust memorial day  and not to understand the suffering  by the way  that one of the things people remember about the united states is that during the  a ship of jews was turned away from america  is that the things we want to remember is how we turn people away from this country when they need help  you can watch albright crush trump below just a few days ago  albright stood in solidarity with muslims and said she was  ready to register as muslim  we need more voices like albright s to fight the tyranny that america has just come under featured image via jessica kourkounis   getty images
