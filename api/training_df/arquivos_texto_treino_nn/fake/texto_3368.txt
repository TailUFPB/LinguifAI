three professors of psychiatry have just come forward with a letter directly addressed to president barack obama that expresses their concerns that donald trump is not mentally healthy enough to be the next president of the united states the letter was written by judith herman  m d   a professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school and two other professors of psychiatry from the university of california  san francisco  in the letter published by the huffington post  the professors stated that they had  grave concern  about trump s erratic behavior  they wrote  we are writing to express our grave concern regarding the mental stability of our president elect  professional standards do not permit us to venture a diagnosis for a public figure whom we have not evaluated personally his widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity  impulsivity  hypersensitivity to slights or criticism  and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office  we strongly recommend that  in preparation for assuming these responsibilities  he receive a full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation by an impartial team of investigators  this letter is just a drop in the bucket  as questions about trump s mental stability and personality have been raised since the beginning of his presidential campaign and are now becoming increasingly common as he continues to break down under the pressure  the mental states of trump s followers have also been questioned while the american psychiatric association has warned that its members should not try to diagnose trump with mental illnesses from afar  this letter to obama is stating a perfectly reasonable concern  trump has acted out in ways that are unprecedented to any presidential candidate or future president of the united states  there is no question that trump is unqualified to be president based on his lack of experience alone   but further evaluation might prove that it would be unhealthy for him to proceed in leading the country featured image via screenshot
