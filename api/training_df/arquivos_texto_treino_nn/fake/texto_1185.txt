rather than stick around in washington following former fbi director james comey s senate testimony  donald trump decided to go golfing again instead as his scandals grow at this point in his presidency  president obama had only played golf one time  trump  on the other hand  has played golf well over a dozen times since taking office  this is despite promising during the campaign that he would refrain from playing golf so much  and despite his repeated attacks on president obama whenever he played golf unlike obama  trump is embroiled in scandal and america faces a difficult future as trump continues distancing our country away from the international community and his policies continue hurting the homeland during his testimony this week  comey detailed how trump demanded his loyalty and fired him for refusing to drop the russia investigation  interference in a federal investigation is known as obstruction of justice  an impeachable offense  by firing comey in an effort to kill it  trump committed a very serious crime but that didn t stop trump from declaring vindication on friday and accusing comey of perjury while calling him a  leaker  trump didn t even bother staying in washington to face more questions  instead  he ran away to his golf course in bedminster  new jersey to avoid reporters  who have been busily analyzing trump s claims and accusations  cnn even caught trump lying and committing hypocrisy when he claimed that he has never asked anyone to pledge allegiance to him scandals are plaguing his administration and the world is in crisis  yet as usual  trump is abandoning any and all responsibilities of the presidency to play more golf every american should be outraged  conservatives repeatedly called president obama  lazy  and  irresponsible  for playing golf  yet trump is on pace to play even more golf in a single year than president obama played in eight  if anyone is lazy and irresponsible  it s donald trump  he should be in washington facing questions  but like a coward who has something to hide  he made outrageous accusations  declared victory  and then cut and ran as far away from the press as possible it s time for congress to act  trump and his entire administration should be impeached  america needs a full time president who actually knows what the hell he is doing and doesn t mind working hard for the american people  trump is neither of those featured image via ian macnicol getty images
