we are all getting whiplash from donald trump s constant flip flopping on his immigration policy over the last few weeks  trump had been touting one of the most racist  heartless and problematic solutions to immigration throughout his entire campaign until just a few weeks ago  when he suddenly walked it back and softened his position  that decision confused everyone   and especially angered his equally racist supporters   and trump has been stuck in a vicious back and forth pattern ever since last week  trump said all undocumented immigrants in the u s  must leave and then get in line to come back to america  this week  he made another  pivot  in his immigration policy  stating that he hasn t ruled out giving some immigrants a path to legalization  when spokesperson katrina pierson went on cnn to try to clear things up  it became apparent that everyone in the trump campaign is confused now in trying to defend her boss  a struggling pierson said that it would be impossible for trump to deport all the undocumented immigrants in america because there could be   times more immigrants than what the estimates say  using the usual imaginary statistics that the trump campaign has become infamous for  she said  we are continuously hearing that there s not  million   there could be  million  there could be  million  this is important because mr  trump can t promise to deport every single illegal alien in the country if there s  million  while she was speaking  the host noticed that pierson was absolutely lost and said   we understand that it s complicated    which only infuriated pierson and made her raise her voice  but as hard as she tried  pierson couldn t give any solid reasoning for why trump s ever changing policy could work  because the truth is that it won t  the only thing that was cleared up in this interview was the fact that not even trump s own campaign can keep up with his policy changes watch pierson stumble through this interview below   katrinapierson on trump s changing immigration stance  he said from beginning he d be  a negotiator in congress  https   t co   new day   newday  september    image is a screenshot
