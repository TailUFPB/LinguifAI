over the last few days  president trump has made it no secret that he is tired of having jeff sessions on board as attorney general  as usual  the situation was confirmed by an early morning tweet from the president himself  this time coming on tuesday attorney general jeff sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes  where are e mails   dnc server    intel leakers   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    the new white house communications director  anthony scaramucci  has stepped up to replace former press secretary and acting white house communications director sean spicer and right into this mess  spicer announced his intention to resign last week and will formally step down from the role in august  so now it s scaramucci s duty to try and justify whatever move president trump makes next and he is more than aware that it will most likely be the firing of sessions in fact  scaramucci has already come straight out and said that trump  probably  wants sessions gone  the comment came during an interview with conservative msnbc host hugh hewitt  who made the statement  it s clear the president wants him gone   in reference to sessions  i have an enormous amount of respect for the attorney general   was scaramucci s reply   but i do know the president pretty well  and if there s this level of tension in the relationship that s public  you re probably right  but i don t want to speak for the president on that because he s a cabinet official  and i sort of think that has to be between the president of the united states and a cabinet official  but scaramucci didn t stop there  far from it  rather  he continued by going into detail of how a person like barack obama s attorney general  eric holder  would be the perfect fit for trump in order to build a great cabinet relationship  you and i might be at odds with eric holder politically   scaramucci told hewitt   but one of the things i would give him a lot of credit for is that he was a pretty good hockey goalie for the president  he was also willing to help the president inside the bounds of the law  i m not saying these guys did anything illegal  but when you think about the relationship john kennedy had with his brother as attorney general  or you think about the relationship the president had with eric holder   president obama   probably don t have that sort of relationship  and i think the president  when he thinks about the architecture of his cabinet  i think he needs that sort of a relationship there  so barack obama might be the only person trump dislikes almost as much as hillary clinton  but the president really needs someone like obama s attorney general right now in order to build some solidarity according to the white house communications director  interesting featured image via alex wong getty images
