on new jersey    chris christie made the argument for raising wages for judges and government employees  but he still presumably thinks minimum wage workers and teachers are the exceptions christie lost a bid to get a raise for judges  who currently make    a year in new jersey  according to christie    makes for  stupid judges  the idea somehow that judges are overpaid is ridiculous   christie said christie said starting salaries for lawyers in the new jersey area is    for a first year associate  you don t want judges out there  lawyers becomes judges who think that getting    a year is a raise   christie said   if you can t make    as a lawyer with the experience to actually be on the bench  you re not that good a lawyer  you want to appear before stupid judges  then don t raise their pay anymore  because the people you will get in the main applying for these jobs will be people who see it as a step up in pay for them   said christie here s the video christie was referring to a defeated bill that would have allowed him and other government officials  including judges  to make money off of book deals  the bill would have also given a big raise to christie s cabinet members  state and local judges and legislative aides the bill would also have done some real damage to newspapers in new jersey  which is currently the only place to find official legal notices  christie s bill would have made the notices available online  and in a time when journalism is under assault  newspapers can t afford the hit that would cause in readership but  let s just for a moment assume that christie is right  and that it takes money to attract the best and the brightest  well  he certainly doesn t seem to have that attitude when it comes to teachers or to the people who serve his copious amounts of food christie has long been engaged in a war against teachers  he even once threatened to  punch  teachers  in the face   in new jersey  teachers average less than half what christie s judges make  and christie fights tooth and nail to keep their pay low  shouldn t we aim for smart teachers  as well christie has long been against raising the minimum wage in new jersey  which has the fourth most expensive cost of living in the nation  it s even ahead of california  still  the minimum wage for new jersey is just     christie vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage featured image via jeff zelevansky getty images
