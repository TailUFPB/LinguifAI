a new report from the new york times reveals that trump renewed trademarks in russia  which contradicts this claim that he does not have any investments in russia  apparently  trump owns a number of unused registered trademarks in russia that are left over from a failed attempt to expand his hotel empire into the russian federation in  and   trump has repeatedly sworn that he does not have any investments in russia  on twitter  he wrote back in january   russia has never tried to use leverage over me  i have nothing to do with russia   no deals  no loans  no nothing  russia has never tried to use leverage over me  i have nothing to do with russia   no deals  no loans  no nothing   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     these trademarks are intellectual property owned by the trump organization  which means that trump can lie as much as he wants  the fact remains that he does have investments in russia  the trademarks were renewed   get this   on november     election day  the day which i assume future generations may come to know as the official expiration date for our democracy  there are six trademarks that were renewed in total  the new york times reports that  despite their inactivity  the trump organization sought extensions for the trademarks from rospatent  the russian government agency in charge of intellectual property  in a series of approvals starting in april  and ending in december  rospatent granted new  year terms for the trademarks  the agency s records show  under normal circumstances  renewing trademarks in russia is generally a routine matter  and there is nothing to suggest from the few public records available that mr  trump was shown favoritism  still  extensions are not guaranteed and can be subject to challenge   particularly if  as in this case  the trademarks went unused for years  according to interviews with a half dozen lawyers specializing in intellectual property law  it seems hard to believe that the trump organization would bother going through with re registering the trademarks if trump or his spawn do not plan on conducting  more  business in russia in the future  the intercept has been running an effort to document every possible connection between trump s more minor henchmen and russia  so far  the results are staggering  it appears that there are major conflicts of interest with russia at every level of the trump administration  this just adds more fuel to an inferno that might end up burning the trump administration down  as the investigation into trump s connections with russia continues  it becomes more evident every day that trump and his cronies have a lot of reasons to keep vladimir putin happy  even if that means the man who campaigned vehemently on supporting  america first  policies  is putting himself and his company s profits  ahead of the nation he is supposed to be leading featured image via wikimedia commons
