today s a somber day of remembrance for the lives lost  years ago in the world trade center  the pentagon  united flight   and all the sacrifices made since then  social media has been tracking   topics for the last several days  as they should  but two days ago  facebook also decided to feature a story that s nothing but a truther conspiracy in its  trending topics  sidebar   truthers are conspiracy theorists loudly proclaiming that the attacks were an inside job  this particular story was from a u k  tabloid site called the daily star  and it says  because of course it does   engineers steven jones  robert korol  anthony szamboti and ted walter are part of the growing community of experts who say evidence indicates the towers were brought down in a controlled demolition they wrote a paper for europhysics news highlighting four important pieces of evidence pointing to this conclusion these were  fires are not normally hot enough to heat a massive steel structure enough for it to collapse  the majority of high rise buildings have sprinkler systems that prevent a fire from getting hot enough to heat steel to a critical level  skyskrapers  sic  are protected using flame proof materials and they are also designed so that if compromised  they do not collapse  spelling errors aside  there is actually a wealth of evidence showing that the twin towers did not have adequate fireproofing on their superstructures  not to mention that these four engineers are well known truthers immune to actual science and fact  they re  experts   though  and must be taken seriously  not but that s beside the point facebook recently got rid of all its trained journalists for its  trending  section  zuckerberg said that the change was because they re a platform  not a content creator  the truth probably has more to do with money than that  but facebook won t admit it   yet  the result has been awful  a false story about megyn kelly  a man using a mcchicken sandwich for sexual pleasure  a satire piece about siri coming out of the iphone  and cooking  breitand now  an impossibly disrespectful story about the alleged truth of the   attacks  that trivializes everyone who died  everyone who worked rescue  everyone who s sick from working rescue  everyone who lost family members  our military men and women who died in afghanistan trying to find osama bin laden and take down the taliban  and the experiences of the entire country during and following that tragic day while it s true that trending topics will include topics and stories we disagree with  for this to be one of the top trending stories just prior to the  anniversary of those attacks shows just how clueless  cold and insensitive facebook has become without its real  bona fide journalists to determine trending topics it seems that facebook s decision to automate  automate  automate was one of the worst ideas in the long  sad history of bad ideas  fortunately  this story was removed from their trending topics list  but the internet never forgets featured image by otto greule jr getty images
