in a sorry attempt to smear the protester who allegedly threatened trump with a sign in reno  people are already working on creating fake connections for austyn crites  who didn t even have the gun the trumpkins at the reno rally claimed  since the original story disintegrated before their eyes  they re now turning to other  ahem  methods to show that hillary was really behind crites  non assassination attempt crites is a  nevertrumper  but is still a republican and has no ties to hillary that anyone s aware of  nevertheless  trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much hillary had paid him to protest at his rally  that was just before he told his people to get crites out of there there are stories floating around claiming that  because crites  name has been mentioned on wikileaks  he must be a paid hillary shill  nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is wikileaks if they re not connected to hillary in some way  right  right  ha     crites  name apparently does show up on wikileaks  but even this right wing site says they re not in connection with any of podesta s emails  rather  he shows up in connection with a company called stratfor  which is a global intelligence agency the atlantic characterizes as  just the economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive  yet wikileaks claims that stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies  and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people  the truth is that stratfor is  more or less  a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world  and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods in other words  in reporting this  wikileaks appears desperate to the atlantic  and the people screaming  smoking hillary gun    because crites  name appears in a few wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate they don t care  though  they re going about their task of  exposing  the connection between trump s  assassin  and hillary with all the gleeful abandon there is in the badly misinformed  paranoid extremist mediaite also found evidence that these poor  desperate souls are creating fake profiles for austyn crites trying to link him to hillary  the one that they screencapped is a little too obvious to be serious because it lists him as a money launderer for the clinton foundation and a paid protester for the dnc  it also claims he studied civil disobedience at the university of chicago s booth school of business they re getting just flat out ridiculous now  especially given that james comey just crushed their hopes of any indictment against hillary over new emails  and the secret service destroyed their dreams of proving that hillary s hiring people to murder donald trump featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
