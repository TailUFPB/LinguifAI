as the first african american president  obama knows that white america wouldn t have tolerated him as an angry black man  which is much of the reason he seems to never go far enough for progressives  especially some african american progressives like cornel west  the presidency is far from obama s final act  though  once he s out of office  he said in an interview with vanity fair  he ll be speaking out a lot more and likely doing things that he can t do while in office obama sat down with presidential historian doris kearns goodwin for the interview  which was published on friday the walls of the private dining room where the interview was conducted didn t have past presidents  instead  there were pictures of black civil rights leaders like nelson mandela  martin luther king  jr  and of john lewis during the  march on selma  still  though  obama s role model is abraham lincoln  my particular passion for lincoln  though  dates back from my earliest memories of politics  and we ve talked about this before that there s no one who i believe has ever captured the soul of america more profoundly than abraham lincoln has not just his biography  of somebody who genuinely rose from nothing  self taught  striking out along the borders of our great frontier  somebody who worked with his hands and then worked with his mind  and somehow became one of the greatest writers in the english language  and i think  most importantly  somebody who was able to see humanity clearly  see the fundamental contradictions of the american experiment clearly  and yet still remain hopeful and still remain full of humor  and still have a basic sympathy for the human condition  even in the midst of a terrible war and having to make terrible decisions  and having a forgiving spirit  while obama seems to have loved his time in office  he does regret some of the  institutional constraints  that might limit him from being who he wants to be  on the other hand  there are things he feels he can only accomplish once outside of office  having had this office has given me this incredible perch from which to see how the world works  the power of the office is unique and it is a humbling privilege  with that power  however  also comes a whole host of institutional constraints  there are things i cannot say  there are things   that i cannot say  not out of any political concerns  but out of prudential concerns of the office  there are institutional obligations i have to carry out that are important for a president of the united states to carry out  but may not always align with what i think would move the ball down the field on the issues that i care most deeply about  ex president role models couldn t be any different  perhaps the most respected post presidency  at least in modern times  would have to be jimmy carter s  he s dedicated his life to building homes for those who most need them and to social justice around the world  bill clinton has the clinton foundation  and the bushes and reagan  well  they retired into near obscurity obama is still young  though  at just   he will potentially have decades to finish his community organizing  only on a grander scale  or really  whatever he wants to do  you can be sure that no matter what he does  he will be working to try to make lives better for his fellow african americans  an in turn  his fellow americans featured image via win mcnamee getty images
