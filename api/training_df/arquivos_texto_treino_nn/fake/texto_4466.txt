allow me to begin by saying former dnc chair howard dean is the f cking man  after tweeting that donald trump might be on cocaine   a reasonable observation based on the gop s actions during the first presidential debate   he could have backed down under scrutiny  he could have caved and apologized  instead  he made his case dean  a physician who is qualified to speculate   though in his own words not diagnose without examining trump in person   responded to criticism of his remarks on msnbc  i don t make diagnosis on the television  it s medically improper   he told kate snow tuesday  a subtle jab at trump and his legion of fox news  doctors  feverishly trying to diagnose clinton with every neurological disorder under the sun because she coughed that one time and contracted pneumonia the other   but i don t think this was a ridiculous idea  something funny was going on with trump last night  something  ridiculous  was indeed going on  trump spent his evening screaming about ridiculous conspiracy theories  attacking his opponent s  stamina  based on a minor illness  interrupting clinton constantly  guzzling water  sweating profusely  and other things that would be expected from his meth addled twitter followers rather than a serious presidential candidate  here s the interesting constellation  he sniffs during the presentation  which is something that users do  he also has grandiosity  which is something that accompanies that problem  he has delusions  i m not talking about being crazy  but for example when he told everybody he was very smart not to pay taxes and then denied that he said after he said it it in front of  million people   dean said   he thinks somehow he s not going to get caught  that is delusional  he has trouble with pressured speech   the former vermont governor added   he interrupted  as you pointed out  hillary clinton twenty nine times  he couldn t keep himself together  do i think at  years old he has a cocaine habit  probably not   dean concludes  but it s something that i think would be interesting to ask him  to see if he ever had a problem with that  asked for clarification if he thinks trump has a  cocaine habit   dean replied  i don t think he has a cocaine habit   placing special emphasis on the word  habit   in other words  it might be a stretch to say trump is addicted to cocaine  but it is possible that he used it to pep himself up before the debate in an effort to deflect from the allegation  trump assured the public that he just had a cold  but stephen colbert put it best when he said the donald  sounded like he was trying to get over a cold using cocaine  we can t know for sure if trump has ever been treated for addiction  as he refuses to release his records   and since trump should be held to the same standards to which he holds hillary clinton  it s not unreasonable to question if he has been using cocaine  especially given the crazy  whacked out bonkers stuff he says in public  watch dean slay this interview below featured image via screengrab  getty images  joe raedle
