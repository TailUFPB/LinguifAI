donald trump is employing extra scrutiny to anyone his cabinet hires to guarantee that they are loyal only to him as he continues to whine about democrats holding up the confirmation process for his nominees  trump is frustrating his cabinet members by forcing them to clear all new hires with former campaign staffers because he is paranoid that they may not be loyal to him  new hires are apparently being subjected to rigorous vetting  and if it is found that they ever criticized trump in any way  they are dismissed according to politico when an informal adviser to education secretary betsy devos recently recommended a candidate for a high level senate confirmed position at the agency  the adviser was told that the candidate had little chance of getting the job because the person had previously worked for an organization that was seen as being at odds with trump s policy positions  one person familiar with the issue said the same goes for the treasury department treasury secretary steven mnuchin has clashed with white house officials over top officials in his department  sources say  the white house saw some of mnuchin s picks as too liberal or not supportive enough of trump  sources say even secretary of state rex tillerson has had to deal with trump s paranoia several high level people were delayed or scuttled because they didn t agree with trump during the campaign or because the white house preferred someone else housing and urban development secretary ben carson has also felt trump s wrath at housing and urban development  shermichael singleton  a top official  joined the department before being terminated when criticism of trump surfaced in a final white house review so trump is literally firing anyone who criticizes him or has criticized him in the past  which means he isn t interested in diverse opinions or experience  he just wants a bunch of yes men who agree with him no matter what  even if he is wrong that s incredibly dangerous because trump is in a job where dissenting opinions can be the difference between life and death  or war and peace  even president obama nominated republicans to high level positions and valued their input  the greatest presidents in history put together administrations that included some of their sharpest critics because they wanted differing opinions and perspectives that would help them make the best decisions  all trump is doing is creating his own echo chamber and because of trump s obsession with total control and absolute loyalty  the various executive departments are very understaffed  furthermore  trump s insistence on scrutinizing every employee hired has apparently slowed down his own job to nominate people to positions as well  so far  he has only managed to pick less than  nominees to fill senate confirmed positions  there are over  such positions that need to be filled adding to trump s problems is the fact that many potential hires are backing out of taking positions because they know associating themselves with trump could ruin their reputations and careers  which is another reason why trump is only seeking friends for positions  but matt sclapp  who worked for george w  bush as his political director  correctly warned that only installing friends into government positions can seriously backfire  it often breaks down into trying to appoint your allies into jobs and that can lead to a lot of bad policy formulations   he said indeed  while nominating some qualified friends is not a big deal  trump is more interested in blind loyalty than he is in qualifications  nominating only friends to important positions can lead to scandal  especially if those friends start using their positions to enrich themselves or give themselves government favors donald trump s administration is a train wreck  and chaos and infighting reigns inside the white house as he continues to embarrass himself and the nation  now  even his own cabinet members are beginning to get frustrated with him  and one wonders who will be the first to resign because they have an incompetent paranoid asshole for a boss featured image by mario tama via getty images
