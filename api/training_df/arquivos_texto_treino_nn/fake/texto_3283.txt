donald trump s ties to vladimir putin have been questioned again and again  and for good reason  trump has previously said good things about putin and has done so once again  but not before he released the  holiday letter  he received from the vladimir putin wrote the letter to donald just over a week ago  on december   saying  i hope that after you assume the position of the president of the united states of america  we will be able   by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner   to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level  in the letter he also wished the trump family happiness and success during his annual news conference putin suggested that america and russia should  discuss ways to normalize our relations  during his election campaign  trump said it would be proper to normalize and it can t be worse  and i agree with him  putin has also tweeted about his hopes to ally with the us on the first meeting with trump  we will discuss how to put russia us relations back on track  president of russia   kremlinrussiae  december    responded in a short statement  a very nice letter from vladimir putin  his thoughts are so correct  i hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts  and we do not have to travel an alternate path  however  trump s tweets say he s definitely willing to travel down  an alternate path   yesterday  on the   donald trump tweeted  the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    also made a statement to  morning joe  host mika brzezinski of msnbc  let it be an arms race  we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all   so it s certain that trump is perfectly fine with starting an arms race  even though that generally leads to war  trump probably doesn t have enough knowledge of history to know that though what will happen between these superpowers remains unclear  but hopefully it doesn t involve nuclear war  and with it the destruction of the world as we know it featured image via mark wilson getty images
