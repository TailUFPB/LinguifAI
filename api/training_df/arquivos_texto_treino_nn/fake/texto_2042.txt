democrats are about to welcome another voice into their big tent after republicans in hawaii decided their tent wasn t small enough in january  hawaii state rep  beth fukumoto attended the women s march in protest of donald trump  as an american  fukumoto has every right to exercise her freedom of speech and right to protest but republicans in the state decided that a woman s place is not in the republican party if she won t submit to trump so they stripped fukumoto of her leadership position in the statehouse and tried to force her to resign simply because she criticized trump republicans also condemned fukumoto because she dared to work with democrats on legislation to benefit the people of hawaii fukumoto refused to be bullied by her sexist and racist colleagues and continued to represent her constituents  and now  after a couple months of thought  fukumoto has decided to ditch the gop to become a democrat  when i joined the republican party eight years ago  i did so with a group of people my age who were full of hope  ideas and energy   fukumoto said   i discovered that it wasn t just me and my republican friends trying to change the status quo  there were good democrats trying to change things too  so we started working together  but  in doing so  i ran into republican partisanship that insisted i stop working with democrats even when it clearly benefited our community  in a video explaining her decision  fukumoto said that some constituents think she should stick it out in the gop and be a voice of opposition from within  however  she would rather join the democrats and actually get things done  i want to be productive   she said   i could stay  i could continue to criticize  i could be that voice of opposition  but what good does that do for the people of hawaii  and what good does that do for my district  i think there s a much better opportunity that if i disagree with what the republican party is doing  to be able to work productively as a democrat to offer a different solution  so that s what i m announcing today  here s the video via  indeed  what s the point of staying in a party that hates you  ultimately  fukumoto made the best decision by joining a party that actually appreciates her voice and ideas  meanwhile  republicans only have themselves to blame because they are so blinded by their loyalty to trump that they literally let a woman who wanted to be part of the party s future become part of the democratic party instead once again  republicans clearly demonstrated that women  especially women who criticize trump  are not welcome in their party featured image  screenshot
