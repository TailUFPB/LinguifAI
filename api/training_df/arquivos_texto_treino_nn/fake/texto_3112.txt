cnn host jake tapper went nuclear on kellyanne conway this sunday the intelligence community has confirmed that vladimir putin ordered russian hackers to interfere with our election to help donald trump win  through propaganda and documents stolen from the dnc  russia gave trump information that he encouraged them to search for all while withholding information hacked from the rnc the information went to wikileaks  which published it  and trump repeatedly cited wikileaks on the campaign trail during an interview on cnn  tapper confronted trump mouthpiece kellyanne conway with video of trump using what wikileaks provided to attack hillary clinton  clearly demonstrating that trump benefited from russian espionage  if you listen to what mr  trump had to say on the stump all the time  he invoked wikileaks dozens and dozens of times to try to suggest that the wikileaks said that there were things that hillary clinton was doing or had done that were untoward   tapper began  so i guess what i m confused about is how can you say that the hacking had no impact on the election when mr  trump kept invoking wikileaks  which was printing  publishing things that the russians had hacked   he continued   obviously he thought it was going to have an effect on the election  faced with the reality that trump opened his mouth a lot on camera  conway tried to downplay the seriousness of the breach  well  it had an effect on his debate answer and it had an effect on the clinton campaign because it was quite embarrassing to watch her closest advisers question her judgment and question whether she would ever find her voice and wondering allowed why she was testing  slogans to find out who she was and what she had won on  this guy had  make america great again  and never change  that s very embarrassing  them calling chelsea clinton  a spoiled brat  that s very uncomfortable but that s what was hacked  but why invoke all those wikileaks that were the work of russian intelligence   tapper asked again  refusing to let conway bullshit her way out of answering the question conway then claimed that trump didn t know who the source of the hacks was at the time  which is a lie because trump was asked to address the hacking in july and he asks the russian to keep doing it once again  tapper nailed conway to the wall with the facts  but you are trying to change public impressions of hillary clinton  right   tapper asked   mr  trump and you and others were trying to make an argument against hillary clinton using the work of wikileaks  and conway responded by claiming that trump was going to win whether russia and wikileaks helped him or not  and we all know that is complete bullshit here s the video via vidme the fact is that russia helped donald trump smear hillary clinton with lies and he is an illegitimate president elect because of it  this country should not be holding an inauguration on january   we should be holding a new election featured image via screenshot
