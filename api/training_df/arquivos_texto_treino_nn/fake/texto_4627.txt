donald trump visited flint  michigan on wednesday  of course  that city is the place where is a crisis regarding having unusable water due to dangerously high lead levels and pipes that need to be replaced  while there  trump toured a water plant and visited a black church  where he pretended to care about the community  which is mostly poor and black  and suffering badly due to the water crisis this was a bad idea in the first place  as the mayor of flint  michigan  democrat karen weaver  had already told trump and his campaign that her city s very real issues were not to be used as some kind showboating photo op  however  as per usual  trump did what he wanted anyway  and when it didn t go well  he did what he usually does in such instances  lied thursday morning  trump went on fox and friends and criticized the pastor of bethel united methodist church  faith green timmons  we ve all seen the viral video in which pastor green timmons shut trump down when he attempted to use her church as a platform to attack democratic rival hillary clinton  and in response  trump lashed out at her on fox news  calling her  quote  a  nervous mess   trump them went on say that the audience wanted him to keep speaking  but luckily there was an npr reporter in the audience at the time  so those of us who weren t there can get the real story about what went down  from npr  the audience was saying let him speak  let him speak   trump told fox and friends that isn t true  in fact  several audience members began to heckle trump  asking pointed questions about whether he racially discriminated against black tenants as a landlord and that s when green timmons   who trump said thursday had planned to ambush him   stepped in to defend trump  saying the republican nominee was  a guest of my church  and you will respect him  thank you  thank you  pastor   trump responded the pointed questions for trump continued as trump wrapped up his remarks  though   and that s the moment when the press traveling with trump was hastily escorted out of the room well  there you have it  folks  the people in the traditionally black church saw right through trump s attempt to pander and pretend that he actually cares about their well being  when  in fact we all have witnessed trump s racism on full display throughout this travesty of a campaign  these people weren t having it  though  and they let trump know exactly what they think of him if it weren t for this reporting  we d have a very different account of what went down in that church on wednesday  which is just one more reason not to trust a word that comes out of donald trump s mouth featured image via video screen capture from twitter
