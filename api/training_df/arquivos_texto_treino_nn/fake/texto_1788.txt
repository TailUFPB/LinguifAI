on thursday  donald trump tweeted that if china  north korea s sole major ally  doesn t deal with north korea  properly   the united states and  its allies  will  now china is neither an ally or enemy of the united states   but they are a major power with around  nuclear warheads and the largest army in the world  a fact many of our allies would consider before backing us in any war that might involve them  trump would  as well  if he had any interest in averting world war iii  but  as trump says   i love war  we call on all parties to refrain from provoking and threatening each other  whether in words or actions  and not let the situation get to an irreversible and unmanageable stage   chinese foreign minister wang yi told reporters in beijing  hoping to appeal to trump s better nature and forgetting that he doesn t have one  if a war occurs  the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner   yi added on friday during a joint press conference with his french counterpart  lately  tensions have risen with the us and  on one side  and  on the other  and one has the feeling that a conflict could break out at any moment   yi said  adding that the side provoking the conflict  trump in this case or  more correctly  the taxpayers he represents  must assume the historic responsibility and pay the corresponding price  as the world worries about what trump will do to satisfy his massive ego   especially after dropping the  mother of all bombs  recently   he seems nonplussed  spending his weekend golfing instead of worrying about the crisis he has helped exacerbate will trump risk a world war and a gigantic hit to the united states  treasury  i think we all know the answer to that   as soon as he is done golfing  featured image via getty images  pool
