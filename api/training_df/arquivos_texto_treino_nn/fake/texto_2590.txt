in a desperate attempt to make steve bannon seem less like a crazed  apocalypse obsessed maniac  fox news played a little game with usa today s deputy editorial opinion editor  david mastio  who suggested in a recent piece that steve bannon and isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi shared  similar world views   including  apocalyptic visions of a clash  between muslims and the united states it is true that both men share these viewpoints  but fox took things to ridiculous levels in an effort to appear to disprove this theory  apparently  because bannon  unlike he and trump s friend putin  has not slaughtered journalists or used chemical weapons  he s a swell dude tucker carlson quickly went through the chart  ticking off many of baghdadi s more horrible actions see  there you have it   bannon  who until recently ran a website aimed at a white supremacist audience and who describes himself as a  leninist  who wants to  destroy the state  is just a ok this cringeworthy attempt to make bannon seem appealing by comparing him to one of the few people in the world who is worse than he is wasn t lost on the internet  twitter users flocked to mock the right wing  news  organization for this whatever this was here s another graphic you can use  foxnews  tuckercarlson pic twitter com   not my president   missmayn  february     steve bannon a pretty good guy when compared to aids  foxnews  tuckercarlson pic twitter com   not my president   missmayn  february    missmayn pic twitter com gorzckbjnh  chris rywalt     chrisrywalt  february    missmayn i think i fixed it pic twitter com   wilhelm davis   wilhelmdavis  february    missmayn did you see they ran this later though  pic twitter com   lou diamond chillups   conorgentes  february     missmayn baghdadi seems to be on a roll  pic twitter com   ins niasemcarv o   insoniascarvao  february     missmayn  fixedit pic twitter com ntaekicyhj  matt kawczynski   mattkawczynski  february    missmayn pic twitter com   brian mazmanian   btothemaz  february     missmayn pic twitter com xybcrjpanv  dr  m to the j  ph d     february    missmayn pic twitter com   simon s   gamesnclass  february    missmayn  themrmagic also  this   though i would differ on  religious extremist  for bannon  pic twitter com   jm   undersilverlake  february    missmayn you can thank  andybeckerman for this pic twitter com   nightscientist   nightscientist  february    missmayn this is like putting  if nothing else i am not  currently  a serial killer  on your online dating profile      dan north      drnorth  february    missmayn that fox news felt the need to make this hilarious graphic at all says a lot about the undercurrent of public sentiment   nick stewart   nickstewarting  february    missmayn  melissajpeltier so now not beheadings people and using child soldiers is the bar for a  good person     foxnews you are pathetic  fadi antoun   fadiantounn  february    missmayn  cafedotcom wow  when you put it that way  i m glad he s our potus   peter drake   peterjdrake  february    missmayn those are all super specificlike  maybe he hasn t beheaded any journalists  but maybe there are a few less fast food employees  thompson kaa     thompsonkaa  february    missmayn i feel like they added the  on kurds  qualifier after realizing there s a possibility bannon has used chemical weapons before   matthew byrd     february    missmayn interesting degree of specificity here  eg   on kurds    of chrstians   sith justice warrior   sithjw  february    no point was it suggested that bannon has done any of the things baghdadi has done  the editorial speaks only of their ideological similarities  which carlson carefully avoided mentioning   but what else can expect from fox news  honesty  el oh el featured image via screengrab
