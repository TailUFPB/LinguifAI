wednesday evening  trump surrogate kellyanne conway showed up on cnn to do her favorite thing in the world  spew utter nonsense accusing cnn of peddling fake news and covering unsubstantiated claims about her lord and master and russian hooker pee  unlike buzzfeed  cnn withheld information that was not   definitively proven   conway went on the attack   but anderson cooper just wasn t going to tolerate any of her bullshit  cooper asked conway if she would be willing to state  here and now  that the trump camp s press secretary sean spicer had lied when he falsely claimed that cnn had also reported the  hooker pee  story  our press secretary sean spicer was absolutely correct and so was our president elect   conway said  trump himself had refused a question from cnn earlier in the evening  childishly calling them  fake news  you can t say you re not reporting it if it s on your website   conway screeched at cooper  who demanded to know what was inaccurate about cnn s report  conway  of course  responded by attacking president obama for allegedly failing to do enough to stop hacking  i know you like to pivot   cooper said as conway melted down  that s actually real news  that actually happened   conway sputtered  i guess what you still have not answered   cooper said  trying get a word in edgewise as trump s bleached moron continued babbling that if cnn links to the buzzfeed report   which did happen and is news  contrary to her belief   they are reporting it   as fact  something buzzfeed did not even do  as is evidenced by their multiple statements that not everything in the report cnn chose to withhold parts of is verified yet cooper asks again  what is inaccurate in our reporting  because you said  you weren t in the briefing  you don t know if what we re reporting is true or not  you weren t in the briefing and i guess you haven t heard anything about what was in the briefing from anyone who was there how can you say it s not true  conway spent the rest of the interview screaming that the media   especially cnn  is completely unfair to trump because they won t ignore everything else that is going on to do fluff pieces about what is going to be in trump s inaugural address and generally going the one thing she does best  looking like an imbecile   all the while  cooper was clearly doing his best not to inform her that she needs to check her battery levels because she appears to be malfunctioning watching cooper somehow make it through this interview without screaming a string of profanities at a person who is clearly too stupid to be around bubble wrap unsupervised   anderson cooper  you re a true hero  watch the interview below featured image via screengrab
