december  could be the day  electors step up to courageously save our nation from the insanity of donald trump on that day  which is often overlooked as a afterthought by most americans  all  electors from all  states will gather in washington d c  to cast their votes for president  usually  the electors merely certify the results that were tallied on election day but the founding fathers created the electoral college as a mechanism to prevent unqualified demagogues like trump from becoming president  in short  it s the last line of defense our country has if ignorant voters manage to elect a threat into the highest office for the first time in our history  the electors have the chance to do exactly that  and a group of celebrities  including west wing actor martin sheen  m a s h actors loretta swit and mike farrell  will   grace actress debra messing  along with many others  are uniting to encourage and support the  electors required to block trump from becoming president in a video  sheen and others explain that alexander hamilton wrote in the federalist papers that the role of the electoral college is to guarantee that the presidency is held by someone  to an eminent degree  endowed with the requisite qualifications  to be president of the united states  they then call on these  people to be heroes and do the right thing donald trump is not that someone  so it is up to the electoral college to do what it was meant to do and vote for someone else here s the video via youtube a petition has been circulating since last month asking the electors to vote their conscience rather than allowing trump to take office and destroy this country  it currently has nearly five million signatures  but unlike the petition  sheen and his fellow entertainers are not asking the electors to vote for hillary clinton  they simply want them to make sure trump can t be president  and that can happen if  electors vote for anyone but trump  they could even vote for a different republican  preferably a sane republican who won t burn our government and this country to the ground this is especially critical now that the cia and  other intelligence agencies have concluded that russia meddled with our political process to help trump win the electoral college exists as a safeguard for this reason  and it is their duty as americans to correct the mistake made on election day featured image via screenshot
