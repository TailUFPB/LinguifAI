republicans are hell bent on repealing obamacare  they don t care how many people it kills  after eight years of demanding the affordable care act be repealed and replaced  the best they could come up with when they finally won the majority  was a plan that will kick  million people off of their health insurance  the proposed bill was especially cruel to the elderly  the sick  and the disabled  thankfully  the american health care act didn t make it past thursday s house vote  but only because a significant number of republicans didn t think it was cruel enough this is ashley  and she is one of the many people the republicans are trying to put into an early grave a few years ago  when she was only  years old  ashley was diagnosed with lupus  an autoimmune disease in which the body s own immune system turns on itself and attacks various organs throughout the body  ashley s case proved to be severe  among other things  the lupus has attacked her brain  which causes seizures her entire digestive system is paralyzed  a condition called gastroparesis  she is unable to eat or take any medications by mouth because it just sits in her stomach until it is eventually vomited back up several days later  she has had multiple feeding tubes surgically implanted  which allowed liquid nutritional supplements to be delivered directly into her intestines  but in ashley  the gastroparesis has paralyzed her intestines too because of this  ashley has relied on total parenteral nutrition  tpn  for more than two years   in other words  she is fed through an iv  she has had multiple ports installed in her chest over the years  along with a countless number of picc lines  anytime you see her  she will have her trusty backpack carrying her tpn pump which feeds her through a tube in her chest from the iv bag she lugs around just to make things fun  ashley s body has decided to develop a blood clotting disorder that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose or identify  she has repeatedly had potentially fatal dvt s over the past few months  including a particularly dangerous one in her neck that developed even after she was placed on high doses of blood thinners now that you have a little background  and rest assured that this is only a small snapshot of her overall medical picture  i will get back to my point because this isn t a sob story  ashley is a fighter and the only thing she needs less than pity is the gop s  make america sick again  plan ashley is alive because west virginia chose to take part in the medicaid expansion  republicans want to gut medicaid  and west virginia s budget is already pushed to the max  if there have to be cuts  expensive patients like ashley will be the first to go and spending caps in the ahca would do just this  getting her treatments approved are already a nightmare  if the gop gets their way  this girl will die  she won t live long enough fight it or look for other options  without medicaid  ashley will die  period i would like to think that putting a face on this would compel a little compassion from the right  but republicans don t give a f ck about ashley or any of the other sick americans they are trying so hard to kill  after all  their only complaint about the gop plan is that it isn t going to kill enough people you can watch ashley talk more about her illness here  via the invisible disability project  featured image via facebook
