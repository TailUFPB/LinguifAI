donald trump just got terminated again by arnold schwarzenegger for lying about him on twitter it s no secret that the ratings for celebrity apprentice were worse than in previous years  but in those previous years  people weren t boycotting the show either millions of americans have been boycotting anything donald trump has his name on  including the reality television show  since the election in november trump refuses to separate himself from his various business interests  which are conflicts of interest as it appears he is making decisions in the white house to benefit himself personally  to that end  trump remained attached to celebrity apprentice as a producer  which instantly made the show a prime way to boycott trump in other words  trump really only has himself to blame for the show s demise earlier this week  schwarzenegger announced that he would not be returning to host the show  citing trump s unpopularity and the fact that viewers and sponsors want nothing to do with a show featuring trump s name  with trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don t want to participate as a spectator or sponsor or in any other way support the show   schwarzenegger said   it s a very divisive period right now and i think the show got caught up in all that division  so schwarzenegger left the show voluntarily  that s a fact  but donald trump has thin skin  so he attacked schwarzenegger by claiming he was fired from the show arnold schwarzenegger isn t voluntarily leaving the apprentice  he was fired by his bad  pathetic  ratings  not by me  sad end to great show  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     schwarzenegger was not fired  he departed the show on his own terms  and he quickly replied to trump s bullshit you should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker  https   t co svajupdhfa  arnold   schwarzenegger  march    fact is that trump only has himself to blame for why celebrity apprentice sank in the ratings  he constantly attacked the show on twitter and at white house events  keep in mind that trump was credited as a producer on the show  so he literally trashed his own show  trump s toxicity also contributed to its downfall as people chose to watch something else rather than help trump make money if trump s name had not been attached to the show  it probably would have done a lot better because people would have tuned in to spite trump  instead  nbc made the monumentally stupid decision to let trump remain as an executive producer rather than fire him and keep him as far away from their programming as possible featured image  aude guerrucci pool getty images
