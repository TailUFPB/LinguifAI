a gop lawmaker in oklahoma raised more than a few eyebrows when before speaking to a group of muslim high school students  he presented them with a questionnaire that represented the worst about islamophobia  he even asked them   do you beat your wife  in oklahoma  there s an annual muslim day at the capitol  which is hosted by the council on american islamic relations  students from tulsa s private school for muslims called the peace academy wanted to visit the office of rep  john bennett  but before he would meet with them  they were supposed to fill out a questionnaire from a hate group that s according to adam soltani  executive director of the council on american islamic relations of oklahoma  who posted a video to facebook shortly after the incident occurred thursday  i just have been informed by some of our community members that rep  john bennett   who in my opinion  at this point  doesn t even deserve to be called a representative   is refusing to meet with muslims unless they answer questions from an islamophobic hate group called act for america   soltani said in the video source  huffington posthere s some of the questionnaire here s the video by adam soltani bennett hasn t responded  but even beyond the fact that this is a bigoted questionnaire  this was directed at high school students while it s tempting to blame this on donald trump  the hate enabler  bennett has been on the hate train for quite a while  in   he denied that there were moderate muslims and said that  percent of islam is violent here s that video bennett  it seems  should be reminded that the vast majority of victims of terrorists are themselves muslim  in this country  muslims are far more likely to be victims of terrorism  hate crimes  than to initiate terrorism  but we ll never hear that from the occupant of the white house  instead  republicans will just spread the idea that high school students might beat their wives featured image via video screen capture
