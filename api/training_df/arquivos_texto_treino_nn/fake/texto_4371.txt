ivanka trump has been sort of the female face of her father s campaign  but despite being a woman  she really doesn t get it  that s quite evident in her new video touting her father s childcare plan  which she kicks off with following gender stereotyping words  the most important job any woman can have is being a mother  that is the height of irony  considering the fact that this video is directed towards working mothers  working mothers value their jobs and their children  and many resent being shunted into sexist gender roles like this  such a dismissive attitude toward women  both mothers and non mothers  will do nothing to warm them up to trump at all but wait  there s more  ivanka goes on to say  donald trump understands the needs of the modern workforce  har de har har  don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts  ivanka s father once said that pregnancy is an inconvenience for business  and told a woman she was disgusting for needing to pump her breasts  he s a serial cheater  a serial sexual harasser  and a serial body shamer the ap published a story earlier today that exposes trump s harassment of women on the set of  the apprentice   according to that story  he rated women contestants on the size of their breasts  and openly talked about which ones he d like to sleep with  he also wanted them to bare more cleavage and wear shorter skirts  and asked one woman to twirl for him so he could ogle her figure as a woman who  at a previous job  was repeatedly asked to twirl around so a manager could ogle my figure before he d even answer a question i had  these revelations make me positively ill trump even compared a camerawoman s looks to the beauty of ivanka on the set of  the apprentice  ivanka hasn t had a very good role model for a father  let alone for anything to do with feminism and women s rights  trump always saw his parental duties as limited to providing funds for his children  he never actually parented  and he s said both of the following to boot  i mean  i won t do anything to take care of them  i ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids  it s not like i m gonna be walking the kids down central park  marla used to say   i can t believe you re not walking tiffany down the street   you know in a carriage  right  i m gonna be walking down fifth avenue with a baby in a carriage  it just didn t work  and  there s a lot of women out there that demand that the husband act like the wife and you know there s a lot of husbands that listen to that  i m really like a great father but certain things you do and certain things you don t  it s just not for me  this is understanding the needs of working mothers  women  and the modern workforce  not hardly ivanka is in awe of her father  it seems  and carries a ton of internalized misogyny because of him and because of society  she s ill equipped to reach out to women on this level on behalf of her father  because that takes a lot more than simply being a female face watch the entire ad below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
