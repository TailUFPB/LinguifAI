ever since trump first seized on the flooding in louisiana as an opportunity to pretend he s presidential  it has been abundantly clear that he has no idea what the f ck he s doing  though gov  john bel edwards specifically asked trump to volunteer or donate rather than show up for a photo op  the donald has the biggest hands  the best brain  and the hugest ideas  so he popped by anyway to spend about a minute handing out play doh and other items to flood victims who were much in need of water  food  clothing  and other items typically needed by people who just lost everything in a natural disaster trump has spent a good deal of time whining that president obama did not immediately rush off to louisiana  but obama was simply respecting the wishes of the governor  who said he d  rather he give us another week or two  and then he can visit  president obama complied  while trump showed up anyway  after all  he was busy crafting a narrative that barack obama hates flood victims  isn t that more important trump  facing criticism for failing to donate money to help  ultimately gave   million to a church run by a hate group leader on tuesday  after respecting the governor s wishes and the needs of the people  president obama toured the flood damaged areas  to him  this wasn t a photo op  to him  this was a tragedy whose victims needed as much support as they could get  we are heartbroken by the loss of life   obama told reporters after surveying the devastation that left  dead  more than   homes damaged  and more than   residents in a position that they applied for aid through the federal emergency management agency  i think anybody who can see just the streets  much less the inside of the homes here  people s lives have been upended by this flood  white house press secretary josh earnest told cnn that   million in aid has already been approved  but president obama made it clear that the effort to fix the damage is only just beginning  sometimes once the flood waters pass  people s attention spans pass  this is not a one off  this is not a photo op issue  this is how do you make sure that a month from now  three months from now  six months from now  people still are getting the help that they need  i need all americans to stay focused on this  if you re watching this today  make sure that you find out how you can help  you can go to volunteers louisiana gov  or you can go to fema gov  or you can go to whitehouse gov  we ll tell you  we ll direct you how you can help  president obama is correct  a natural disaster  especially of this scale  is not an excuse to rush there for a photo op  it s a reason for the community and the country to come together to fix things  it s a time for the president to step up and focus on the long term response rather than looking good for the media   and it s especially not the time to pander to donald trump s wishes let s hope trump learns something about acting  presidential  from this  watch the video below  and be sure to take the president s advice about helping featured image via screengrab
