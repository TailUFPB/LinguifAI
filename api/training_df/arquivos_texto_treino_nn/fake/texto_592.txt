donald trump seems to think that he can bully congress into doing his bidding  even though they are a separate and co equal branch of government  his current target is senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  r ky   who trump is blaming for the failure of the disastrous trumpcare bill that would have taken healthcare from millions  first  trump ordered mcconnell to  get back to work  on the healthcare bill  as if mcconnell works for him  now  during a presser amid the north korea crisis  trump suggested that at some point mcconnell should step down as senate majority leader when trump was asked about his attacks on mcconnell and his feelings on whether or not the senate gop leader should continue in the post  he said  i ll tell you what  if he doesn t get repeal and replace done  and if he doesn t get taxes done  meaning cuts and reform  and if he doesn t get a very easy one to get done  infrastructure  he doesn t get them done  then you can ask me that question  trump then made it clear that he intends to continue hammering mcconnell in public  and he wants the help of the press in doing so  that means ask me that question  let s hope he gets it done  this is a very clear warning shot  and we know that trump is a bully  he is angry that he has been humiliated on his signature campaign promise  which is to repeal and replace the affordable care act on day one  it is now well past the  day mark  and the gop has proven that even with control of all three branches of the federal government they cannot achieve anything major on the legislative front  it is clear that trump is taking this personally  that he is feeling aggrieved  and that right now he blames mitch mcconnell for that failure mcconnell better use his article  powers and check the orange fool sitting at  pennsylvania avenue  he should see now that no one is safe from trump s ire if he believes they have done something disloyal  something to betray him mcconnell would be wise to push back  lest he allow trump to believe that he can be pushed out by an unruly wannabe dictator read more featured image via drew angerer getty images
