the entire republican party spent the  campaign season running on a promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act  otherwise known as obamacare  however  now that they have the house  the senate  and the white house  they re like a dog who caught a car it s been chasing for years  and they can t agree on what to do this entire week has been spent with party members bickering amongst themselves  and many members of the gop house conference in open revolt against paul ryan s repeal and replace bill  in fact  the bill was so terrible and would cost so many people their health coverage  that even donald trump wouldn t put his name on it  the white house has openly said not to dub the plan  trumpcare  well  it seems that for now  there will be no obamacare repeal  in fact  there won t even be a vote  house speaker paul ryan has pulled the bill because it seems it became clear friday afternoon that they would not have the votes to get this mess of a healthcare reform bill past the house  much less past the senate  of course  this comes just one day after trump gave house republicans an ultimatum  either hold a vote or there will be no obamacare repeal on his watch  period that really should come as no surprise  given trump s low level of patience  short attention span  and penchant for throwing tantrums  he also reportedly said to those voting  no   on the bill   i m gonna come after you   so  who really knows what will come of the relationship between the white house and congress after this  after all  it was already just a lukewarm marriage of convenience well  we ve given the gop a chance to govern  they have all three branches of the federal government  and they have instead descended into utter chaos in  days flat  have been fielding scandal after scandal  and have gotten nothing done  time to give it back to the democrats  because it s clear that the republicans can t handle it featured image via mark wilson getty images
