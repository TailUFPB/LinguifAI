going into election day  trump s campaign is worried enough about his lack of control to wrestle his twitter account away from him  lest he completely loses it there and destroys whatever chance he has left of winning  but that s not all  reports are surfacing that  in the  hour  trump s entire state of mind is deteriorating as he s increasingly faced with a humiliating loss the new york times ran a report on the failing candidate s last gasp of air  finding that trump sleeps less and less  needs aides and family to talk to him at all hours of the day and night  and requires reassurances that his campaign is still on the right track  it hasn t been on the right track since in launched  he s angry  he s short tempered  he s erratic  and while that all seems like typical trump  it s gotten worse in final run up to nov   for instance  he s been so upset about early voting numbers and polls that he flew completely off the handle at his staff over an abc news poll showing hillary leading by double digits  in doing so  he terrified them into actually discussing a confrontation with the network  accusing them of bias and intent to suppress the vote of trump fans he s always thought his rally numbers proved he was winning  but now he pushes that almost to the exclusion of all else as his real numbers fall  and his rallies are indicative of nothing  but they re all he s got left and somewhere he knows it in fact  that could be why he scheduled five rallies across half the country for one day  three of which were in minnesota  virginia and michigan  he has a less than one in five chance of winning those states  he s only got a one in four chance of winning pennsylvania now  some on twitter were confused by where he staged his rally blitz wait  trump still has to hold a rally in pennsylvania before going to the rally in virginia that was supposed to start  minutes ago   sam stein   samsteinhp  november    just landed in pittsburgh  were a woman is nearly in tears   don t schedule five rallies in a day if you can t make them all   pic twitter com   jenna johnson   wpjenna  november    part of trump s meltdown is promoting his businesses instead of his candidacy and agenda  his staff has tried  and failed  to keep him corralled and on message as he does his own thing  now that he s looking to be royally embarrassed tomorrow night  he has to seem in control of something and he doesn t know how else to look like a success  the newest hillary email scandal collapsed  numbers are tightening in some places but early voting heavily favors hillary in crucial states  everything that was supposed to put him over the top has dissolved in his hands and his campaign style has taken on the desperate notes of  i want to look like i went down fighting   instead of   i can still win this thing   combine that with his lack of sleep  his now constant need for soothing reassurance  and his increasingly out of control temper  and we ve got a presidential candidate who is literally losing his mind featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
