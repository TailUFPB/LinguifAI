for republicans  being compared to ronald reagan is something akin to being compared to jesus  both figures are revered among republicans for being nothing like they actually were  of course  that doesn t stop many from comparing donald trump to reagan  when pretty much the only things they had in common were being wealthy and having few skills other than being showmen  okay  perhaps they do have quite a bit in common  but when john mccain was asked by david axelrod if trump was like reagan  his answer was a firmly decisive  no  mccain said he found  appalling  trump s assertion in an interview earlier this year that the us lacked the moral standing to question russian president vladimir putin s human rights abuses   we ve got a lot of killers  what do you think  our country s so innocent   trump said at the time  to state that there s some moral equivalency between an imperfect nation   that s the united states of america   and vladimir putin is appalling   mccain responded  and i think it s pretty clear that there s a difference between  well  aren t we killers and the guy that stood there and said   mr  gorbachev  take down this wall    he said mccain even went so far as to say that in russia s interfering in our election  they ve done something far worse than attack us with conventional weapons  it s one thing to destroy a building with a bomb or inflict damage  but if you destroy the fundamentals of a free and open society  which is what democracy is all about  you inflict incredibly heavier damage   he said here s the video reagan  of course  became president during the cold war  when russia was the soviet union  it was communist instead of a capitalist oligarchy  getting into bed with russians then wouldn t have won him the white middle america poorly educated vote  times  though  have changed  russia is no longer filled with commies and well  we had eight years of a black guy and the very real prospect that the next president would have been a woman  to trump voters  that s much scarier than anything a former kgb agent who s known to kill his political enemies can do the fact that mccain is saying this is significant  though  the investigation may be stalled in the house but it s now in the senate and there is no devin nunes  even republicans seem in shock by the actions of the russians  mccain isn t the only one  as for reagan  well  he had a little thing called iran contra which helped him win his election  so  i guess he and trump have even more than being rich hacks in common  they were both propelled into office by a hostile foreign country featured image via alex wong getty images
