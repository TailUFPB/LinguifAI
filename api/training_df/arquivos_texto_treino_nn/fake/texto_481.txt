donald trump s refusal to accept the fact that mexico is not paying for his ridiculous  ineffective border wall is pretty much the definition of psychotic  mexico has struck down trump s claims that it will foot the bill for the wall numerous times  but trump continues to state the opposite   and he continued to do so on monday during a joint press conference with finnish president sauli niinisto when oann s trey yingst asked trump if he was still going to try and force mexico to pay for the wall  trump said  yes  it will  one way or the other  mexico s gonna pay for the wall  that s right  it may be through reimbursement  but one way or the other  mexico will pay for the wall  showing just how ineffective and flawed his plan was  trump had to add the disclaimer that the u s  will likely pay for the wall at first  to be later reimbursed  which probably won t happen   trump said  we need the wall  it s imperative  we may fund it through the united states  but ultimately mexico will pay for the wall  you can watch trump completely disconnect from reality and facts below trump made these comments just hours after the mexican government put out a strong statement about how it would not pay for the border wall  mexico s ministry of foreign affairs said  as the mexican government has always stated  our country will not pay  under any circumstances  for a wall or physical barrier built on u s  territory along the mexican border  to make this even more embarrassing for trump  former mexican president vicente fox  a well known critic of trump and his wall  posted this on twitter   realdonaldtrump how many times do we have to tell you  you can keep tweeting  but we won t pay the  fuckingwall  https   t co pfowlsbocb  vicente fox quesada   vicentefoxque  august    seriously needs to get back to the real world and start working on real solutions instead of his twisted fantasies featured image via alex wong getty images
