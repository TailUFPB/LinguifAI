by now  the only people in the world who still think trump was the target of an assassination on saturday are his supporters and campaign staff that was certainly the case on sunday morning as trump campaign manager kellyanne conway refused to acknowledge that austyn crites was not carrying a gun during a trump rally and was merely trying to hold up an anti trump sign tapper began by pointing out the facts and then reported that trump supporter dan scavino and one of trump s sons are retweeting misinformation about the incident in an effort to claim that there actually was a real assassination attempt  it s not an assassination attempt   tapper repeated before asking conway   should they be spreading this misinformation  of course  conway tried to capitalize on the incident by bragging about how  nimble  and  resilient  trump is  even though secret service agents were the ones who got trump off stage and he retreated from a guy who was just holding up a sign  to conway  the guy holding the sign was  scary  and she proceeded to smear him and ignore the fact that there was no assassination attempt  it s scary  all the coverage is usually about our protesters wreaking havoc and making people feel afraid  and it certainly goes both ways  i m with mr  trump and the secret service routinely  they do an amazing job  i also want to point out because some people are spreading misinformation about the protester  he had canvassed for hillary clinton and he had donated to her campaign  so  this is a democratic plant or operative trying to disrupt our rally  and i think people saw a nimble resilient donald trump who would be nimble and resilient as president as well  tapper responded by calling conway out  except it wasn t an assassination attempt  it was apparently a local voter  a republican who says he is supporting hillary clinton  he has given money to hillary clinton  he has canvassed for hillary clinton  but he says he s a republican  but most importantly  he was not trying to assassinate anyone  this was not an assassination attempt  but why is your campaign spreading that it was  that s really remarkable that that s what the storyline is here   conway whined before trying to bargain with cnn  conway offered to stop spreading misinformation  but only if cnn retracts  all the storylines  all the headlines  all the breathless predictions of the last two weeks that turned out not to be true  that trump is losing the election trump  however  is losing this election and is behind in the polls  so tapper laughed at conway and moved on here s the video via youtube kellyanne conway should be ashamed of herself and she should never be allowed to work again when this election is over featured image  screenshot
