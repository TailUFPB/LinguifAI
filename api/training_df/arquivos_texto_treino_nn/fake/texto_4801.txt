minnesota humorist garrison keillor just nailed donald trump in one of the best take downs yet donald trump is an insecure little man who thinks the presidency will finally make people respect him  and nobody made that clearer than keillor  who wrote a column published on wednesday that puts the republican nominee in his place keillor begins by focusing on trump s hat  the brim shadows your face  which gives a sinister look  as if you d come to town to announce the closing of the pulp factory   he wrote   your eyes look dead and your scowl does not suggest american greatness so much as american indigestion  keillor continued by pointing out that trump has apparently been trying for his entire life to be liked and respected by the manhattan elite   the new york times treats you like the village idiot   keillor wrote   this is painful for a queens boy trying to win respect in manhattan when you came to manhattan  years ago  you discovered that in entertainment  the press  politics  finance  everywhere you went  you ran into jews  and they are not like you  jews didn t go in for big yachts and a fleet of aircraft   they showed off by way of philanthropy or by raising brilliant offspring  they sympathized with the civil rights movement  in queens  blacks were a threat to property values   they belonged in the bronx  not down the street  to the times  queens is cleveland  bush league  you are queens  the casinos were totally queens  the gold faucets in your triplex  the bragging  the insults  but you wanted to be liked by those people  this explains why trump would throw his hat into the presidential ring  he is desperate for respect from his wealthy peers  running for president is your last bid for the respect of manhattan   keillor continued  if you were to win election  they couldn t ridicule you anymore  they could be horrified  but there is nothing ridiculous about being leader of the free world  you have b  bombers at your command  when you go places  a battalion of security guys comb the environs  you attract really really good speechwriters who give you churchillian cadences and toss in quotes from emerson and aeschylus and ecclesiastes  keillor then went on to mock trump over the bad month he had in august  the teleprompter is not your friend  you are in the old tradition of locker room ranting and big honkers in the steam room  sitting naked  talking man talk  griping about the goons and ginks and lousy workmanship and the uppity broads and the great lays and how you vanquished your enemies at the bank  keillor concludes by pointing out that running for president is the hardest work trump has ever done in his life and breaks the news to donald that in the end he is going to lose and he won t get a damn thing he wanted  it s the hardest work you ve ever done  you walk out in the white cap and you rant for an hour about stuff that means nothing and the fans scream and wave their signs and you wish you could level with them for once and say one true thing  i love you to death and when this is over i will have nothing that i want  donald trump is currently imploding in the polls and his campaign continues fly off the rails even as he insists that he is winning and that everybody loves him this is a man in serious denial and keillor just hit him with the reality that he has always been a loser and will always be a loser featured image via getty
