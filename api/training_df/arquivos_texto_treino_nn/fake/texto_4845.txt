newt gingrich  former house speaker and now trump surrogate  apparently pulled a page out of the republican presidential nominee s playbook when he attempted to stiff over  businesses  including dozens of small businesses  who helped him with his  failed presidential campaign gingrich  who owes over   million in campaign debt  recently filed documents with the federal elections commission to effectively detail a debt settlement that would end his presidential election committee  thus allowing him to escape paying the millions back to creditors and consultants who helped his campaign many of these small businesses manufactured lawn signs and organized tv spots for the republican candidate  who four years later would be runner up on donald trump s v p  slot luckily the fec wasn t having any of it rejected gingrich s debt settlement  saying that his plan does not  meet the requirement  under federal election law because it  contains no debt settlement agreements and must continue to file all required reports   so instead of the fec taking action right now  gingrich will have to complete the entire process of debt settlement plan procedures gingrich  who is worth anywhere between   to   million  has some nerve stiffing small business owners when they poured their resources into his failed presidential campaign  perhaps this is why trump didn t pick him  they both have gotten flak for stiffing honest  hardworking business owners it s time republicans take responsibility for their actions and pay their debts  while busy running small businesses into the ground  they have the gall to stand up on stages and podiums and proclaim to be saviors of small businesses so many people have been hurt at the hands of republicans  it s hard to keep track  but this election has shown the american people one thing  republicans do not pay back their debts  and they will crush anyone to save a buck hopefully  the fec denied gingrich again and forces him to pay back his debts to those who helped him  if he were an honest conservative  fiscal responsibility    this wouldn t even be an issue in the first place featured image via john moore getty images
