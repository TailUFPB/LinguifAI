matt lauer gave donald trump a chance to stop acting like a petulant child but he only doubled down on wednesday morning after bragging about somehow being picked by time magazine as their person of the year  trump was asked by lauer if he would be better off not watching saturday night live  you know  because trump has more important shit he should be dealing with like the presidency  can we agree  mr  president elect trump  that at this stage it would be better for you to simply stop watching snl   lauer asked   as opposed to watching it and then complaining about it  as we all know  trump has repeatedly thrown a temper tantrum every time he watches alec baldwin s perfect impersonation of him on the longtime comedy skit show after baldwin s latest performance  trump took to twitter to whine just tried watching saturday night live   unwatchable  totally biased  not funny and the baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse  sad  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    trump refused to answer lauer s question and proceeded to trash the show instead  there s nothing funny about it   trump claimed  even though millions of americans watch the show because it is hilarious   the skits are terrible  i like alec but his imitation of me is terrible  but you can t bring yourself to stop watching it   lauer tried again and this time  trump made a veiled threat suggesting that he ll try to force saturday night live off the air once he gets into office if the show doesn t stop mocking him  frankly  the way the show is going now   and when you look at the work they re doing   who knows how long that show s gonna be on  it s a terrible show  here s the video via youtube when trump talks like this it needs to be taken seriously  freedom of speech is in serious jeopardy and trump is actng like a typical dictator who can t handle being the butt of a joke former egyptian president mohammed morsi also whined about being the the subject of satire  and that led to bassem youssef  who hosted a daily show like political satire program  to be arrested and persecuted  his show was eventually forced off the air  it sounds like trump is laying the groundwork to do the same to shows that make fun of him featured image  ty wright  getty images
