if donald trump really had proof that president obama wiretapped him he would have revealed it long before now over a week ago  trump accused obama of wiretapping trump tower without providing a single shred of evidence of back up his claim terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    tweets created a firestorm as the media quickly called trump out and even republicans wanted no part of trump s bullshit  however  congress left the door open for trump by setting a deadline for him to provide evidence supporting his accusation white house mouthpiece sean spicer then tried to start backing away from the accusation  claiming trump didn t mean  wiretapping  when he said it and now that deadline to provide proof has come and gone  meaning trump was clearly lying when he accused president obama of a felony joe scarborough reacted to the missed deadline on twitter  this is a joke right   he asked   i m not being a smart ass here but everybody knows trump was lying about obama and the fbi tapping him  everybody  this is a joke right  i m not being a smart ass here but everybody knows trump was lying about obama and the fbi tapping him  everybody  https   t co   joe scarborough   joenbc  march    mika brzezinski echoed her co host on morning joe on tuesday by by calling on trump to admit he s a liar and apologize  if the president was lying  don t you think at some point he ought to say   i apologize  i am just an idiot  i will not do that again   she began brzezinksi then went after spicer for supporting trump s lie and then trying to spin out of it on monday during a press briefing  these reporters trying so hard to keep a straight face and sean spicer  who s a nice guy  but he s got to stop  he s got to stop   brzezinski said  noting that the justice department has nothing to give congress to justify an investigation and then she called trump out  were you lying  mr  president  did you make it up  was it some little spurt of activity that you had out of need to have action  i d like to know where it came from because it s a very serious allegation  here s the video via youtube  indeed  it is a very serious allegation  in fact  trump has opened himself up to a defamation lawsuit  which president obama should most certainly file  trump should not be allowed to get away with making such accusations  there needs to be consequences but congress is apparently still trying to bail trump out  despite the missed deadline  congress extended it to march  and if the justice department still has no proof it appears that republicans are going to use their subpoena power to start a witch hunt against president obama rather than do anything about trump s russia scandal joe scarborough is right  this administration is a joke  and so are republicans in congress featured image via screenshot
