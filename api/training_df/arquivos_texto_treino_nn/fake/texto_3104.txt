you know  because republicans are now pretending that they acted like adults over the last eight years in   mitch mcconnell infamously declared that republicans would actively work to sabotage the government and america in order to make president obama a  one term president  of course  his plan failed but he never stopped the unprecedented obstruction  hissy fits  and utter disrespect towards president obama and whatever policy ideas he proposed  basically  if obama suggested it  republicans hated it  even if it was their idea originally  like the individual mandate in obamacare but now that donald trump is about to take over the white house due to help from the russians  mcconnell is whining because democrats intend to show him what karma looks like last week  mcconnell complained after senate democrats promised to block trump s supreme court nominees  calling such a thing something that americans won t tolerate  except that mcconnell and republicans blocked president obama s supreme court nominee for nearly a year until the nomination recently expired  but now republicans all of a sudden expect democrats to kiss trump s ass and mcconnell demonstrated his hypocrisy again on sunday during an interview with face the nation host john dickerson the office of government ethics recently sounded the alarm that they are being pressured to  rush  trump s cabinet picks through a system of checks that mcconnell himself insisted upon in   such as financial disclosures  tax returns  and background checks  when president obama made his cabinet picks  but now mcconnell is pretending that republicans treated president obama with nothing but deference and respect and said that democrats should treat trump the same way and resorted to using petty insults the democrats are really frustrated that they lost the election   mcconnell said  we confirmed seven cabinet appointments the day president obama was sworn in  we didn t like most of them  either  but he won the election  so all of these little procedural complaints are related to their frustration at having not only lost the white house  but having lost the senate  i understand that  but we need to  sort of  grow up here and get past that  here s the video via vidme funny  i seem to remember republicans leaving countless federal and judicial positions unfilled because they pledged to make president obama fail  and to this day hundreds of positions remain unfilled all because republicans hated that a black guy was elected president mcconnell insisted on these rules being followed in   so he must follow his own rules  but it gets even worse for mcconnell when you consider that his wife has been nominated to be secretary of transportation  so one wonders what mcconnell wants to desperately hide so much that he now thinks it s no big deal to skip procedure seriously  democrats should declare war on trump in a way that makes the republican war against president obama look like a sissy fight  turnabout is fair play  after all  and if anyone deserves to be obstructed and blocked  it s donald trump  and republicans only have themselves to blame featured image  screenshot
