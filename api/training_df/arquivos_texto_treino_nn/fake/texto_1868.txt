with devin nunes  recusal from the house intelligence committee s russia investigation  the committee needs a new leader  and that new leader is rep  mike conaway of texas  if that name sounds familiar  it s likely because conaway made some waves earlier this year by saying something so stupid it should have automatically disqualified him from running this investigation conaway is the man who made the ridiculous comparison between russia s meddling in our election  and mexican celebrities performing for hillary clinton  oh yes  to conaway  they are one and the same  harry reid and the democrats brought in mexican soap opera stars  singers and entertainers who had immense influence in those communities into las vegas  to entertain  get out the vote and so forth  those are foreign actors  foreign people  influencing the vote in nevada  you don t hear the democrats screaming and saying one word about that  when he was pressed on whether mexican performers are really on par with russian hackers  he said  sure it is  it s foreign influence  if we re worried about foreign influence  let s have the whole story  two things  idiot  first  foreign performers aren t working in secret  second  foreign performers aren t working to obtain and release thousands of internal party documents specifically damaging to one campaign foreign performers are more like surrogates belonging to a certain demographic  foreign hackers are more like spies working to sabotage something and the man now leading the russia probe tried to downplay it into nothing by claiming they re the same thing  it was the dumbest thing he could ever have said as next in line for the chairmanship because it proves he s both too partisan to run an investigation that should be as non partisan as possible  and also that he s just plain too stupid to know what he s doing things just got very interesting here  and not in a good way  can house republicans offer up anybody capable of running this investigation the way it needs to be run  it s just gotten ridiculous now featured image by lance cheung  cc by   via flickr
