earlier today  facebook representatives told congress something that should shake every american to their core  a shady russian company bought thousands of dollars worth of ads specifically targeting american voters      to be exact  in other words  russian actors actively sought to influence the outcome of our election facebook has traced the ads back to what they re calling a  russian troll farm   which is known to spread propaganda friendly to the kremlin  some mentioned both trump and hillary by name  while most merely worked to stoke fears about gun rights  immigration  and other issues   the same fears that trump himself stoked during his campaign with all the brouhaha surrounding  fake news   and the question of how big a role social media played in the dissemination of fake news that may have unduly influenced our electoral outcome  this is a massive revelation indeed nbc news posted facebook s official statement on the matter to their twitter account  it reads  in part  we have found approximately    in ad spending from june of  to may of  associated with roughly   ads that was connected to about  inauthentic accounts and pages in violation of our policies  our analysis suggests these accounts and pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of russia  read their full statement below facebook statement   inauthentic accounts  likely operated out of russia  bought roughly    in ads between june  and may  pic twitter com   nbc news   nbcnews  september    utterly convenient that these ads started popping up right as trump formally announced his candidacy  this was even before the primary season really got underway  and the gop field was crowded  at that point  we weren t going to know for months who the gop candidate would be  yet  when combined with all the other evidence against trump and his campaign  such as meetings between don jr  and a russian lawyer  the trumps  financial connections in russia  and more  the dark picture of russian meddling starts becoming a little clearer here s the thing  while the amount these russians spent is just a tiny fraction of overall spending during the campaign cycle  and most of the ads didn t actually reference our election  the targeting was more specific than it ought to have been  that brings up questions about whether these russian operators had help from within the u s  when it came to targeting their ads if they did indeed have help from inside our borders  where did the help come from  russians already here  or people close to some of the candidates  like  oh  say  donald trump and his family   facebook can t determine that  but hopefully investigators will be able to uncover some information about it soon featured image via spencer platt getty images
