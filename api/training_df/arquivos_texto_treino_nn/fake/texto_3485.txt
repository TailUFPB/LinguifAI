the trump team has shown one thing in the last month   they are the worst when it comes to draining the swamp  they have packed the cabinet with the biggest  ugliest swamp monsters  whether they be charter school billionaires or goldman sachs executives just when you thought it couldn t get any slimier  it gets way worse apparently  the trump team is having a hard time finding entertainers for the upcoming inauguration  no one   and that means no one   wants to be associated with that freak show  not even jail bait loving ted nugent has signed on to help  so naturally  trump is desperate  lest his ego suffer a blow the trump team is so desperate  that they are actually offering government appointments to those who can find and secure entertainment for the inauguration  according to sources who spoke to the wrap donald trump s inaugural committee is scrambling to lock in a list hollywood performers for the parties celebrating him   and having a rough time booking big names  two insiders tell thewrap  both said that trump inaugural committee members have contacted them in recent days offering cash or even a government appointment if they could deliver marquee names of course  the team denied this was happening  saying they are instead  organizing an exciting and uniting celebration of freedom and democracy while following all rules  regulations and appropriate standards of conduct  jenn topper  the spokeswoman for the sunlight foundation  a nonpartisan organization focused on transparency and accountability in government  said   without knowing more specifics about the arrangements  it s difficult to say whether this would violate ethics laws or rules  but it certainly raises questions  imagine if hillary clinton offered government jobs to entertainment scouts  then again  hillary clinton wouldn t have a problem booking big wigs to attend her inauguration donald trump is already using his newfound power to offer kickbacks to his personal business and to those who help his image  he has no clue what he s getting himself into  but he likes the attention and the ego bolstering  even if it comes at the expense of our democracy  featured image via steve pope getty images
