white house press secretary sean spicer has the hardest job in washington  he has to  on an almost daily basis  face a firing squad of reporters and try to explain his boss s crazy behavior  this is especially true when it comes to donald trump s infamous twitter habit there have been several explanations from white house officials about how reporters and the american public should treat trump s tweets  now that trump has had a spectacularly nutty weekend on twitter even by normal trumpian standards  spicer had to answer on monday  point blank  if every crazy tweet is an official statement from the white house  spicer said of the tweets  the president is the president of the united states so they are considered official statements by the president of the united states  to that end  that means that trump s repeated attacks on london mayor sadiq khan at a time when we should be supporting our closest ally through a crisis are official white house statements  that means that the infamous  covfefe  tweet is an official white house statement  that means that every lie  every personal attack  every crazy or vulgar or downright bizarre thing trump has tweeted since taking office on january  is an official white house statement  think about that  and weep for this nation  folks after that clearly not well thought out response  spicer went on to say that trump is in no way worried that he will hurt his muslim ban case with the supreme court with his tweets in that direction  either  spicer didn t really address the tweets themselves  only sticking to the white house party line and saying  the court should follow the law  there s no question that we should prevail  of course  if trump continues to undermine his own case  they won t prevail  and that is sure to result in more attacks on the judiciary via   you guessed it   twitter what a crazy time to be living in  but what did we expect  elect a clown  expect a circus watch the video of spicer s bizarre remarks below featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
