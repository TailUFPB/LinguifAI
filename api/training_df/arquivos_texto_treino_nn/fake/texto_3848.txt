the unthinkable has happened  and we are now all forced to live under a donald trump administration for the next four years  this is especially terrifying to minorities  since the man that was just declared our next president is a racist  misogynistic  xenophobic bigot  and his vice president elect  indiana governor mike pence  is just as bad   only much more quietly  well  there is one person in the united states senate who won t stand for any of that bigotry when it comes to lawmaking  bernie sanders while bernie has promised to work with a trump administration where they can find common ground  he has already warned trump that there will be no funny business on his watch when it comes to going after minorities  bernie tweeted if donald trump takes people s anger and turns it against muslims  hispanics  african americans and women  we will be his worst nightmare   bernie sanders   sensanders  november    isn t the first time since trump s victory that bernie has warned him against aggressively attacking the rights of minorities  either  on wednesday  he said  to the degree that mr  trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country  i and other progressives are prepared to work with him   the vermont senator said in a statement released wednesday  to the degree that he pursues racist  sexist  xenophobic and anti environment policies  we will vigorously oppose him  this is reassuring  because while the situation is certainly dismal  there are democrats and independents in the senate who still have enough seats to block the republicans and a trump administration from appointing anti lgbtq  anti women  anti muslim  anti immigrant justices to the supreme court  while this might  optics wise  looks like democrats offering retribution for the gop s refusal to give president obama s appointee  merrick garland  a hearing and a vote  indeed it is not  it is a way to keep republicans from stripping the basic human rights from groups of americans they hate thank you  bernie  for having our back  let s hope that you and senate democrats are successful in protecting us for the next four years as we live out this literal nightmare featured image via joshua lott getty images
