when will sarah palin learn that the best response when someone says something not so nice about her is to shut up recently  president obama pointed out that he sees a  straight line  between the disaster that was the vice presidential nomination of the half wit  half term former governor of alaska as being the incredibly stupid straw that broke the very unfortunate camel s back when it comes to right wing politics  the figure who helped give power to the tea party  the freedom caucus  and other far right groups whose members very likely know how to put out a meth lab explosion and still make the baby s room look ok by the next day   all without getting soot on their robes and hoods  no less  i see a straight line from the announcement of sarah palin as the vice presidential nominee to what we see today in donald trump  the emergence of the freedom caucus  the tea party  and the shift in the center of gravity for the republican party   the president told new york magazine   whether that changes  i think  will depend in part on the outcome of this election  but it s also going to depend on the degree of self reflection inside the republican party  there have been at least a couple of other times that i ve said confidently that the fever is going to have to break  but it just seems to get worse  sarah palin may not be smart   but even she can see an insult from her back porch  and  of course  mama grizzly wasn t about to take that lying down  on monday  she posted a scathing reply to obama   one that surely burned his black soul  that s black as in the color  not black in the way she would point it out  to its very core  there s a reason pro american activists have been living rent free in president obama s head these past eight years   palin wrote  adding the usual rhetoric about the national debt   destroying our children s future   etc   that s what should occupy the president s headspace  not some hockey mom from alaska  she linked to a fluff piece from independent journal review  where the truth goes to die  titled  obama mentioned sarah palin twice in  weeks  she has an idea on what he should focus on instead  someone should compare that to how many times she has mentioned obama in two weeks of her mad  delusional  drunken ravings  palin  whose son recently had to deal with a little teeny incident in which he hit his girlfriend and made threats with a gun and the undisputed champion of the great birthday party drunken brawl of   learned very quickly  oh  let s face it   she probably learned nothing  what happens when you say stupid things about the president on the internet there s a reason pro american activists have been living rent free in president obama s head these past eight  https   t co   sarah palin   sarahpalinusa  october    responded with an epic barrage of truth and mockery  most centered on her strong and unwavering support for one of the few people in history who actually may be  worse than hitler   sarahpalinusa like trump has been living tax free for the last twenty years   jacqui rodham   heyjdey  october    sarahpalinusa  injo you should thank obama for mentioning you  you re sinking  thankfully  into obscurity  clodagh smith     october    sarahpalinusa unfunded liabilities  like all the wars chimpy mcflightsuit got us in   tammay    thefiveohtwo  october    sarahpalinusa pro american activists  you hate any american that doesn t believe what you do   michael hendricks   mikeekimcurtis  october    sarahpalinusa  injo shut up and go back to huntin wolves from a helicopter dum dum   matt houser   realmattyvegas  october    sarahpalinusa you re a joke  delete your account  pastor bukake   revjizzmop  october    sarahpalinusa  injo as opposed to your head which is a vacant lot with the occasional tumbleweed passing through  burly aces   burlyaces  october    sarahpalinusa  injo still dumber than a bag of hair  m     october    sarahpalinusa does your shitty son charge rent when he beats women      om ingram      omingram  october    sarahpalinusa you were relevant for one month  eight years ago   chicago man   iwanski  october    thing is for certain  it s hilarious that obama has stayed largely silent over the years  weathering insult after insult from palin and the rest of the stupid part of america  and when the president finally delivered a well deserved traditional classy insult buried in an honest statement  she can t handle it at all  just goes to show what thin skinned bullies palin  trump  and their ilk really are featured image via getty images kris connor  screengrab
