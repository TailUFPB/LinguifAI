saturday night live is known for the laughs they give us and they sure gave us plenty when it came to the  election  this week  there wasn t much to laugh about  i wasn t sure how snl would approach the current state of affairs tonight  but they did so much more than i could have hoped  instead of making us laugh  they made us cry  and after making us sob  they made us hope for the future in tonight s cold opening  kate mckinnon once again appeared as hillary clinton in her trademark white pantsuit  alone on the stage  mckinnon sat at a grand piano and sang hallelujah  the words of the song and the haunting melody made it all but impossible not to shed a tear  but then  she reminded us not to give up hope and to continue fighting the good fight to make the future a better place for everyone this is a tough time for people of color  for women  for the lgbtq community  for muslims  and for all of america  however  we cannot go gentle into that good night  we must continue to rage against the bigotry and hatred that threaten to consume us  so go ahead and cry tonight  sob uncontrollably  but tomorrow  wake up and fight like hell watch snl s cold opening here  see if you can make it through with a dry eye  i m doubting that you can featured image via video screen capture
