one of the gop s biggest donors who used to be associated with ibm is the man responsible for millions of twitter bots that follow president trump and are likely designed to spread false or misleading news to voters on social media robert mercer  the man the whole scheme relies on for guidance  is a very reclusive republican mega doner and huge tump supporter  reports the new york daily news mercer and his daughter rebekah orchestrated an off the radar money raising plot during the whole campaign  and also connected to trump to some critical figures like bannon this computer scientist turned billionaire built technologies at ibm used to power its watson super computer  mercer also assisted apple with the development of the siri platform experts told the daily news that of trump s  million twitter followers   million are actually automated bots designed to be  weaponized   these bots can spread false news stories and mislead voters to distract them from scandals faced by the white house the scary part is their ability can escalate rapidly with the introduction of more advanced technology  fooling humans into doing things in the electronic realm turned out to be really easy   explained chief technology officer at bromium  simon crosby  in reference to campaigns that influenced the  election and brexit referendum  with a few extra steps that seem available in the right circles  it could get even easier  you have arbitrary and ridiculous information spread very quickly  and now to the targeted user is more susceptible to believing it and spreading it  and we now know that it influences people  we saw it in the election  with brexit   he said  ultimately  the problem is that anybody can talk to anybody  especially if  anybody  is a bot on twitter or facebook who knows a lot about you  it makes sense for a man with knowledge of the inner workings of watson to use his skills to help facilitate a bot operation for political gain  even though any computer scientist who is motivated could help tump do it   almost all ai technology is open source  it s the proximity of mercer to trump  in particular  that causes concern and raises questions before mercer made billions at his current hedge fund  he worked at ibm where he developed several patents and published studies on  brown clustering   which imb used to create watson artificial intelligence mercer  a big player in getting breitbart news funded and where it is today  invested millions into a firm called cambridge analytica  to mine online data and influence voters  the new yorker magazine reported that this tech company uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers  this type of technology has been employed in previous candidate campaigns that mercer supported and will be used in the future to target voters on social media  crosby explained  we re in deep trouble in the sense that it s extraordinarily easy to automate a generation of arbitrarily absurd and ridiculous stuff  photo by oliver contreras for the washington post via images getty
