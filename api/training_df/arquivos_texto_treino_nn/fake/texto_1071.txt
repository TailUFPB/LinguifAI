on january  this year  more than  people were arrested without warning in relation to the anti trump protests that took place in washington dc  now some of those involved face up to  years behind bars  including the reporters and photographers who were just trying to bring us the news heavily armed riot police closed off an entire city block in washington on the day of donald trump s inauguration  encircling the bulk of the protestors  however  the order to disperse never came  police just started arresting protestors  it didn t even cross my mind that was what was happening   said independent photographer and videographer alexei wood   i was waiting for an order of dispersal and the mass of people showed no sign of resistance when the police completely surrounded them  almost all of the protests that took place that day went by without violence or arrests on a mass scale  with the exception of black bloc anarchists and anti fascists clashing with police  wood was unfortunate enough to be scooped up when police retaliated by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the protestors  as well as launching concussion grenades into the crowd when the smoke had cleared  more than    worth of damage had been inflicted on property  cars  and buildings  according to the u s  attorney s office for the district of columbia  the following day  more than  people  including wood and several other journalists  were arrested for felony rioting  a charge that carries a statutory maximum sentence of  years in prison and a fine of     however  some were lucky enough to have the charges dropped things went from bad to worse for wood and company when  on april   the superior court of the district of columbia returned a superseding indictment giving additional charges to  defendants  three of whom hadn t even been previously charged  these new charges include urging to riot  conspiracy to riot and destruction of property and could see the defendants spending between  and  years in prison  wood alone faces five felony property destruction charges and three felony rioting charges alexei wood  based in san antonio  texas  focuses on social justice struggles and resistance movements in his work  but now he finds himself in the exact same position as those for whom he tries to do justice  stating that the implications of the defendants  cases  are humungous for striking fear into protesters  the state is not just going after window breakers  which in itself may not be justified  instead  the state seeks to criminalize dissent by indiscriminately arresting more than  people and imposing a slew of felony charges that carry the potential of decades in prison   wood continued   but it also means if we re  too close to a newsworthy story  we could be facing more than  years  wood posted live footage of the anti fascist march on his facebook page  the  minute video showing him complying with police orders  while at no stage suggesting that he took place in any violent acts  the livestream speaks for itself  it s right there for everybody to see  i love that it s there for everybody to see because i want individual people to see my work and make their own decision   he said   i think it s a very clear case  take a look at the livestream and decide for yourself if the man filming it deserves to spend what could possibly equate to the rest of his life in prison  function d  s  id     var js  fjs   d getelementsbytagname s    if  d getelementbyid id   return   js   d createelement s   js id   id   js src      connect facebook net enus sdk js xfbml  version      fjs parentnode insertbefore js  fjs    document   script    facebook jssdk    anti fascist black bloc dcposted by lex shoots on friday  january    image via kevin dietsch   pool getty images
