for months  various third parties have been making all sorts of noises about how we need third party candidates in the presidential elections if we ever want to break the tyranny of the two party system  this has resonated especially well with people who think hillary clinton is about as bad as donald trump  however  libertarian gary johnson  and his running mate  bill weld  have issued a surprising announcement about this election that doesn t include begging for votes for johnson the johnson weld campaign believes that trump is a monumentally bad choice for president of the united states  saying  in their statement on the matter  a president of the united states operates every day under a great deal of pressure   from all sides  and in furtherance of many different agendas  with that pressure comes constant criticism after careful observation and reflection  i have come to believe that donald trump  if elected president of the united states  would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office   no  trump wouldn t be able to handle the pressure  johnson and weld are both reading this quite correctly  because trump is a  too thin skinned to deal with hostile world leaders who might ridicule him  along with a hostile congress that just won t do his bidding   and b  just plain too mired in fascism to be the leader of the free world  he would destroy the free world the campaign went on to say  mr  trump has some charisma and panache  and intellectual quickness  these qualities can be entertaining  yet more than charisma  more even than intellectual ability  is required of a serious candidate for this country s highest office  a serious candidate for the presidency of the united states must be stable  and donald trump is not stable   while it does sound like they re admitting defeat and endorsing hillary  or  at least  trying to convince people to vote for hillary  that s not quite the case  whatever other sites have claimed  the johnson weld campaign wants the nov   election to be between johnson and hillary  rather than hillary and trump  governor weld and governor johnson are campaigning nonstop  with rallies and appearances scheduled over the next few days across the country from alaska to cincinnati  and are fully committed to giving voters the third choice they deserve in this election any suggestion to the contrary is the product of active imaginations and partisans in both the republican and democrat camps who see how many independents  millennials  and other disenfranchised voters are looking to the johnson weld ticket as a vote they can cast in good conscience  either way  the johnson campaign  despite being much closer to republicans than democrats ideologically  cannot stomach voting for trump  they can t tolerate their voters voting for trump  either  but neither do they want their voters choosing hillary featured image by bill mccay via getty images for siriusxm
