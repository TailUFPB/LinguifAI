everyone remembers who died at bowling green thanks to kellyanne conway  everyone remembers who died in atlanta thanks to sean spicer  and the truth is that those of us who didn t die at bowling green died in atlanta  or did we  donald trump held a rally in florida today  where he discussed  or rather  fear mongered  about terrorism  and referenced yet another completely imaginary terror attack  this one happened last night in sweden  supposedly  and it s fairly safe to assume we all died there  too  you look at what s happening last night in sweden  sweden  who would believe this  sweden  they took in large numbers  they re having problems like they never thought possible  the thing is  there were no terror attacks in sweden last night  there was an incident at the turkish embassy in sweden on the   but that was specifically against turkey  possibly by supporters of an organization that has been operating mainly in turkey for the last  years  and turkish establishments in sweden have been having problems like this for years  which makes it unlikely that these people were refugees  but refugees are what trump was trying to scare his crowd over with this new fake attack  we ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country  and there was no way to vet those people  there was no documentation  there was no nothing  bull  shit  the vetting process has been explained so many times by so many people now that it s a wonder anybody at all can still lap this liquid baloney up the way they do finding news about any terror attacks anywhere on the european continent last night is difficult  in fact  news about terror attacks last night is coming mostly from india and pakistan  most of that news seems to speculate whether india is behind terror attacks in pakistan there are a few stories about terrorism in israel  but pretty much nothing from europe  and certainly nothing from scandinavia  yet trump went on and on about how we have no way of knowing who s coming into the country by claiming that sweden is having problems they ve never had before  it s a truly dark time when someone who calls himself president of the united states has to lie in order to spread the proper amount of fear and truth be told  fear mongering is bad enough  what trump is doing is a squillion times worse  watch his gullible  worshiping audience eat this lie up below featured image by joe raedle via getty images
