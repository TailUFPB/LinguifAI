republicans may act like they have faith in donald trump when the cameras are rolling  but if you ask them in private  they have some serious issues with his trainwreck of a presidency on tuesday  senate minority leader chuck schumer told the ladies of the view that republicans have  real problems  with trump when you speak to them behind closed doors  when you talk to republicans quietly   you know  in the cloak room and the gym   they are having real problems with him   schumer replied   now  very few   john mccain  to his credit   but very few have had the courage to oppose hime even though they know he s doing a lot of things that are against what america is all about my prediction is that if he keeps up on this path   which is likely  i don t think he ll change   within three or four months you re going to see a whole lot of republicans breaking with him  and that s the salvage of america  that is the hope of america  schumer continued  noting that trump has assembled the  worst cabinet i ve ever seen in the history of america   he then predicted that in a matter of months trump will push republicans to a point where they have  no choice  but to turn on him schumer explained that trump had  campaigned as a populist against both the democratic and republican establishments   if he continued on that path  he might  have some successes   schumer said  but what trump has done is  move to the hard  hard right  way beyond what most republicans are for   and because of this  he will  be a failure  schumer doesn t think trump is going to change anytime soon  but he does think that there will come a time when republicans will step up and put a stop to this madness  or at least he hopes so  i do think  and hope and pray  that a lot of the republicans   they re mainstream people  i don t agree with them on the issues but they re good people   that they will feel they have no choice but to break with him  the minority leader also added that trump s attacks on the press  in particular  are  trouble for the democracy  watch the segment here featured image via video screen capture
