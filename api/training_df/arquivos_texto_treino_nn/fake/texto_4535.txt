even though donald trump  sort of  dropped the  birther  issue  there s one pro trump surrogate who   in the tightest re election fight of his life   is still pledging to continue his investigation into president obama s birth certificate sheriff joe arpaio  who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury  told a group of tea party activists that he is certain barack obama s birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it  i m not going to give up  and we re looking into it  i don t know how it s going to turn out  i don t care where he s from  we are looking at a forged document  period  i had nothing to do with trump on the birth certificate  we did it on our own  because of you guys  the room of  or so activists were of course energized by arpaio s pledge to unleash the  truth   before speaking to the crowd  arpaio told reporters that it was the tea party activists in maricopa county that got him  stuck  with the birther issue after world net daily  a right wing publication known for conspiracy theories  had a reporter speak to another group  and subsequently gathered almost  signatures demanding arpaio investigate  he complied  launching his investigation last week according to arizona central mike zullo  the lead investigator on the case and commander of arpaio s cold case posse  told the crowd that he knew trump s statement was a  punch in the gut  because it was unexpected  zullo said he thought trump s statement was  strategic  it s not going to deter us   zullo said   it s not going to stop us  i am closer than ever  zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where president obama was born  the kapiolani medical center for women and children in honolulu  denies that such a birth ever happened well there you have it  not only are maricopa county residents footing the bill for arpaio s legal woes  yet again   they are now paying for another  investigation  into president obama s birth certificate  is this what republicans mean by  fiscal responsibility  in maricopa county  there are almost   million taxpaying citizens  and now they are paying their sheriff s office their tax dollars to  investigate  some fringe conspiracy supported by  activists  think about that maybe that s why arpaio is losing his re election bid to a democrat  paul penzone  and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting good thing he s focusing on the issues that matter featured image via ralph froso getty images
