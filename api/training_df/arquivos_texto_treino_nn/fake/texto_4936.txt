if the republican party actually took this guy s advice they wouldn t be a party on the verge of extinction donald trump and the gop are waging a pathetic effort to reach out to black voters  but a black voter who writes a column for the charlotte observer took the republican party to task on tuesday by teaching them a lesson on how they can attract minority voters if they are really serious about getting votes beyond the old white male demographic  hey  republican party  african american voter here   eric frazier began   i hear you ve been looking for me  but you re sending out such wildly mixed messages that i m not sure if i should be flattered or furious  hat no   fits me pretty snugly right now  here s why your national standard bearer  donald trump  is making an explicit appeal for my vote  he came to charlotte last week and said the democratic party plays black voters for suckers while black neighborhoods rot  trump asked african americans what they have to lose by voting for someone new  which frazier called a  fair question  too bad the guy asking it ranks as the most racially inflammatory presidential candidate since arch segregationist george wallace   he snapped back   instead of making his black voter sales pitch by talking to us  he s doing it by talking about us to white audiences  that tells me a hell of a lot more than the words on his teleprompter do  someone call the burn unit because trump just got torched frazier called trump out for calling all black people poor when  in fact   percent of african americans live above the poverty line  frazier concedes that a  percent poverty rate is still too high  especially when compared to white people  but the statistics clearly show that trump was wrong to make such a claim  frazier opined that trump is only making a pitch to black voters because he is trying to just give  cover to embarrassed white supporters who are sick of answering for his racial provocations  he then pointed out that republicans in north carolina  where trump made his pitch  are working hard to suppress black voters by cutting sunday voting and early voting  both of which are popular among black communities frazier even gave republicans a quick lesson on how they can truly convince black voters to vote for them  but they probably aren t going to like it  blacks vote democrat today because democrats fought for their votes  the party that once welcomed cross burning klansmen did an about face on civil rights and earned the black vote are you fighting to get those votes back  nope the path to do so is clear  if you re interested  embrace affirmative action   and let racist base voters walk  pass criminal justice reform  champion black entrepreneurship and the rebuilding of the inner cities  reach out to churchgoing black families  their traditionalist social values mirror yours even viewed through the lens of small government conservatism  this agenda is do able you ll lose old voters  and you ll gain new ones  just as the democrats did  years ago in a changing america  you ll be in position to compete for real minority votes  instead of just complaining about imaginary fraudulent ones  to conclude  frazier told republicans to stop thinking black people are stupid and to start treating them like a serious voting block who damn well know who and what policies they are voting for  concerned about black votes this november  gop   frazier asked   quit whining  stop provoking  start competing  the question is will republicans take this advice seriously or will they ignore it like they usually do  because the white conservative base republicans have been relying on for years is dying off and there are not enough young conservatives to replace them winning national elections no longer comes down to who wins the white vote  donald trump is seriously courting the old white male demographic  but his alienation of young people  blacks  hispanics  muslims  and women have seriously crippled his campaign  it has also crippled the republican party down the ticket and could have serious repercussions for the gop for many years to come if republicans ever want to sit in the white house again  they are going to have to kick out the racists and get back to being the party of lincoln  because right now  lincoln is spinning in his grave due to the fact that white supremacists have taken over the party and are bragging about it black voters definitely do not want to support a political party that is infested and controlled by people who hate them  and pretending that black voters will do exactly that is insulting and is a big reason why republicans can count on losing the black vote for decades to come if they continue to refuse to change featured image via alex wong getty images
