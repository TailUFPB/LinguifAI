not too long ago  the republican party and donald trump made a disgusting move to screw over millions of americans when they tried to repeal the affordable care act  obamacare  with the american health care act  trumpcare   the plan fortunately didn t work out and was shot down immediately  leaving the gop stunned and upset that their disastrous bill didn t pass  they ve just been delivered another devastating blow  this time by americans who are showing the republican party they haven t forgotten thanks to the gop s unethical obamacare replacement  obamacare is now more popular than ever   more popular than the republican party as a whole ezra klein tweeted this amazing graph to illustrate this is going to tear trump and the gop apart  considering how desperate they were to get rid of obamacare  the overwhelming support that the affordable care act is receiving now will surely make it harder for republicans to get rid of it in the future  if they dare try again this serves as a major warning to the gop   if they keep trying to get rid of obama s legacy and policies that clearly work  their party will lose all support and soon there will be no republican party  if conservatives thought they would have americans standing behind them during their attempt to repeal a health care law that provides access to more americans than ever  they ve just learned that they were very  very wrong the gop has no idea how badly the party has been damaged under trump  he is completely obsessed with pushing legislation through  and it has been working against the republican party as each attempt of his fails and the party becomes more unpopular than ever  with the introduction of trumpcare  republicans have basically paved the way for democrats to get congress back in two years  and getting trump out of the white house featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
