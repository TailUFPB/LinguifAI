joe biden was speaking at the skybridge alternatives  salt  conference when one rich  a  hole  decided to disrespect the former vice president s dead son  biden was furious and he put the heckler in his place effortlessly bill ackman  manager of a failing hedge fund  was speaking at the wall street event as well  fox business reports that during the private vip dinner  former florida governor and  gop presidential contender jeb bush  asked biden why didn t you run  biden explained that part of the decision stemmed from the death of his son beau biden  who died of brain cancer in   the room grew quiet as biden became emotional  and said   i m sorry i ve said enough  that s when ackman blurted out  why  that s never stopped you before  the formal  and understated dinner conversation suddenly turned tense  according to three people who were present and confirmed both the substance and the wording of biden s responses biden  these people say  turned to someone seated near him  and asked   who is this asshole    a reference to ackman then he turned directly to ackman and stated   look  i don t know who you are  wiseass  but never disrespect the memory of my dead son   these people say ackman attempted what was described as an apology  to which biden said   just shut the hell up  a spokesman for ackman insisted that the idea that there was an argument or altercation between joe biden and bill ackman  is just utter nonsense  he even added that  bill had a great time at the dinner and enjoyed spending time with the former vice president  but three different sources who witnessed the exchange say otherwise  biden was in rare form   said one person with direct knowledge of the heated conversation   i can t believe it has never leaked out  there are some lines you just don t cross and this is one of them  why ackman thought he could get away with making this kind of remark is anybody s guess  but biden was not having it and in the process  he proved that he has plenty of spunk left for a  presidential run  i never thought she was a great candidate  i thought i was a great candidate  biden said at the dinner  which raises speculation that he may decide to run for president in the next election  while biden  who is   would be the oldest candidate to ever run for the white house  he certainly seems up to the task featured image via alex wong getty images
