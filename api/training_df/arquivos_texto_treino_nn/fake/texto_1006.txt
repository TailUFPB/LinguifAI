despite how much the mainstream media and america has clearly communicated that no one is interested in what trump adviser kellyanne conway has to say anymore  she unfortunately keeps finding ways to spread her alternative facts  recently  conway was caught lying about the american health care act  the disastrous replacement to obamacare   and even the gop is pissed about it according to sen  bill cassidy  r la   conway needs to shut up and sit down when it comes to the recently unveiled republican health care bill  in an interview with cnn host jim scuitto  cassidy trashed conway for trying to speak for the republican party as a whole  and made it clear that she was merely the spokeswoman for donald trump  not the gop  scuitto asked cassidy about conway s recent false statements  over the weekend  kellyanne conway  spokesperson and surrogate for the white house  made a remarkable claim that there aren t any medicaid cuts in this bill  is the gop misleading americans about what s actually in this bill  cassidy s response could not have been any more fed up with conway  cassidy bluntly said  kellyanne conway is not the gop  however  scuitto argued that  she s a very close spokesperson for the president and speaks for the president  cassidy just shook his head and said   i just can t address that   signaling that yet another republican is ashamed beyond belief over trump and his incompetent  dishonest team you can watch the interview below conway had blatantly lied about there being no medicaid cuts in the gop s new health care plan   there are actually substantial cuts being made to the program and they are being widely reported  particularly after the cbo has weighed in conway s lies yet again prove that she cannot be trusted  even after having previously banned from all reputable cable news shows  she obviously hasn t learned her lesson featured image via yana paskova   getty images
