the attorney general of the united states lied under oath  but that seems to be the status quo in the trump administration  during sessions  confirmation hearing in january  he told sen  al franken  d mn  that he was  not aware  of evidence that anyone affiliated with the trump campaign communicated with the russian government during the campaign  but today  his selective memory issues seem to be clearing up  however  the only reason sessions is admitting there was contact with the trump administration is because of court documents that were unsealed monday revealing that donald trump s former campaign adviser  george papadopoulos  floated the idea of setting up a meeting between the former reality show star and russian president vladimir putin in march   papadopoulos claimed he had  connections  that could help arrange the meeting between trump and putin on top of that  an instagram picture on trump s account shows sessions attended the meeting in which papadopoulos made the suggestion so  it s kind of a big deal  and special counsel robert mueller is all up in this administration s business over the russia scandal  a source familiar with the matter told nbc that sessions rejected the meeting and apparently  sessions doesn t remember if he remembers that  or something source clarifies  unclear whether sessions recalls nixing the papadopoulos proposal for trump putin meeting   though he did do so   ken dilanian   kendilaniannbc  november     franken isn t too happy about the  alarming pattern  in which sessions  apparently failed to tell the truth  under oath  about the trump team s contacts with agents of russia a hostile foreign power that interfered in the  election  once again  developments in the ongoing investigation into russian interference in the  election have brought to light evidence that you failed to tell the truth about your interactions with russian operatives during the campaign  as well as your awareness of russian contacts by other members of the trump campaign team   franken wrote in a statement  we must get to the bottom of what happened so that we can prevent it from happening again   franken wrote   i am deeply troubled that this newest revelation strongly suggests that the senate and the american public cannot trust your word  in june  sessions said that he had  no knowledge  of any conversations by anyone connected to the trump campaign about  any type of interference with any campaign  by russians who knew that a racist elf would lie  certainly  none of us would have ever guessed featured image via alex wong getty images
