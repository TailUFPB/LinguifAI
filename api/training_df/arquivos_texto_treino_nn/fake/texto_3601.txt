kellyanne conway couldn t take the heat donald trump s lie about  million people voting illegally has been repeatedly debunked  especially by politifact  which rated it  false  because trump got his information from right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones  who got his information from a guy who refuses to show evidence to support his claim rather than admit that her boss is full of shit on this one topic  kellyanne conway dodged the same question from george stephannopoulos on four different occasions  that claim is groundless   stephanopoulos said   isn t it irresponsible for the president elect to make false statements like that  i think it s groundless to talk about fake news  the fake news is that somehow the popular vote is more important than the electoral college vote now   conway replied   all i saw was  road to    i ve never heard  road to popular vote  hillary clinton currently has more than a  million vote lead in the popular vote and recount efforts are underway in three battleground states because the popular vote in those states could very well be wrong and that would swing the election in clinton s favor and rid us of trump and his bile stephanopoulos scolded conway for ignoring his question and asked it again  kellyanne  that s not what i asked   he said   no one is questioning the victory  i said  is it appropriate  is it responsible for the president elect to make false statements like that  but conway still refused to answer and chose to whine about the recounts instead  well first  many people are questioning the victory   conway said   you ve got people spending millions of dollars   wasting money and time   in the clinton and stein camps  so  not everyone has  accepted the election results  conway then claimed that trump got his information from many  different people  including anti immigrant kansas secretary of state kris kobach who is an extremist conservative whack job  there s not evidence that there were millions of illegal votes   stephanopoulos replied   zero  but conway only continued whining about the recount because whining is what she does best  there s also no evidence that a recount is going to change the results in wisconsin  michigan  and pennsylvania   she claimed  and while that might be true  the fact that russia hacked our election system and trump repeatedly claimed the election is rigged makes it pretty clear that we need these recount efforts  if conway really believes trump legitimately won this election  she should have no objection to the recount  the only reason she would object is because she fears the recount will reveal something her and trump do not want discovered stephanopoulos refused to let conway hijack the interview and asked the question again  simple question  kellyanne  is that statement by president elect trump true  but conway couldn t even answer a simple question  which means these recounts should move forward  in fact  they should move forward in every state trump  won  just to make sure his team didn t rig the results  after all  trump did hire a man convicted of election fraud in michigan  that alone should make people question the vote tallies here s the video via youtube again  how conway is able to sleep at night and look at herself in the mirror every morning after defending trump on a daily basis is a total mystery featured image  screenshot
