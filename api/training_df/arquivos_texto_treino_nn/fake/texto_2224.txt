trump and his administration have been dogged by ongoing accusations and reports that they re in bed with russia  but a huge part of the story got lost in the controversy over the presidential election  and it implicates the entire republican party  in addition to the dnc  russia targeted the democratic congressional campaign committee and several democratic house races with their cyberattack the hackers are guccifer    according to a december report in the new york times  and they made public the names  cell phone numbers  email addresses and even personal addresses of the democratic candidates they went after  but they didn t stop there   they also released batches upon batches of internal party documents  seemingly with the intent to influence the closest house races in the country and how is paul ryan involved in any of this  the national republican campaign committee and the congressional leadership fund  a superpac that s tied to ryan  both used stolen d c c c  documents to mount an attack campaign against joe garcia  a florida democrat who lost a very competitive race with carlos curbelo who unseated garcia in  the illicit material was used in other states as well  including swing states like pennsylvania  new hampshire  ohio and north carolina  as well as in illinois and new mexico  anywhere where democratic candidates were in very tight races against their gop opponents whether paul ryan knew about the clf s use of material hacked by the russians is anyone s guess  the point remains  though  that his own super pac used information that came courtesy of russia  which means that russia didn t just influence the presidential side of things   they influenced the congressional side of things and it s not like they had material that they genuinely thought was just flowing from some natural spigot  several republicans did refuse the chance to use the hacked documents in part because they knew it came  from a possible foreign source  the d c c c  s chairman  rep  ben ray lujan of new mexico  sent a letter to his counterpart at the n r c c  when he first saw an ad that appeared to use the hacked documents  the n r c c  s use of documents stolen by the russians plays right into the hands of one of the united states  most dangerous adversaries  put simply  if this action continues  the n r c c  will be complicit in aiding the russian government in its effort to influence american elections  and that s what s happened  russia had its hands in far more than our presidential election and calls the results of every federal race in  into serious question  the republicans ran with the material  which does  in fact  make them complicit in russia s meddling featured image by win mcnamee via getty images
