trump continued to claim credit for things with which he had little to do when february s jobs report came out earlier today  and sean spicer even defended him to a press that wanted to know why jobs reports are suddenly authentic  when they were all fake under obama  but the hypocrisy doesn t end there  apparently  kevin brady  chairman of the house ways and means committee  issued his own statement on the jobs report  and in doing so  he brought republican hypocrisy to a whole new level the february  jobs report  which  of course  came out under obama  showed   new jobs  brady said  while it s good news that more americans have joined the labor force  it s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages  one year later  we have a jobs report that says   new jobs were created in february  brady said  this is a great report  the fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction  isn t   less than    or is there some kind of new math of which we aren t yet aware  really  partisan games and fuzzy math are the only explanation for brady s saying he s very pleased about last month s jobs report   it s obviously because there s a republican in the white house and brady wants to kiss his ass it also showcases republicans  insistence on opposing everything that obama ever did brady should have thought this out a little better  there s no way to spin the difference between the two statements as anything other than sheer gop hypocrisy take a look at both full statements below kevin brady on the february  job report v  kevin brady on february  job report  what could have changed  pic twitter com ortmxrxqoc  sam stein   samsteinhp  march    image by mark wilson via getty images
