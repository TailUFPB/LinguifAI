the people who actually know what is at stake when it comes to national security under a trump administration are not happy at all  that would be the likely reason for the unprecedented number of leaks coming from within the government regarding the trump white house and the activities therein  one such person is long time cia operative and national security council spokesman edward price price wrote an absolutely scathing indictment of trump in the washington post regarding his inability to continue to work in the intelligence community with trump as commander in chief  and even put out a video revealing what he thinks of the person currently leading the nation as well  while noting that he has been proudly serving his country for years regardless of which party controlled the white house  price noted how trump s issues go beyond anything he has seen before and could ever tolerate  i watched in disbelief when  during the third presidential debate  trump casually cast doubt on the high confidence conclusion of our  intelligence agencies  released that month  that russia was behind the hacking and release of election related emails  on the campaign trail and even as president elect  trump routinely referred to the flawed  assessment of iraq s weapons programs as proof that the cia couldn t be trusted   even though the intelligence community had long ago held itself to account for those mistakes and trump himself supported the invasion of iraq  price then went on to go all in on trump s disgraceful comments in front of the cia memorial wall  where he should have been there to thank the intelligence community s officers for keeping us safe  and to honor those who so bravely did in the line of duty in service to all of us  instead  trump relitigated his election victory  and boasted about crowd sizes and criticized the press  price says of that event  trump s actions in office have been even more disturbing  his visit to cia headquarters on his first full day in office  an overture designed to repair relations  was undone by his ego and bluster  standing in front of a memorial to the cia s fallen officers  he seemed to be addressing the cameras and reporters in the room  rather than the agency personnel in front of them  bragging about his inauguration crowd the previous day  whether delusional or deceitful  these were not the remarks many of my former colleagues and i wanted to hear from our new commander in chief  finally  price gives us the straw that really broke the camel s back for him  the way trump elevated white supremacist steve bannon on the nsc the final straw came late last month  when the white house issued a directive reorganizing the national security council  on whose staff i served from  until earlier this year  missing from the nsc s principals committee were the cia director and the director of national intelligence  added to the roster  the president s chief strategist  stephen k  bannon  who cut his teeth as a media champion of white nationalism  it is great to see good patriots like edward price coming out so bravely and saying what needs to be said  that trump is unfit to be president  and is making dangerous and reckless decisions as commander in chief  we can only hope that there is some mechanism in place for these good people to be able to refuse reckless orders from this clearly mentally ill narcissist who belongs in the nut house rather than in the white house watch edward price scorch trump in absolutely epic form below featured image via video screen capture
