just remember this the next time we need help from our allies and they tell us to go f ck ourselves donald trump has been on a whirlwind foreign trip in which he has been embarrassing the red  white  and blue in every nation he has visited first  he bowed like a princess before the saudi king and even went full hypocrite by refusing to say  radical islam  during his speech there then he went to israel and confirmed that the israelis were the source of the highly classified intelligence he leaked to the russians on thursday  trump delivered a speech in front of nato leaders and insulted our allies the whiny temper tantrum was all about trump s complaint that some nato nations have not paid enough for their own defense  i have been very  very direct with secretary stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that nato members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations  but  of the  member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they re supposed to be paying for their defense  this is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the united states  and many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years  trump s speech may have gone down well with his conservative supporters in redneckistan usa  but our allies were sure as hell pissed off  the looks on their faces as trump bitched about them spoke volumes here s the video via youtube this was supposed to be a speech to unite europe and the united states against terrorism  but what trump did is divisive and totally counterproductive  it s also hypocritical considering how much money the united states owes to other nations  and  that s not how nato works angering our allies won t help us win the war against terrorism  if anything  it only lets terrorists know that they are succeeding furthermore  while trump was busy humiliating himself and our country  he failed to throw his support behind article   a crucial part of the military alliance with the other nato members that says all members will come to defense of any nato member that comes under attack  in other words  if russia attacked france tomorrow every nato nation would be obligated to come to france s defense  but apparently  trump didn t want to do anything to make vladimir putin angry  trump s silence on article  suggests that he would not come to the defense of any of our allies if they were to be attacked once again  trump proves to be an embarrassment who has turned america into a laughingstock around the globe featured image  screenshot
