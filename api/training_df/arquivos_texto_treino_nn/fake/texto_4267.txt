with  days left to go until election day  a new poll from nbc wall street journal  a gold standard in polling  shows hillary clinton posting an unprecedented double digit lead over donald trump the first major poll since the revelations exposed in a recent audio leak   in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women by grabbing their genitals without consent   shows that not only has clinton posted a  point lead in a head to head contest  she has opened up an  point lead in the four way race with the libertarian candidate gary johnson and the green party s nominee  jill stein because of trump s admission to sexually assaulting women doesn t bode well for voters  the house is now in play   something that no one  just one week ago  thought would be possible  forty nine percent of voters want to see a democratic congress while  percent want to see a gop congress  that s a three point uptick for democrats forty one percent of voters called the tapes  completely unacceptable  and  percent said it should be an issue in the campaign while republicans try desperately to write it off as simple  locker room talk   the electorate isn t buying it and they are actually  reasonably so  disgusted by it the poll also shows that clinton has opened up a  point lead with women  that is a nine point difference than it was in mid september when it was a smaller  yet still significant   point lead remember  john mccain lost the female vote by  points  and mitt romney lost by   both times women made up  percent of the total electorate  you can t lose female voters this  bigly  and win a national election if trump continues to lose by a whopping  points  he s absolutely done with future tapes on the horizon  the trump campaign has pretty much run out of time  republicans are abandoning him  the electorate is abandoning him  and his campaign is crashing and burning featured image via win mcnamee getty images
