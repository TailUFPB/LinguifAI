everyone is in anticipation for thursday because of former fbi director  james comey will be testifying  there is so much anticipation of what he might say or might not say that tv networks are showing countdown clocks to count down when his testimony starts tomorrow  not only this  but people are on twitter tweeting about where are the best places to watch and if they will be offering special morning cocktail drinks for those coming in to watch comey s testimony  if you think this is not enough  it isn t because the senate says the house seating is in full demand  more so than it has been for more than a decade more people anticipating what comey will say during his testimony since being fired from the fbi by donald trump is president trump himself and his aides  they aren t anticipating in a good way  however  they are worried about what he will say and if what he says ends up inflicting not just legal wounds  but political wounds as well apparently  according to comey s co workers and friends  he was shocked to have been fired when he was  he was in shock that he found out about being fired from being the director of the fbi by the television screen  in fact  his associates say that he had no idea he was getting ready to lose his job and was in total shock when he found out  he especially didn t know since he was in the middle of helping with the investigation that was going on about russia s possible interference in the presidential election  comey was almost into a  year term as the fbi director although comey had no idea that he was about to lose his job as the fbi director  he did have some uneasy feelings about the new president  according to his associates  he was primarily concerned about trump since he did want to back off from the investigation going on for michael flynn  the former national security advisor although it may be true that comey may testify about the assumed russian hacking of the presidential election  he may avoid testifying about certain things including the ongoing russian investigation  in fact  legal experts say comey avoiding the current russian investigation makes perfect sense  especially since comey is a former prosecutor and understands full well not to take any steps to complicate the criminal probe featured image by mark wilson getty images
