donald trump has chosen to ignore pride month  but the same can not be said of all politicians  sen  elizabeth warren set the internet on fire this weekend when she was caught on video literally dancing through the streets at the boston pride parade the massachusetts democrat celebrated lgbt pride along with tens of thousands of others at the  annual boston pride parade and the scene could not have been any more perfect  and this is a prime example of exactly why she has become a liberal icon  i love pride   warren says in the short video she posted   it may be my single most favorite day of the year   because it s the day that we all come together and celebrate  go pride  it is worth noting that not only has trump chosen to ignore pride month  but he has decided it isn t even worth a passing mention after the supreme court ruled in favor of marriage equality and after the deadly massacre at pulse  that pretty much says it all right there  doesn t it he claims to be an inclusive leader and has said that he stands by the lgbt community  but clearly  that is not the case  actions speak louder than words  and so far  he has offered neither this month warren  on the other hand  is the polar opposite of trump and that couldn t make us any happier  her joy at this weekend s event was absolutely infectious and the internet just can t get enough of her   or her rainbow feather boa   this is exactly why we liberals love her so much you can see the video of sen  warren dancing along the route of the parade  here i love the boston pride parade  it shows our commonwealth and our country at its best  pic twitter com   elizabeth warren   senwarren  june    image via video screen capture
