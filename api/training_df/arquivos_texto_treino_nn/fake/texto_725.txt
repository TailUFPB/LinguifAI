donald trump is so desperate to take credit for job creation that he ignored the fact that the deal he bragged about takes money away from every person in wisconsin on wednesday  trump made a big deal about a chinese company known as foxconn building a factory in wisconsin that could create up to   jobs thank you foxconn  for investing   billion dollars with the potential for up to  new jobs in wisconsin  madeintheusa   pic twitter com   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july    addition  trump claimed that the deal would not have happened had he not been elected  and went on to suck up to foxconn chairman terry gou  his great company has seen our you know  you see exactly what i m saying our administration s work to remove job killing regulations he s been watching to institute buy american and hire american  and all of those policies  and to pursue the steps necessary to revitalize american industry  including repealing and replacing obamacare we better get that done  fellas  please  it should be pointed out that foxconn was already planning to build a factory in the united states long before trump ever considered running for president but if trump really wants to take credit  that means he is also taking credit for republicans screwing over the people of wisconsin to get the factory to come to their state you see  in exchange for foxconn choosing wisconsin  republican lawmakers and governor scott walker approved a   billion subsidy for the company  according to bloomberg  that amounts to taking   from every man  woman  and child in wisconsin to fund what the milwaukee journal sentinel points out  would total more than the combined yearly state funding used to operate the university of wisconsin system and the state s prison system  and let s remember that we are talking about a private company that is already worth billions  foxconn does not need billions of dollars of government subsidies to expand  they have the money to do it themselves  this amounts to nothing more than foxconn holding the people of wisconsin hostage and republicans letting them and complying with their demands and that is especially disastrous for wisconsin since foxconn is known for promising investments and not delivering as bloomberg reported three years ago  gou signed a deal with the government of jakarta  indonesia s capital and its biggest city  to invest   billion and employ local workers to make electronics  that never happened  neither did a   million high tech factory in pennyslvania that was announced a year earlier  just this past year  foxconn is reported to have pledged investments of   billion in india     billion in kunshan  china  and    billion in guangzhou  it s too early to know if those sums will ever be spent  but including wisconsin  the tally now stands at    billion of commitments  that s more than hon hai  has spent in the last  years so while trump is busy touting the deal to make himself look good  he is doing so at the expense of wisconsin taxpayers  many of whom now have to worry about how they will get by after paying foxconn s ransom featured image via olivier douliery pool getty images
