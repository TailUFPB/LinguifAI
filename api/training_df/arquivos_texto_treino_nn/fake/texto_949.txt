on saturday night  during a speech to honor veterans in washington  donald trump once again perfectly demonstrated what a petulant child he is and how little he cares about the people who sacrificed their lives for this country trump was speaking at the  celebrate freedom rally   where he should have been thanking and praising the veterans in attendance  instead  he completely derailed and went off on one of his characteristically self centered rants  proving that he is incapable of acting presidential and focusing on anything but himself for more than a few minutes while some might hope that trump chose to stop honoring veterans to make an important announcement  most americans know that wasn t what happened  instead  trump stopped his speech to rant about the  fake media  and bragged about how he d won the election  conveniently leaving out the fact that he lost the popular vote by literally millions  no one understands how trump went from commending veterans to talking about the media and his presidency  but here s his awful rant  we will not let them because the people know the truth  the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house but i m president and they re not  the fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far  instead of being subtle and smart  they used a hatchet  and the people saw it right from the beginning  the dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf our great american people  it will never happen  their agenda is not your agenda  considering that trump had spent his entire saturday attacking the press  from cnn to msnbc  he clearly needed to get this out of his system   and it was in extremely poor taste to do it at this event  trump s insensitivity  immaturity and self centeredness continues to embarrass the country  and every american who supported trump should be ashamed  this is not how our veterans should be treated you can watch trump come unhinged below featured image via scott olson   getty images
