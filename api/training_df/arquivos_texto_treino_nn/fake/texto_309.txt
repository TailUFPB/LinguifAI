graham cassidy  the latest and worst in a line of republican healthcare bills collectively dubbed  trumpcare   looks dead  senator susan collins  r me  just joined senators john mccain  r az  and rand paul  r ky  as one of the few to break party lines and refuse to vote for the bill  while not everyone is against the bill for the best of reasons  susan collins could not have been more clear about the many issues she had with the legislation here s her statement  first  both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the medicaid program  expert projections show that more than   trillion would be taken out of the medicaid program between the years  and   this would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for  years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens  including disabled children and low income seniors second  both bills open the door for states to weaken protections for people with pre existing conditions  such as asthma  cancer  heart disease  arthritis  and diabetes  some states could allow higher premiums for individuals with pre existing conditions  potentially making their insurance unaffordable  states could also limit specific categories of benefits for affordable care act policies  such as eliminating coverage for mental health or substance abuse treatment third  physicians  patient advocates  insurers  and hospitals agree that both versions of this legislation would lead to higher premiums and reduced coverage for tens of millions of americans the cbo s analysis on the earlier version of the bill  incomplete though it is due to time constraints  confirms that this bill will have a substantially negative impact on the number of people covered by insurance there has been some discussion that the new version of the bil includes additional money for my home state of maine  the fact is  maine still loses money under whichever version of the graham cassidy bill we consider because the bills use what could be described as a  give with one hand  take with the other  distribution model  huge medicaid cuts down the road more than offset any short term influx of money  but even more important  if senators can adjust a funding formula over a weekend to help a single state  they could just as easily adjust that formula to hurt that state  this is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue that must be handled thoughtfully and fairly for all americans  there you have it   susan collins just hammered the final nail into trumpcare s coffin on september   a special rule allowing republicans to pass legislation with only a simple majority   votes and a tiebreak  will expire  after that  any healthcare legislation that republicans want to pass will have to get at least eight democrats on board republicans can t govern or even get their own party to agree  so good luck with that featured image via alex wong getty images
