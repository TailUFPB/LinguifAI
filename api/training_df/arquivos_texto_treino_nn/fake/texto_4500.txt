a louisiana deputy city marshal is in hot water after body cam footage revealed him shooting at a suspect who had his hands up in the air  this is  sadly  becoming too common a story in the news as awareness of problems with officers who have hair trigger fingers grows  what makes this story sadly and horrifically unique  though  is that deputy derrick stafford also shot and killed the suspect s six year old son and stafford is claiming self defense for that  because of course he is  stafford  out of fear for his life and that of his fellow officers  began shooting at the vehicle to prevent any further actions by  few which would put the officers in imminent danger  officers went after christopher few after watching an argument between him and his girlfriend outside a bar just before the  shooting  they claimed witnessing domestic abuse as the reason they decided to chase down few  whose six year old son  jeremy  was in the front passenger seat  rounds were fired although few had his hands up  but no firearm was found in the car  and few and jeremy were both shot while still in the car  stafford and his partner  norris greenhouse  said that after few drove forward and then backed up  they were in fear for their lives  so they fired that s always the story  though  it makes us wonder just what police departments are teaching that so many officers shoot first and ask questions later  claiming they were in fear for their lives when it s obvious that their suspects were unarmed  and even had their hands in the air reports claim that neither stafford nor greenhouse knew jeremy was in the car when they opened fire  few was critically wounded  and jeremy  who was autistic  non verbal and in a special needs first grade class  was murdered stafford s plea of  self defense  is a huge middle finger to few and the rest of jeremy s grieving family  arguments will be heard in court next week  where judge william bennett will decide whether the indictments stand featured image via louisiana state police facebook page
