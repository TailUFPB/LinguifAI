donald trump hates the press  unless the press is the far right wing rags that kiss his ass nonstop  and report only what he likes  on friday  sean spicer held a press gaggle in his office and included some of those rags  while excluding established media outlets with long histories in the white house  the ap and time magazine boycotted the gaggle in solidarity with the new york times  the los angeles times  cnn and politico cnn and the new york times hit back pretty hard  and the white house correspondents  association likewise hit back  now  with the white house correspondents  dinner coming up in a couple of months  trump is yet again insulting the press  he just announced on twitter he s not going to attend the dinner this year i will not be attending the white house correspondents  association dinner this year  please wish everyone well and have a great evening   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    president generally attends the dinner and gets up onstage to poke fun at himself and everyone in existence  and it s generally hilarious  trump  however  is at war with the press as evidenced not just by spicer s treatment of certain media outlets  but also by his own speech at cpac  where he railed against the  fake news  media he does it all the time on twitter  too  and some press outlets are getting tired of it as far as the dinner  cnn and msnbc have indicated that they might not attend this year  vanity fair and the new yorker have both announced they won t be there  a list of attendees hasn t been published yet  but we can probably expect more outlets to refuse to attend even if trump isn t going to be there featured image by olivier douliery via getty images
