back in may  republicans in broward county elected rupert tarsey secretary of their gop affiliate  little did they know they had actually elected rupert ditsworth  a former student at la s harvard westlake school  a    per year preparatory academy in california  more than a decade ago  ditsworth attacked a fellow student at h w  elizabeth barcay  hitting her over the head at least  times with a claw hammer after a date to jamba juice gone awry  before dumping her out of the car and fleeing after the attempted murder  ditsworth s parents enlisted a psychiatrist to try and suss out why their son may have beaten a girl within an inch of her life  no word on whether the shrink was any use  other than that rupert still claims he was defending himself and went on to work on the trump presidential campaign before running for election to the broward gop so that s a no now florida republicans are understandably freaking out  the fort lauderdale area is largely democratic  and having a party secretary who once split open the skull of a high school girl tends to cast an organization in a dim light tarsey  as rupert is now known  doesn t see what the problem is  he sat down for an exclusive interview with dailymail com at his   million beachfront condo  why should i resign  i did nothing wrong and i was elected  this is just party politics  tarsey insists his name change has nothing to do with his horrific attack on a defenseless young woman with a deadly weapon   i m estranged from my dad   tarsey says  perhaps the broken skull  nose  and leg that the girl suffered at the hands of his  foot  son explains why dear old dad may have created some distance between them the chair of the broward gop  bob sutton  was apoplectic  we were blindsided  he s a member of the knights of columbus for christ s sake  and he came highly recommended by the former chair we had no idea what his background is  we want him out but he is refusing to resign  he deceived us  it looks like he even used a reputation management firm to make sure we wouldn t find out who he is  it really is a shame that republicans aren t better at figuring out that members of their party are horrible monsters  perhaps if they started with the racists  sexists  and homophobes  they might get better at spotting the guys with the claw hammers in their closets featured image via screen capture
