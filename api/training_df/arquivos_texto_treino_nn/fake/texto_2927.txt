the first thing that donald trump had planned on doing upon taking office was issue a bunch of executive orders canceling a bunch of executive orders  that s one promise he s making good on already  but rescinding a lot of things obama did will harm a lot of people during obama s last week in office  he announced a reduction in fha fees from   percent to   percent  that may not sound like a lot  but given that mortgages are in the hundreds of thousands  that reduction can actually provide some relief to low income and first time borrowers  that s what trump has canceled the department of housing and urban development is now under the auspices of the less than experienced and intelligent ben carson  who was disappointed that obama didn t consult him about this  he was also disappointed that obama and the fha announced it so close to the end of his presidency which is  of course  ridiculous   until obama had officially left office and trump was officially sworn in  he could continue his work as the leader of this country  but republicans have spent the last year acting like a president has no right to act during his entire last year of office  though  so of course carson was upset republicans claim that lowering those rates will hurt taxpayers because it will hurt funding for the fha  from the group that wants to destroy the mortgage interest deduction homeowners claim on their taxes  though  that s rich  in reality  this is another attack on the poor and the young it s important to note that what the fha program does is provide insurance for mortgages  rather than doing the actual loans themselves  on a    home  the annual fee is     the reduction obama wanted would have reduced that to     an extra   per year doesn t sound like much  but for both low income and first time homebuyers  that extra   can go a very long way what does trump and his administration care  though  their logic very likely boils down to   if you can t afford to buy  then just freaking rent  it s not that hard   well  actually  yes it is in many markets where average rents are higher than average mortgages  in fact  in august   monthly rents were higher than monthly mortgage payments in markets across  states housing groups were divided on this  but many did want obama s reduction because they believed it could have helped spur some home buying  without that reduction  though  there will be fewer low income people who can afford a loan  and will have trouble affording to rent housing too  that can push them into worse areas with fewer jobs  and it s a downward spiral thanks  trump featured image by alex wong via getty images
