neo nazis and white supremacists gathered in pikeville  kentucky yesterday  they were met by scores of protesters who booed the group  approximately  members of the traditionalist workers party  the league of the south and the national socialist movement were heavily armed when they gathered at the courthouse in town pike county is a very white place  at least  percent of the people who live there are white  the area also went heavily for president donald trump  eighty percent of the people there voted for trump  these are the reasons that pikeville was selected for the rally  the neo nazis and white supremacists are looking to become more politically relevant  they picked the area because they thought their message would appeal to the working class people who live there pikeville residents wanted no part of the message the rally organizers were trying to spread  most of the rally supporters are not from pikevillee  lifelong pikeville resident  elizabeth white said   we have no clue why they would even pick pickville  why don t they go disrespect their own homes  their own people  their own families  we need trump to tell them to go back to their own place  there had been a lot of concern about the rally as recent protests around the country have turned violent  one protester was shot in the abdomen at an event in seattle  several people were stabbed at another event in sacramento  unlike washington and california  which have strict gun control laws  kentucky residents are allowed to carry weapons  organizers of the pikeville protest said beforehand that their people would be heavily armed  that led some to be concerned that violence at the protest could turn deadly luckily  none of that happened  the three hour rally included harsh words from both sides but was peaceful  as the protesters left town  people protesting the protest shouted   get the fuck out  get the fuck out and stay the fuck out  you are not welcome here  featured image via nick wagner
