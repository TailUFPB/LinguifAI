it is no secret that president donald trump et al had no idea what they were getting into when they took over the white house in january  despite announcing   in theory i could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly    he made this comment last november  team trump seems barely able to find their way to work every day  as the  day mark looms  it seems white house staffers are starting to get the enormity of the job politico interviewed numerous people within the administration to get their take on how things are going within the administration  perhaps one aide put it best when he said this   i kind of pooh poohed the experience stuff when i first got here but this shit is hard  for his part  trump does not seem to understand the scope of some of his failures  such as with health care reform or his inability to have any major legislation passed but it looks like the people around him are starting to get it  they are in a tough spot  they have to do their jobs to the best of their ability but are hampered by a president who refuses to give up any of his free time and puts more stock in opinions he sees on cable news than what he gets in his security briefings this has forced trump s aides to change their tactics  one high level official told politico  you don t walk in with a traditional presentation  like a binder or a powerpoint  he doesn t care  he doesn t consume information that way  you go in and tell him the pros and cons  and what the media coverage is going to be like  one big hurdle white house staffers face is how to control trump  one person who is close to the administration said   it s not like the white house doesn t have a plan to fill his time productively but at the end of the day he s in charge of his schedule  he does not like being managed  despite the possibility that the white house staffers are more aware of the challenges they face  some upsetting facts remain  many high level positions remain unfilled  neither secretary of state rex tillerson nor secretary of defense james mattis have deputies  most ambassadorships are empty  the problem is not just that team trump doesn t know how to deal with congress  it s that they simply do not know how to govern featured image via mark wilson getty images
