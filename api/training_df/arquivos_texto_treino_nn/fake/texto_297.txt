as if trump calling for a private organization to fire people who refuse to stand for the national anthem wasn t bad enough  it now seems that some high schools have decided to follow his dangerous lead  parkway high school  in bossier  louisiana  will start punishing football players who won t stand for the national anthem  they could face less playing time or getting kicked off the team entirely waylon bates  parkway s principal  says that they  require students to stand in a respectful manner throughout the national anthem during any sporting event in which their team is participating  failure to comply will result in loss of playing time and or participation as directed by the head coach and principal  continued failure to comply will result in removal from the team  parkway high school is committed to creating a positive environment for sporting events that is free of disruption to the athletic contest or game  and it has begun high schools are now following trump s order will kick off any players who don t stand during the national anthem  pic twitter com   shaun king   shaunking  september    news says that bates is trying to keep politics out of his schools athletics  he accomplished the exact opposite with this letter  though  in fact  there s a chance now that this will only spur black athletes and their allies to do exactly what bates does not want them doing evidently  the louisiana high school athletic association allows schools to set their own rules about this kind of thing  so other high schools may or may not follow suit here  but the school doesn t seem to care about anything except forcing students to worship the flag  this is one of the replies to shaun king s tweet called them  said constitution doesn t apply to extracurricular activities  seriously  they said that   tdport   tdport  september    bad for the school that case law seems to be on the side of any students who wish protest  well  anything by not standing for the national anthem  almost  years ago  in the midst of wwii  the supreme court delivered a   decision stating that public school systems cannot require students to salute the flag in west virginia state board of education et al v  barnette et al  this decision reversed an earlier scotus decision upholding the ability of schools and districts to do that exact thing this case is generally seen in the context that requiring students to salute the flag can be a violation of religious principles since the plaintiffs were jehovah s witnesses  their religion prohibits them from saluting symbols  the majority opinion  however  barely even mentions religious freedom  justice jackson  writing for the majority in west virginia board of ed v  barnette  tied this to other freedoms protected in the bill of rights  rather than making it about religious expression  he held that  freedoms of speech and of press  of assembly  and of worship may not be infringed  slender grounds   and wrote  censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the state is empowered to prevent and publish  it would seem that involuntary affirmation could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence  in this case  jackson believed that silence didn t  create a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression   and said  to sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a bill of rights which guards the individual s right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind  justice jackson essentially turned the case into one where the government tries to establish its own religion and tries to force its own views onto people  in that case  children  and it could be seen this way in parkway s case  too  since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag  the school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes  stand during the national anthem or else trump set off a firestorm by calling for nfl owners to fire players who sit or kneel  or stay in the locker room  during the national anthem  despite the backlash  he s doubled down  and tripled down  and quadrupled down on it  spending a lot of time on twitter slamming the nfl and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests  to say nothing of his continued slights to puerto rico  which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back to back powerful hurricanes  and now  high schools are starting to weigh in  and it may well be illegal for them to do so  despite sports being extra curricular  this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol  and parkway high school s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill advised letter violating the first amendment rights of students featured image via mark wilson getty images
