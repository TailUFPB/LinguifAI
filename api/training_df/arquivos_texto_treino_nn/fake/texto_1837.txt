congressman steve king  r ia  is pretty much the most openly racist person sitting in congress  he recently came under fire for tweeting openly white supremacist sentiments about  western civilization  and not being able to restore it with  somebody else s babies   here is that awful tweet wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  https   t co   steve king   stevekingia  march     he is giving donald trump a warning about sidelining white supremacist steve bannon in the white house in favor of more left leaning advisers like trump s daughter ivanka and her husband jared kushner  this warning comes because word on the street is that there is a battle brewing between bannon and kushner  and it seems that bannon is losing big time  in fact  bannon may indeed be on his way out well  this is not sitting well with the white supremacists who have championed trump so long and so hard  and indeed were instrumental in putting him into the white house  they even deliberately trended  firekushner to send a message to trump about where his priorities should lie  rep  king chimed in with similar sentiments sunday night  tweeting at trump  realdonaldtrump steve bannon is the lynchpin to your energized base  conservatives are an endangered species in your white house   steve king   stevekingia  april     in other words  king is warning trump that if he gives in to what the alt right  read  white supremacists  call ivanka and jared s  globalist  leanings and policies  he s finished and his base will turn on him  this is probably true  however  the idea that trump would pick bannon in a showdown between the former breitbart head and his daughter and son in law is downright laughable  so  suck it  steve king  you won t be getting your way on this one if the bannon v  kushner feud continues  bannon will be pushed out  and there will be marginally more reasonable people who have trump s ear  the side effect will be a betrayed and outraged alt right and conservative base  which will ensure donald trump s defeat in   along with his feuding with the republicans on capitol hill who will surely not bow to his daughter and son in law s largely democratic policies so  bad for republicans and trump world  great for america featured image via scott olson getty images
