one of the problems that republicans have is what to do about the white nationalists that are taking over the conservative movement  including the kkk and the neo nazis that have come out of the woodwork since trump began his run for the white house  some of them are just trying to ignore it  and some are trying to claim that these groups aren t all that bad when you consider that democrats were once the party of slavery  today s republicans are those democrats  actually   so they re the true racists here and then you have idiots like the executive director of the american conservative union  dan schneider  who says that the so called  alt right  is really the fascist left speaking at cpac  he told an audience full of conservatives  there is a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks and we must not be duped  just a few years ago  this hate filled left wing fascist group hijacked the very term  alt right   that term has been used for a long time in a very good and normal way  he s right  it s a  sinister organization trying to worm its way into  their ranks  but it s really a fascist left wing movement well  let s look at this  the  alt right  has always been a conservative movement  it was actually conservative opposition to george w  bush over his foreign policy  these were people who believed that w  was a liberal in conservatives  clothing who had betrayed them with his policies they originally had some of everything   reagan republicans  anti immigration hawks  libertarians  and even monarchists  and yes  white nationalists  but it wasn t like the left saw an opening  or saw cracks in the movement  and took advantage of them  it was richard spencer himself who  during his evolution from a conservative into one of the worst white supremacists we ve got  ultimately hijacked the term and turned it into an anti semitic  white nationalist movement but since this movement now has the door it needs to shove itself into the mainstream via president asterisk  increasing numbers of republicans are trying to find ways to distance themselves from that kind of hate  at the same time  some obviously see an opportunity to use it to demonize the left  which riles up a different kind of hate schneider also said  they are anti semites  they are racist  they are sexist  they hate the constitution  they hate free markets  they hate pluralism  they hate everything and despite everything we believe in  all of that is true  but they grew out of the conservative right  not the left  but maybe he s another one of the many ignorant conservatives who believe that today s democrats are the democrats who fought for slavery when you have an entire movement willing to tolerate people like steve bannon  milo yiannopoulos  steve miller and even trump himself  shucking responsibility for that movement is antithetical to the conservative idea of  personal responsibility   the gop needs to look in a mirror if they want to find an answer to the so called  alt right  featured image by kirk irwin via getty images for siriusxm
