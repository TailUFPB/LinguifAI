the average american makes about    a year   and too many americans scrape by on much less  so how much does trump pay his staff  according to the public filing of payroll released by the white house  an absurd amount  apparently since taking office  trump has staffed his white house with a number of unquestionably unqualified people   including former reality tv stars  his only job requirement is that they be loyal to him   and he measures that loyalty in how well they lie for him on television  the most opportunistic of his staff has risen to that challenge and he subsequently paid them handsomely for the job  of trump s staff  a few people stick out for the ridiculous amount of money they make for doing  essentially  nothing omarosa  who was hired by trump because she appeared on  the apprentice  with him  makes    per year  it s entirely unclear what she does exactly  likewise with scandal laden seb gorka  who gets paid    but legally can t do the job trump hired him for because he s so shady that intelligence officials wouldn t give him security clearance  instead  he hangs out at the white house and collects a paycheck kellyanne conway and sean spicer both get paid the same    that omarosa does  but that money covers not only their jobs and expenses but also their human dignity  both trump staffers are required to repeatedly and shamelessly lie and defend trump no matter what indefensible thing he said or did  spicer at least has the decency to look like the toll is killing him inside  conway appears to actually enjoy the dishonesty  and one suspects she would probably do the job for free if she had to hilariously  former fox news host k t  macfarlane gets paid the same amount that trump s top staff does  including reince priebus  she has been sidelined since her friend michael flynn was booted from his job and his replacement  h r  mcmasters told trump he wouldn t take the job unless she was removed  now she putters around the white house under the vague title  assistant to the president  doing who knows what  for that  she earns    the release of the white house payroll only goes to show just how cartoonish trump s administration is  filled with disgraced lobbyists  fox news hosts  former reality tv stars  and a variety of other opportunistic liars  it s no wonder the white house barely functions and is plagued with in fighting  backstabbing  and scandals  it turns out  if you hire a bunch of clowns  the west wing can fit an awful lot of them inside  each cashing a paycheck for more than many americans make in three years of work featured image via win mcnamee getty images
