donald trump finally held his first solo press conference on thursday and it did not go well at all in fact  it was a complete and total disaster and an embarrassment throughout his remarks  trump peppered the press and the american people with lie after lie his principle target  of course  was the media  which he again accused of being  dishonest  the press has become so dishonest that if we don t talk about it  we are doing a tremendous disservice to the american people   trump said   tremendous disservice  we have to talk about it  we have to find out what s going on because the press  honestly  is out of control  the level of dishonesty is out of control  i ran for president to represent the citizens of our country  i am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well  i am talking  and really talking  on this very entrenched power structure and what we re doing is we re talking about the power structure  we re talking about its entrenchment  as a result  the media s going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort   not all the time   and some of the media s fantastic  i have to say  honest and fantastic   but much of it is not  the distortion  and we ll talk about it  you ll be able to ask me questions about it  we re not going to let it happen because i m here  again  to take my message straight to the people trump went on to claim that he inherited a  mess  from president obama and portrayed the world as an apocalyptic wasteland that only he can fix and then he bragged about his electoral college win again as some sort of proof that the american people love him i put it out before the american people  got  electoral college votes  i wasn t supposed to get   they said there s no way to get    is impossible    which you need   that was laughable  we got   because people came out and voted like they have never seen before  so that s the it goes  i guess it was the biggest electoral college win since ronald reagan  in other words  the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made  and they are not happy about it for whatever reason trump s press conference was a dumpster fire of lies  and nbc reporter peter alexander stepped up to the plate and called trump out  you said today that you had the biggest electoral margin since ronald reagan   alexander began  he then proceeded to list president obama s two electoral victories which were far bigger than trump s in  trump then claimed that he was talking about republican presidential wins overall  trump s win is one of the smallest on record and he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes faced with the facts and caught in a lie  trump was asked  why should americans trust you  trump claimed that he was given the information  suggesting that he was just reading remarks that someone told him to read alexander repeated his question and added to it  why should americans trust you when you accuse the information they receive as being fake when you re providing information that s fake   he asked all trump could say in response was  i don t know  here s the video via youtube clearly  donald trump doesn t know how to do anything except lie  and this is why we have a free press to call him out for it featured image via screenshot
