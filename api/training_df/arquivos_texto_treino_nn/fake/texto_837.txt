well  it seems that despite the efforts of notoriously crafty senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  the gop s massive tax cut for the rich healthcare bill is dead for now  senator john mccain  r az   is out for emergency surgery   we wish him well  of course    and senator susan collins  r me  and senator rand paul  r ky  were already hard  no   votes  then  late monday night  senators mike lee  r ut  and jerry moran  r ks  came out against the bill as well  each senator had his or her own reasons for opposing mcconnell  but those reasons matter not for now  the votes to pass this disastrous piece of legislation simply are not there of course  upon hearing that he was  once again about to be humiliated on one of his signature campaign promises  donald trump took to twitter to fume about the bill s failure in the senate  he tweeted that he wants to simply repeal the affordable care act now and rip healthcare away from millions  he also said the unthinkable in this hyper partisan environment  work with democrats  here is his tweet republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now   work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate  dems will join in   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  july     we all know that mcconnell knows that trump is a fool  and he will likely not heed anything trump has to say  but this just goes to show two things    republicans cannot govern their way out of a paper bag  even when they control the entire government  and   trump  once again  shows poor impulse control on twitter  as well as a woefully inept understanding of the workings on the legislative branch of the government he now supposedly runs either way  these tweets are whiny  pathetic  and like something you d see from a child  oh well  elect a child  expect tantrums featured image via mark wilson getty images
