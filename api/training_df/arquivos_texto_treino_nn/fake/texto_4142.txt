most americans wish that the  presidential election were already over  but we all have to wait three more weeks  which means hearing more claims from trump that the election is rigged against him  the republican nominee has been making such claims since the conventions for both parties ended in july and hillary clinton came out with a large lead over him he has accused the media and the clinton campaign of colluding to fix the election in hillary s favor and is urging his supporters to go to polling places on election day to intimidate voters  trump has drilled his rhetoric about election rigging into his supporters  heads so deep that many of them are already threatening bloody violence and the assassination of hillary clinton if she wins well  president obama has had enough of trump s bullshit whining  and he slammed him for it during a white house news conference on tuesday calling trump s claims  irresponsible   president obama pointed out that trump s whining  doesn t show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president  president obama addressed the absurdity of trump s claim by noting that america s election system is decentralized  which means elections are run by local and state governments  and that there are way too many votes being cast across  states that it s impossible to rig an election indeed  over  million americans voted in  and a comprehensive study concluded in  that out of one billion votes cast since   only  credible cases of voter fraud were found so trump s claim that the election is rigged has no historical evidence to suggest election rigging has occurred in the past  and president obama declared that such claims are unprecedented i have never seen in my lifetime  or in modern political history  any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place  it s unprecedented   obama said   it happens to be based on no facts  trump  started whining before the game is even over   obama continued   i d advise mr  trump to stop whining  and go try to make his case to get votes  president obama then took the high road by saying that if trump wins on november  he will meet with him at the white house like an adult and escort him to his inauguration for a peaceful transfer of power  and that is the total opposite of what trump and his supporters say they will do if hillary clinton is the winner here s the video via youtube donald trump is a threat to our democracy  his repeated claims that the election is rigged is making his supporters paranoid and bloodthirsty  as president obama said  trump must congratulate hillary clinton if he loses and concede defeat gracefully  calling the results rigged and refusing to admit defeat would only hurt our democratic process and could result in violence and chaos  especially if his supporters try to overthrow the federal government if that happens  trump and his supporters should be arrested and charged with committing treason against the united states  period for now  trump needs to stop whining and abandon his rhetoric about rigged elections  it s not helping him  he s only embarrassing himself and making himself look even more unfit to be president featured image via screenshot
