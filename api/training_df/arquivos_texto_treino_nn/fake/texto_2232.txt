while we re focused on the ridiculous donald trump tweets or the equally ridiculous obamacare replacement bill  republicans are debating a bill that would put us at the total mercy of corporations  no matter what they do currently  there are a few bills in the house and in the senate  which are different  but identical in one way  they both strip us of our right to free speech  and  well  they do both put to rest the idea that republicans are for the  free market  there s h r    the fairness in class action litigation act that rep  bob goodlatte  va  introduced in early february it would place a slew of new restrictions on class action lawsuits  like barring judges from certifying a class action where the lawyer representing the plaintiffs is in anyway related to anyone in that plaintiff class  not just familial relations either  if the attorney has any sort of working relationship with a class member outside of that particular lawsuit  the case would be shut down source  consumeristthink about that for a moment  while corporations might have in house council or their usual team of lawyers to represent them  we  as consumers  would not be allowed to work with an attorney that anyone in the class action suit had worked with  or had known  before  since most consumers don t have an army of attorneys at their disposal  this gives a serious advantage to the corporations other bills introduced in recent weeks by gop lawmakers seek to limit more specific types of legal claims  one piece of legislation could make it more difficult for victims of asbestos to collect their claim by imposing new paperwork requirements on the trusts administering these funds  another bill would preempt state medical malpractice laws and cap non financial damages at    democrats  thankfully  are attempting to expand consumer rights one bill  by our current hero al franken  d mn   would allow us to sue corporations instead of being forced into arbitration   typically with the arbiter chosen by the corporation sen  patrick leahy  d vt  has a similar bill  which would ensure that states follow state and federal laws for example  airbnb was recently able to compel arbitration in a lawsuit alleging violations of federal civil rights laws  and wells fargo is trying to sidestep a massive consumer fraud lawsuit by compelling the cases into arbitration  when americans enter into agreements to obtain cellphone service  rent an apartment  or accept a new job  most are not made aware of the forced arbitration clauses that are tucked away in the legal fine print   said leahy   but these dangerous provisions force us to abandon our constitutional right to protect ourselves in court  and instead send hardworking americans to face wealthy corporations behind closed doors in private arbitration  while all of these binding arbitration and these restrictions on how complaints can be addressed are completely anti consumer  the one that should be called a violation of our most basic rights to free speech are non disclosure agreements  which even republicans should object to  in fact  one republican  former fox host gretchen carlson  objects strongly  since she was a plaintiff in a sexual harassment suit against her former employer  arbitration silences millions of other survivors who might have come forward if they knew they weren t alone   said carlson  who contends that this should not be a partisan issue   harassers come from all political parties  she s right and the party that favors the free market should agree  the only way a free market could even begin to work is if consumers have all the information that s available  by silencing consumers  we are not only violating the first amendment rights  we are leaving it open for future consumers to be hurt in the exact same way silencing consumers in favor of corporations isn t exactly new  but it s a huge step toward fascism  strengthening those laws aren t good for small businesses  and they are horrible for the consumer  and as with any fascist country  corporations are king featured image of rep  bob goodlatte  r va  via chip somodevilla getty images
