republicans are already touting their intention to dismantle medicare and donald trump is poised to be the rubber stamp  but democrats are prepared to do whatever it takes to stop them house speaker paul ryan has been waiting for a puppet president to come along for a long time now so that he can get his plan to kill medicare signed into law now he has one  and has made little effort to hide his intention to target medicare on the first day trump takes office ryan s plan would privatize medicare  which basically means he would give it to wall street and turn it into a voucher system  medicare itself would whither of the vine and die and anyone who is on medicare or looked forward to it would be shit out of luck because they would get less care at higher prices on tuesday  kellyanne conway even signaled that trump will consider ryan s proposal to gut medicare  he will  i m sure  take a look at speaker ryan s proposal and other proposals   conway said   in this case  he will go ahead and look at alternatives  well  if republicans thought they would be able to just jam through whatever laws they want  they are gravely mistaken incoming senate minority leader chuck schumer fired a warning shot at the gop on friday making it clear that democrats will fight tooth and nail to block any republican bill that dismantles the popular healthcare program that has been working perfectly since  when it was enacted  the republicans  ideological and visceral hatred of government could deny millions of senior citizens across the country the care they need and deserve   schumer said   to our republican colleagues considering this path  democrats say   make our day   your effort will fail  and this attack on our seniors will not stand  nancy pelosi chimed in with a warning of her own  it s ideological with the speaker to take away the guarantee of medicare   she said   but  is a fundamental pillar of health and economic security  and we will not go down that path  in short  democrats in the house and senate are prepared to to obstruct republicans in the same way they obstructed president obama over the last eight years  and that s exactly what democrats need to do  they need to more vicious and uncooperative than republicans ever were  it s time to give them a taste of their own medicine for america s sake  anything less should be punished harshly when the midterm elections roll around in   so democrats better hold the line and fiercely defend america s social contract or they can expect primary challenges  there is absolutely no excuse for democrats to treat trump better than republicans treated president obama  in fact  there is every reason to treat him worse  the future of our country depends on it featured image  zach gibson getty images
