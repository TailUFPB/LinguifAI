for the first time since taking office  donald trump will be reunited with vladimir putin and he s very excited about it  his advisors  however  are not  they are shaking in their boots at the idea that trump will go overboard in exuberance and potentially implicate himself  and presumably some of them  in collusion while trump is cutting off media access in many areas  including with a camera and audio blackout at press briefings  for the meeting with putin  he wants the media to see it all  his advisors are pushing for something much more low key and even for something that doesn t involve trump at all trump and some others within his administration have been pressing for a full bilateral meeting  he s calling for media access and all the typical protocol associated with such sessions  even as officials within the state department and national security council urge more restraint  according to a current and a former administration official some advisers have recommended that the president instead do either a quick  informal  pull aside  on the sidelines of the summit  or that the u s  and russian delegations hold  strategic stability talks   which typically don t involve the presidents  the officials spoke anonymously to discuss private policy discussions source  associated presstrump s goal for the meeting is particularly troubling  he wants to roll back all the obama era sanctions on russia and would like to partner with them in syria  despite the fact that russia is on the wrong side of a rebellion against bashar al assad s brutal  dictatorial regime  assad  as you may recall  used chemical weapons against his own people those optics aren t what trump s advisors are afraid of  though  they are afraid that trump will be  well trump  a man who has no verbal filter there are big risks  though  trump is known to veer off script  creating the possibility for a high stakes diplomatic blunder  in a brief oval office meeting with top russian diplomats last month  trump revealed highly classified information about an islamic state group threat to airlines that was relayed to him by israel  according to a senior administration official  the white house defended the disclosures as  wholly appropriate  in other words  it s entirely within the realm of possibility that trump will hug putin and thank him  in front of cameras  for all his help during the election  remember when trump met with the russian ambassador and spy chief in the white house  it was about the happiest we ve ever seen him hard facts  last april trump promised russia s ambassador a  good deal   hacking began  kislyak asked for an end to sanctions  trump   yes   pic twitter com   seth abramson   sethabramson  june    s pretty clear that trump can t contain his giddiness over his country crush  that s bad enough  imagine how terrified his advisors are at the idea that trump may one day have to testify in front of congress or a judge  for the rest of us  though  the meeting could be the moment trump seals his own fate featured image via sean gallup getty images
