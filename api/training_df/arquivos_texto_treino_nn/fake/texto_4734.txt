the morning joe panel just nailed donald trump to the wall the republican nominee and florida attorney general pam bondi have denied that that there was any pay to play going on between them when he made a sizable donation to her before she killed the case the trump university in her state trump donated    to bondi via his  charity   which is illegal and resulted in a    fine from the irs  bondi dropped the case  and then trump held a discounted fundraiser for her at his mar a lago resort definitely sounds fishy  doesn t it  that s especially true when you consider that trump has bragged about paying politicians to do his bidding and the morning joe crew had absolutely no problem talking about that history of foot in mouth disease on wednesday  trump has said in the past that he gave money to politicians for favors   mark halperin said before calling on trump and bondi to release any and all documents pertaining to the donation to prove there was no quid pro quo  to put this to rest  he should put out all of the documentation from his office  how did this contribution come to be made  where s the paperwork  where are the emails  where are the memos that say   hey  let s  right now  give pam bondi some money  by the way improperly through our charity   and  pam bondi s office should put out all the internal emails from her office that talk about the decision not to make him part of the litigation  maybe there s not any connection  but the onus is on them now  it s a strange bit of timing  because  again  trump has bragged   halperin continued   this is what he did  he gave money to politicians in order to control his decisions to get favorable results  and he said that s how he succeeded  mika brzezinski then jumped in and noted that the timeline is incredibly suspicious before confirming halperin s remarks about trump having a history of paying lawmakers for favors  you can see a timeline and a direct result of the money   brzezinski said  which is what he says he does with money  he buys people off  he makes deals  and he got a deal to not be investigated in an area where he has a real weak spot and that s trump university  i ve never seen a campaign and a family get more defensive than when you bring up trump university because they have a weak spot there  mika went on to say that it is a weak spot because there are so many people who have been scammed by trump university here s the video via twitter trump denies political motives behind fl atty  gen  donation   morningmika  trump university is  a real weak spot  https   t co mnmesaihxx  morning joe   morningjoe  september    that s not all later on in the show brzezinski actually laid out the timeline of trump s donation and bondi s subsequent dropping of the case against trump university brzezinski noted that as bad of some of the accusations against hillary look  there are no connection  dot to dot  like there are on this trump scandal  the  donation by the donald j  trump foundation was made four days after it was announced that bondi said she was considering joining new york state s investigation into trump university   she reported the panel went on to explain that this is why donald trump should be forced to hand over his tax returns because they would show all of trump s shady financial dealings over the years here s the video via youtube it s time for the irs to end the audit of trump s tax returns so that he no longer has that silly excuse to use  but trump s pay to play scandal with pam bondi proves that he is untrustworthy and will likely use the government to help himself if he should become president  this kind of corruption should concern all voters  which makes it all the more amazing that trump isn t losing by a wider margin  apparently  conservatives like their presidents corrupt and ignorant featured image via screen capture
