democrats appear to be completely fed up with donald trump s bizarre conspiracy theory where he alleges   without evidence   that the presidential election will be  rigged   trump has also called on his supporters to show up in minority heavy voting precincts in a move that many believe is an attempt to suppress the vote  to  rig  things in his favor now democrats are suing the republicans the democratic national committee is suing the republican national committee for aiding gop nominee donald trump as he argues that the presidential election is  rigged   claiming that trump s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities the suit  filed wednesday in us district court in new jersey  argues that the rnc has not sufficiently rebuked trump for the line of attack  which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on election day the democrats argue in the filing that  trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the november  election will be  rigged  based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in  certain areas  or  certain sections  of key states  republicans are still bound under a consent decree due to a previous court case  which limits their ability to officially send people to polling stations to intimidate voters  at the same time  outside fringe right wing armed militia groups like  the oath keepers  have recently sent out calls to patrol voting booths on trump s behalf knowing how vital the votes of latinos  blacks  and others are to democratic hopes   especially with president obama off the ballot   republicans appear to be highly invested in any and all schemes focused on cutting down the number of voters  if they can suppress minority turnout  which has always been anti republican but could now form the foundation of a landslide  republicans think they could pull out a  tainted  victory featured image via flickr
