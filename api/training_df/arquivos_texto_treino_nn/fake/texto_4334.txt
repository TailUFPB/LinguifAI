the list of people gop presidential candidate donald trump hasn t insulted keeps getting shorter and shorter  we know he regularly insults women and muslims and latinos and immigrants and african americans  earlier in the week  he insulted veterans  he s mocked the disabled  and his latest tactless comment was directed toward literally on their death beds in a rally in nevada on wednesday  trump begged those who were dying to vote for him  yes  those who were dying i don t care how sick you are  i don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis  meaning it s over  you won t be around in two weeks  doesn t matter  hang out till november   get out and vote  then  trump said he was kidding not kidding mr trump added   i say kiddingly  but i mean it  he also reassured dying people that after they are gone   all we re going to say is   we love you and we will remember you always  here s the video people are not happy one terminally ill person did respond  and it wasn t to support trump this one pretty much gets to the heart of it  or the lack of heart of trump  as deeply offensive as this is  especially for anyone who either is sick or those who take care of the sick  there is a bit of refreshing honesty in trump s joke not joke   i don t care  is perhaps the most truthful line he s uttered during his campaign full of lies  he genuinely doesn t care if people are sick  he doesn t care if people are suffering  he doesn t care if people are poor  he doesn t care about people at all donald trump has a compulsive need for constant validation  he received fawning validation on the apprentice  now  he s taken his show to the american public and he expects the same from us  it s easy to imagine that trump loves the idea of people dragging themselves from their death beds to do one last thing  pull the lever for donald trump  what greater ego validation is there featured image via ethan miller getty images
