for the past week since trump struck one of his alleged  solid gold  deals to keep carrier from moving to mexico  we ve seen what is probably the most pathetic victory lap from a president elect in u s  history  between lying through his teeth about what the deal entailed  then unleashing multiple twitter rants targeting carrier s union president when he was called out on it  his behavior has not been what most would consider presidential  to say the least thursday night  during his segment  a closer look   seth meyers took the opportunity to dig deep into the deceptive carrier deal and discovered that hardly any of what trump is bragging about adds up  so trump first claimed he would stop carrier from moving jobs to mexico  then claimed he was saving over   jobs and then it turned out he was saving only  which the washington post reports is just  percent of the total who were due to leave the state  meyers points out that while saving those  jobs is likely a big relief to the families of those workers  it isn t nearly good enough compared to what was promised   and to add to that  the hypocrisy from the right regarding this so called deal is astounding  despite its many flaws  there s no denying the deal was politically popular  but for republicans  what s so surprising about this new policy of strong arming companies into making business decisions is that the gop has spent eight years calling obama a  socialist  for his economic policies  remember how they reacted to the auto bailout  which saved as many as   million jobs  they accused him of coercion and hijacking capitalism  well  as you might have guessed  they see the carrier deal a little differently  watch it all unfold here featured image via video screenshot
