yesterday  the new york times ran a story in which they gave moving accounts of two women who say that donald trump sexually assaulted them  trump maintains that his boasts about being allowed to assault women because he s got star power were just words  and that he s never done such a thing  in a sorry attempt to maintain the illusion that he s a good person  trump has had his lawyers send the times an official cease and desist  claiming the story amounts to libel the strange thing is that the bulk of this letter appears to be directed at the women that the times spoke to than it is to the times itself  ou apparently performed an entirely inadequate investigation to test the veracity of these false and malicious allegations  including why these two individuals waited  in one case   years  and  in another case  more than three decades  before deciding to come forward with these false and defamatory statements  and there it is  assassinating the characters of the victims by saying that  if they d really been assaulted sexually  they d have come forward right away  is a very typical ploy for those trying to defend themselves against such allegations  but there s still nothing in there about what  specifically  is false in the times  story and how they know the times knowingly published a false story trump s victims could all find their names and characters dragged through the mud because of this  and make no mistake  he will do that as loudly as he can  the fear of having that happen  and of not being believed  keeps many sexual assault victims from coming forward and that could easily be why trump is doing this  however  his method appears to be two fold  in addition to intimidating and bullying his victims  he s also intimidating and bullying press outlets  the hope there would be that they won t give a voice to any more of his victims out of fear of getting sued this isn t the only absurdity in the letter  but it is the most damning  given its possible intent  the letter also makes it political instead of naming specific falsehoods  which is outright ridiculous if this is a serious cease and desist  your article is reckless  defamatory and constitutes libel per se  it is apparent from  among other things  the timing of the article  that it is nothing more than a politically motivated effort to defeat mr  trump s candidacy clearly  the new york times is willing to provide a platform to anyone wishing to smear mr  trump s name and reputation prior to the election irrespective of whether the alleged statements have any basis in fact  really  that s a hell of a thing to say in a cease and desist  the letter itself is politically motivated   it s actually quite difficult to believe that an actual lawyer wrote this baloney  here s what a strong cease and desist letter should contain  and this is a template of a decent cease and desist  this idiocy meets none of the conditions it needs to cnnmoney reports that trump has also threatened the palm beach post for publishing a separate story from yet another victim  besides that  the trump campaign told times reporter megan twohey that he would sue if they published the story  she received her own letter yesterday afternoon and was called a  disgusting human being  a lawsuit against the times would uncover everything and probably sink trump entirely  because these allegations are the tip of the iceberg  he knows that  but  if nothing else  the discovery phase of this would be interesting you can read the letter in full here breaking  trump demands retraction from  nytimes  threatens lawsuit https   t co  pic twitter com   christina wilkie   christinawilkie  october    image via scott olson getty images
