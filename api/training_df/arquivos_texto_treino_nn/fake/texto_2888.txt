the women s march was historic  over four million women all across the country  and world  came out in solidarity to protest against the incoming avalanche of assault from the trump administration contrary to popular belief  the women s march was not a protest against president trump   it was a protest in support of women s rights before taking the oath of office  the trump administration pledged to defund all programs at the doj which enforce the violence against women act  donald trump himself has released the names of  conservative judges who are potential supreme court nominees that mirror the late justice antonin scalia  who does not believe the  amendment extends to women  on monday  january   trump signed an executive order imposing the  mexico city  rule   that overseas operations  including clinics  that perform or encourage abortion will lose all federal funding from the united states the war on women is in full force  and trump is at the reins that is why  now more than ever  an equal rights amendment is needed the proposal is a simple one equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex  the congress shall have the power to enforce  by appropriate legislation  the provisions of this article  this amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification aside from the  amendment  which gives women the right to vote  there is no specific mention of women in the united states constitution  the word  men  is mentioned a handful of times  the words  women    ladies   or  female  is nowhere  not one line in the united states constitution even alludes to the rights of women when considering historical context  aside from the    nor is the word  equality  found anywhere even though the constitution states  all men are created equal   we know that the founders truly did not understand that  if you weren t white  a landowner  or male  the constitution was not written with your rights in mind  thomas jefferson  who authored the declaration of independence and made significant contributions to the constitution  wrote were our state a pure democracy there would still be excluded from our deliberations women  who  to prevent deprivation of morals and ambiguity of issues  should not mix promiscuity in gatherings of men what many people fail to realize is that the rights of women that hinge on the  amendment s equal protection clause can easily be taken away  the  amendment says that states may not  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws   should a congress or bench of judges hold hostile views of women s equality  they could deem it necessary to roll back on much of the social progress made through common or statutory law  should trump appoint one  two or even three new justices to the supreme court  who hold originalist views like scalia  many issues such as equal pay  abortion  insurance discrimination  and so forth could vanish or become embedded in sex discrimination the only thing women truly  inarguably have is the right to vote  but what s the point of voting if your rights as a human being could be taken away down the road in the name of jurisprudence the argument  women already have everything the era would guarantee them  is not only wrong but na ve  first  women don t have  everything  equal to men in current law  there are still many statutes that separate on the basis of sex  second  only the era would truly guarantee them these fundamental rights without fear of being stripped away so easily  so those opposed to the era actually give us a reason to support it   they admit it would guarantee equality if enacted this wasn t always a divisive issue  republicans use to support it  richard nixon and gerald ford supported the era in the   as did president carter  this was not a partisan issue until phyllis schlafly came along and derailed it using scare tactics  one argument was that this would lead to same sex marriage  but schlafly is gone  as is ford and nixon   and a new era for women is on the horizon  if women came out in support for an equal rights amendment as they did on january   equality would be the true law of the land featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
