trump s pick for press secretary  noted numbnut sean spicer  appeared on abc s  this week  to discuss  well  various things  at one point  he was asked about whether russia actually did try to rig our election  and he decided to deflect instead of actually give us a real opinion on it  however  his deflection is just plain insane  despite the fact that hillary lost the election  he decided to say  we re having part of a conversation  why aren t we talking about other influences on the election  why aren t we talking about hillary clinton getting debate questions ahead of time  that s a pretty valid attempt to influence an election  well  first off  she lost  so why is spicer even bringing this up  most likely because there s no excuse for russia meddling in our election  along with the fact that trump s closeness with russia looks really bad  it looks so terrible there s no way to make it look pretty without deflecting  so  yeah  sure  russia s bad  but hillary s worse  and blah blah blah punish her for it yes  spicer said that  too  when are we going to start talking about the other side of this  which is  what did hillary clinton do to influence the election  is she being punished in any way  please  someone stop these people from embarrassing the whole country any further  watch the whole ridiculous segment below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
