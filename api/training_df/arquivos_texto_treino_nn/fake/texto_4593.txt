donald trump is rising in the polls  has the media wrapped around his little finger  and people are starting to take him seriously  with all these things going in his favor  with  days left until the election  you d think he would stick to staying on script but  as always  he screws it up just hours after  denouncing  birtherism  and then falsely accusing the  clinton campaign of starting it   trump delivered another off color  off script speech in miami where he  yet again  hinted at hillary clinton s assassination after incorrectly claiming that clinton wants to abolish the second amendment  which she can t do   trump said  i think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons  they should disarm  i think they should disarm immediately  what do you think  yes  take their guns away  she doesn t want guns  take them  let s see what happens to her  take their guns away  okay  it will be very dangerous  and just like that  trump basically called for an assassination of hillary clinton  and the basket of deplorables cheered like the rabid dogs they are just five weeks ago  trump hinted that angry gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands   assassinating hillary clinton   should she win the presidency  hillary wants to essentially abolish the second amendment  if she gets to pick her judges  nothing you can do folks  although the second amendment people maybe there is  i don t know  after those comments were made  trump received intense backlash from both the left and the right  although his people maintain he was not advocating for assassination  but rather them getting out to vote  his campaign promised to stay on script the remainder of the race clearly they aren t following their own advice former congresswoman gabrielle giffords  who was shot in the head at a constituents  meeting   thus forcing her to resign from congress   demanded trump apologize and disavow his dangerous comments  in his more stable moments  mr  trump has said he regrets some of the ugly insults and dangerous threats he has leveled during the course of this campaign  we call on him to immediately renounce these comments  apologize to hillary clinton  and acknowledge that once again he has gone dangerously too far  if anyone knows the danger of stoking political violence  no matter how  innocent  it may seem  it s gabrielle giffords  republicans  independents  and weary democrats should ask themselves  is this who they want representing them  a  man  who makes a casual reference to violence against hillary clinton any presidential candidate who is so cowardly he has to call on his opponent to essentially be assassinated should in no way even remotely be considered for the job  perhaps trump s secret service agents should have a word with the republican candidate about jokes regarding death when will the american people stand up and say  enough is enough   enough of the off script  jokes   enough of the blatant disregard for cordial campaigning  enough of the deplorable and reprehensible comments featured image via joe readle getty images
