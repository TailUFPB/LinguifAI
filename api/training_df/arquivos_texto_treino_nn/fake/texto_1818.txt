sean spicer s is having a very  very bad day while the jewish community celebrated passover  spicer claimed that adolf hitler never gassed people  after immediate backlash  spicer said he meant hitler never gassed german citizens  after another immediate backlash  spicer said he meant hitler never specifically bombed people with chemical weapons  merely gassed them in concentration camps  which he bizarrely called  holocaust centers    by this point  he had proven his original point was nonsensical and still offensive  while also proving that he was a bad liar it would take him a few more hours   and a call from the israeli government asking that he resign  before he got around to begrudgingly apologizing  and he managed to screw that up too while speaking with cnn s wolf blitzer  spicer claimed he didn t want his hitler comments to be a  distraction  from trump s efforts  what efforts exactly  allow spicer  seen here stepping on every metaphorical rake in the yard  to explain with characteristic rambling  jumbled sentences i needed to make sure i clarified and not in any way  shape or form any more of a distraction from the president s decisive action in syria and the attempts that he s making to destabilize the region sean accidentally just said the quiet part loud  oops wow  while apologizing for hitler gaffe  spicer literally says he doesn t want to distract from trump s attempts  to destabilize the region  pic twitter com   tommy christopher   tommyxtopher  april    trump s own staff are quietly admitting to reporters that his syrian policy is that he has no policy  some mistakenly thought his order to launch  missiles at a syrian airbase was the start of some coherent plan  but that idea quickly fell apart  trump s son eric would clear things up when he openly admitted trump impulsively decided to issue the strike after his daughter ivanka asked him to instead  trump s middle eastern efforts continue to be haphazard and counterproductive  thanks to spicer  we now know that somewhere in the deepest parts of their brains  this administration knows that as an added bonus  here s blitzer telling the white house press secretary how to correctly pronounce assad s name after spicer repeatedly botches it   presssec continues to be unable to pronounce assad s name so wolf kindly helps him out pic twitter com iqnfxcdsfn  jon passantino   passantino  april    image via twitter
