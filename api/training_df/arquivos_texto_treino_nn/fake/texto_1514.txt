acting fbi director andrew mccabe testified today in front of the senate intelligence committee  when asked if the rank and file employees of the law enforcement agency  he said   director comey enjoyed broad support within the f b i  and still does to this day  the vast majority of f b i  employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to director comey  mccabe went on to say   it has been the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life to have worked with him  when asked about the current investigation into any ties between the trump campaign  mccabe said that the agency considers this investigation to be very important and serious  as to what impact comey s firing will have on the investigation  he said   the work of the men and women of the fbi continues despite any changes in circumstances   he said in response to a question from senator marco rubio  republican of florida   there has been no effort to impede our investigation to date  simply put  you cannot stop the men and women of the fbi from doing the right thing  given what the white house has said this week  both areas are important  yesterday  white house spokesperson sarah huckabee sanders told the press that the reason comey was fired was because  among other things  that he had lost the confidence of the agents there  one reason many believe president trump fired comey  and no one believes anyone but trump made this decision  because he thought it might slow down the investigation  it now appears neither of those ideas are true featured image via alex wong  getty images
