it s tough these days to keep track of exactly how many shadow governments are propping up donald trump  steve bannon is the de facto president  mike pence is reportedly the puppet master behind all the lgbt hate and anti abortion positions  but let s not forget that the ultimate trump puppet master isn t even an american  it s russian president vladimir putin and on an edition of the o reilly factor that will appear on super bowl sunday  trump refused to say anything bad about putin at all bill o reilly is rarely the voice of reason  but this is a time of such absurdity that even glenn beck is warning us of the insanity of trump  still  compared to trump  o reilly is downright sane  even he recognized the dangers of having putin s hand up the you know what of the person who s supposed to be the leader of the western world in the interview  trump was asked about putin  he s still trying to claim that he never met the russian leader  despite that being widely debunked  he once said that he met with putin in russia and the man  could not have been nicer   when o reilly talked about putin  though  trump played dumb  i do respect him  i respect a lot of people   trump says in a clip of the interview released saturday   that doesn t mean i m going to get along with him  trump goes on to say that if russia aids the u s  in the fight against isis   then that s a good thing  source  hollywood reporterwhen asked about the fact that putin is a killer  trump merely shrugged it off and said that the united states isn t so innocent o reilly  host of factor  retorts with about putin   he s a killer  though  putin s a killer  there are a lot of killers  we got a lot of killers   trump says   what  you think our country is so innocent  here s the video it s becoming increasingly more clear every day that donald trump absolutely loathes the united states  no  our country is certainly not innocent  but we don t have recent evidence of any of our presidents poisoning those who disagree with him   the worst similar thing  that we know of  is the outing of a cia agent who disagreed with dick cheney and the weapons of mass destruction claim   it s definitely not too early to rule that possibility out when it comes to trump  though  the way he lashes out at anyone who dares say anything against him is straight from the playbook of a third rate dictator and trump s puppet master putin is far from just third rate  watch for trump to be following in putin s footsteps and with tacit approval of killing political enemies  it s apparent that nothing is off limits for this new administration  be afraid  be very afraid featured image via video screen capture
