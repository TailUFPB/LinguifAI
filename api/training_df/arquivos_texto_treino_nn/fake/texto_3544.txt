it finally dawned on glenn beck that his buddy sarah palin isn t quite right in the head  last night on his television show  beck expressed concern for sarah palin s erratic behavior lately and wondered if she suffered a brain aneurysm  according to right wing watch  the half term governor of alaska had thrown her full support behind donald trump s bid for the white house  then after his win she attacked him for the carrier deal  calling it crony capitalism  for once in her life  she got something right but she should have known that trump would pull such a move  beck called palin s enthusiastic endorsement of trump  crazy  sincerely  has she had a brain aneurysm   beck said monday night on his program   because i don t know what has happened to her  because before palin attacked the carrier deal  trump was considering her for a cabinet position  she s totally unqualified for the position of secretary of veterans affairs  but trump is also unqualified to be leader of the free world so it kind of makes sense he chose her  but  beck thought she would have done a fine job in that capacity beck said palin attacking trump over the carrier deal is absurd  because  you own it  sarah  you brought it to the table  he said he would do that  beck and his staff members decided that maybe palin is lashing out at trump because she is just  butt hurt  over the fact that she may not get the v a  secretary position after all watch the political arena in this country is so insane that glenn beck is making sense  glenn  fucking  beck  let that sink in for a moment sarah palin does own this  instead of draining the swamp  trump is filling it with terrifying creatures  everything trump accused hillary clinton of  he is doing  trump hasn t even been sworn in yet and he s plagued with scandals  but  hillary s emails were made into a scandal so he s going to be the next president photo  j d  lasica via flickr
