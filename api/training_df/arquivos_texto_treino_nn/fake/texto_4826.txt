the southern poverty law center released a report on wednesday  outing both of the newest additions to the trump campaign as members of a secretive far right extremist group made up of the most powerful conservatives and white supremacists in the united states in what was described as a  shakeup   trump hired conservative pollster kellyanne conway and breitbart bigwig stephen bannon as his campaign s ceo  whatever the hell that is  since presidential campaigns don t have ceo s  according to the slpc s report  conway and bannon are members of the council for national policy  cnp   this right wing group is known for its secrecy and is comprised of some of the country s most powerful conservatives  the cnp is an intensely secretive and shadowy group of what the new york times once described as  the most powerful conservatives in the country   reads the splc report  in addition  it is so tight lipped that it tells people not to admit their membership or even name the group  revealing when or where the group meets  or what it discusses  is also forbidden  the membership rolls also boast some of the most notorious white supremacists in the country as well  the cnp is not controversial so much for the conservatives who dominate it   activists of the religious right and the so called  culture wars   along with a smattering of wealthy financiers  congressional operatives  right wing consultants and tea party operatives   as for the many real extremists who are included  the report states that the cnp s members include  michael peroutka  a neo confederate who for years was on the board of the white supremacist league of the south  jerome corsi  a strident obama  birther  and the propagandist hit man responsible for the  swift boating  of john kerry  joseph farah  who runs the wildly conspiracist  news  operation known as worldnetdaily  mat staver  the liberty counsel leader who has worked to re criminalize gay sex  philip zodhaites  another anti gay activist who is charged with helping a self described former lesbian who kidnapped her daughter from her former partner and fled the country  and a large number of other similar characters  earlier this year  the splc got their hands on the cnp membership directory for   this document showed that bannon had been a regular member and conway had served as a member of the group s executive committee  it is unknown what their current standing with the group is today when the splc first published the original article on the cnp several months ago  they pointed out that it is very much within their rights to operate in secret  however  this means that the group  also provides an important venue in which relatively mainstream conservatives meet and very possibly are influenced by real extremists  people who regularly defame lgbt people with utter falsehoods  describe latino immigrants as a dangerous group of rapists and disease carriers  engage in the kind of wild eyed conspiracy theorizing for which the john birch society is famous  and even suggest that certain people should be stoned to death in line with old testament law  the splc concluded that it is  not known how their contacts within the cnp may have affected conway and bannon   but they reiterated what they wrote in may  at a time of extreme political polarization in our society  in the middle of an ugly presidential contest which has featured an almost unsurpassed record of ethnic  racial and sexual insults and lies  americans deserve to know who their ostensible leaders are mixing with as we collectively decide our country s future  that is as true of campaign leaders as it is of political candidates   the splc added trump has been trying to distance himself from the alt right  the modern term for white supremacists  especially after hillary clinton gave a blistering speech calling out his ties with the fringe element  bannon s connection to breitbart has drawn scrutiny  as the blogspot is known for its racist  sexist  and anti semitic content  but from the looks of it  trump and his campaign are sitting right in the laps of these right wing extremists  conway and bannon s involvement with the cnp just made that abundantly clear featured image via rawstory  and liberal america
