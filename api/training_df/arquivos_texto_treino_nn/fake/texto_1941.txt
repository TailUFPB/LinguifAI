noam chomsky has warned us of how dangerous donald trump is since the beginning of his campaign  his prediction that trump would endanger the entire planet by ignoring climate change was confirmed this week when he signed an executive order rolling back president obama s environmental protections  now  chomsky has another warning and it is downright terrifying speaking to alternet  chomsky said that it is just a matter of time before all of trump s supporters realize what fraud they actually voted for  i think that sooner or later the white working class constituency will recognize  and in fact  much of the rural population will come to recognize  that the promises are built on sand  there is nothing there   the noted scholar said chomsky then explained that if trump s approval ratings falls low enough  we could end up seeing a  staged terrorist attack  i think that we shouldn t put aside the possibility that there would be some kind of staged or alleged terrorist act  which can change the country instantly  a few days later  in an interview with truthout  chomsky expanded on what he meant  he explained that trump could reach a point of sheer desperation to boost his public approval ratings  a terrorist attack would be one way he could try to do that chomsky again said that trump s supporters are waking up and realizing that he lied to them about absolutely everything  sooner or later  his supporters will turn their backs on him  if that happens  we can expect that the trump bannon crowd will seek to divert attention in one of the many familiar ways   perhaps conjuring up some threat to american security  or if there is one  exploiting it   or  perhaps  scapegoating the most vulnerable  immigrants  muslims  welfare recipients  one of reagan s disgusting techniques   and other available targets   chomsky explained   that could turn very ugly  it could lead to the  friendly fascism  that sociologist bertram gross predicted  years ago  or worse  if chomsky s prediction is correct and trump ever did try to stage or exploit an attack  it certainly wouldn t be the first time in history this scenario had played out  a perfect example of this is the vietnam war in   the uss maddox was allegedly attacked in the gulf of tonkin by the north vietnamese  this is the incident responsible for officially kicking off the vietnam war  however  documents released in  and  show that this supposed attack never even happened featured image via justin sullivan getty images
