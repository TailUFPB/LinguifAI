obeying the law can be such a pain in the ass  at least according to the trump organization  with their hundreds of employees  it can just be so difficult to fill out paperwork to make sure that any gifts and money that comes from foreign governments violates the constitution s emoluments clause in response to a document request from the house oversight committee  trump s company sent a copy of an eight page pamphlet detailing how it plans to track payments it receives from foreign governments at the firm s many hotels  golf courses  and restaurants across the globe  but while the trump organization said it would set aside all money it collects from customers that identify themselves as representing a foreign government  it would not undertake a more intensive effort to determine if a payment would violate the constitution s prohibition on public office holders accepting an  emolument  from a foreign state  to fully and completely identify all patronage at our properties by customer type is impractical in the service industry and putting forth a policy that requires all guests to identify themselves would impede upon personal privacy and diminish the guest experience of our brand   the trump organization wrote in its policy pamphlet  which the company s chief compliance officer said had been distributed to general managers and senior officials at all of its properties source  the atlanticlet s just add this to trump s ever growing list of broken promises  while it seemed that the wall that will likely never get built was the cornerstone of trump s campaign  his real selling point was the promise that he would be the anti whatever the right wing media has been telling us about hillary clinton over the last  years  instead  he became everything the right wing made up about hillary and much  much more instead of draining the swamp  trump filled it with a bevy of goldman sachs people  he said he would take no salary  he is taking one  and while he did donate his first quarter salary to the national parks service  that s tax deductible for him  so taxpayers are covering the cost of his salary and the tax deduction trump is a grifter  he might not have run for president with the specific goal of getting richer  but he s certainly taking advantage of all the opportunities the office hands him  legal or not  diplomats are staying at his hotels  just hoping that it will give them a special in with blotus  since taking office  china has granted trump  new trademarks  hell  just this week  daughter ivanka took what amounted to a   million from the saudi government to go to her theoretical foundation   this after he was saying that hillary clinton should be locked up for taking donations from the saudis for her actual foundation if trump refuses to abide by the constitution   the one thing he was sworn to on inauguration day  it s time for him to go  then again  it seems that with every move  with every secret he discloses  with every flirtation with the russians  trump is daring us to do something about it
