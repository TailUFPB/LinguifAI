if you ve subjected yourself to cable news over the last few days  you ve probably noticed a non stop barrage of coverage of the most  pressing issue  of the week  hillary clinton is  gasp  human  and she sometimes succumbs to germs if anything  the fact that hillary made an appearance at new york s   memorial service  despite the fact that she had pneumonia  is a testament to her stamina  not a sign of weakness  but the media has turned it into just another way hillary is deceiving the public this tactic might backfire on the media  nearly every woman can relate to the idea of trying to forget they are sick  so they can get s  t done  whether that s  t includes taking care of a household or taking care of a country  or anything in between  cnn reporter christiane amanpour is pretty angry  her network has been among the worst in the non stop bullying of a woman recovering from a common illness  so  amanpour took to the air to beg the media   can t a girl have a sick day or two  finally tonight  imagine a world where you can t slow down  you absolutely cannot  can t get sick  this weekend after attending a   memorial in new york after more than a year of relentless campaigning  the democratic presidential nominee  hillary clinton  fell ill and these pictures have boomeranged across the world  several hours later the campaign revealed the former secretary of state had been diagnosed with pneumonia on friday  but surely this can t be a case of a human being having an off day  nope  like so many things hillary  the media are having a field day  off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage  this must be another typical clinton conspiracy to fool them with total transparency breakdown  talk about a transparency breakdown what about donald trump s tax returns  where are they  can t a girl have a sick day or two  don t get me started because when it comes to overqualified women having to try  times harder than underqualified men to get a break or even a level playing field  well we know that story  and then  to hammer home the double standard  amanpour talked about the male presidents who have suffered from their various forms of frailty  and seriously now  the  president of the united states  franklin pierce rose to that role after earning the nickname fainting frank for twice collapsing in two battles in    she continued   who could ever forget george bush senior throwing up all over the japanese prime minister and then fainting at a state dinner  and he oversaw the fall of the soviet union and won the first gulf war  considering the media outrage over hillary failing to tell them she had pneumonia on friday  consider the media activity shielding some great american presidents  agreeing for instance  not to show these photographs of franklin d  roosevelt  whose polio kept him confined to a wheelchair  but did that stop his new deal for america or winning world war ii  and then there is everyone s favorite president  john f kennedy  now he saved the world from possible nuclear armageddon during the cuban missile crisis  called for a new frontier in space and generally inspired whole generations around the globe while the press kept secret his painful struggle with addison s disease  leading the world in sickness and in health if the boys can do it  why not the women  here s the video courtesy of media matters the bottom line is  human bodies are flawed  and even the most healthy of us occasionally gets sick  treating that as a moral failing is insulting to all women  not just to hillary clinton featured image via video screen capture
