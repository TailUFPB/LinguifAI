it s no secret that californians aren t really fans of donald trump and trump can t stand california  california rejected trump during the election by a whopping  percent margin  in turn  trump has called the most populous state in the union   out of control   and threatened to withhold money if they don t bend to trump s will  california s governor  jerry brown  on meet the press on sunday  said trump would be picking a fight with the wrong governor at specific issue is that fact that many of california s cities are sanctuary cities  which means it s safe for undocumented residents to report crimes without fear of deportation  now  anyone with half a brain knows that people reporting crimes is one of the biggest weapons against criminals  but trump tells his supporters that sanctuary cities are hotbeds of danger  they aren t  in fact because people can report crime  they are typically safer california is not backing down to trump s bullying  if he pulls funding from california  california is going to retaliate and that s the last thing trump wants  we do have something called the ninth and the tenth amendment   he stated   the federal government just can t arbitrarily for political reasons punish the state of california  that s number one  number two  california is america  we re  percent  we re a key part  the export capital going into the pacific  we re the innovation capital  high tech  agriculture   to  billion dollar industry  you don t want to mess with california because you re going to mess with the economy  and that could blow up in your face in a gigantic recession  and roll the republicans right out of this town  source  nbc newshere s the video  brown isn t just talking out his you know what  without california  the country is in a whole lot of hurt  not only is it the largest state  it s also the  largest economy in the world  its economy surpasses france and india  or  if trump voters need to see something a bit more tangible  let s just say that without california  the cost of food  if you can find it  will go through the roof california produces a sizable majority of many american fruits  vegetables  and nuts   percent of artichokes   percent of walnuts   percent of kiwis   percent of plums   percent of celery   percent of garlic   percent of cauliflower   percent of spinach  and  percent of carrots  and the list goes on and on  without california  supply of all these products in the united states and abroad would dip  and in the first few years  a few might be nearly impossible to find  orchard based products in particular  such as nuts and some fruits  would take many years to spring back price surges would eventually become the larger issue  rising prices would force americans to consume more grains  which are locked in a complicated price dependent relationship with fresh fruits  vegetables  and meats  when the price of produce increases  people eat more grain  when the price of grain drops  people eat more fruits and vegetables   in fact  in some parts of the world  wheat and rice are the only proven  giffen goods a product in which decreasing prices lead to decreasing demand   young people and the poor in america  more than others  eat less fresh food when prices rise source  slatebeyond that  though  could you imagine  if just once  president obama threatened to pull funding from  let s say  texas   a state which was consistently hostile to the democratic president  republicans and many democrats would have had a fit and they would have been right  donald trump works for us  all of us  not just the people who voted for him  it s time he learn that and jerry brown is the perfect person to teach the lesson featured image via video screen capture
