for months now  the republicans have been doing all they can to ram through a disastrous   even deadly   massive tax cut for rich people healthcare bill  finally  the senate had come up with a version that looked like it might pass   but then moderate senator susan collins  r maine  and libertarian rand paul  r ky  said they would vote for it under no circumstances  they had different reasons  of course   senator collins knew it would be a potential death knell for the most vulnerable among us  while senator paul thought the bill wasn t conservative enough and didn t actually repeal the affordable care act after collins and paul came out against the bill  which the gop is hilariously calling the better care reconciliation act  that only left one vote that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell could lose and still pass his bill and get it to donald trump s desk  with mike pence acting as the tie breaking vote everything changed when senator john mccain  r az  had to have emergency surgery to remove a blood clot over his left eye  he is now at home in arizona  and we wish him a speedy recovery  this  however  was a game changer  it meant that without mccain s vote  mcconnell was one vote short  so  of course he shelved the vote until mccain s return well  as of monday night  none of that matters  as senators mike lee  r ut  and jerry moran  r ks  came out against the bill because they  like rand paul  don t think it is cruel enough to the poor  the elderly  children  and the disabled  however  despicable as their reasons may be  for the moment that matters not  mcconnell does not have the votes he needs to pass this bill  for now that is a win for us now  all of that being said  a word of caution   these people have been vowing to get rid of the affordable care act for the last seven years  it is what they promised their obama hating  mouthbreathing base  so they won t give up  public pressure works  keep calling your senators and telling them not to kill us featured image via win mcnamee getty images
