much like donald trump himself  it s hard to tell what kinds of insane things might happen during an interview with the people who support the incompetent potus  cnn s alisyn camerota learned this the hard way on thursday morning when she interviewed a few trump voters about how they thought he was doing after his several weeks in office  the experience may have left a permanent scar despite having the failures  investigations and exposed lies  this focus group of trump voters gave trump an  a  grade   all but  voter in the group of  had the balls to give trump a  b  because he refused to give out the highest grade  that voter  billy baer  said  it was like people were laughing in his face   literally laughing in his face   about the prospect of him being elected  he got elected  and we don t know  as far as the votes and fraud and everything else  my assumption is that he probably would have been elected by a higher number than what the results actually showed  while giving a clearly failing and highly unpopular potus an a or b is puzzling in itself  the real shocking moment came when camerota challenged the trump supporters on trump s claim that millions of people had voted illegally in the election  this is where baer insisted he saw busloads of people from out of state coming into new hampshire to vote  camerota questioned this obviously bullsh t claim and asked  when you say you ve seen it  do you mean dozens or do you mean  million  there s a difference  baer then admitted he hadn t seen  million illegal voters  even though this has been the number trump s been touting despite having no evidence  baer replied  extrapolating  based on the number i ve seen with my own eyes  busloads of people coming in   whether they re illegal  meaning they came into the country illegally  or they re illegal voters   they came over from massachusetts into new hampshire  when camerota asked baer just how he d seen  busloads and busloads   another trump supporter chimed in to deliver the final blow of insanity  josh youssef jumped in and said   who cares  though    solidifying that the truth and facts do not matter at all to anyone who supports trump  camerota was visibly stunned and said  i care  just to be clear  you saw it with your own eyes  busloads and busloads of people coming from somewhere other than new hampshire to vote  you saw that  youssef tried to defend trump and said  i ve seen cars coming in from out of state that are full  with out of state plates   i live right across the street from the polling place in my ward  and not surprisingly  baer s claims also didn t hold up  he eventually said  yeah  i guess that i can t cite the busloads that i ve seen and where i ve seen them  but on television i ve seen it  well  we know that trump also gets all of his  facts  from television   the mostly false fox news to be exact   so this makes perfect sense  you can watch this disastrous interview below trump voters give the president a grade after his first months in the white house https   t co kuqfsdlrcv  new day   newday  march    image is a screenshot
