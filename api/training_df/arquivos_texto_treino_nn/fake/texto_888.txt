at the close of the election  upon finding out that he lost the popular vote  donald trump made the bold accusation that there were millions of illegal votes  most especially in california well  because irony is the favorite theme of the trump administration  as truth would have it  it was actually a trump voter who tried to cast illegal ballots for trump in iowa according to cbs news  a woman from des moines  iowa  pleaded guilty to election misconduct for attempting to cast two separate ballots in the  presidential election for then republican nominee donald trump according to the associated press  terri lynn rote    entered her plea for the felony charge on june   court documents state that lawyers affiliated with the case are recommending rote face up to two years of probation with community service on the side  further  rote told police why she tried to vote more than once  she was convinced her first vote for mr  trump would be manipulated and changed to a vote for then democratic candidate hillary clinton  according to her statement to the police  rote believed mr  trump s claims about widespread election rigging  so  if you thought trump lying to his supporters didn t actually have an effect on them  you would be wrong  his lies not only were inaccurate but got this gullible voter in a lot of trouble the irony of all of this is beyond hilarious considering we were all told by trump that it was the liberals who were up to no good  and by saying it was the liberals who were up to no good caused his own supporters to literally be up to no good and attempt to tamper with election results thus resulting in a guilty plea between this and the russia scandal  it s more than obvious the actual criminal was put in office by the electoral college featured image by getty images
