another day in the trump administration means another day of sheer insanity as trump begins to name ambassadors to various positions across the globe  one sticks out above all  callista gingrich  wife of former speaker of the house newt gingrich aside from having no diplomatic experience whatsoever  gingrich is an interesting choice for her perspective position  ambassador to holy see  newt gingrich confirmed to cnn that his wife was  being considered  and said if chosen  he would not be moving to rome  but instead be  clocking in  a lot of miles between italy and the united states the holy see  which is comprised of the vatican and the roman catholic church overall  is arguably one of the most important relationships between the united states and the western judeo christian religious order and in typical trump form  he nominates someone who is the antithesis of what the position holds dear  why  for starters  callista gingrich is an adulteress gingrich  who met her husband newt when he was house minority whip  admitted to engaging in a six year extramarital affair while the speaker was married to his second wife  marianne ginther so not only is callista gingrich an adulteress  she is married to a twice divorced adulterer  both of which are grave sins in the roman catholic church gingrich and her husband are both  staunch catholics   and are allowed to receive communion  as newt had his first two marriages annulled   effectively absolving all wrongdoing in the eyes of god and the church still  the decision to hand callista gingrich the position of ambassador to the holy see is pathetic  given the many catholic lawmakers and diplomats are currently and formally serving in washington d c  and have much more experience there are currently  catholic members of the senate alone  including republicans pat toomey  lisa murkowski  marco rubio  john hoeven  thom tillis  dan sullivan  mike rounds and susan collins once again  donald trump is considering a joke to lead a very serious and very sacred position in american diplomacy  why  because he has favors to pay  newt gingrich was one of trump s biggest mouthpieces throughout the campaign this is what we call dynasty politics  this is what we call the  swamp  in washington d c  god help us  no pun intended  if callista gingrich is given this position featured image via peter marovich getty images
