donald trump and the republican party s push to repeal and replace the affordable care act  aka obamacare  was met with protests and resistance all around the country  despite being well aware that their  replacement  would be stripping millions of americans  especially the ill and lower income citizens  of their life saving  affordable health insurance  the gop has continued to push forward with their horrible idea   and now they re getting annihilated for it on the internet on monday  republicans released a draft bill of their obamacare replacement  the american health care act  as expected with anything that trump or the republican party does  it was not received well and is already considered a massive failure just  hours after its release  to commemorate yet another major fail by the gop and its corrupt  deranged leader  the internet came to the rescue and tore the new replacement apart   by making it a meme here s some of the best obamacare vs  trumpcare memes we could find  which makes the gop s latest f  k up just a little more tolerable           out of all of them  this one is sure to make trump explode and throw a twitter temper tantrum  as we all know how damn sensitive he was  and still is  about the pathetic size of his inauguration crowds hopefully  these hilarious memes will force more americans to pay attention to what trump and the gop is trying to do to americans  the gop s replacement plan puts americans  health care in jeopardy  and will make it much more expensive for many the gop and trump have not been listening to the american people  if they truly cared what the majority of americans wanted  obamacare would be left alone or amended at best  according to a poll by cnn orc  most americans are satisfied with their health care and don t want obamacare to be taken away  but then again  if republicans actually cared about what the majority of americans wanted  we d have hillary clinton in the white house and none of this would be happening featured image via twitter
