maybe you re a little confused  like me  about when exactly the american flag took the place of the first amendment to the constitution  after all  i have a sister older than the current american flag  but conservatives sure do like symbols  and their assumption that everyone else does as much as they do is probably why the outrage over nfl players taking a knee  or sitting  or otherwise not properly  respecting  american symbolism has captured the zeitgeist in the country this football season but what does  respect for the flag  actually mean  and is there a double standard  one twitter user had a pretty spectacular take on whether there just might be a little hypocrisy at play in all of the criticism of those  ungrateful black multi millionaires  who dare to protest in a way that s  unacceptable  to white people  hennywise  is a third generation veteran of the armed forces  and his outline of ways that america completely ignores the  disrespect  that doesn t bother them or even makes them happy is a primer on the united states flag code  setting aside the fact that a significant number of sports fans may in fact be getting a beer at concessions during the national anthem and display of the colors  there are a number of regulations that americans don t seem to mind breaking let s jump right in us flag code  chapter   the flag should never be carried flat or horizontally  but always aloft and free   pic twitter com   hennywise   koopakinte  september    flag code  chapter   the flag should never be used as wearing apparel  bedding  or drapery   pic twitter com   hennywise   koopakinte  september    s a popular violationus flag code chapter   the flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever   pic twitter com omnzturfad  hennywise   koopakinte  september    flag code chapter    pt   it should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like  pic twitter com   hennywise   koopakinte  september    flag code chapter      or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard   pic twitter com   hennywise   koopakinte  september    it s saturday us flag code chapter   no part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform   pic twitter com   hennywise   koopakinte  september    covered in the  respect for flag  section  standing kneeling sitting  that s considered a conduct violation  not disrespectful   hennywise   koopakinte  september    a  generation vet  hennywise   koopakinte  september    user pointed out one small thing that hennywise overlooked in his synopsis of hypocrisy great thread  also this  taketheknee pic twitter com   hsquared   blondewarship  september    flag code also specifies that the flag should never have placed on it  or attached to it  any mark  insignia  letter  word  number  figure  or drawing of any kind that makes the  blue lives matter  flag an even more direct form of disrespect than a violation of most of the other regulations would be considered but will conservatives care  hypocrisy has never seemed to bother them before featured image via brett carlsen getty images
