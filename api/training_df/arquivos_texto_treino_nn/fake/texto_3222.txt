years ago  donald trump tweeted that he hoped russian dictator vladimir putin would become his  new best friend   during the debates  he looked immensely sad as he said the words  he s not my best friend  when he was accused of being a russian puppet  but now that vladimir putin has helped him get elected and trump has taken to openly praising the russian president on twitter  it seems that they are finally ready to buy matching friendship bracelets and make it official on friday  vladimir putin announced that he would not immediately retaliate against the united states for expelling  suspected russian intelligence agents  putin  who personally directed an effort to hack donald trump s opposition in what the cia has confirmed was a far reaching effort to install donald trump as president  has been earning nothing but praise from the donald  who says with a wink and a nod that he totally knew nothing about anything that was happening and denies that russia is responsible for the hacks putin says that instead  he will wait for donald trump to become president before he decides how to move forward   a fairly concrete sign that the two are working in collusion  at any point  trump could say  no more   at any point  he could be honest with the american people about their relationship and possibly even avoid prison time  unfortunately  this is donald trump we re talking about  and he seems to be immune to scrutiny  prosecution  or anything else he deserves  further steps toward the restoration of russian american relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of president d  trump will carry out  putin said friday this is another time trump could have stepped up  he could have cemented his place as a strong president by telling putin that he stands by the decision to expel  suspected spies  instead  he sided with russia yet again  praising his president for the  delay    something that will virtually ensure that putin gets whatever he wants great move on delay  by v  putin    i always knew he was very smart   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  december    course  the internet does not take kindly to the incoming

boycott trump scion   puppymnkey  december    years  conservatives have accused president obama of treason every time he so much as sneezed  under  u s  code     treason is defined as such whoever  owing allegiance to the united states  levies war against them or adheres to their enemies  giving them aid and comfort within the united states or elsewhere  is guilty of treason and shall suffer death  or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than     and shall be incapable of holding any office under the united states while nothing obama has done has come close  isn t trump s repeated praise of putin   a man who personally oversaw an attack on our nation   giving  aid  and  comfort  within  the united states or elsewhere   isn t the fact that the russian president s  delay  until his puppet was in office   a move trump praised    adhering to  an enemy of the united states i won t wish death on trump  even if his actions call for it under our nation s laws  death would give him an  easy out  and prevent him from learning what it s like to wake up every day staring at the cold walls of a prison cell featured image via getty images
