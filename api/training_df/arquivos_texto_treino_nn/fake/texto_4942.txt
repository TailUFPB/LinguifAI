if there s anyone who is absolutely tired of donald trump s shenanigans running for office  it s last week tonight host john oliver on sunday s show he had a simple request of trump  drop out  simply drop out and tell america this entire candidacy was a stunt  a satire designed to expose the flaws in the system  he also added  you re either going to win  or you re going to lose  and i think both those scenarios end pretty badly for you  oliver then went on to explain that if trump were to win that he would absolutely unqualified and his candidacy is very reminiscent of a fiction book that is about a class clown who ran for president as a joke speaking directly to trump  he also says  although your campaign was the political equivalent of a bigoted clown s blazing funeral pyre  you have accidentally made upwards of four good points during this campaign  adding  if you dropped out in order to teach america a lesson  you would not be a loser  you would be a legend  it would actually be something quite extraordinary if trump were to just drop out  because it would absolutely expose how flawed not only our system is  but also how flawed many of the citizens are living within it oliver wants trump to admit that it s all been a joke  and to come on his show  but under one condition  he must read the speech from the book  the kid who ran for president  that speech reads  i have a question for the grown ups of america  are you out of your minds  are you expecting me to enforce the constitution  i never even read it  i was absent from school that day  you want me as commander in chief of the armed forces  what if somebody attacks the united states  would you really want me in charge  america must be in really bad shape if you elected me president  you better get it together and find some qualified people to run this country or we ll all be in big trouble  it s a speech that one could quite literally imagine trump saying now it s up to trump to own up to pulling a fast one over on the united states and appear on oliver s show  or continue on being the schmuck that he may truly be  it s really up to him watch the segment here https   www youtube com watch v ndqdkfbvirqfeatured image via video screen capture
