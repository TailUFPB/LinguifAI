president donald trump has had some strong words for his fiercest political rival  hilary clinton  over the years  including having his supporters to chant  lock her up   at his political rallies  but now it seems that trump has bitten off a little more than he can chew with this whole  president  thing and needs all the advice he can get   even if it comes from clinton  to make matters more amusing  he is actually acting on what she says as the carnage from hurricane maria becomes more evident  president trump has been a little too preoccupied with perpetually tweeting abound nfl players not standing for the national anthem  while hardly acknowledging the fact that american lives are in danger after a enduring a week without electricity or clean water in puerto rico  on sunday  hillary clinton had had enough of this madness and took to what she assumed was the only platform for getting trump s attention directly  twitter  to deliver a very direct message to the president of the united states president trump  sec  mattis  and dod should send the navy  including the usns comfort  to puerto rico now  these are american citizens  https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  september    s call for action initially took place on change org when she set up a petition that received   signatures in just three days  with critics showing their frustration with the hashtag  sendthecomfort  both the hashtag and clinton s tweet specifically mention the usns comfort  a hospital ship and  in what could be a simple twist of irony  although that is highly unlikely  federal emergency management agency administrator brock long announced that that was exactly what the navy was going to do just two days after clinton s plea  we re dramatically increasing the federal footprint that s there   long said outside the white house  a motion later confirmed by the navy trump himself commented on the difficulty of getting aide to puerto rico  but it really didn t sound as if he knew much about the place  let alone where it is  but still claimed that officials were  doing a really good job  it s very tough because it s an island   trump said   in texas  we can ship the trucks right out there  and you know  we ve gotten a pluses on texas and on florida  and we will also on puerto rico  but the difference is  this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean  and it s a big ocean  it s a very big ocean  the move to send the usns comfort came after days of criticism aimed at the us government for failing to truly offer any aide in puerto rico  a us territory of almost   million people  in the aftermath of hurricane maria  large areas of puerto rico face months without power and as well as having an exceptionally long rebuilding process ahead of them president trump plans to visit the area next week featured image via alex wong getty images
