if you were unaware  there was a much anticipated hearing on the collusion between the trump campaign and russian intelligence operatives during the election scheduled on tuesday   key word  was  because the donald totally has nothing to hide at all  the gop nixed those plans  the public hearing was to feature former acting attorney general sally yates  who was fired by trump for doing her job  and former director of national intelligence james clapper   both of whom are figures republicans do not want to allow near a microphone democratic rep  adam schiff announced on friday that trump transition team member and chairman of the united states house permanent select committee on intelligence rep  devin nunes canceled the hearing breaking  chairman just cancelled open intelligence committee hearing with clapper  brennan and yates in attempt to choke off public info   adam schiff   repadamschiff  march    also criticized nunes for running a  dead of night excursion  for documents related to surveillance of trump associates while leaving the rest of the committee  in the dark  we strongly object to the cancellation of this hearing   schiff says   we would still urge the majority to reconsider  the witnesses have made it clear to us they are still available and we would urge that that hearing be allowed to go forward  recently  nunes gave us a clear indicator that he is compromised when he ran directly to the donald with alleged information showing that information regarding trump and his team was perfectly legally incidentally collected while intelligence agencies were monitoring some pretty nasty people overseas  he did not share this information with his fellow congressmen and women there is no question now  there is no defense  republicans   not just trump and his immediate team   are not working for the american people  at this point  we have no choice but to accept them for what they are  the enemy of the american people featured image via getty images  chip somodevilla
