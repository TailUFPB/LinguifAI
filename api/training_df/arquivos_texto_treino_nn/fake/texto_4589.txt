trump s way of handling the heat is simple  deflect  and blame everything on everyone else  he is a master of pointing the finger and saying  look  they do it too   the evidence couldn t be more clear with how he accuses hillary clinton of everything   from pay for play  to corruption  to even murder and for some reason  the media lets him get away with it but luckily for us  and bad for trump once the debates come around   hillary clinton isn t letting him get away with anything sick of the never ending accusations and silence by the media elites  clinton listed on her website nine difference instances in which trump accused her of doing something he actually does himself  from real pay for play to ties to russia  clinton proves that it really is trump  and not her  that is the shady candidate let s take a look so there you have it  while trump continues to accuse clinton of everything under the sun  he himself is actually the real culprit in all of these scenarios  but because he s loud and entertaining and gets them good ratings  the media ignores the glaring contradictions and hypocrisy  and let s him a free pass bottom line  trump literally does everything he accuses clinton of doing once the debate season heats up  you ll see donald trump be put in his rightful place featured image via justin sullivan getty images
