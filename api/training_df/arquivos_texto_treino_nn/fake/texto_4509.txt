donald trump thinks african americans are worse off now than they have ever been  and president obama just took him to the woodshed for it during a rally  trump declared that  african american communities are absolutely in the worst shape than they ve ever been in before  the assertion suggests that slavery was a picnic for black people and that jim crow was heaven on earth but president obama set trump straight during an interview with good morning america at the smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture  you know  i think even most  year olds ll tell you that whole slavery thing wasn t very good for black people   obama told robin roberts   jim crow wasn t very good for black people  what we have to do is use our history to propel us to make more progress in the future  here s the video via abc president obama also slammed those who think racism no longer exists in this country simply because he was elected to the presidency or because some black people make a lot of money  it s unrealistic to think that somehow that all just completely went away  because the civil rights act was passed or because oprah s making a lot of money or because i was elected president  you know  that s not how society works  and if you have hundreds of years of racial discrimination it s likely that the vestiges of that discrimination linger on  and we should acknowledge that and own that  as president obama said  donald trump could learn a lot from a visit to this museum  to think that black people had it easy as slaves is offensive and it s almost as if trump thinks they would be better off going back to being slaves  so he s definitely on a slippery slope  and while that may get his white supremacist supporters frothing at the mouth  it does nothing to help him get black people to vote for him featured image  jim lo scalzo pool getty images
