reps  jason chaffetz  r ut  and elijah cummings  d md  dropped a bombshell on tuesday morning  during a press conference  they announced what cummings described as a  major problem  for the trump administration  it looks like former national security adviser michael flynn committed a felony  we received a response from the white house refusing to provide any of the documents we requested   cummings said   the white house has refused to offer a single piece of paper in response to this committee s bipartisan request  according to the congressman  classified military documents have revealed that flynn failed to disclose payments he received from foreign governments before he became trump s national security advisor  this is a major problem   cummings said  i believe these documents should be declassified to the fullest extent possible without compromising sources or methods   he added cumings also noted that flynn s illegal actions could land him in prison for up to five years  chaffetz said that if these documents are correct  then flynn s actions were clearly illegal   and there will be consequences  as a former military officer  you simply cannot take money from russia  turkey or anybody else   chaffetz said   and it appears as if he did take that money  it was inappropriate  and there are repercussions for it as a violation of the law  the congressmen  who both serve as senior members of the house oversight committee  said that so far  they haven t seen a shred of evidence to suggest that flynn actually followed the law and got permission from the federal government before taking cash from multiple foreign governments you can watch video of their press conference  here featured image via win mcnamee getty images
