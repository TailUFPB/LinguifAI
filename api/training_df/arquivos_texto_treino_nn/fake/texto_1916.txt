another day  another  democrat  who is backing the nominee for the supreme court seat that the senate republicans stole from president obama  we have previously reported on how traitorous  democrats  like joe manchin  dino wv  and heidi heitcamp  dino nd  have turned tail and voted with republicans on many issues   most notably falling in line with republicans in order to confirm right wing potential supreme court justice neil gorsuch  now  we have a third to add to that list  joe donnelly of indiana  donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue  after meeting with judge gorsuch  conducting a thorough review of his record  and closely following his hearing before the senate judiciary committee  i believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well respected among his peers  the only redeeming statement donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the senate should still have a  vote threshold when it comes to confirming gorsuch or any other nominee for the supreme court  that is paramount  because it means that there is a true bipartisan senate consensus for the court s nominations and confirmations  which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary of course  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell cares not one whit about that  he and his fellow gop cronies have insisted that gorsuch will be on the court  one way or another   this means he is willing to breach the  vote rule to make sure gorsuch makes it to the supreme court  what the republicans did to president obama s nominee merrick garland is a travesty and a disgrace  and the democrats should do the same for gorsuch  for those who won t   primary them  we have no time for dinos in these troubled times  oppose trump at every turn  or the good folks at we will replace you will have you heads  as they should featured image via alex wong getty images
