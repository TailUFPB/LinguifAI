donald trump  jr  seems to have taken over as his father s campaign s supervisor of offensive posts  particularly with some of his most recent tweets  one was of a bowl of skittles  and asked us the really asinine question of whether we d eat those skittles if we knew three of them were poisoned  but not which ones  he s  rightfully  caught an awful lot of flack for that  but he likely didn t expect to catch it from the man who took that photo he probably also didn t expect the photographer to be who he is  a refugee living in the u k  david kittos fled turkish occupation of cyprus in the  and has been living in the u k  ever since  he is  quite understandably  angry by trump jr  s misappropriation of his image to promote a xenophobic  racist and anti refugee policy  this was not done with my permission  i don t support his politics and i would never take his money to use it in   when i was six years old  i was a refugee from the turkish occupation of cyprus so i would never approve the use of this image against refugees  oops  that s only a minor faux pas   oh wait  it s a major embarrassment to use an image that originates with a refugee to speak out against refugees kittos took the picture six years ago in his studio while he was experimenting with a specific type of flash  he s not on twitter  but friends familiar with his work let him know of this unauthorized and offensive use of one of his photos  which does appear on flickr just what is up with this campaign acting like copyright only applies to other people we digress  anyway kittos  photo was never intended for political use and he certainly would never release it or sell it for such usage  trump jr  and others  like the disgraceful former congresscritter joe walsh  don t seem to care  though  as long as they can make their point that refugees are dangerous wrigley  the makers of skittles candy  also upbraided trump jr  for his baloney  skittles are candy  refugees are people we don t feel it is an appropriate analogy  we will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing  for his part  kittos isn t sure if he s going to pursue legal action  however  he did say  i would like the trump campaign to delete the image  but they are probably not interested in what i have to say i was thinking about getting lawyers involved but i don t know if i have the patience this isn t about the money for me  they could have just bought a cheap image from a micro stock library  this is pure greed from them  i don t think they care about my feelings  they should not be stealing an image full stop  and they definitely need to learn how to source copyrighted work if they re the so called  law and order campaign  that they claim to be  but that s beside the point  kittos is  himself  a refugee  it s natural that he would feel especially upset by this use of his image  it also speaks to the insanely tone deaf nature of the trump campaign  they don t care about such trivia as long as their point is made featured image by john sommers ii getty images
