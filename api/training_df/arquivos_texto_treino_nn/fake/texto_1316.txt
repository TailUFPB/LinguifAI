judging by how disastrous donald trump s first overseas trip went  it couldn t have been any more clear that trump is not physically fit enough to deal with the exhausting demands of being president  he lacked the stamina and energy  as he was reportedly exhausted by the second day and he even had to make use of a golf cart to follow behind other world leaders as they walked this was truly humiliating for trump  especially after spending his entire presidential campaign insulting democratic rival hillary clinton s stamina   even though she has traveled extensively during her time as secretary of state and worked tirelessly on her presidential campaign despite having pneumonia  yet  fox news is choosing to ignore the obvious and decided to defend trump  which was absolutely ridiculous on wednesday  fox news host jon scott stated that because trump has the energy to tweet incoherent thoughts at night  he truly has the  stamina to be president   yes  really after midnight  trump had sent out a tweet whining about  the constant negative press covfefe   this obviously went viral for its insanity  and trump eventually followed it up with another weird tweet in the early hours of the morning trump is obviously losing his mind  but fox news believes that as long as he can tweet  trump is good enough to lead the country  scott commended this unpresidential behavior and argued  people are enjoying it  you ve got to give him that  it was a big issue during the campaign  he often accused hillary clinton of not having the energy  the stamina to be president  so  he was up tweeting at   a m   even if it wasn t exactly a  well  coherent tweet  and then at   a m   he deleted it  so  i guess the president is  as he said  a man who needs only a few hours sleep  at any rate  he got   retweets and   likes for  covfefe  absolutely disgusting  no wonder trump likes fox so much  you can watch below featured image via pool   getty images
