if you have been vacationing under a rock over the weekend  you might not be aware that donald trump jr  did a naughty  no  he didn t go out hunting for  and killing more defenseless animals to pose with   he went hunting for russians  specifically  he went hunting for a russian lawyer who claimed to have damaging information about hillary clinton  this was an effort to get opposition research on an opponent in an american political campaign from the russians  who were known to be engaged in spying inside the united states   former bush ethics lawyer richard painter said sunday of trump jr  s meeting  we do not get our opposition research from spies  we do not collaborate with russian spies  unless we want to be accused of treason  if this story is true  we d have one of them if not both of them in custody by now  and we d be asking them a lot of questions   painter said   this is unacceptable  this borders on treason  if it is not itself treason  trump jr  doesn t even bother disputing the truthfulness of the story  saying he did indeed collude with the russians in hopes of gaining  helpful  information about his dad s political opponent  but he says that she had  no meaningful information  so his engaging in a little light treason is not an issue in the least  according to trump jr   ivanka trump s husband jared kushner and trump campaign manager paul manafort also attended the meeting  trump s son says he  had to listen  even if the meeting  went nowhere  obviously i m the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent  went nowhere but had to listen  https   t co   donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  july    white house spokesmoron sarah huckabee sanders agrees with trump jr  that a little collusion with a kremlin connected lawyer isn t a hug deal  in fact  the only real problem is the people who exposed the details  she said during an off camera press briefing  the only thing i see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed  following the admission and the additional  leaked  details trump jr  left out  he hired a criminal defense attorney because he did absolutely nothing wrong and there s nothing to see here where there s smoke there s fire    and there s a lot of very  very russian smoke   enough to suffocate our country if nothing is done about it featured image via screengrab
