with a very dramatic flair  senator john mccain joined his republican colleagues  sens  lisa murkowski and susan collins  in torpedoing the gop s trumpcare bill  but just days earlier  everyone with any sense was absolutely furious with mccain for voting  yes  to advance trumpcare to the senate floor for a full vote we all felt betrayed  particularly since that  yes  had come from a man recently diagnosed with a very aggressive type of cancer  he has to return to his home state of arizona for treatments most people can t afford without insurance  that many can t afford even with insurance  and that could bankrupt entire families later on if things like lifetime caps on coverage are ever reinstated but it s possible that mccain actually had a grander plan  and his  yes  vote  moving the bill out of committee  was carefully calculated  the senate was trying to pass trumpcare under a process known as reconciliation  which only requires a simple majority to pass  instead of the usual  vote threshold  check this out amazing  also clear now that mccain s yes on motion to proceed is what killed the bill  https   t co  pic twitter com jzqvqmizmj  steve simitzis       july     what mccain did was make it so they can t advance another trumpcare bill to the floor and try to pass it as a reconciliation measure  at least  not without some massive changes to what they re trying to do  the senate can actually try to pass up to three reconciliation measures each year  but only one each for spending  revenues  and debt limit  they can also put any two or all three into a single bill while republicans are still trying to scramble to put something together  they ll have a very difficult time getting another reconciliation bill to the floor so mccain seems to have made a point of advancing the bill specifically so he  along with murkowski  collins  and the entire democratic wing of the senate  could effectively kill it for the rest of the fiscal year  and it was a giant f ck you to mcconnell as well  who was sure he had the votes to pass it since mccain had voted  yes  on the procedural motion featured image via mark wilson getty images
