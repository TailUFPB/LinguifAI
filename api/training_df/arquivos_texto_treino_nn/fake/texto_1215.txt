the entire nation has been glued to the coverage of fired fbi director james comey s testimony all day  when it was finally over  pundits continued to pick it apart  meanwhile  the republican national committee claimed victory for donald trump in the government s investigation into potential collusion between team trump and the russians  trump s own lawyer all but called james comey a liar in a statement whose clear purpose was to discredit the testimony altogether  and perhaps most pathetically of all  house speaker paul ryan tried to excuse trump s inappropriate  loyalty  requests of comey as sheer ignorance of how washington works  all in all  the gop message is one of  nothing to see here  folks  despite these bizarre public statements on the part of top republicans  there is one prominent conservative who is willing to tell the truth about how the gop is really feeling about the situation regarding trump and the russians  in short  they are shitting their pants  conservative columnist and editor of the weekly standard bill kristol tweeted  i happen to have seen various gop senators this afternoon  trust me  basically  they re not just concerned  they re pretty terrified  i happen to have seen various gop senators this afternoon  trust me  basically  they re not just concerned  they re pretty terrified  https   t co   bill kristol   billkristol  june    tweet comes as a result of an article in politico that referred to the republican leadership s interest in what james comey would be saying on capitol hill as a  collective yawn   since this wouldn t be the first time the gop has sold their souls and lied through their teeth to cover for trump  i am more inclined to believe bill kristol  further  they know they cannot publicly criticize trump or show any sort of wavering in their confidence in his innocence in this whole russia mess without having trump light them up on twitter and having his fans come for them so  in other words  this russia stuff is getting so hot that even republicans cannot privately deny it any longer  but  they ll never say a word in public against trump  because they care more about saving their proverbial political asses than they do about this country featured image via drew angerer getty images
