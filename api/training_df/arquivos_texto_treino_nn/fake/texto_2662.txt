last week  news broke that white supremacist and former breitbart head stever bannon had been given a seat on the  principals committee    a role usually reserved for generals   while the roles of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the director of national intelligence had been  downgraded  and they were told to only attend meetings when issues in their direct area of expertise are being considered but why would trump choose to place this much power in the hands of steve bannon  it turns out it wasn t a choice  the new york times reports that trump is signing executive orders without bothering to find out what is in them  and that it was not until after he had signed it that trump realized one of his numerous executive orders had made bannon one of the most powerful men in the country mr  priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the west wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs  but for the moment  mr  bannon remains the president s dominant adviser  despite mr  trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the national security council  a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban yes  you read that correctly  our president cares so little about doing his job properly that he doesn t even bother to find out the details of the executive orders he is signing   even if he is granting an insane amount of power to someone who should not be taken seriously when offering his opinion on ice cream flavors bannon s influence has steadily grown as trump s time in office has passed  to the point that it is not unreasonable to call him   not trump    president   while this is a popular turn of events among white supremacists  a group that was courted heavily by bannon s propaganda outlet  the rest of the country is steadily growing weary of dealing with someone like bannon   who has described himself as a  leninist  who wants to  destroy the state    having any power at all featured image via screengrab
