if there s one news organization that donald trump can usually always rely upon to be in his corner  it s fox news  the media branch of the republican party will pretty much always show bias towards any republican candidate or conservative ideal  most of the time even without trying to find any facts of any kind however  it looks as though trump is going to hate the new poll that fox news revealed showing who  according to them and their viewers  won the first presidential debate winning with   of viewers polled was none other than democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton in fact  trump was only able to garner   of those polled to say that he won  with   saying it was a tie new fox poll  who won first debate   specialreport https   t co  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  september    you re any good at math  that s not even close  not even remotely close  hillary got well more than half of those polled saying that she definitively won  while trump probably held onto the few who were going to say that he won no matter what the bar is set so incredibly low for trump  too  if he kept his pants on  those   pulling for trump were still going to say that he won  so  for hillary to sweep up this debate as a win in her column with even fox news viewers  well  that s bad news for trump and his floundering campaign it will be interesting to see how he behaves in the next debate to try to sway viewers featured photo by drew angerer getty images  twitter
