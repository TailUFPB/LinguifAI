republicans are caught between a rock and a hard place and democrats are poised to take advantage of the chaos the avalanche that buried the republican party on friday is causing mass panic among gop candidates up and down the  ballot trump s vulgar remarks about groping women has resulted in many republicans withdrawing their support of his presidential campaign  but whether they stick with him or turn their backs on him  it s a double edged sword that is making republicans bleed out with under a month to go before election day the republican nominee has been a toxic force ever since he threw his hat into the ring over a year ago  and while that has hurt republicans among independent and moderate republican voters in addition to the many groups trump has insulted  republicans who are just now running away from trump have angered the conservative base that somehow still supports him and the political consequences could cut deep if trump has his way  even if he loses in november  trump could still bring many republicans down with him  especially after this threat he posted on twitter so many self righteous hypocrites  watch their poll numbers   and elections   go down   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    in case you re confused  that s trump attacking the republicans who have denounced him since friday s bombshell  and there is no doubt that trump s supporters are going to remember who betrayed them when it s time to vote trump even escalated the threat by instructing his team to launch the attack according to the new york times in a set of talking points sent to his supporters sunday morning  mr  trump s campaign urged them to attack turncoat republicans as  more concerned with their political future than they are about the country  as we all know  trump s team has received a lot of television time this year  which means any republican who has distanced themselves from trump is about to get a whole lot of negative press and that s really bad news for republicans  because as the times further reports   much of the party appeared to be in a state of paralysis  uncertain of how to achieve political distance from mr  trump without enraging millions of voters who remained loyal to his campaign  specifically  republicans now fear losing both houses of congress  which would be a historic political victory for democrats at a time when gerrymadering basically guaranteed that the gop would at least hold onto power over the house of representatives steven law  a longtime lieutenant of the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky  said the party had descended into chaos  the republican party is caught in a theater fire  people are just running to different exits as fast as they can   said mr  law  who now heads the  super pac  american crossroads one member of the house republican leadership  conceding its majority was now in jeopardy  compared the situation to the  scandal involving a florida congressman s inappropriate conduct with congressional pages  if that scandal was a house fire  this lawmaker said  mr  trump had brought on the political equivalent of a nuclear attack democrats see this as a major opportunity to seek wins in republican leaning states such as indiana and georgia  and even wins in red states like arizona  if successful  we could be seeing a reversal of the  midterm election that swept republicans into office should it come to pass that republicans lose across the board on november   we could be finally seeing the last gasp of republican reliance upon it s conservative base  which means republicans will have to move towards the center if they want to be politically relevant again featured image  win mcnamee getty images
