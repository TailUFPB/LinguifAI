it s become more than obvious that donald trump has absolutely no filter when he speaks  he says exactly what is on his mind  and as it would appear  he may even believe his own lies what trump also seems to believe  is that he s the best thing that ever happened to the world and we should all be grateful to be alive during his existence on the planet  he s obsessed with how much people either like him or don t like him  and what he s most obsessed with is ratings  he seems to live for ratings and how many people saw him at any particular time  it s very pathetic that he seems to need this gratification however  in a recent unfiltered moment from trump  he compared himself to    and the ratings  face the nation  got covering the world trade center collapsing in an interview with the associated press  as they spoke with trump  they said  and that s one of the difficulties i think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party  but then it s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people  this is when trump decided to say  no i have  it s interesting  i have  seem to get very high ratings  i definitely  you know chris wallace had   million people  it s the highest in the history of the show  i have all the ratings for all those morning shows  when i go  they go double  triple  chris wallace  look back during the army navy football game  i did his show that morning  um  ok  and ap responded with   i remember  right   however  trump wasn t done  he continued  it had   million people  it s the highest they ve ever had  on any  on air   cbs  face the nation  host john  dickerson had   million people  it s the highest for  face the nation  or as i call it   deface the nation   it s the highest for  deface the nation  since the world trade center  since the world trade center came down  it s a tremendous advantage  he then went off on a tangent about the  fake news  or whatever the fact that he s comparing  and randomly so  his ratings on a show to the coverage of the world trade center collapsing isn t only bizarre  it s depraved  he s literally trying to say that he s so popular  he can beat the ratings of the worst domestic disaster on american soil  not only that  he says this after making a terrible joke what the f  k is wrong with him  this is about as shameful as one could ever possibly get featured photo via getty images
