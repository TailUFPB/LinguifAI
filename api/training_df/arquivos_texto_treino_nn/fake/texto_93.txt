good news everyone  all crime in texas has been solved  how do we know this  because fort bend county sheriff troy e  nehls has announced that he s going on a crusade against protected political speech apparently  the sheriff saw someone s anti trump sticker he placed on his truck and decided to take action pleasing the tortured little snowflakes who contacted him about it but also showing that not only he but an unnamed prosecutor is corrupt as f ck  i have received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along fm   if you know who owns this truck or it is yours  i would like to discuss it with you   the sheriff posted on facebook wednesday   our prosecutor has informed us she would accept disorderly conduct charges regarding it  but i feel we could come to an agreement regarding a modification to it  yes  disorderly conduct  for a sticker  because it s anti trump sorry  sheriff  no  agreement  is necessary  as it is not a crime to criticize the president or people who voted for him  naturally  americans stopped by to laugh at the sheriff who claims that saying mean things about trump constitutes an  immediate breach of the peace         unfortunately for the sheriff  this matter was decided in the  supreme court case  cohen v  california  a man was convicted for disturbing the peace by wearing a  f ck the draft  jacket  but the supreme court told those who would abuse the justice system by punishing protected political speech to f ck off unfortunately  the goal here isn t to successfully prosecute someone  it s to make sure that the owner of the truck pays for being mean to trump featured image via screengrab
