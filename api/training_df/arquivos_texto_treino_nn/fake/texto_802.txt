the whole world knows about the bombshell report of donald trump jr   jared kushner  and the former campaign manager for donald trump s  presidential run  paul manafort  holding a secret meeting with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya  of course  despite how shady this is on its face  team trump s party line has been   nothing to see here   well  it seems that there just might be something to see here  considering that veselnitskaya actually once represented a russian spy agency reuters reports that veselnitskaya was involved in a bitter fight over elite  exclusive pieces of property in moscow  who was her client  the fsb  of course  meaning  essentially  she was working for the kremlin and vladimir putin  supposedly  that connection ended in  when veselnitskaya won the case for the fsb  however  with the way russia operates  once a russian spy operative  always a russian spy operative  here is how reuters describes the chain of events reuters could not find a record of when and by whom the lawsuit   which dates back to at least    was first lodged  but appeal documents show that rosimushchestvo  russia s federal government property agency  was involved  it did not immediately respond to a request for comment veselnitskaya and her firm kamerton consulting represented  military unit   in the property dispute  the documents show now  to play devil s advocate  it is very possible that trump jr  and the rest didn t know veselnitskaya s history  that is possible  but certainly not probable  considering the fact that trump jr  himself has admitted that his family has been getting money from russia to fund their business ventures for years  that makes it highly unlikely that the trumps and those in their orbit weren t well aware of who this woman was  what her background was  and who she worked for at the end of the day  this is a woman that never should have been allowed into this nation at all  and she definitely shouldn t have been anywhere an american presidential campaign  all of this is shady as hell  and hopefully robert mueller can get to the bottom of it while we still have a republic to save featured image via flickr
