on tuesday night  fox news blowhard and right wing messiah bill o reilly made it very clear that republicans  primary focus comes down to one thing  the white dominated power structure  and those dastardly liberals  he says  are out to destroy it o reilly says that liberals want to get rid of the electoral college   which has twice in recent memory allowed someone completely unqualified to assume office despite losing the popular vote   because they want power taken away from the white establishment  the left in america is demanding that the electoral college system put into place in  be scrapped  but there is a hidden reason for this   o reilly said  adding that voting patterns reveal that most minority votes go to the democratic party  this is unsurprising to anyone who pays attention to the way republicans talk about muslims  hispanics  women  african americans  and pretty much anyone whose skin tone is darker than a piece of classroom chalk  but to o reilly  it s a conspiracy against white people   a conspiracy to silence white rural voters by counting each and every person s vote equally  no matter where they live  very few commentators will tell you that the heart of liberalism in america today is based on race  it permeates almost every issue  that white men have set up a system of oppression  that system must be destroyed  o reilly may scorn the idea  but white men really have set up a system of oppression  time magazine notes that the electoral college largely exists to benefit white slave owners in the south at the philadelphia convention  the visionary pennsylvanian james wilson proposed direct national election of the president  but the savvy virginian james madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the south   the right of suffrage was much more diffusive  in the northern than the southern states  and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of negroes   in other words  in a direct election system  the north would outnumber the south  whose many slaves  more than half a million in all  of course could not vote  but the electoral college a prototype of which madison proposed in this same speech instead let each southern state count its slaves  albeit with a two fifths discount  in computing its share of the overall count virginia emerged as the big winner the california of the founding era with  out of a total of  electoral votes allocated by the philadelphia constitution  more than a quarter of the  needed to win an election in the first round  after the  census  wilson s free state of pennsylvania had   more free persons than virginia  but got   fewer electoral votes  perversely  the more slaves virginia  or any other slave state  bought or bred  the more electoral votes it would receive  were a slave state to free any blacks who then moved north  the state could actually lose electoral votes if the system s pro slavery tilt was not overwhelmingly obvious when the constitution was ratified  it quickly became so  for  of the constitution s first  years  a white slaveholding virginian occupied the presidency  white men have largely abandoned the democrats  and the left believes it s because of racism that they want to punish minorities  keep them down  o reilly told his mindless audience  apparently forgetting that conservatives regularly list the ways they want to punish minorities and keep them down  voter i d  laws  for example   summing up  left wants power taken away from the white establishment  they want a profound change in the way america is run  taking voting power away from the white precincts is the quickest way to do that  this isn t the first time o reilly has made similar complaints  in   he and john mccain joined together to prattle on about how liberals want to break down the  white christian male power structure  that has been long established in our country  in   he complained to megyn kelly that the  white establishment is now the minority  o reilly s latest rant was so stupid that the typically nonsensical and terrible  soopermexican  over at rightscoop put him on blast is that really what conservatism is conserving  white establishment power  here i thought it was about free markets  free people  and getting the government out of our way  well  i feel stupid  i wish the gop had mentioned this earlier well darn  as you probably know  i m a minority conservative  and i really hate and despise how the left makes all politics about racial identity  as i wrote here  but the age of trump makes it sound like  conservatism  is being redefined as pro white identity politics  this can t be a coincidence  right watch o reilly s latest racist rant below featured image via screengrab
