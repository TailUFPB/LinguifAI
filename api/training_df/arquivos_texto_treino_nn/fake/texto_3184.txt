yesterday  the wall street journal s editor in chief  gerard baker  announced that his paper would no longer call out trump on his lies  sure  they ll still report what he says  but apparently  baker thinks that it should be up to the readers to decide whether trump is lying or telling the truth  in other words  baker is tossing out journalistic responsibility  probably to avoid becoming a casualty of trump s crusade against the  dishonest media  dan rather  former cbs evening news anchor and veteran journalist  has a different take on this  in explaining his perspective  he took the wall street journal through a paper shredder for baker s new stance  blasting baker s decision right out of the gate  a lie  is a lie  is a lie  journalism  as i was taught it  is a process of getting as close to some valid version of the truth as is humanly possible  and one of my definitions of news is information that the powerful don t want you to know  basically  if you can concretely back up your assertions that someone is being less than honest  then  as a journalist  it is your responsibility to say so  baker tried to differentiate between lies and misstatements by saying the word  lie  indicates an intent to deceive in yesterday s interview  but rather sees right through that  as do the rest of us   it is not the proper role of journalists to meet lies especially from someone of mr  trump s stature and power by hiding behind semantics and euphemisms  our role is to call it as we see it  based on solid reporting  when something is  in fact  a demonstrable lie  it is our responsibility to say so  little green footballs  charles johnson also sees a massive problem with baker s decision  and posted this series of tweets about it wsj editor gerard baker said they won t call trump s lies  lies   but check out how many articles they printed saying hillary clinton lies   charles johnson   greenfootballs  january    greenfootballs something like this https   t co  they had no problem using that word for her   orange cosby   unabogie  january    t find a single wsj article  news or opinion  referring to trump lying  but i found many articles calling hillary clinton a liar   charles johnson   greenfootballs  january    don t have time to count how many clinton  liar  articles they published  looks like hundreds at least   charles johnson   greenfootballs  january    absolute  hypocritical horseshit coming from the wall street journal  then  it really does look like baker s trying to cover his ass to avoid ending up in trump s anti media crosshairs there are things trump says that are demonstrably lies  even under baker s definition  for instance  he claimed he never told people to check out alicia machado s alleged  sex tape   when he literally tweeted   check out sex tape   he ran an ad that supposedly showed mexicans streaming across our border  which was actually a recording from morocco  his campaign later tried to backpedal on that  to no avail  he claimed to have seen a top secret tape of a u s  plane unloading cash and giving it to iranian officials in iran  he and his campaign tried to backpedal on that  too   he also claimed he sent investigators to hawaii to look into obama s birth certificate  and then said they couldn t believe what they were finding  that never happened and that was all before he was even elected  it s really hard to wonder whether he had an intent to deceive with these  given how they played into his larger goals as the washington post s greg sargent points out  he doesn t throw falsehoods around casually  his claim that he saw thousands of muslims cheering the twin towers as they fell from the streets of new jersey was part of a larger effort to demonize muslims and boost his own appeal to the xenophobic right after explaining how trump s birtherism was part of a larger effort to gain political clout and legitimacy  sargent goes on to say  in these cases  was trump lying  the standard that baker adopts   that there must be a provable intent to mislead   seems woefully inadequate to informing readers about what trump is really up to here  sure  it s possible that trump continued to believe these things after they were debunked  we cannot prove otherwise  but so what  if we accept that it s possible to prove something to be false   which baker does  judging by his own comments   then we presumably also accept that this can be adequately proved to trump  and so  trump is telling a falsehood even though it has been demonstrated to him to be a falsehood  and that s what dan rather is getting at in his facebook post  we are being confronted by versions of what are claimed to be  the truth  that resemble something spewed out by a fertilizer spreader in a wind tunnel  and there is every indication that this will only continue in the tweets and statements of the man who will now hold forth from behind the great seal of the president of the united states  read his full
