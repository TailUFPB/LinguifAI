it s gotta be hard these days to be john mccain  standing up to donald trump is pretty unpopular among republicans these days  and we ve seen the proof in how quickly the base turned on some otherwise solidly conservative gop senators who have decided the age of trump is just too much for them first tennessee s bob corker then mccain s fellow arizona senator jeff flake dropped out of the running for reelection  possibly dashing the gop s hopes for holding on to the senate in the  elections  but regardless of the fact that they ve both been what old mitt romney might call  severely conservative   red meat trump voters turned on the two like villagers with pitchforks that could be  however  because they don t have the credentials john mccain has  when he trolled trump hard last week on the  bone spurs  he used as an excuse to dodge the draft with all of his silver spoon  private school pals  trump tried to clap back with a warning that  people have to be careful because at some point i fight back  mccain s answer  i have faced tougher adversaries  now  you might think donald trump is at least smart enough not to come at a former pow with some weak stuff like that  but you d be wrong  laughably wrong  in fact  go ahead and have a little laugh  because you re in good company mccain thought it was hilarious appearing on the view the following day  the panel gave the senior arizona senator a chance to expound a little on his short response to the president s threat  he said he would  fight back  and it wouldn t be pretty  are you scared  mccain didn t answer immediately because he was busy laughing his ass off  no  i mean  almost with tears in his eyes  there he is  next to his daughter   who just landed the spot on this show   and this old man looks like he s going to cry from laughing so hard  every woman on the panel is cracking up  people offstage are howling i just want to know donald trump has seen this clip  i can die happy as long as i know donnie daycare has watched this octogenarian cry tears of laughter at the prospect of being scared of little old him enjoy mccain is asked if he s afraid of trump  he laughs for about  straight second  pic twitter com   kyle griffin     october    image via alex wong getty images
