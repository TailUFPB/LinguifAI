now that we ve known donald trump well for a while now  we should all know that the man who occupies the oval office  for now  likes to make sh t up  his mind even manufactures people  like his former spokesman john barron  who was actually trump  since the campaign trail  though  trump has been talking about his friend  jim   and much like john barron  jim doesn t appear to exist a few weeks ago  the new york times published an incredibly long and comprehensive list of all the lies donald trump has told  just since taking office  that was a few weeks ago  though   before the  and before he claimed his son had a meeting with russians about his campaign and that trump sr  knew nothing about it between trump s regular pattern of lying and the fact that he already has a pattern of making people up  it shouldn t be a surprise that the media hasn t been able to find his friend jim  oh  and by the way  jim is kind of a xenophobic asshole the way trump tells it   jim is a friend who loves paris and used to visit every year  yet when trump travels to the city thursday for his first time as president  it s unlikely that jim will tag along  jim doesn t go to paris anymore  trump says that s because the city has been infiltrated by foreign extremists whether jim exists is unclear  trump has never given his last name  the white house has not responded to a request for comment about who jim is or whether he will be on the trip source  washington postthis isn t the first time jim has complained about all the brown people in paris  in february  trump told an audience that jim loved paris  but alas  he doesn t go there anymore because  paris is no longer paris  while anecdotes  often exaggerated  have long been a tool for political orators  we can t think of anyone who has made up an imaginary friend  that s just weird featured image via sean gallup getty images
