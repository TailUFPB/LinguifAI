trump has long claimed that he was legally not allowed to release his tax returns because of an alleged  audit  that required him to keep them a secret  this has been repeatedly debunked by legal experts and tax experts   and now trump himself  after learning rachel maddow had obtained his  tax returns and was planning on breaking it on live television  trump s white house freaked out and released the tax returns themselves  so much for the audit lie the statement  like many of trump s reactionary tantrums  was light on culpability and focused mostly on whining about how unfair it was that his taxes would be released this way you know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago ironically  the question of whether the current president is in violation of the law   specifically conflict of interest laws   is exactly why rachel maddow and other investigative journalists are looking into trump s taxes in the first place  and because he is the first president in decades to flatly refuse to release them   leaking  the documents to the public is the only way they ll come to light wh responds to msnbc report on trump tax returns   you know you are desperate when you willing to violate the law   pic twitter com dcedfdxwcc  jim acosta   acosta  march    s statement   which appears to have been hastily written  in part  by trump himself   claims he paid around   million in taxes while pulling in around   million in income  the document  as summarized by the daily beast  goes into more detail the documents show trump and his wife melania paying    million in regular federal income tax a rate of less than   however  the trumps paid an additional   million in the so called  alternative minimum tax   or amt  trump has previously called for the elimination of this tax so in trump s ideal world  he would like billionaires like himself to pay a   tax while using loopholes and tax havens to avoid paying the lion s share of what he owes  that s pretty pathetic coming from a person who has been using his time in office to dismantle welfare programs and cut spending in the arts and sciences there is an alternative theory about the tax returns  trump  leaked  them himself  all so he could freak out about it later johnston  possible potus leaked returns    donald has a long history of leaking material about himself when he thinks it s in his interest    betsy klein   betsyklein  march    would his  interest  be  one could argue that this might be the very best tax return he has  as reporters get closer to his more recent filings  he may have leaked this document to placate journalists  be seen throwing a tantrum  and hope that everyone moved on  if that s the case  reporters should be encouraged to dig even harder  they have clearly struck a nerve featured image via michael reynolds pool getty images
