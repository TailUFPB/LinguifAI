just when you thought support of donald trump would drop to zero it turns out there is still one group that backs him  percent  despite claiming to be all about  family values  and biblical principles  conservative evangelical leaders still refuse to revoke their endorsement of the republican nominee in   trump made vulgar comments about women while bragging to access hollywood reporter billy bush that he can grope any woman he wants because he is famous  you know i m automatically attracted to beautiful   i just start kissing them   trump said   it s like a magnet  just kiss  i don t even wait  and when you re a star they let you do it  you can do anything  grab them by the p ssy  the offensive remarks were finally enough to cause many republicans to condemn trump and call for him to drop out of the race but conservative  christian  leaders like family research council president tony perkins and faith and freedom coalition president ralph reed say they both still support and want trump to be president of the united states  my personal support for donald trump has never been based upon shared values  it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as  justices on the supreme court that ignore the constitution  america s continued vulnerability to islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last    years   perkins said  voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life  defend religious freedom  create jobs  and oppose the iran nuclear deal   added reed   ten year old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns  wow these two so called  men of god  are literally still supporting donald trump and think his remarks aren t a big deal at all  and they have the nerve to call themselves  christians  it makes one wonder what it will take to make these assholes change their minds about trump because sexually assaulting women certainly doesn t bother them at all  and frankly  they should be ousted from their positions and ostracized by the christian community they claim to represent featured image via wikimedia
