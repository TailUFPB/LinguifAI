when donald trump made his acceptance speech after winning the election  many of us were skeptical of his peaceful promise to be a president for all americans   especially after he spent his entire presidential campaign insulting the muslim  hispanic  lgbt  black  disabled and female americans  we had every right to remain guarded  and trump is proving us right on the first day of trump s weird  completely unnecessary  victory tour   trump mocked the majority of americans by making fun of the ones that didn t want him to be the next president of the united states  at the rally in cincinnati  ohio last night  trump railed against the  extremely dishonest press  for underestimating and criticizing him  completely ignoring the fact that most of america did not want him to win seemingly oblivious to the fact that he lost the popular vote by millions  trump railed against specific members of the media  such as abc s martha raddatz for having an extremely emotional reaction after realizing trump would become america s future president  imitating raddatz crying  trump said  how about when a major anchor who hosted a debate started crying when she realized that we won  how about that  tears   no  tell me this isn t true  trump also explained how he d been watching the shocked reactions on people s faces as he followed the election results on tv  and seemed truly amused by it  for a future leader of our country to show such a lack of respect  maturity and sensitivity to the very people he is going to be representing and leading is repulsive and should be condemned  it s truly horrifying behavior you can watch trump insult americans in the video below trump does not have the ability to be gracious or compassionate about anything  and it s clear that there won t be much improvement in the weeks leading up to his presidency  if this is what trump s speeches are going to look like  we re in for a long and painful four years featured image via win mcnamee getty images
