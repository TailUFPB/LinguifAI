donald trump has never been senate majority leader mitch mcconnell s  r ky  favorite person  that uneasy relationship deteriorated further in recent days and weeks  as trump proceeded to openly mock and humiliate mcconnell  blaming him for everything from the failed attempts to repeal obamacare to the entire situation of the fractured gop s stalled agenda  now  since trump had such a disgraceful response to the white supremacist violence in charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti racism activist heather heyer and the injuries of countless others  it seems that trump and mcconnell are engaged in what the new york times is calling their own little  quote   cold war  according to the new bombshell report  trump doesn t even talk to mcconnell   the one most important man in the legislative branch when it comes to getting his agenda passed  the new york times reports  the relationship between president trump and senator mitch mcconnell  the majority leader  has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks  and mr  mcconnell has privately expressed uncertainty that mr  trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises what was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility the article further suggests that when trump and mcconnell were speaking  trump didn t just keep his taunts to the usual juvenile derision via twitter  no  apparently  on august   mcconnell and trump had some kind of conversation  and trump could not help going after mcconnell to his face  there are no details regarding exactly what was said  but knowing trump  it was likely pretty scathing and humiliating for mcconnell  who seems to consider himself your typical dignified grown man  he is likely simply done with trump s playground bully behavior and is no longer going to dignify trump s ignorance and taunts with responses it also doesn t help that mcconnell s wife  elaine chao  is trump s transportation secretary  she is an immigrant  and arrived from taiwan as a child  speaking no english  under trump s new immigration plans  she would never have been allowed into this country  further  to top it all off  secretary chao had to be humiliated standing next to trump during his charlottesville tirade  in which he defended white supremacists  think about that   how it must have made mcconnell feel to see his wife being used that way in such a despicable  bigoted  and unhinged trump rant all of this has resulted in much more criticism than one would expect from mitch mcconnell in public  but  according to the times  mcconnell is much more angry with trump than he is letting on  and he is even wondering if trump will be the gop s leader for much longer  given his recent behavior  again  from the new york times mr  mcconnell has fumed over mr  trump s regular threats against fellow republicans and criticism of senate rules  and questioned mr  trump s understanding of the presidency in a public speech  mr  mcconnell has made sharper comments in private  describing mr  trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing in offhand remarks  mr  mcconnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where mr  trump s presidency may be headed  and has mused about whether mr  trump will be in a position to lead the republican party into next year s elections and beyond  according to people who have spoken to him directly all in all  those two might never speak again  the thing is  though  donald trump has severely underestimated mitch mcconnell s power  the gop took a chance and hitched their wagon to this ignorant  incompetent orange fool because their voters left them no choice  however  they now clearly regret it   and said regret just might be inching toward hastening trump s removal from office featured image via justin sullivan getty images
