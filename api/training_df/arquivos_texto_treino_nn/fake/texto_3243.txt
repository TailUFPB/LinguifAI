barring something completely unforeseen  donald trump will be our new president in just a few weeks  that means that all personal liberties could fly right out the window  except for one  the liberty to discriminate based on who people love  trump and the new congress haven t even taken office yet and the legislative hatred has already begun ted cruz  who s never met a gay person or a woman who didn t make him feel self righteous  is expected to reintroduce the first amendment defense act  fada   which  despite its completely inoffensive name  is all about allowing bigots to freely discriminate  trump is expected to sign it in the text  the bill says that businesses can refuse service based on one of two beliefs  and both are ridiculous  that marriage  is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman  or  sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage  as for the second one  well  unless a couple is entering an establishment demanding space to specifically have sex  it doesn t seem there s ever a reason to declare that one  as for the first  marriage is what the law says it is  and the law says that marriage is between two consenting adults who get married  okay  that s not the legal definition  but the supreme court  when antonin scalia was still alive  said that defining marriage is unconstitutional the ceo of equality texas agrees that the proposed law shouldn t be a law at all  the legislation that senator cruz is proposing specifically elevates two narrow interpretations above any other religious practice   chuck smith  ceo of equality texas said   the bill is titled the first amendment defense act  but in reality it is an unconstitutional attempt to totally redefine what the first amendment protects  source  kxanit would also put the federal government in the weird position of suing itself  the fada would allow businesses to sue if the government wouldn t let them discriminate  the u s  attorney general would be required to defend the businesses against the government trump will likely sign the bill  at least according to his campaign s website  if i am elected president and congress passes the first amendment defense act  i will sign it to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of catholics and the beliefs of americans of all faiths  here s the video the other bad news is that by the time this reaches the supreme court  we will likely have another conservative justice featured image via drew angerer getty images
