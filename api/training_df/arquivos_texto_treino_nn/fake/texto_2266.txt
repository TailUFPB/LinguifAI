donald trump is playing a dangerous game by falsely accusing his predecessor of wiretapping his phone lines before the election  most people realize when trump seems unhinged in his twitter timeline  it s usually to distract the public from what is really going on  such as his scandalous ties to russia and his new travel ban which remarkably resembles his old travel ban  republicans and democrats are both left scratching their heads over trump s accusations republican rep  trey gowdy  s c    who spent two years investigating hillary clinton over the attacks in benghazi  said monday he s seen no evidence to support trump s claim that former president obama wiretapped his office during the presidential campaign  i don t think the fbi is the obama team  and i don t think the men and women who are career prosecutors at  belong to any team other than a blindfolded woman holding a pair of scales   gowdy told politico  we have the tools to keep us safe and it s prudent for those tools to be used lawfully and appropriately   gowdy continued   if they re not used lawfully and appropriately  there s a paper trail and we ll be able to find it out  gowdy continued to say that it was  hard to cross examine tweets  and any information regarding a fisa warrant used against trump would be available to the trump administration by the way  if a fisa warrant was issued  that would have to be allowed by a judge  meaning  in that instance  there would be some sort of evidence against trump  so much so as to wiretap his phones or at least any calls to and or from russia  the obama team is no longer in charge   gowdy added   so any information the current department of justice has that suggests the previous department of justice acted inappropriately  they are welcome to release it  but there is no evidence to release  a sitting president cannot issue a wiretap  that s not how presidenting works  k  there is a process to go through first even jason chaffetz said today that there is no evidence to back up trump s claim  still yet  chaffetz is willing to investigate trump s claim while refusing to launch a probe into the alleged president s ties to russia featured image via alex wong getty images
