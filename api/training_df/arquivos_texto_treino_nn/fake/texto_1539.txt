as everybody who still believes in democracy and true freedom reels from fbi director james comey s firing  the media and members of congress have been frantically working to get the deets on what happened  rep  adam schiff  the ranking member of the house intelligence committee  which is conducting its own investigation into russia   just dropped a truth bomb about comey  and trump would be wise to go find a cave and hide in it now schiff was asked  on cnn  whether he believes this is a cover up  he doesn t  he thinks it s something worse  it s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  after all  the president calls this whole investigation a fake  and here you had an fbi director who was seriously looking into whether trump associates were colluding with the russians  the end of his statement to cnn should be particularly jarring to anybody familiar with history  watch below rep  adam schiff on firing of fbi director james comey   it s a brazen interference with a criminal investigation  https   t co   cnn   cnn  may    this year  the white house tried to get the fbi to publicly dispute stories appearing in the new york times about contacts between trump s associates and russian actors  they ve been trying to bend the fbi to their will for a long time  and when comey wouldn t lie under oath for them  or end his russia probe  trump decided to fire him in fact  jeff sessions was actually told to find reasons to fire comey  and they ve been working on it for at least a week  trump likely wants someone in that position who ll end that investigation before they discover something really damning  he wants a puppet if trump was innocent  the white house wouldn t have been looking for reasons to fire comey now  comey may not have even been fired  but if he was  trump probably would have done it when he took office under the guise of getting a fresh start  as schiff said to cnn  this is not the behavior of an innocent man featured image via mark wilson getty images
