sally yates  testimony before a congressional committee on the events leading up to trump s disgraced former national security adviser michael flynn  resigning  and her own firing for speaking out against him had always promised to contain some explosive revelations  and it didn t take long for the match to be lit early into yates  appearance in front of the committee  she got down to brass tacks  she had told trump three separate times that michael flynn was trouble  in every case she was ignored  save for white house counsel demanding to know whether flynn was facing a criminal charge  what s more  yates testified that she has specifically told the trump administration that there was a great deal of evidence to suggest flynn was either susceptible to blackmail from the russians or already compromised  again  she was ignored and then later fired particularly damning  yates said that she watched in horror as flynn s own lies about his involvement with the russians was being passed along to the media by others within the administration  including vice president mike pence   pence later confirmed this by claiming he had believed what flynn was telling him at the time   she noted that this created a situation where the national security adviser was digging an increasingly deep hole for himself with lies and implicating everyone around him as well  she added that this was not lost on the russians  who   given their relationship with flynn   were holding cold  hard proof of flynn s lies and could threaten to release it at any time yates   the national security adviser  essentially  could be blackmailed by the russians    via  msnbc pic twitter com   kyle griffin     may    s a classic blackmail set up  let the mark get in too deep  make sure the risk of exposure is too big a cost to bear  then use that vulnerability against him or her unfortunately  trump s administration chose to stick by flynn rather than slip out of the noose that was rapidly tightening around their necks  making matters worse  by repeating flynn s lies  they were also exposing themselves to blackmail  a white house run by a person famous for never apologizing to anyone in his life was walking headlong into a massive scandal   what would they do to avoid responsibility for it as yates put it   you don t want the national security adviser to be in a position where the russians have leverage over him at some point  the debate over what exactly trump knew and when he knew it becomes moot  even if trump were completely blameless in the coordinated relationship between his trusted adviser and the country undermining american democracy  it would only reinforce that his stupidity qualified as criminal negligence  obama warned him  yates warned him  the fbi warned him  the media warned him  and he ignored all of them to protect his friend   a man now claiming to be a foreign agent featured image via twitter
