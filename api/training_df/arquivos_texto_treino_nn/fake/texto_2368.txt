one would think that  after all the accusations that hillary lied to congress about everything in all of creation  they d be especially sensitive to anybody else lying to them  especially when it s easily proven  trump s pick to head the epa  scott pruitt  used a private email account for some of his government business during his tenure as oklahoma s attorney general  it s not illegal for him to use private email under oklahoma law as long as the emails are made publicly available  but they weren t  and he lied to congress about it anyway pruitt answered a written questionnaire that asked him whether he used private email  he responded with  i use only my official oag email address and government issued phone to conduct official business  he later told the senate energy and public works committee that he didn t know why a personal email address was listed as part of his business addresses    pages of emails  presumably from that address  have been released after an oklahoma judge ruled that pruitt had been withholding them illegally senate democrats say this raises serious questions about pruitt s credibility  which is already on shaky ground because he was suing the epa as oklahoma s attorney general  one of the concerns about his emails is that he was working closely with fossil fuel companies to resist the government s efforts to limit carbon emissions   something the fossil fuel industry and all its lackeys hate because it hurts profits that s a serious conflict of interest  and lies about it just compound the whole situation sen  ron wyden  an oregon democrat  said of pruitt s credibility  now that he is in charge of protecting clean air and water in every community across the country  the public must decide for themselves whether they can trust pruitt when he can t even be honest about his email or his ties to the oil and gas industry  sen  john barasso  a wyoming republican  wouldn t comment on the matter and other republicans appear to be silent as well  why  likely because they want someone at the epa who s willing to render it toothless  if not dismantle it entirely  and also because this reflects extremely badly on them given their insistence that hillary s use of private email was the world s worst crime ever pruitt will probably remain at the head of the epa even though lying to congress is perjury  republicans never want to admit when they ve screwed up featured image by aaron p  bernstein via getty images
