up until this point  mark cuban has been one of the most outspoken billionaires going after trump and begging america to vote for hillary clinton in november  today  it seems like another business mogul is ready to join cuban s cause and tell america to wake the hell up billionaire entrepreneur richard branson  the founder of virgin group  has finally spoken out against trump and has done so via a brutal statement on his company s website  his statement opened with something that most of us   especially cuban   could agree with  branson said  i want an entrepreneur to become president one day   just not donald trump  in railing against the disgraced gop candidate  branson didn t hold back in telling americans that trump is such a horrendous excuse for a candidate  that many of branson s conservative wealthy colleagues cannot even bring themselves to vote for him  even though they may have voted republican religiously in the past  branson said  quite a few of my american friends  especially some very successful entrepreneurs  are registered republicans  they have told me they are unable to vote for donald trump due to his extreme views  and his shocking ignorance of policy  branson continued to trash trump while showering his opponent in compliments  stating that clinton is a safe pair of hands and a leader of supreme experience and knowhow  twitterthen  branson got real on trump s temperament  because apparently some people need to be reminded over and over again how dangerous it is to have a ticking time bomb with the maturity of a three year old in the white house  on the other hand  mr trump s temperament is irrational  aggressive and he lacks informed ideas on how to grow jobs in america  an entrepreneur president would put that at the heart of his plans and yet his fear based campaign blames immigrants and open borders  america was built upon a collective embracing of diversity and openness   not division and close mindedness  there are too many examples of mr trump s lack of empathy and respect to name  i agree with many on both sides of america s political aisle that he is unfit for office  twitterbranson concluded by urging americans to  make sure you vote for your future  and not be misled by uninformed  inflammatory remarks  featured image via ty wright and mike coppola   getty images
