the  values voter summit is underway  and of course this yearly gathering of homophobes  misogynists  science deniers  and other assorted right wing nuts is especially feverish since this is an election year  at the top of the list of priorities for such people  is  of course  abortion these people hate the idea of a woman being able to control her own body  they think that a bunch of men in the government should have that authority  not a woman and her doctor  however  one gop senator who spoke at this horrible event really had the most absurd argument ever to make the case that he is somehow more qualified than anyone else to legislate on abortion  because he ran a small business before he was a member of congress south carolina senator tim scott said  with the air of a father finding out that his teen daughter has come home pregnant  that an employee told him that she was pregnant  so what did sen  scott do with this woman  why  what any manipulative christian who wants to control the lives of others would do  took her to a crisis pregnancy center crisis pregnancy centers are nothing but right wing christian organizations that lie about a woman s choices when it comes to dealing with an unwanted pregnancy  they manipulate young girls and women into believing that abortion is absolutely not an option  for any reason  and  of course  these are the same people who are opposed to any sorts of help for the mothers and children once they are born senator scott said of the conclusion of his decision to  help  this woman in this way  and how it makes him especially qualified to opine and legislate on this matter  as an elected official  when i have the responsibility and the opportunity  the privilege to protect life  i do so having been in the private sector  realizing the importance that we should place on life and the choice of life  senator scott  you aren t  protecting  anything  you re just trying to control the bodies of women around the nation who you don t even know  plus  you ll likely  like all gopers  abandon these fetuses the second they are out of the womb  you people and your sick obsession with controlling women need to be voted out  as a south carolinian  i plan to do just that watch tim scott s crazy unfold below featured image via andrew harrer bloomberg via getty images
