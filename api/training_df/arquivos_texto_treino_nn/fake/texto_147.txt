donald trump very obviously has a specific type of woman he likes  and whom he prefers to represent him  he is a horrid misogynist who thinks women s worth lies solely in our ability to stir his penis to life  or not   he likes his women tall  thin  big breasted basically supermodel quality  knowing that  one would think that sarah huckabee sanders doesn t fit his mold nearly well enough to be his press secretary  and yet  she is  why in a brilliant op ed for the l a times  david horsey turns a light bulb on about why trump would prefer sarah sanders over virtually anyone else  including sean spicer    she has a singular comfort with distorting the truth that spicer never had  and she s obviously far more comfortable with it than anyone besides kellyanne conway  horsey says  but now i get it  anyone who is going to be tasked with the job of explaining this president to the news media needs to be comfortable with saying things that are demonstrably not true  that was the problem with sanders  predecessor  sean spicer  lying seemed to fluster him  when he was challenged on any blatantly erroneous statement  he would get red faced and petulant  it was as if he was trying to signal a message to reporters   come on  guys  lay off  don t make me humiliate myself on live tv   by contrast  sanders is perfectly fine with saying that paul manafort s indictment has nothing whatsoever to do with trump  she had no issue spinning trump s tax breaks for the wealthy into a    year raise for american families  despite being a woman  she s perfectly fine saying that the women accusing trump of sexual assault are all lying simply because that s trump s position  as for the entire russia scandal  including a report that trump has lost his mind over it  horsey says  taking the offensive  sanders confidently delivered the new republican talking point that  if anyone were guilty of colluding with moscow  it was hillary clinton   which is the boldest evasion anyone in the trump camp has come up with  so far   horsey paints sanders as the spin meister she is   someone who effortlessly puts forth the idea that the facts of anything and everything are  nothing more than what you want them to be  by that new standard  sanders is a pro   and that  ladies and gentleman  is why trump has her as his press secretary  he needs someone who has a demonstrable problem with the truth featured image via mark wilson getty images
