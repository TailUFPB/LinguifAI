it s no secret that there is no love lost between donald trump and the media  however  a new report regarding how his son in law jared kushner tried to manipulate the press into covering the trump campaign in a better light is downright disturbing  according to the hill  kushner offered better access to the campaign in exchange for more pro trump news pieces the first attempt to control messaging in this way was done by asking sinclair broadcasting   an outfit that owns local stations nationwide   to have anchors refrain from commenting on trump s rallies  statements  and interviews  and just air footage of the rallies and interviews instead  and in the most flattering light possible  kushner revealed this tactic while speaking to new york city business people  the trade off was that the trump team would be more cooperative with friendly networks in fairness  it seems that sinclair broadcasting s efforts here were noble  and likely if it were anyone but the highly manipulative team trump  it would likely be fine because no other campaign would ever make such demands  sinclair vice president scott livingston said of the deal  our promise was to give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position share their position with our viewers  certainly we presented an opportunity so that mr  trump could clearly state his position on the key issues  our commitment to our viewers is to go beyond podium  beyond the rhetoric  we re all about tracking the truth and telling the truth and that s typically missing in most political coverage  okay  fair enough  but it seems livingston underestimated trump and his campaign  they have no respect for journalists  do not tolerate voices that are critical of trump  and they refuse to cooperate with media outlets that are not explicitly pro trump  this attitude is never more apparent than what happened when trump s team tried to get cnn to have more trump supporters included in their famously heated political panel debates  this was a request from jared kushner as well  and when cnn s jeff zucker shot that request down  the trump people became increasingly difficult for the network to deal with cnn s refusal to kowtow to his request seemed to irritate kushner so much that he couldn t stop talking about the network at the new york business meeting  one person who was in the room said of kushner s cnn remarks  he kept going on and on about it  it was around this time when trump started calling cnn the  clinton news network  and trashing them on twitter this does not bode well for the free press and the first amendment in general under a trump administration  clearly  these people want to control the message   and that message better be pro trump or else  likely  breitbart will be a trump propaganda arm  and he will  slowly but surely  sow distrust in any press that is not explicitly flattering and supportive of him  he already has a head start  as most of his supporters do not trust anything that isn t said by trump himself welcome to your banana republic  america  it s going to be a rough four years featured image via drew angerer getty images
