georgia congressman and civil rights hero john lewis said on friday that donald trump  is not a legitimate president   naturally  trump attacked him on twitter for stating what millions of americans already think  but film legend michael moore agrees with lewis wholeheartedly on saturday  moore took to facebook to give six reasons that lewis is right and trump is illegitimate  he began by pointing out that trump didn t even come close to winning the popular vote   nothing  including an arcane  racist section of the constitution  can change the fact that  million more americans voted for hillary than for trump  it s either a democracy or it isn t  if he had won by  million  i would sadly admit that trump is the president the american people wanted  but that s not what happened next  moore said what many people  including my mother who worked in mental health care for several decades  have been saying for months  trump is f cking nuts  not like   ha ha  he s crazy   but as in  this is no laughing matter  the man is seriously suffering from a mental illness    he is not well and needs help  he has a number of serious mental disorders that make him unfit to hold office   and they are on display every day in one cringe worthy tweet after another  he is a full blown malignant narcissist  he displays sociopathic tendencies  he will say one thing and  seconds later say the opposite  he is disconnected from the truth  and he has a stunning lack of human empathy  these behaviors make him a truly dangerous occupant of the oval office the third item on moore s list is obvious to anyone who has been paying attention even a little bit  russia  it is undeniable at this point that the russians interfered in the u s  presidential election and clearly helped land trump s orange derriere in the white house   the russians interfered with the election in order to get him elected  even trump now admits as much  that alone makes the election tainted and should be voided  we spend trillions on ridiculous weapons and ineffective police state style homeland security measures to defend us against those who would  destroy our way of life    but we are to remain silent when a foreign government is caught trying to get their candidate elected as our president  and they succeed  this is a joke of monstrous proportions   and the fact that conservatives  republicans and patriotic good ol  boys are actively defending this foreign aggression into our country confirms to me what i ve feared all along  that they really hate our form of democracy  our bill of rights  our belief that  all men  sic  are created equal   our one person one vote system  that whoever scores the most points wins and that people of all religions are welcome here  they don t believe that  and i d respect them so much more if they would just simply admit it moore then slammed fbi director james comey for his decision to announce that the investigation into hillary clinton s emails was being reopened just days before the presidential election  this all turned out to be bullsh t by the way but still ended up being the straw that broke the camel s back and swung support away from clinton in the final stretch   the fbi clearly chose sides  and fbi director comey s interference in the  days before the election most definitely helped tipped the balance to the fbi s preferred candidate  donald j  trump  that our own federal police would so brazenly attempt to throw the election to the person with the least votes is mind boggling  frightening and must be stopped  attorney general lynch must immediately  today  appoint a special prosecutor to investigate what to me appears to be a criminal offense  if this is true  i want to see fbi director comey in handcuffs and behind bars  short of murder and a few other heinous acts  is there a worse crime in our democracy than the highest ranking cop in the land attempting to throw the election moore continued by noting that trump has appointed billionaires to serve in his cabinet who will be all too happy to sell the u s  to the highest bidder  in particular  he took issue with the nomination of exxon ceo rex tillerson to serve as secretary of state   trump has nominated in rex tillerson the most powerful corporate ceo in the world as  our  secretary of state  why would the quarter billionaire head of the world s richest corporation want a  government job   so that he  a personal friend of putin s  can get the us sanctions lifted off russia so that his company  exxonmobil  can get back to their exclusive oil deal with russia   which will eventually net exxonmobil three trillion dollars  this is nothing less than a bold  audacious robbery in broad daylight   and it says a lot about you and me that they think they can get away with it finally  moore said that trump s legal woes alone should have ruled him out as a presidential possibility  from rape to fraud  trump has faced a long list of felonies over the years  not to mention whatever it is in his taxes that he his so desperate to keep secret and his myriad conflicts of interest  how he has made it this far is mind boggling   trump has potentially committed a number of felonies   and a felon simply can t sit in the oval office  i can t believe i even have to state that   from his admitted sexual assaults to whatever he s hiding in the tax returns  to possibly evading taxes  to his committing fraud with trump u  to his long list of conflicts of interest   the chance of us having to suffer through his impeachment trial in the senate is just too much to bear moore concluded by once again stating that lewis was spot on and urging the public to contact their congressmen to ask them to follow lewis  lead and refuse to attend the inauguration of an illegitimate president featured image via jemal countess getty images
