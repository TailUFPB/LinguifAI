donald trump s days in the white house could be numbered if republicans stop denying reality on thursday  trump delivered an insane press conference in which he spewed a string of lies and bragged about how many electoral votes he received he repeatedly claimed that the media pushes  fake news  and openly praised conservative outlets like fox news for kissing his ass overall  trump demonstrated once again that he is totally unfit to hold the office he occupies and that is why lawmakers are actively pursuing ways to kick him out of the white house before he does something even crazier earlier this week  rep  earl blumenauer called for a congressional review to explore the constitutional process to remove an unstable person from the presidency  it s not normal behavior   blumenauer said   i don t know anybody in a position of responsibility that doesn t know if they re being rained on  and nobody i work with serially offers up verifiably false statements on an ongoing basis  and that s why rep  ted lieu is going to introduce a bill to require a psychiatrist work at the white house because if trump is mentally unfit to be president  he is   then the american people have a right to know and he should be removed from office so he can t harm anyone else or this nation ever again  i am not a mental health professional  so i don t know in terms of any sort of medical expertise on this   lieu said in defense of the bill   but i do see and hear the same things that other people see and hear  and a lot of people have concluded that what s going on is not normal  so what do i do with that as a member of congress  anyone who can launch   nuclear weapons in minutes absolutely should be questioned on any matter related to their physical and mental health  exactly  trump is so unstable and predictable that he could literally launch a nuclear strike any time over the smallest slight  the fact that random guests at the mar a lago parties can take pictures with the guy who carries the nuclear football is also worrying even republicans think trump s behavior is  disturbing  even if they do refuse to admit that he should be kicked out of office rep  mike simpson told the hill that   the behavior is somewhat disturbing   but thinks  it s a stretch  to question trump s mental and emotional stability so the question is how much more proof do republicans need before they admit that trump is dangerous and needs to go  because the fact that they are willing to defend him after all the insanity and chaos we have seen in the white house so far makes one wonder if they are mentally and emotionally stable enough to be congressmen a republican judge was brave enough to call for trump s impeachment earlier this week  republicans in congress would be wise to listen to him if president obama had acted like trump is acting they would have moved to impeach him on the first day  america has already put up with four weeks of trump s bullshit and it s only getting scarier it s time for republicans to recognize the reality of the situation and do what s best for the country instead of what s best for the republican party  and that means trump should be impeached immediately featured image via joe raedle getty images
