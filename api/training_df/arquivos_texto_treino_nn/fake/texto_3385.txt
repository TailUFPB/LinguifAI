despite not having any time to attend critical press conferences  president elect donald trump has more than enough time to devote to his weird  thank you tour  to celebrate his  victory   which was really a loss if you count the millions of popular votes hillary clinton surpassed him with  last night  trump held one of his rallies in pennsylvania  where he became the unhinged trump we saw during his presidential campaign  as he ditched his teleprompter  what followed next was something only trump would do at one of the most insane parts of his speech  trump told his supporters that they were  crazed  and  wild beasts  before he won the election  he totally insulted their intelligence  and they loved every second of it  trump said  before the election  you people are like wild beasts  wild animals   they are screaming   jail  jail  prison   going crazy  before the election  they are brutal  they are so crazed  you are like crazy people  and that s good  i like that  and now you are laid back   you ve won  you feel great about it and you don t have to go totally wild  trump claimed that now that he d won  his supporters were more  laid back   although most of us would disagree   you can watch trump go off the rails below trump says  thank you  rally crowd is  laid back  compared to  crazed  pre election audience   it s much different  https   t co rjdkcqcieo  abc news politics   abcpolitics  december    has a painfully skewed view of his supporters  like many other things  if he thinks they have gotten less  crazed  since he won the election  there was a dramatic increase in hate crimes and violence in the few days after trump won  and those incidents continue to be reported over a month later  trump s supporters now feel more entitled to their white privilege than ever  and will go ballistic if anyone crosses them  and of course  trump only continues to feed the beasts trump is only  days away from the beginning of his term  and instead of using his rallies to talk about his policies  trump is filling the space with nonsense like this featured image via ethan miller getty images
