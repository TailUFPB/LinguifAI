most of us in the u s  are well aware of donald trump s extreme obsession with former president barack obama  but now we know that foreign diplomats are privy to that  too  top ranking european officials  speaking on the condition of anonymity  told buzzfeed news what they think of trump and what their chief concerns were  trump s erratic and unpredictable twitter use was brought up as well  also discussed was trump s lack of a strong  experienced team around him in total  six top european government officials who ve had firsthand dealings on the international stage with trump and his administration were interviewed by buzzfeed and their views are consistent at international gatherings  trump is described as  something of a laughing stock  trump could send a tweet in the middle of the night pissing off kim jong un  and the next morning we wake up to a world on the brink of war   one diplomat said that observation was made before trump tried to start a nuclear war on twitter so we can only imagine how he or she feels now one of the officials went as far as to say that a small group of diplomats play a version of word bingo whenever trump speaks because they consider his vocabulary to be so limited   everything is  great    very  very great    amazing    the diplomat said of trump s vocabulary but there s also a fear among our allies that trump is dangerous  he has no historical view  he is only dealing with these issues now  and seems to think the world started when he took office   a diplomat told buzzfeed news   he thinks that nato existed only to keep the communists out of europe  he has a similar attitude in asia pacific with japan  ignoring that the us basically wrote their constitution  the diplomats said they also believe that trump s foreign policy is chiefly driven by an obsession with unraveling former president barack obama s policies  and we ve pretty much seen that  too  here in the u s  it s his only real position   one official said   he will ask   did obama approve this   and if the answer is affirmative  he will say   we don t   he won t even want to listen to the arguments or have a debate  he is obsessed with obama  another diplomat said that it s impossible to discuss serious international issues  such as libya  with trump  they have growing concerns because they re still struggling to find someone in his administration to engage with because meeting with trump has proved to be  basically useless  he s not the kind of person you can have a discussion about how to deal with  al sarraj    the official added   so you look for people around him  and that is where it s a problem  the constant upheaval  it s unclear who has influence  who is close to the president  we feel their pain  we witnessed trump s obsession and profound jealousy of obama when he tried to claim that our country s first black president is really a sneaky muslim from kenya  the former reality show star tried to delegitimize obama but he failed to do so because facts got in his way  that s still the main problem with trump  he s adverse to facts  but  he did sell himself on the campaign trail to people who thought they could stick it to liberals by siding with the former reality show star  a man with zero political experience  and here we are  just after  months after trump was sworn in and we could break out in a nuclear war at any minute  conservatives sure showed us with their maga and pepe memes  didn t they read more photo by sean rayford getty images
