donald trump just got his ass handed to him by the retired admiral who oversaw the raid that finally took down osama bin laden last week  trump viciously accused the media of treason and called them the  enemy of the american people in a tweet that has since been condemned across the country the fake news media  failing  nytimes   nbcnews   abc   cbs   cnn  is not my enemy  it is the enemy of the american people   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february     one critic of trump s tweet knows all about who our enemies really are and he called trump out during remarks to a group of journalism students in texas retired admiral william mcraven is the chancellor of the university of texas system  but he is most notable for being the commander who oversaw the daring raid in pakistan in which osama bin laden was killed by seal team six ten years after al qaeda terrorists perpetrated the   attacks six years later  trump is referring to the press as the  enemy  while isis and other terrorist organizations are benefiting from his rhetoric that doesn t sit well with mcraven  who called trump s attack on the media  the greatest threat to democracy  on tuesday  the president said the news media is the enemy of the american people   mcraven said   this sentiment may be the greatest threat to democracy in my lifetime he then urged his audience to challenge trump s statement  i will tell you as journalism majors  as americans  you should challenge that sentiment and that statement every opportunity you can  we must challenge this statement  and this sentiment  that the news media is the enemy of the american people  by attacking the free press like he did  trump is on the slippery slope toward arresting and jailing journalists for doing their jobs  conservatives are praising trump s assault on the media  but they would have cried bloody murder if president obama has said the same about fox news and right wing media outlets  trump and conservatives hate facts because facts weaken their arguments  facts and evidence derail their agenda and they know it  that s why they are waging war on facts  getting rid of facts makes it easier to fool the people and easier to force a destructive agenda upon them as admiral mcraven said  trump is a  threat to democracy  and the media needs to continue revealing his incompetence and treachery to the american people  because without a free press  our freedoms would be quickly taken from us a president who fancies himself a king featured image via sean rayford getty images
