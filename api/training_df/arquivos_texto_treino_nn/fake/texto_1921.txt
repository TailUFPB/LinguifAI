mitch mcconnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what senate republicans did to supreme court nominee merrick garland when antonin scalia passed away in february   his body was not even cold before republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by president obama and so  when president obama selected a centrist judge named merrick garland to be the next supreme court justice  republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the constitution republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that democrats would have done the same thing even though democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing  furthermore  republicans claimed that no supreme court nominee has ever been approved by the senate in an election year mcconnell made the same claim on sunday after chuck todd grilled him in response to republican insistence that donald trump s supreme court nominee neil gorsuch be confirmed immediately  the tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential  year   mcconnell said   you d have to go back  years to find the last time it happened  everyone knew  including president obama s former white house counsel  that if the shoe had been on the other foot   wouldn t have filled a republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election  again  democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a supreme court nominee also  mitch mcconnell is ignorant of senate history as it turns out  there have been several election year confirmations of supreme court nominees and we don t have to go back  years to find one in fact  the last one occurred only  years ago when the senate confirmed justice anthony kennedy in  during ronald reagan s last year in office it also happened in  when dwight eisenhower nominated william brennan  the senate confirmed him despite it being an election year in   also an election year  franklin roosevelt nominated frank murphy to the supreme court and the senate confirmed him so contrary to what mitch mcconnell says  there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming supreme court nominees during an election year todd challenged mcconnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving garland an up or down vote  why not put him up for a vote   todd asked   any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation  why not put merrick garland on the floor and if the rationale is   you know what  too close to an election   then vote no  look  we litigated that last year   a flustered mcconnell replied   the american people decided that they wanted donald trump to make the nomination  not hillary clinton  actually  the american people voted for hillary clinton  she won the popular vote by nearly  million votes mcconnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm gorsuch  but that s not true either  you see  by refusing to grant garland a confirmation hearing  republicans set a precedent and gave democrats all the reasons they need to block gorsuch at all costs plus  gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by trump  which is all the more reason for democrats to block him if senate republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to merrick garland  perhaps democrats would have been more open  but the way republicans treated garland was un american and totally outrageous  they disgraced the senate with their conduct and democrats now have precedent to respond in kind but mcconnell balked when todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says supreme court vacancies won t be filled during an election year  in short  mcconnell knows that if a republican had been president in   senate republicans would have rushed any supreme court nomination through  because in the end  republicans are hypocrites here s the video via youtube there is no excuse for democrats to not block neil gorsuch from becoming a supreme curt justice  in fact  if republicans somehow get him confirmed  democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the senate  this supreme court seat rightfully belongs to merrick garland  he deserves a fair confirmation hearing before republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the supreme court again  until then  republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way republicans treated merrick garland and republicans only have themselves to blame featured image  screenshot
