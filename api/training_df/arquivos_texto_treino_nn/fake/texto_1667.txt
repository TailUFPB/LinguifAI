donald trump is reportedly considering an executive order that would pull the united states out of the north american free trade agreement  nafta  unless they are willing to renegotiate with him for a better deal this is what trump had to say about nafta during his recent word salad of an interview with the associated press earlier this week ap  what about nafta  what s the plan on nafta trump  what would you like to know ap  i would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating trump  i am very upset with nafta  i think nafta has been a catastrophic trade deal for the united states  trading agreement for the united states  it hurts us with canada  and it hurts us with mexico  most people don t even think of nafta in terms of canada  you saw what happened yesterday in my statements  because if you look at the dairy farmers in wisconsin and upstate new york  they are getting killed by nafta ap  is your plan still  though  to renegotiate the whole deal trump  i am going to either renegotiate it or i am going to terminate it ap  termination is still on the table trump  absolutely  if they don t treat fairly  i am terminating nafta ap  what s a timeline for that decision trump  it s a six month termination clause  i have the right to do it  it s a six month clause cnn reported today that two senior administration officials had confirmed that trump is debating withdrawing the u s  from nafta through an executive order  the white house is currently mulling an executive order declaring the us  intent to withdraw from nafta  a move that could trigger a renegotiation of the trade pact rather than outright withdrawal   the officials told cnn this isn t a new stance for trump  who railed against nafta throughout his campaign  in june  trump declared that nafta was  the worst trade deal in  the history of this country  i m going to tell our nafta partners that i intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal by a lot  not just a little  by a lot for our workers  and if they don t agree to a renegotiation  which they might not  because they re so used to having their own way not with trump  they won t have their own way then i will submit under article  of the nafta agreement that america intends to withdraw from the deal   trump declared to his rabid supporters last summer featured image via mark wilson getty images
