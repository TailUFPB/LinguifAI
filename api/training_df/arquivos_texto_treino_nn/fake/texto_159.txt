the civil war was about slavery  in fact  slavery was the one issue that threatened to rip the union apart before the constitution was even ratified  at the convention in philadelphia  the  three fifths  compromise was made due to the southern states wanting more representation in the house of representatives due to wanting their slaves to count as part of the constitution  so  the states that would go on to become the confederate states of america actually forced the founders to protect slavery in the original constitution these  compromises  would be done repeatedly  through different types of fugitive slave laws  and other compromises like the creation of the   line   known today as the mason dixon line  slavery was allowed below that line  and was not allowed above it  that compromise was later threatened with the kansas nebraska act  which would allow the incoming state of kansas to vote on whether or not to allow slavery  rather than having the state automatically enter as either a slave state or a free state  this resulted in  border ruffians  violently crossing the line into kansas to make sure that kansas allowed slavery  this conflict would come to be so bloody that it was known as  bleeding kansas  now  all of this led to one thing  there were states who wanted the united states to allow slavery  and those who knew it to be a brutal  immoral institution that needed to end  hence  no matter what the white supremacist revisionist history and propaganda says  the civil war was about slavery  however  donald trump s chief of staff  john kelly  seems to need that little history lesson in a tuesday appearance with right wing hack laura ingraham  kelly had a few words regarding famed confederate general robert e  lee  with regards to the recent controversies over statues honoring the confederacy  he said of the pro slavery general  i would tell you that robert e  lee was an honorable man  he was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state  which  years ago was more important than country  it was always loyalty to state first back in those days   now it s different today  but the lack of an ability to compromise led to the civil war  and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand  i can only come to the conclusion that this means that the so called  adult in the room  in trump s chaotic  incompetent  scandal ridden white house is either too ignorant of history to know what kind of man he just used the word  honorable  to describe  or he is just a ok with slavery  and equates white supremacy and owning human beings with the likes of those who would liberate those human beings who were so brutally held in bondage against their will for so many years that we  their descendants  still suffer injustices as a result  even today next time someone says the trump administration isn t full of white supremacists  show them this watch kelly s dangerous remarks below enough about john kelly being the  adult in the room   he s out here praising robert e  lee and falsifying history  pic twitter com   jamil smith   jamilsmith  october    image via drew angerer getty images
