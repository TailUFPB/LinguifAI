a new report from the new york times finds that donald trump owes twice as much debt as he reported on his public election filings the ny times reports  beyond finding that companies owned by mr  trump had debts of at least   million  the times discovered that a substantial portion of his wealth is tied up in three passive partnerships that owe an additional   billion to a string of lenders  including those that hold the loan on the avenue of the americas building  if those loans were to go into default  mr  trump might not be held personally liable  but the value of his investments would sink  the ny times points out that trump probably didn t lie about the amount of debt he has in his public filings  it s just a matter of the forms that were filled out not being designed for a person who has as complex financial holdings as trump does what s really interesting about the report  is that it also shows trump s one of the very few criticisms of hillary clinton shared by some on the left  which he stole from progressives anyway  is now rendered completely invalid for him to make  due to it being completely hypocritical the ny times reports  an office building on avenue of the americas in manhattan  of which mr  trump is part owner  carries a   million loan  among the lenders  the bank of china  one of the largest banks in a country that mr  trump has railed against as an economic foe of the united states  and goldman sachs  a financial institution he has said controls hillary clinton  the democratic nominee  after it paid her    in speaking fees  trump has positioned himself as a strong businessman throughout his presidential campaign  however  he has come under fire from democrats as report after report comes out showing that he is actually a huge failure in the world of business  most notably from elizabeth warren who has said that  donald trump is a loser  count all his failed businesses  see how he kept his father s empire afloat by cheating people with scams like trump university and by using strategic corporate bankruptcy  excuse me  bankruptcies  to skip out on debt  the report is damning and should give democrats a few more talking points that show just how dangerous a trump presidency would be for the united states featured image from spencer platt getty images
