if there s anyone in this country who s an expert in dirty politics  it s donald trump surrogate roger stone  stone is a racist  a conspiracy theorist  misogynistic and pretty much everything ugly that comes out of the trump camp  he s also intensely loyal to trump  so if stone says trump was simply toying with mitt romney just to be a vindictive a  hole  well  you can pretty much take that to the bank on sunday  stone appeared on infowars with alex jones  jones and stone are both conspiracy nuts  but what stone told jones was no conspiracy  according to stone  trump only interviewed mitt romney for the secretary of state position to  torture him  for refusing to endorse the orange man  donald trump was interviewing mitt romney for secretary of state in order to torture him   stone claimed on the program   to toy with him  and given the history  that s completely understandable  mitt romney crossed a line  he didn t just oppose trump  which is his democratic right  he called him a phony and a fraud  and a con man  and that s not the kind of man you want as secretary of state  while trump s official team hasn t confirmed or denied stone s allegations  it s far from out of character for trump  who seems to relish in vindictive retribution actual  we can t confirm or deny that trump is a billionaire either  billionaire richard branson called trump vindictive and dangerous what concerns me most  based upon my personal experiences with donald trump  is his vindictive streak  which could be so dangerous if he got into the white house  for somebody who is running to be the leader of the free world to be so wrapped up in himself  rather than concerned with global issues  is very worrying trump has vowed to sue all the women who accused him of sexual misconduct  in fact  trump threatens to sue everyone who crosses him  he cuts off media sources when they write negative things about him a psychologist had this to say about trump psychology research shows that vindictiveness is strongly correlated with narcissism  a personality trait that countless psychologists say trump shows all the signs of having  studies have also found that those who seek revenge are often very energetic and have dominant personalities  further  vengeful people often seek powerful positions that allow them to inflict what they see as well deserved hurt on their enemies  that pretty much describes trump to a t if  in fact  trump did only invite romney to meet with him to  torture him   this is beyond troubling  we need an adult in the white house  not a proud schoolyard bully featured image via drew angerer getty images
