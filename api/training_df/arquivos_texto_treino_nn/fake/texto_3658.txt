patton oswalt is a comedian  but he s also very seriously worried about the future of this country after the inauguration of donald trump in his facebook post on sunday  oswalt  who heartbreakingly lost his wife this year  is nonetheless worried about the rest of us so  sixteen days into the reality of donald trump being our president elect  and i m reading new yorker and jacobin and slate and ny times articles  trying to make sense of just what the fuck happened  and how the fuck do we go forward  the democratic party is in shards on the floor right now  i think we re going to have eight years of trump and his clean shaven looters scraping out the carcass of the country before fucking off and blaming it on progressives and lesbians and pc and rap music oswalt talks about the schadenfreude that seems to be resonating throughout trump i verse  people  according to oswalt  are telling the comedian that his type of comedy is over and now we have to be subjected to whatever trumpsters call comedy  obviously  oswalt had the perfect answer for that so many alt righters  or just people on the right  are failed or frustrated comedians  just as so many far  far left wingers are  comedy is too pc  it s not pc enough  it s racist  it shames white men  it doesn t fit to my standards  so therefore i must destroy it being funny isn t something everyone is born with  and even the ones born with it have to work and evolve and have humility while they do so  for the untalented but still entitled  there s a gut full of envy to carry around when they see other people getting laughs where they can t oswalt went further and compared these times to the rise of the nazis  he referenced an essay by clive james  about egon friedall  an intellectual who committed suicide before being hauled off by the nazis egon threw himself from his window as the sa men battered down his door  screaming   watch out  get out of the way   to the pedestrians as he plummeted i think   i m guessing  i know   that egon sensed something even more sinister behind the nazi uprising  something fueled not by nationalism or racial pride but by bog standard showbiz envy here s the post in its entirety  it s definitely worth reading and sharing it s an interesting perspective and if you think about it  conservatism  not just trumpism  is based on envy  conservatives are envious of people who have more talent  they are envious of people who they think are getting more attention  they are even envious of those who have much  much less than them conservatives try comedy again and again  and with the exception of just a few  like tim allen or larry the cable guy   they nearly always fail  their comedy  like their policies  is mean spirited  conservatives punch down while liberals speak truth to power  when conservatives fail  their envy leads to anger  more than anything  though  trump has made being thin skinned fashionable  trump supporters  even after winning  think they are the consummate victims  when victimhood is given power  things can get very dangerous  it s what happened in  germany and it s what could easily happen in just a few weeks featured image via bryan bedder getty images
