donald trump s decision to choose russian state media over american journalists has drawn the ire of the ladies on  the view  on wednesday  just one day after firing fbi director james comey as the agency continues to investigate his russia scandal  trump took a meeting with russian ambassador sergey kislyak  kislyak is the russian official whom michael flynn spoke to during the transition  an action that raised further concerns about trump s ties to russia and vladimir putin and raised even more concerns by letting russian state media attend the meeting complete with all of their equipment  while banning the free press in the united states from attending the decision especially concerns former cia deputy director david cohen after vice president joe biden s former national security adviser posed a  deadly serious  question about whether it was smart of trump to allow russian state media and their equipment in the oval office  cohen replied  colinkahl no  it was not   david s  cohen   cohendavid  may    went to explain that he wasn t even allowed to bring his phone into the oval office  nor was he allowed to let foreign delegations bring cameras in that room  but trump let putin s propaganda machine do it this infuriated joy behar so much that she ripped trump a new one on thursday  calling his actions  treasonous  and  un american  he s speaking to the russian foreign minister and ambassador kislyak who s the one who michael flynn got fired for talking to   behar said   and in the room  here s trump talking to the russians and the russian press is there covering  and guess who s missing from the room  the american press  they were barred from the room  this is treason to me  this is un american  it s unpatriotic  americans should be furious  here s the video via youtube indeed  americans should also be worried  trump may have just compromised national security by letting putin s propaganda network inside the oval office  the threat of listening devices and cameras being covertly placed inside the oval office is a very real threat  this is where the president often meets with foreign officials  staffers  members of congress  and military leaders inviting a russian state media crew into the oval office is irresponsible  trump s refusal to let american media cover the meeting is flagrantly outrageous because trump chose putin s propaganda machine over the american free press  it s suspicious and makes one wonder what trump wanted to hide from the american people featured image  screenshot
