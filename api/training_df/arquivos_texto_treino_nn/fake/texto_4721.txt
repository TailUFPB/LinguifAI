greta van susteren left fox news abruptly recently  but she s having a bit of fun trolling the network  when someone leaves  standard procedure is to redirect their news page back to fox s own website  however  they also redirected her personal page  greta com  that s not right   she owns the domain  so she took matters into her own hands and redirected it somewhere else she redirected it to an animal rescue site called petsconnect rescue  petsconnect noticed that  and was so grateful for it that they even tweeted a thank you at her  since fox is right leaning  and also named after an animal  unless it was named for men s views of women as eye candy   that s punking a little hard  animal rights and welfare do not matter to the right at all not only that  but on the chance that fox stole her domain to needle her  and it wasn t an honest mistake  needling them back with a sharp pipe like this seems to be the most reasonable thing to do fox news is falling apart at the seams with all of the sexual harassment allegations being thrown at them  and also with gretchen carlson s   million settlement  the network also publicly apologized to her  and settled with a handful of other women as well it also recently came out that they re guilty of hacking into the personal phones of journalists at other news outlets to find out who they were talking to  in short  roger ailes maintained one of the biggest tissues of lies ever  running his network into the ground and calling it a success the toilet is too lofty a place to describe the depths to which they have sunk van susteren s website is greta com  since it s her domain  it will go where she wants it to  that s her right  and fox news can go suck it featured image by nancy ostertag getty images
