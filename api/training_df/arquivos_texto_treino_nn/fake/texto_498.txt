early next month  the gop controlled house of representatives will take up a spending bill that provides funding for nearly every department in the federal government  it s a must pass bill because  without it  the government will shut down  that s a non starter for many republicans  who still feel the pain of the last time there was a government shutdown  republicans were largely unable to shift blame to the democrats as they attempted to do  and their popularity suffered as a result  but despite the gop s absolute grip on congress  the bill is still subject to amendments  and one democrat from tennessee has a doozy in mind representative steve cohen is introducing amendments to the spending plan that would ban the use of federal funds at trump branded properties  it covers every business listed on trump s financial disclosure form  including hotels  country clubs  and resorts  that means events like the ones at mar a lago where trump has hosted dignitaries and foreign leaders would either be held elsewhere  or trump would have to provide accommodations free of charge such an arrangement would have prevented the secret service from having to stay in a trailer outside trump tower  where they moved after price negotiations fell apart over them staying inside while protecting the president  it also would have precluded the state department from spending upwards of    on rooms at a hotel that trump recently opened in vancouver  most of all  it might reduce the amount of money you and i pay for the president to spend more than   of his time in office  so far  at his own resorts in a statement cohen released wednesday morning  he said congress should not allow the president to use his office to profit himself and his family   the president s refusal to divest from his privately owned businesses creates a conflict of interest when steering federal spending to his resorts and other businesses  the american people should have total confidence that the president is serving their interest  not his own financial enrichment   president trump s refusal to disclose information to congress or seek congress s authorization for accepting profits from foreign governments stemming from his sprawling foreign financial interests is a brazen violation of the constitution and a danger to our democracy we couldn t agree more  congressman  and while these amendments stand about a snowball s chance in hell of passing   or possibly even being brought up for a vote   it will be nice to see you force republicans to go on record and either declare their allegiance to donald trump  or to the principles of conservatism featured image via alex wong getty images
