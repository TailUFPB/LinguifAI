donald trump is an established denier of climate change and lover of absurd conspiracy theories  during the first presidential debate on monday  hillary clinton slammed him for claiming that global warming is a chinese hoax  donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the chinese   clinton said on the debate stage   i think it s real  i think science is real  trump promptly interrupted her to declare that he hadn t ever said anything of the sort   i did not  i did not   countered trump   i do not say that  go figure  this was a boldfaced lie  in   trump tweeted this trump later claimed he was just joking after bernie sanders nailed him to the wall for this ridiculous theory  but he still insisted that climate change is a hoax that benefits china  well  i think the climate change is just a very  very expensive form of tax  a lot of people are making a lot of money  i know much about climate change  i d be   received environmental awards  and i often joke that this is done for the benefit of china  obviously  i joke   trump said to fox news in january   but this is done for the benefit of china because china does not do anything to help climate change  they burn everything you could burn  they couldn t care less  they have very   you know  their standards are nothing  but they   in the meantime  they can undercut us on price  so it s very hard on our business  the gop nominee has repeatedly claimed that global warming is a  hoax   he argued this point on fox news in  and his twitter feed abounds with similar statements sooner or later  you d think trump would learn that lying about what he has said doesn t work  especially if it was said on television or social media  but apparently  this is a lesson that hasn t quite sunk in yet watch trump lie about claiming that global warming is a chinese hoax  here featured image via win mcnamee getty images
