donald trump insulted the people of puerto rico just as he was getting ready to travel there to inspect the devastation caused by two category  hurricanes as a helicopter was standing by  trump took questions from reporters as he walked to the landing pad one question was about the hurricane relief effort that is currently underway in puerto rico trump responded by whining about the criticism of his response  which was slower than george w  bush s response to hurricane katrina  then he gave himself an a  grade on the response and proceeded to blame the victims of the hurricane for all the problems i think it s now no longer acknowledged what a great job we ve done  texas and florida we get an a plus  i think we ve done just as good in puerto rico and it s a much tougher situation  now the roads are cleared  communications starting to come back  we need their truck drivers  their drivers have to start driving trucks  we have to do that  at a local level they have to give us more help  i will tell you the first responders  the military  fema  they have done an incredible job in puerto rico  and whether it s her or anybody else  they re all starting to say it  i appreciate very much the governor and his comments  he has said we have done an incredible job and that s the truth here s the video via youtube keep in mind that puerto rico just suffered near total devastation  there is a lack of food and water and not nearly enough manpower and equipment  much of the island still has no electrical power blaming the locals is what a poor leader does when he or she wants to shift the blame for their own mishandling of the situation  trump responded badly to the dire situation in puerto rico and he refuses to take responsibility  apparently  the buck always stops with someone else  puerto ricans should boo trump s sorry ass back to the mainland  because he basically just doubled down on suggesting that they are lazy  such poor leadership ability by the mayor of san juan  and others in puerto rico  who are not able to get their workers to help  they    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort    federal workers now on island doing a fantastic job   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    should be ashamed of himself featured image  screenshot
