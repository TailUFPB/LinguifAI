republicans hate it  they really really hate it  but after more than seven years of trying to work across the aisle  president obama s administration has given up and is taking matters into its own hands  this time to save planned parenthood  forever the rule  by the department of health and human services  if enacted  would cut title x funding to states that cut funding to planned parenthood the title x program provides basic preventive health care and family planning services for  million low income americans  about  percent of patients who use title x have incomes below     planned parenthood serves about a third of those patients  using the   million a year it receives in title x grants to subsidize contraceptives and cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings for people who can t afford them  title x does not allow any money to be used to pay for abortions for any reason still  politicians in  states have voted to block public funds from planned parenthood because its services include abortion  republicans in congress are also on a mission to defund the family planning provider  citing a series of debunked undercover videos produced by anti abortion activists that purport to show planned parenthood selling fetal body parts  source  huffington postrepublicans have had planned parenthood in their crosshairs for years  ostensibly it s because planned parenthood performs abortions  but only three percent of what they do is about abortions  the rest is about family planning and both women s and men s health services  in other words  planned parenthood prevents far more abortions than they could ever perform besides  their objection to planned parenthood has nothing whatsoever to do with abortion  republicans consistently cut off funding for planned parenthood  despite the fact that no federal money and very little state money goes toward abortions  in other words  it s highly unlikely you ve ever paid a penny in taxes that has gone to abort a fetus so  what is the problem with planned parenthood  well  the problem is that most republicans in congress and in the states believe it s the  century and that women should be punished for having sex  sure  they might agree to planned parenthood performing mammograms  but g d forbid they do anything with lady parts or anything that would imply a woman is having sex without a  being married and b  wanting to procreate just this week  congress blocked funding to fight the zika virus by you got it sticking an amendment in there that would block funding to planned parenthood perhaps that was the last straw and that s why the department of health and human services proposed this new rule planned parenthood is breathing a sigh of relief  this will make a real difference in so many people s lives   said cecile richards  president of planned parenthood   thanks to the obama administration  women will still be able to access the birth control they need to plan their families  and the cancer screenings they need to stay healthy  that s not the only defeat anti choice republicans have faced this week  a judge in very conservative utah ruled that the state cannot cut funding to planned parenthood perhaps this is a sign that the pendulum is finally beginning to swing the other direction  perhaps soon  women will get a say in our own health choices featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
