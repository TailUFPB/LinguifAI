late show host stephen colbert is no fan of donald trump and his administration of bigots  therefore  he was  of course  incensed at attorney general jeff sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding trump s bigoted muslim ban judge derrick watson infamously blocked trump s muslim ban    and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  muslim ban  muslim ban  on thursday  sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized judge watson s decision  saying the following  we are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the supreme court  if not the ninth circuit  so this is a huge matter  i really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the united states from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power  of course  that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged sessions for decades  and rightly so  he is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from  and here he is  the nation s top law enforcement officer  shameful  but true  therefore  stephen colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting sessions is  amazed  an  island in the pacific  judge can block the travel ban  just like how i m  bewildered  a  racist elf  can be ag   stephen colbert   stephenathome  april    is exactly what jeff sessions is   a stone cold racist  a stone cold racist who is now in charge of the civil liberties of the citizens of the united states of america  you really can t make this stuff up thank you for telling it like it is  mr  colbert  goodness knows  we need more voices like yours featured image via zach gibson getty images
