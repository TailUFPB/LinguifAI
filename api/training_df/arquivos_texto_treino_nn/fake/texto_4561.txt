i woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed here s google naturally  my reaction was  oh  s  t  what did bill clinton do to damage his wife s campaign now  of course  the headline sounds really  really awful  it plays right into the idea that the clinton foundation is all about pay to play  just like donald trump has been saying all along  unfortunately  it takes reading beyond the headlines  which is something most people don t do  to find out the real story   and the real story is that there is no pay to play  it was natural for people who ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things  and i trusted the state department wouldn t do anything they shouldn t do   clinton told npr in an interview that aired monday morning  source  cnnin other words  people can ask for favors  but that certainly doesn t mean they ll get them  leaked emails have shown that some clinton foundation donors have gotten meetings with clinton and that others were turned down  there is zero evidence of pay to play  in other words  people might have asked for favors  but there s no evidence they got them now  let s talk about the foundation the media doesn t like to mention  the trump foundation  trump hasn t given to his own foundation since   he does collect money from others  though  and gives it in his name  he also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets  all for himself  but out of charity money new york attorney general eric schneiderman said in a september  cnn interview that his office is investigating trump s charitable foundation over concerns that it  engaged in some impropriety  as related to new york charity laws  the investigation launched amid reports from the washington post that trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself  such as a    oil painting of himself and a    autographed football helmet  and also recycled others  contributions  to make them appear to have come from him  although he  hasn t given to the foundation since   source  media mattersmedia matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote trump at the cost of clinton s candidacy journalists have been criticized for the  double standard  in the ways they cover trump and democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton  earlier this month  cable news programs devoted  times more coverage to clinton s pneumonia diagnosis as the washington post s reporting about the trump foundation  this week  both the trump foundation and trump organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of donald trump s dr  oz stunt all of this biased coverage is hurting clinton and helping trump  trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks  largely because the media covers every minor clinton  scandal   if you call getting sick a  scandal   while ignoring every scandal in trump s closet  and trust me  there are a lot featured image via ethan miller getty images
