donald trump is getting more screwed over by the republicans as the days go on  they had originally wanted to use him to advance the gop s motives  but now that they see how batsh t crazy he is  many conservatives want nothing to do with him we saw a perfect example of this on saturday morning  when gop sen  lindsey graham condemned trump s latest twitter meltdown  and it was absolutely brutal  graham basically stood behind former president barack obama and trashed trump for accusing the last respectable potus of wiretapping his phones in the trump tower before the election graham has previously spoken out against trump  and has rarely minced his words when warning americans about the loose cannon we now have in the white house  in the town hall  graham blatantly stated that what trump was alleging might end up being the biggest scandal we ve seen in decades  graham said  the president of the united states is claiming that the former president of the united states ordered wiretapping of his campaign last year  i don t know if it s true or not  but if it is true  illegally  it would be the biggest political scandal since watergate  this statement was met with shouts and screams  and graham had to beg the rowdy crowd to settle down so he could continue  offering another take on what trump had done  he said  if the former president of the united states was able to obtain a warrant lawfully to monitor the trump campaign for violating law  that would be the biggest scandal since watergate  graham went on  explaining that trump had just done himself a major disservice  and his twitter meltdown may have very serious consequences  i m very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegal  i would be very worried if  in fact  the obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about trump campaign activity with foreign governments  this would hardly be the first time trump s pathetic attempt to make someone look bad backfired  you can watch graham defend obama below   lindseygrahamsc responds to donald trump s claim that obama wiretapped him https   t co  https   t co   cnn   cnn  march    image via scott olson and drew angerer   getty images
