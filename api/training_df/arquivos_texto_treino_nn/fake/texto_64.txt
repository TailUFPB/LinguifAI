sunday morning  after what must have seemed like another interminable weekend of scrutiny  terror  and being made to look like a fool  donald trump returned to doing what he does best  being an absolute garbage person  he was still recovering from the humiliation of his hilariously bad attempt at pretending time magazine  offered  him their person of the year honorific  followed by the embarrassment of trying to troll cnn  only to see their response tweet get twice the likes and retweets of his original so trump had to up his game  and how could he possibly piss off more people than by pivoting back to roy moore  the accused pedophile running for the us senate in alabama even some of trump s most ardent supporters have begged the doddering dotard to back off his support for the toxic candidate  it s hard  as you might imagine  to truly get behind a guy who s accused of molesting young girls  especially with so much evidence against him  but trump tried nonetheless the last thing we need in alabama and the u s  senate is a schumer pelosi puppet who is weak on crime  weak on the border  bad for our military and our great vets  bad for our  amendment  and wants to raises taxes to the sky  jones would be a disaster   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    endorsed luther strange in the alabama primary  he shot way up in the polls but it wasn t enough  can t let schumer pelosi win this race  liberal jones would be bad   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    s an interesting tack to take   just talking about how terrible doug jones is  rather than addressing the fact that roy moore is accused of touching children inappropriately  what s more interesting is how wrong he is on every count  weak on crime  jones successfully prosecuted the kkk members who blew up a birmingham church  killing four young black girls in   the second amendment  the most jones supports as far as gun control is expanded background checks  bad for the military  jones supports increased military spending  a position that puts him at odds with the two lawmakers that trump tries to  tie  jones to in his tweets  jones is largely considered a moderate among democrats the bottom line is  trump is terrified of losing a crucial vote on his signature tax cuts for the wealthy  he is so calculating that if he didn t have something so important pending  he would throw roy moore under the bus in a heartbeat   despite the similarities between accusations against moore and accusations against himself this is the worst of politics  people  and when the republican party is bloodied on the floor of america  they can thank their garbage president who refused to back away from a child molester just because he wants to  accomplish  something before he s booted out of office featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
