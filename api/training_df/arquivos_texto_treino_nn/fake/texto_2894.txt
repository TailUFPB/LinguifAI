while trump is busy trying to convince the world that he s the most popular president in history  others who know the truth are sitting back and laughing  that includes the dallas stars  the hockey team from the very red state of texas  they decided they were going to poke fun at trump over his claim that there had to be at least   million people at his inauguration  there weren t   and they did so using their jumbotron stars jumbotron with a topical joke  pic twitter com   kate morrison   unlikelyfanatic  january     that says their attendance was   million  this is their way of drawing attention to the fact that  as mashable put it  donald trump is really  really obsessed with numbers  especially those that reflect his popularity  sending members of his staff into the world armed with  lies  and  alternative facts  to claim the attendance at his inauguration was hyuge  kate morrison  the person who tweeted the pic of the stars  jumbotron  apparently received several thousand retweets within a half hour  as of the time of this posting  she had well over   retweets  and more than   likes the stars do tend to be irreverent when it comes to egotistical celebrities and their own opponents  they ve trolled justin bieber and toronto  and they went after the city of winnipeg  too  where they posted a list of  reasons  to visit winnipeg that included   any suggestions   and  go visit vancouver instead  so this isn t anything new  but it is hilarious given trump s inauguration and his ego  he s so embarrassed by the size of his inaugural crowd that his press secretary  sean spicer  told a a series of outright lies in an attempt to convince us that all evidence to the contrary  no matter how obvious  was fabricated the stars actually had a crowd closer to     there s no sports arena in the u s  that can hold anything close to   million people  but that doesn t matter   if trump will lie about his numbers  then there are people who will counter with something as embarrassing as possible for him featured image via screen captures from embedded tweet
