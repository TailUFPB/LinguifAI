donald trump thought bringing juanita broaddrick to the second presidential debate would be a good idea for people who might have forgotten  in the early   when president bill clinton was running his first campaign  broaddrick went public with her accusations that clinton had raped her in the  while running for governor and that hillary had intimidated her into silence as expected  it created a media circus  no such accusation had ever been thrown at a presidential candidate in such a manner however  years after the accusations surfaced  broaddrick  in a sworn affidavit in december   during the paula jones scandal  admitted that president clinton had never made any un warranted sexual advances towards here as obtained by the washington post   i met president clinton more than twenty years ago through family friends  our introduction was not arranged or facilitated  in any way  by the arkansas state police  i have never been an arkansas state employee or a federal employee  i have never discussed with mr  clinton the possibility of state or federal employment nor has he offered me any such position  i have had no further relations with him for the past    years   during the  presidential campaign there were unfounded rumors and stories circulated that mr  clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies  newspaper and tabloid reporters hounded me and my family  seeking corroboration of these tales  i repeatedly denied the allegations and requested that my family s privacy be respected  these allegations are untrue and i had hoped that they would no longer haunt me  or cause further disruption to my family        specifically  i do not have any information to offer regarding a nonconsensual or unwelcome sexual advance by mr  clinton  any discussion offer or provision of state or federal employment or advancement in exchange for sexual conduct  or any use of state troopers to procure women for sex  requiring my testimony at a deposition in this matter would cause unwarranted attorney s fees and costs  disruption to my life and constitute an invasion of my right to privacy  for these reasons  i have asked my attorney to advise ms  jones s counsel that there is no truth to the rumors they are pursuing and to provide her counsel with this sworn affidavit known as jane doe   at the time  broaddrick admitted  to law enforcement and to the courts of this country  six years after the initial accusation   that president clinton never raped her and if bill didn t rape her  how would hillary clinton have intimidated her into silence seems as though the trump campaign didn t so their research  sad considering broaddrick lied  could one see why hillary clinton wouldn t take too lightly to such awful and shameful accusations that were never true to begin with  that s why women take her side on these issues the fact that donald trump used a liar as a prop to deflect from his own sexual prowess shows how desperate and pathetic him and his whole campaign is featured image via justin sullivan getty images
