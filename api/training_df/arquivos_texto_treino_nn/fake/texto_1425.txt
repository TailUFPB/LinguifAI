the department of justice announced on wednesday that former fbi director robert mueller has been named as special counsel for the investigation into donald trump s likely collusion with russia  after a week that has rocked washington to the core and left the white house in utter chaos  the statement released by trump in response to the news that special counsel had been appointed shows just how bad things really are within the oval office the statement consisted of a mere three sentences  as i have stated many times  a thorough investigation will confirm what we already know   there was no collusion between my campaign an any foreign entity  i look forward to this matter concluding quickly  in the meantime  i will never stop fighting for the people and the issues that matter most to the future of our country  the first thing that stands out about this statement is that it is distinctly un trumplike  and this uncharacteristically coherent statement also shows the white house is understanding the gravity of the current situation  despite the words themselves  these three short sentences show that trump clearly knows he is in deep sh t after he fired fbi director james comey  news broke that trump had tried to pressure him to drop the russia investigation and trump s twitter feed went silent  something very unusual for the tweeter in chief  until he released this short statement  the only remarks he had made were at a commencement speech for the u s  coast guard  where he whined that he had been treated more unfairly than any other president in history   insert eye roll here  at this point  pundits are speculating that trump may have hired an outside attorney who is telling him to shut the hell up  no one really knows whether he has sought counsel or not  although he clearly should if he hasn t because he s definitely going to need it  but his statement and his silence make one thing very clear  trump knows he s in trouble  he may want it all to just go away  but the appointment of special counsel guarantees that this  matter  will not be  concluding quickly   and even trump is smart enough to know it this time featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
