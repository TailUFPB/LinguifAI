donald trump thinks the healthcare bill republicans passed to repeal the affordable care act is  wonderful  and promised even more such bills to come  we are sooo screwed after years of trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law  house republicans passed a bill on monday that they dubiously named the  american healthcare act  except that there is nothing  american  about it  nor does it provide healthcare to anyone who needs it the monstrous bill pretty much leaves  million americans out in the cold without insurance  republicans stripped subsidies away from low income americans and will give them to families who can actually afford to pay for healthcare without government aid  the bill also wipes out the medicaid expansion that allowed millions more to obtain coverage  furthermore  the bill kills the insurance mandate  which guaranteed that enough americans would have health insurance that the insurance pool would be able to cover people with pre existing conditions  the bill also makes senior citizens pay more for healthcare and defunds planned parenthood  which would strip low income women of the health services they need  including cancer screenings overall  the bill a big  fuck you  from republicans to the american people  so  of course  trump loves it trump crowed about the republican bill and then attacked the affordable care act by claiming that it is  imploding however  it s only  imploding  because trump and republicans are sabotaging it so it doesn t work the way it should our wonderful new healthcare bill is now out for review and negotiation  obamacare is a complete and total disaster   is imploding fast   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    then tweeted that this bill is only the first  phase  of his plan to destroy healthcare in this country  and he actually thinks that  getting rid of state lines  will bring the cost of healthcare down don t worry  getting rid of state lines  which will promote competition  will be in phase     of healthcare rollout   foxandfriends  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    apparently  drug prices is one of his targets i am working on a new system where there will be competition in the drug industry  pricing for the american people will come way down   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    trump  that means americans who rely on affordable and accessible pharmaceuticals are about to get hammered this is a really bad bill for the american people  so bad  in fact  that four republican senators are prepared to oppose it  which means it will be dead on arrival in the senate  a majority of americans support the affordable care act and the protections and benefits it provides  the uninsured rate is at an all time low and more people have access to healthcare than ever before  trump s plan will only hurt tens of millions of americans while setting healthcare in this country back by decades featured image via jim lo scalzo   pool getty images
