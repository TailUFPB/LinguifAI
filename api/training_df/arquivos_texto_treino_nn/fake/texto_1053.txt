well  that has to be embarrassing ever since election day  trump has insisted that he won the popular vote despite the fact that hillary clinton actually won it by nearly  million votes according to trump  hillary only won it because of  voter fraud   accusing nearly three million people of voting illegally in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    the popular vote has been a sore spot for trump as his fragile ego just can t handle rejection and so  trump decided to create a panel to investigate i will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud  including those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    you may also recall  trump has repeatedly refused to create a panel to investigate the russian interference in the election that helped him win well  that s about to change according to the boston globe  two members of the panel are calling for looking at russian hacking of voting systems in more than two dozen states  a departure from what trump intended the panel to investigate new hampshire secretary of state bill gardner and maine secretary of state matthew dunlap have requested that the panel look at russian interference  which trump has repeatedly claimed never happened despite evidence to the contrary  there s stuff coming out now that states were hacked in this election   gardner said  if you are looking at the integrity of the election  you have to look at things that might compromise that integrity   dunlap added   that includes things that might happen electronically  and kansas secretary of state and trump ally kris kobach agrees with them  in the initial descriptions of the commission  election security and the integrity of equipment and voter databases was not specifically described   kobach said   but if it s something the commission wants to discuss  we can  in short  trump s own  voter fraud  panel is going to take a look at russian interference in the  election  which is probably the last thing trump wanted them to investigate  but the problem with investigating the  voter fraud  that trump claims cost him the popular vote is that instances of voter fraud are negligible  even republican state officials have criticized trump for making such an outrageous claim  so it s likely the panel simply didn t have much to do because voter fraud is so rare in our country  now they are going to investigate real voter fraud and trump must be terrified because he slipped up on thursday morning by admitting that russia did interfere  only he also attempted to blame it on president obama by the way  if russia was working so hard on the  election  it all took place during the obama admin  why didn t they stop them   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    not only is congress and special prosecutor robert mueller investigating  trump s own panel is investigating now  the only walls trump is seeing right now are the ones closing in on him and his treachery featured image  jason kempin and sean gallup getty images
