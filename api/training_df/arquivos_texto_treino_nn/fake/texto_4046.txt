we all know trump is vindictive  if he wasn t  he wouldn t be threatening lawsuits against everyone under the sun  and promising to change libel laws so it s easier to sue media outlets that dare to report bad things about him  even if they re true   at a private lunch  years ago  when richard branson was expecting to just talk with trump about whatever over lunch  it turned out that all trump could talk about was his bankrupt companies and the people who d refused to help him financially in an interview on cnn  branson flat out said  it was just the two of us  i was expecting an interesting lunch talking about various things in the world and instead i got a lunch where all he talked about was his bankrupt companies  then trump said that he d tried to get help from five different people  all of whom had told him  more or less  to go fuck himself  branson then said what trump had planned for those people  and then he spent the rest of this lunch telling me how he was going to spend the rest of his life destroying those five people  he s also hell bent on destroying any press outlets  like the new york times  that won t make him look good  and he s obsessed with destroying the women who have accused him of sexual assault  because they aren t helping him either maybe trump had lunch with branson because he was hoping branson would help him out financially  branson is only the  wealthiest person in the world  but trump is   according to forbes  that s this year  several years ago  when this lunch took place  trump may have been in considerably worse shape  certainly his companies were in terrible shape branson went on to say that trump s vindictive nature is dangerous for america  in fact  he couldn t believe that such a vengeful and petty man would even get this far in a presidential election  he s hoping he can get through to people who think trump is wonderful  and will be good for america and the world trump is not a good man photo of richard branson by mike coppola via getty images for tribeca film festival  photo of trump by joe raedle via getty images
