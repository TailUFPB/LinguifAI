remember when trump said that we were done with nafta  and rumors swirled that he was drafting an executive order withdrawing us from the agreement  and remember how he softened that position very quickly  it seems that he wasn t the one to reach out to canadian prime minister justin trudeau on that  nor did trudeau call him of his own accord white house officials reached out to him behind trump s back why  because they were concerned that trump would unilaterally yank us out of it  hurting multiple sectors of our economy and doing zero favors for canada and mexico as well  so  according to canada s national post newspaper  they contacted trudeau themselves  the unconventional diplomatic manoeuvre  approaching the head of a foreign government to influence your own boss  proved decisive  as trump thereafter abandoned his threat to pull out of nafta unilaterally  citing the arguments made by trudeau and mexican president enrique pena nieto as pivotal  trump  in a childish tantrum  slapped a  percent tariff on imports of softwood lumber from canada  claiming that our agreement with them over that was unfair  he wholly neglected other parts of our trade relationship with canada  including the fact that they import a lot more dairy from us than they export to us in other words  if trump would actually take a look at how things are working  he might find that things aren t quite as unfair to us as he makes them out to be with his tantrums trump has also threatened to levy massive taxes on products imported from rexnord a company that just closed its indiana plant and laid off more than  workers as punishment for sending its jobs to mexico rexnord of indiana made a deal during the obama administration to move to mexico  fired their employees  tax product big that s sold in u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    the national post put it  this incident highlights the following issue with trump  but the incident highlights the difficulties faced by governments all over the world when it comes to dealing with a president as volatile as trump  trump has no business being the leader of the free world featured image by ron sachs pool via getty images
