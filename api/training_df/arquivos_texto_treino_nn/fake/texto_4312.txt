earlier today  an audio recording surfaced of donald trump talking about working really hard to fuck a married woman eight months after he married melania  but this is about more than just a leaked extramarital affair  he actually tried to assault this woman and he bragged that he just starts kissing beautiful women  which is likewise sexual assault his inner circle and surrogates don t know what to do with this mike pence actually dodged his press pool and then disappeared when they asked him about it  politico s matthew nussbaum got that on video and posted it to twitter earlier today my attempt to get pence to respond to the trump tape  he ignored the question  pic twitter com   matthew nussbaum   matthewnussbaum  october     when he s had a chance to calm down  he ll tell the press that trump never said those things he said  he s good at that  maybe he ll even say the audio was doctored  the washington post s david farenthold obviously fabricated it  whatever  it ll be the only way that mr  mike family values pence can deal with this without cracking up one of pence s campaign staffers said that his hasty departure with no comment to his press pool had nothing to do with this news  we call bullshit on that ben carson  another staunch defender of  family values   and who s one of trump s surrogates now for whatever reason  said through his spokesman that this is no big deal  because everyone cheats on their spouse  you know  these things happen  i m sure somebody could find a video of bill clinton talking like this   are we gonna say bill clinton was the same person as president that he is today  obviously not people commit adultery  it happens  ministers  heads of state  everyday people  people are human  they do human things  it s nothing unusual that somebody committed adultery on their spouse  women do it  men do it  should we be shocked by it  no  the difference is that republicans tried to argue  back in the day  that bill clinton s sexual escapades made him unfit to be president  they felt  at the time  that presidents should be held to a higher standard  yet here s ben carson  a staunch evangelical and republican  basically saying   eh  everyone does it  so what  others are not so quick to defend him  though  paul ryan  who had finally managed to swallow his bile enough to appear with trump  disinvited him to the wisconsin event tomorrow and will appear alone he said  i am sickened by what i heard today  women are to be championed and revered  not objectified  i hope mr  trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests  rnc chairman reince priebus  who has spent an awful lot of time defending trump from various attacks since the july convention  blasted him  no woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner  ever  and one of his own campaign advisers said  this should have never happened  i wish it had never happened  i think i know that men talk this way sometimes  but it s nothing i would ever want to hear or condone or approve of  my reaction is   it s appalling  it s just flat out appalling  the adviser said   another day in trump world i hate it  trump s campaign did issue an apology  but it was lukewarm and backhanded and tried to deflect some of the backlash by saying bill clinton was probably worse and so it goes  if bill clinton was unfit to serve because of his extramarital affairs  then what s trump for sexually assaulting women and openly bragging about it  the gop will never coalesce around a response for this featured image by ethan miller getty images
