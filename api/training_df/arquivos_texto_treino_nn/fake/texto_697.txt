the people working in donald trump s white house are not the sharpest tools in the shed  after all  anyone with any sense whatsoever will stay far  far away from working for this administration at all  because of trump s penchant for ruining the lives and careers of everyone around him via public humiliation  therefore  it should come as no surprise that an  email prankster  from the united kingdom managed to trick several white house officials into believing he was jared kushner according to cnn  homeland security adviser tom bossert feel for the hoax  the email read  tom  we are arranging a bit of a soir e towards the end of august  it would be great if you could make it  i promise food of at least comparible  sic  quality to that which we ate in iraq  should be a great evening  bossert returned the email to the kushner imposter  and even gave the person his own email address  thanks  jared  with a promise like that  i can t refuse  also  if you ever need it  my personal email is   redacted  here is an image of the exchange  via cnn now  this guy is in charge of advising the loons in the white house on how to keep us safe  yet  he was too dumb to realize that this was a hoax  likely for kicks  as the rest of the world is laughing at the clown car that is the trump administration  think about that  and be absolutely terrified they also got freshly fired white house communications director anthony  the mooch  scaramucci  from cnn  i had promised myself i would leave my hands mud free   wrote the fake priebus   but after reading your tweet today which stated how   soon we will learn who in the media who has class  and who hasn t   has pushed me to this  that tweet was breathtakingly hypocritical  even for you  at no stage have you acted in a way that s even remotely classy  yet you believe that s the standard by which everyone should behave towards you  general kelly will do a fine job  i ll even admit he will do a better job than me  but the way in which that transition has come about has been diabolical  and hurtful  i don t expect a reply  none of these people should be anywhere near our government  and yet they are running the whole damn thing  trump supporters  if you think this is what things are supposed to be like  you really are as stupid as we always thought you were featured image via alex wong getty images
