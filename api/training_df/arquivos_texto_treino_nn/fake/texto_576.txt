after a white nationalist rally in charlottesville  virginia ended in violence  americans have been looking to donald trump to denounce the violence and condemn white supremacy  unfortunately  the response of the disgraced president of the united states has been nothing but disappointing as he refuses to stand up against the dangerous beliefs that made this rally possible  trump s weak response was simply  we all must be united   condemn all that hate stands for  there is no place for this kind of violence in america  lets come together as one  america doesn t need to be told that it elected the wrong person  most of americans didn t even vote for this racist imbecile  the majority of the country voted for democratic candidate hillary clinton  and most of us still believe that she should be in the white house  if it had been her in the oval office  this rally may not have even happened   and her response to this emergency solidifies the fact that she should have been potus in reaction to the horrifying violence and racist rally  clinton publicly condemned white supremacy and expressed empathy for those affected by the hateful environment trump and his supporters have created  clinton tweeted  my heart is in charlottesville today  and with everyone made to feel unsafe in their country  like a true leader  clinton called for unity against the violence and bigotry  clinton continued  but the incitement of hatred that got us here is as real and condemnable as the white supremacists in our streets  every minute we allow this to persist through tacit encouragement or inaction is a disgrace   corrosive to our values  now is the time for leaders to be strong in their words   deliberate in their actions  once again  clinton surfaces as the leader that america truly needed  unfortunately  we re stuck with a racist toddler featured image chip somodevilla and justin sullivan    getty images
