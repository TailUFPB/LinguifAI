after donald trump s saturday morning tweetstorm  we have no choice but to wonder what  exactly  he is worried about  ever since the  pee pee dossier  was originally released  we have seen trump s ravings evolve from complaints about  fake news  to demands that the  illegal leaks  stop  on saturday  the donald expanded on his at times incomprehensible ravings by blaming obama for people learning about his and his campaign s illicit activities involving russian oligarchs terrible  just found out that obama had my  wires tapped  in trump tower just before the victory  nothing found  this is mccarthyism   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    isn t mccarthyism  while trump did not provide any evidence of his claim  it was well known by intelligence agencies rather early in   trump even publicly asked the dictator of a hostile foreign power to hack his political opponents  it s only natural for our intelligence agencies to want to look into that saying nothing of the evidence that has been uncovered that his team kept in constant contact with high ranking russian officials during the campaign  trump demanded to know if it is legal for our intelligence agencies to investigate someone who is openly colluding with vladimir putin against the interests of the american people is it legal for a sitting president to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election  turned down by court earlier  a new low   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march     he threatened to go after president obama in court because our intelligence agencies did their jobs i d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that president obama was tapping my phones in october  just prior to election   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  march    didn t quite explain his next tweet  but he is more right than he knows about part of it   how low has president obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process  this is nixon watergate  bad  or sick  guy   president asterisk whined this is  indeed  very much like nixon watergate in that nixon was guilty and did quite a bit of public flailing before the investigation into his crimes was complete  but it seems that trump was saying that nixon  like himself  was innocent and that president obama was  sick  for allegedly authorizing wiretaps against such a pristine example of a human being as trump naturally  americans were all over this one   mikepwilliams this is truly staggering  he seems paranoid   jordan uhl   jordanuhl  march    realdonaldtrump and the paranoia is starting to sink in   pic twitter com   rob szczerba   rjszczerba  march    realdonaldtrump looks like he s breaking out the tin foil hats again   pic twitter com   rob szczerba   rjszczerba  march    realdonaldtrump you know when you say you want to make education great again  does that include spelling   matt haig     march     realdonaldtrump this is nixon watergate  if by that you mean you ll be impeached and resign in disgrace   nick jack pappas   pappiness  march    realdonaldtrump hopefully your presidency ends like nixon watergate   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  march

illegally delete this  supposedly  archived tweet    theresistance   aynrandpaulryan  march    realdonaldtrump you ve been tweeting paranoid  unsubstantiated  unproven crap for an hour  who is driving america   craig stone   craigstone  march    realdonaldtrump your attempt to spin a situation in which your staff broke laws by communicating with russian spies is ludicrous      stephen robert morse   morsels  march    realdonaldtrump four tweets now about this wire tap story and still no specifics starting to think you re reading conspiracy blogs   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  march     realdonaldtrump he didn t need to tap anything  you re always on here spilling your guts  also  nixon was guilty  rather like yourself   jane slavin   janeslavin  march    realdonaldtrump and you are nixon  you know how that ends      don t lie to your country or obstruct justice   jose andrade   jandrade  march    realdonaldtrump nope  you are worse than nixon  and this fiasco is worse than watergate   andrea kuszewski   andreakuszewski  march    realdonaldtrump tweeting doesn t seem like the right way to level charges like these on a former president  unless they are nonsense   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  march    realdonaldtrump even for you this is fucking embarrassing   michael beveridge     march    realdonaldtrump is this going to be another  obama isn t an american citizen  until it s politically convenient to admit you were wrong   matthewdicks   matthewdicks  march    realdonaldtrump did he go so low as to collude with a foreign power to get himself elected   raoul binderschmidt   skeletorjesus  march     last year it was revealed that trump had a special console next to his bed at the mar a lago that allowed him to spy on guests  phone conversations  though trump denied it  numerous former staffers confirmed that the billionaire did  indeed  spy on guests  unlike the possibility that our intelligence agencies did  tapp  trump s phone during the campaign   with good reason   this would be a crime  it is illegal in florida to intercept or record phone calls without the consent of everyone involved in the conversation hopefully  trump is right that this is like nixon watergate  we all know how that ended featured image via getty images  pool  screengrab
