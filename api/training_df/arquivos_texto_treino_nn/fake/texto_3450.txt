our former u n  ambassador  john bolton  is a ridiculous conspiracy theorist  he s so ridiculous that sen  rand paul  r ky  will work to block his appointment to the department of state as undersecretary  and  because conspiracy theorists can never keep their mouths shut about anything  he s got an absolutely wild theory about the russian hacks  obama did it seriously  that s the idea he floated on fox news earlier today  he thinks that the hacks may have actually been a false flag operation courtesy of the obama administration  it is not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside  that this hacking into the dnc and the rnc computers was not a false flag operation  a false flag would mean that obama himself undermined our electoral process to what  make russia look bad  start a war  the guy sounds like alex jones  who thinks everything that happens is a false flag of one type or another bolton s  logic   if  indeed  it can be called that  is this  f you think the russians did this  then why did they leave fingerprints we would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the russians  that s why i say until we know more about how the intelligence community came to this conclusion we don t know whether it is russian inspired or a false flag  bolton is likely doing wonders for trump s relationship with the intelligence community  trump already pissed off the cia by going after them for their report  rather than doing the responsible thing and calling for an investigation  but then again  if a real investigation did take place  it could reveal he didn t legitimately win the election the horror his ego couldn t handle that and bolton s conspiracy theorish nature couldn t handle an investigation  either  even so  accusing the obama administration of orchestrating a false flag operation to steer our election and make it look like russia did it is a serious deal  no wonder rand paul doesn t want this guy anywhere near the presidential cabinet the full exchange is below  via twitter john bolton suggests dnc hack was potentially a false flag operation by the obama administration pic twitter com   ben jacobs   bencjacobs  december    image by ethan miller via getty images
