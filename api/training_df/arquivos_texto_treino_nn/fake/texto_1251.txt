trump took some time today during a white house meeting with republican congressional leaders to brag about his new ideas for the border wall  according to three meeting attendees  trump proposed that the wall could be covered with solar panels  and pay for the cost of the wall with the electricity it generated trump was happy about his idea of a wall that was up to  feet high and solar panel covered  he bragged that they would be  beautiful structures   because most walls are only  or  feet high  and these ones would be taller and better trump did have one caveat going forward with solar panel border wall discussion   he insisted that lawmakers could talk about it as long as they told everyone it was his idea  the truth is  obviously  it wasn t  but remember  we have a toddler for a president a solar panel covered wall was actually proposed in a bid submitted during a u s  requests for wall designs at the beginning of the year  according to a report by the ap  the companies who get the contracts will likely be announced later this month this begs the question   can we use the president s toddler tendencies for the good of the planet  maybe all we need to do to get trump to support renewable energy is to give him credit for coming up with it and give him extra praise like a three year old who ate his vegetables  you did it  trumpy photo by olivier douliery pool getty images
