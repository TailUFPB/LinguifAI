pennsylvania is always one of the most sought after states in presidential elections  and even though it has been reliably democratic  republicans often believe that its  electoral votes are within reach  with that in mind  there s almost nothing the gop won t do to get those votes  including busing in people from out of state in order to intimidate voters   especially minority voters and now pennsylvania republicans are going to court to do just that the pennsylvania republican party filed a complaint late friday night asking a federal court to allow out of county poll watchers to monitor voting stations on election day filed on behalf of eight keystone state voters  the suit alleges that state law restricting poll watchers to the county in which they re registered violates the first amendment and denies them their right to equal protection under the law republican presidential nominee donald trump has been muttering for weeks that the election has been  rigged    a conspiracy theory that has coincided with him dropping in almost every national poll  from anywhere from  to  percent as a result  many republican voters have now convinced themselves that there is a massive national operation underway to  steal  the election from trump  and trump has told his backers that this effort is coming from cities in swing states  and those cities are largely the main source of votes from black and latino voters  both of whom are overwhelmingly democratic those voters are more motivated than usual to vote against trump  because he launched his campaign by describing mexicans as  criminals  and  rapists  and repeatedly making it seem as if black people only live in urban blight  forever under fire by drug gangs and enduring lives of complete desperation  success and middle class livelihoods for ethnic minorities simply don t exist in trump s view of the world and his party doesn t want them voting featured image by michael candelori  cc by   via flickr
