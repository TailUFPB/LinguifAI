late show host stephen colbert has been having a high old time ripping donald trump and his crazy  scandal ridden administration to shreds on a nightly basis  however  no matter his open loathing of trump  the comedian never crossed the line of questioning the integrity of the election result   until now on tuesday night in a real humdinger of a monologue  colbert started in on the story about how nsa contractor reality winner leaked secret documents that revealed that the election hack was much broader than the american public had previously been aware of  indeed  it seems the russians hacked into the electoral system right up until election day  colbert said of this development  days before  come on  guccifer  that s poor planning  you can t leave your hacking to last minute  put some thought into it  no one wants an election you just picked up at walgreens  that s when colbert hit his home run  who really knows who won november  now  i mean  other than vladimir putin  now  i m a little rusty on my constitution  but i guess that means new election  of course  the crowd cheered heartily at this  and colbert lapped it up and continued  let s just get the band back together  somebody find jeb and wake him up  i don t know where he is  check the mild salsa aisle  or a store that sells only mayonnaise now  all along  donald trump has said the entire russia story is fake news  and there s no way to know whether this document that was released was real   other than the fact that the leaker was immediately arrested   all in all  there s just so much goodness in this monologue that you just have to watch it for yourself  in all seriousness though  colbert is right   the american public now has very good and valid reasons to question the integrity of the outcome of the presidential election in   we do need a new election  we have to have faith in our electoral process  and we don t have it now it s time to find some constitutional mechanism to make this happen watch colbert s brilliance below  featured image via video screen capture
