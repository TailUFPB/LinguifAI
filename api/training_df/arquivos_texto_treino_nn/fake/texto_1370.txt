donald trump has made a habit of embarrassing america in front of other world leaders  but on monday he outdid himself kicking the week off  trump outed israel for being the source of intelligence information that he d given to russia   a move that disgusted israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu  however  he was far from done ruining america s reputation  as he spoke in israel  trump stated that he d just gotten back from the middle east  completely oblivious to the fact that israel is actually in the middle east  trump said  our secretary of state has done a great job  we just got back from the middle east  saudi arabia  and we were treated incredibly well  it s almost too ridiculous to be true  but then again  what else can we expect from trump  you can watch the incident below  and pay attention to the reaction of israeli ambassador ron dermer  who tries to disguise a very obvious facepalm by running his fingers through his hair oh man  watch israeli ambassador ron dermer  on right couch  react when trump says in israel we just got back from the middle east   pic twitter com      yair rosenberg      yairrosenberg  may    doesn t get much more humiliating than this  already  the white house has had to defend several of trump s mistakes during his international tour  citing  exhaustion  as the primary excuse for his pathetic performance  it s only been a few days   however  we all know that trump is actually that dumb and doesn t know anything about other countries or how the world works one can only imagine how hard everyone in the room had to concentrate to avoid correcting or laughing at trump after such an insane f ckup  trump has proven  once again  that america s current president is a joke  and no one can take him seriously featured image via screen capture from embedded video
