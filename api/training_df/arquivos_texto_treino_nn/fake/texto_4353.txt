republicans have officially sunk so low this election they couldn t possibly go deeper   or so you d think  last night s vice presidential debate showed two men  one an honorable senator and the other a lap dog governor  go at each other over policy and personal barbs  republicans criticized tim kaine for interrupting too much  but were silent when trump did the same thing to hillary clinton   and donald trump felt it necessary to  on twitter of course  mock kaine s personal appearance  kellyanne conway   who refuses to acknowledge trump s record deficit with female voters   suggested kaine was sexist but perhaps the most deplorable of all insults hurdled at tim kaine s way comes from world net daily writer jerome corsi  phd  corsi   who  exposed president obama s former life as a gay drug dealer   took to twitter to denounce kaine s pin  which is recognized by the department of defense for families with those serving in the military  corsi referred to the sacred pin as  ho chi minh    viet cong   and  leftist secret squirrel stuff   corsi also accused kaine of not respecting the military because the pin  he felt  was too narrow and didn t do enough to honor all those who have served   including those who have died waiting to receive care from the va corsi deleted several tweets in response to other users  but luckily we got screenshots saved of the monstrosity for a party that claims to support the military  the troops  military families  and veterans  they certainly have a hard time showing it  corsi  along with the north carolina gop  which also mocked kaine s pin as being communist sympathizing  shows how utterly heartless  foul and downright dirty the gop can be  by all means  object to kaine s policy ideas  object to his running mate  hillary clinton  but the minute one trashes his son  and their blue star status  will be the minute of regret so far  world net daily  corsi s employer  has not denounced the comments  nor has any prominent member of the republican party  yet corsi still has a platform to spew his hate and mismanagement of the truth republicans  this election  have mocked blue star families  gold star families  war heroes  veterans with ptsd  our military  and so forth  where will it end  when will republicans stand up and denounce this outrageous  offensive  un american hate that consumes their party featured image via salon
