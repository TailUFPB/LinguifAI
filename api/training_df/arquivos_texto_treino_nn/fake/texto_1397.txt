it s potentially a world record  trump managed to insult his foreign hosts almost immediately after stepping foot off of air force one  and making matters worse  the misstep was so easy to avoid  numerous people tried to warn him but he couldn t be bothered one of donald trump s favorite things to do is give two thumbs up  despite being a  year old man currently facing several fbi and congressional investigations into campaign wrongdoing and a new investigation into possible obstruction of justice  trump s go to gesture is a big smile and a thumbs up for the cameras  nixon had the double peace sign  trump has his thumbs up  i guess it s supposed to project confidence in the face of so much chaos  is it working but to anyone with even cursory knowledge of saudi arabian customs  the gesture trump loves so much doesn t mean the same thing over there  in fact  like many places around the world  a thumbs up is equivalent to giving a middle finger  knowing trump s ignorance of other cultures and his love for the gesture meant anyone could see that he was walking into a disaster  he was warned  repeatedly taboos in saudi arabia  last bullet point   trump s signature gesture  pic twitter com   annie karni   anniekarni  may    would assume trump might scan the list of  taboos  on the  hour flight over to a country he s never been  but trump   whose pastimes include watching fox news and eating fast food   apparently skipped the memo  too many words instead  trump stepped off his plane and instantly did what everyone knew he would  thumbs up did trump spend the plane ride over studying arab customs  or yelling at subordinates and eating kfc with silver cutlery  pic twitter com sbchbuojnu  tom the dancing bug   rubenbolling  may    s insta gaffe is just another sign that the president is not taking his first trip abroad seriously  already sources within the white house have leaked trump s dread of the trip  he repeatedly asked that the trip be shortened  he refused to prep for it meanwhile  foreign dignitaries are preparing for trump s visit by trump proofing everything  diplomats are encouraged to play to trump s outsized ego and limited attention span keep it short   no  minute monologue for a  second attention span  do not assume he knows the history of the country or its major points of contention  compliment him on his electoral college victory  contrast him favorably with president barack obama  do not get hung up on whatever was said during the campaign  stay in regular touch  do not go in with a shopping list but bring some sort of deal he can call a victory the bar being set so low for trump probably means that the saudis weren t particularly surprised that trump immediately flashed a rude gesture  in the same way a toddler might get away with behavior that would be unacceptable for an older person  trump s inability to rise to any occasion  no matter how easy  means he s given a lot of leeway featured image via mark wilson getty images
