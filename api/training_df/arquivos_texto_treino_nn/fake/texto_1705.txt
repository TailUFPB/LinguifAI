we all remember the absolutely disastrous visit donald trump had with german chancellor angela merkel  he infamously made her look at him like he had lost his mind when joked about her allegedly being wiretapped by the obama administration while he was busy trying to defend his own false claims that obama wiretapped trump tower  refused to shake merkel s hand during a photo op  and even tried to give her a bill for nato worth billions of dollars trump  however  seems to have a very different memory of his visit with the german leader  while speaking of the visit with the associated press  trump said  yeah  it s funny  one of the best chemistries i had was with merkel  as if that weren t ridiculous enough  considering that the whole world saw how that visit actually went  trump continued  this time trying to excuse his rudeness with the handshake debacle  and i guess somebody shouted out   shake her hand  shake her hand   you know  but i never heard it  but i had already shaken her hand four times  you know  because we were together for a long time  he went on to boast  because  um  i m at odds on  you know  the nato payments and i m at odds on immigration  featured image via justin sullivan getty images
