donald trump just broke his biggest promise to his supporters in a bigly way during his speech in gettysburg  pennsylvania on saturday  the republican nominee listed some of the things he plans to do in his first  days in office if he is elected to the presidency on november  one of those things is a draconian anti immigration policy that includes deporting millions of immigrants  whom trump called criminals and killers  back to mexico  he also said he would cut off funding to cities that give immigrants sanctuary but his main point  as usual  was all about his damn wall along the mexican border trump has repeatedly declared that mexico will pay for this massive structure  which experts estimate will cost up to   billion but during his speech  trump changed his tune in a way that suggests america will actually be picking up the tab and merely hoping that mexico will reimburse us for the cost  the end illegal immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border   trump said   don t worry about it  remember i said that mexico is paying for the wall  however  he then added this remark  with the full understanding that the country of mexico will be reimbursing the united states for the full cost of such a wall  okay  here s the video via youtube  trump s remarks on the wall are at the   mark in other words  america will be paying for trump s wall if he becomes president  not mexico because in order for there to even be a need for mexico to reimburse us  it means america would have to pay for the wall first  and that means american taxpayers would be on the hook but just like his insistence that mexico will pay for the wall outright  trump has no way of forcing mexico to reimburse us either  so trump just promised to increase the national debt by billions of dollars within his first  days in short  the central promise trump made to his supporters has just gone up entirely in smoke the question is are trump s supporters too dumb to notice that their hero just admitted that he has been lying to them this whole time  probably not featured image  screenshot
