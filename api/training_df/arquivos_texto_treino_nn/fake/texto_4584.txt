when john boehner left congress  he left behind a stench so bad it took a team of professionals and a hefty chunk of change to get rid of it  no  i m not talking about his obstructionism  i m talking about the fact that boehner is a massive chain smoker  and his office reeked so bad that paul ryan had to have new carpets  furniture and paint in his new office now  boehner has found a new home  and it can only be imagined that the entire building stinks just like boehner s old office  he s now a class  director on the board of reynolds american inc  the company that makes his beloved camel cigarettes  yes  his job will be to lobby congress to help prevent and eliminate those pesky regulations that tobacco companies have to jump through   you know  like the ones that say the tobacco companies can t market to children  although a boehner spokesman spun it to sound like just the opposite  rai is striving to transform the tobacco industry through innovative strategies that include speeding the decline in tobacco use among young people and reducing the harm caused by smoking   said a boehner spokesman   these are objectives speaker boehner supports and looks forward to helping rai advance through his service on the board  source  nprhere s the video the reality is much bleaker  there is a tiny grain of truth in the statement that fewer young people are using tobacco  but one of the things tobacco companies are trying to sell as a safer alternative to tobacco are e cigarettes  which for children  are even worse than traditional cigarettes  just because the cartridge can be broken and children have been known to swallow toxic doses of nicotine not only that  tobacco companies are specifically marketing e cigarettes to young children  often with ads touting their candy like flavors if you recall  boehner stepped down from his speakership and announced that he would be leaving congress immediately after a congressional visit from pope francis  he seemed to imply that the pope had put the  pro life  speaker into a crisis of conscious  in truth  republicans wanted him out  badly  but what happened to the man who claimed his life was changed after meeting the pope nothing that the pope would approve of  smoking is still the leading cause of preventable death in this country  nearly half a million americans die from smoking ever year  while not as many children are picking up cigarettes  hence the panic and the hiring of boehner  more than   new smokers each day are younger than   of those    will become addicts  this is what john boehner is promoting  he s almost better back in congress  at least there  he got nothing done  now  he ll be personally responsible for the deaths of millions and he ll be pushing cigarettes on children featured image via alex wong getty images
