donald trump continues to be the biggest pain in the a   for white house press secretary sean spicer  who seems to visibly hate his job more and more each day earlier today  spicer crashed and burned during his press briefing when reporters cornered him and asked him why trump refused to release the alleged  tapes  and recordings of the private conversations between himself and former fbi director james comey  this was a hot topic  considering that trump had just accused comey of lying under oath last week  when comey said trump demanded that he drop the investigation on michael flynn  trump s former national security adviser when a reporter questioned spicer about why trump wouldn t give up the recordings if they could prove comey had lied during his hearing  it was clear that spicer wanted to hide behind the bushes again  spicer stumbled over his words and said  i think the president made it clear on friday that he would get back as soon as possible on this  things got even more humiliating as the reporter pressed spicer further  so what s he waiting for  what s the delay  it looked like spicer had completely given up defending trump or trying to come up with a more clever response  instead  spicer said  he s waiting for  he s not waiting for anything  when he s ready to further discuss it  he will  but he laid out his position very clearly  very concisely on friday  you can watch this very awkward press briefing below trump has gotten himself in such a mess with this whole russia thing that not even his own team knows how to defend him anymore  as spicer continues to fail trump  the rumors of his termination have only been strengthened  after trump sees this  spicer s days in the white house may be numbered featured image via win mcnamee and alex wong   getty images
