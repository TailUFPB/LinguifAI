gop presidential nominee donald trump has taken a ridiculously hardline   and even bigoted   stance on immigration  he has promised to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it  and he has said that he will erect  deportation forces  to root out and get rid of all people in the united states without proper documentation  well  as we already knew  it turns out that the donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one according to the associated press  it turns out that donald trump s wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia  melania often modeled using just her first name  and was first granted entry into the country on a visitor s visa  known as a   visa  this occurred on august     melania did not get a legal work visa until october     during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country  melania made money on ten different modeling assignments  totaling upwards of     she got a green card in   and became a naturalized citizen in  so  in other words  melania trump lied about her immigration story  as recently as thursday  when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go  and that this is how she did it  melania said  in part  in her stump speech  as a young entrepreneur  i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance  so of course  i came here  living and working in america was a true blessing  but i wanted something more  i wanted to be an american  well  it appears that  as has long been suspected  that melania trump wasn t as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims  the information obtained by the ap include  but are not limited to  her contract from metropolitan international management   a modeling agency  also  there s the ledgers from the agency  which is no longer in business  that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitor s visa  but no work visa  it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melania s wrongdoing  but it is certainly quite interesting  this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship  while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk  it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud  you can read more here at the associated press the long and short of it is this  donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the  other   namely  immigrants  that is the height of hypocrisy  seeing as how his own wife didn t completely comply with immigration law  hopefully this story  and the many other lies and cover ups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country  and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time featured image via alex wong getty images
