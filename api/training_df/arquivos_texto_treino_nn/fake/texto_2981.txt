president elect donald trump has had trouble finding people to perform at his inauguration from the moment he won the election  while a list artists have usually jumped at the opportunity to sing or play for a new president  celebrities have turned trump down left and right  it s been a massive public embarrassment for trump  even as his team uses bribery to get gigs and continues to fail the humiliation is far from over  the very few acts that agreed to perform for trump are now dwindling  the latest to pull out just days before trump s big day is the b street band  a bruce springsteen cover band  the cover band has just announced that  due to the backlash the group received since news broke that they would play for trump  they are abandoning the gig in an interview with rolling stone  will forte  the group s keyboardist  manager  agent and publicist  said that the band received  thousands of emails  that made the band reconsider  he recalled saying to his band members   we re standing out in the storm right here  we gotta get out of the storm  due to the fact that springsteen himself had publicly condemned trump many times before  the band thought it would only be right to honor him and the fans that had made the springsteen cover band a reality  forte said  we owe everything to  and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else  we felt that we had to make it known that we didn t want to seem disrespectful  in any way  shape or form  to bruce and his music and his band  i don t want to upset them  we owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else  it became clear to us that this wasn t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out  twitterthe b street band had actually signed a contract in  to play at this year s gig  but that was before the presidential nominees had been voted on  the band never thought they might have to play for trump  forte revealed  as time went by  the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense  the band was caught in a hurricane  we didn t see this coming  of course  when i started this band  years ago  it was only about performing and making people happy  i never thought the distortion of what we do as a band would ve been so intense  i wish it never would ve happened  we would ve never got involved in this if i knew how this would turn out  i would trade in all the support and publicity just to go back to where we were four months ago  i don t think they ll ever be a cover band of our size in the history of music that will get the attention of something this big  i m worn out  the band s worn out  everybody loves to have their  minutes of fame  but maybe not this way  twitterforte acknowledges that the the b street band may now be punished financially for breaking the contract  but considers its stance more important  forte said  so far  it s okay  but that s all i can say  whatever the consequences are for breaking a contract  i m willing to take because this is much more important  trump is literally about to be left stranded at his inauguration featured image by drew angerer via getty images
