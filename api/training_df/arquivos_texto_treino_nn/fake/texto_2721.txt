you know how everyone suspected that there would be some quid pro quo for all the help vladimir putin gave donald trump during the election  well  it s happening on thursday  donald trump lifted sanctions imposed by president obama that prevented putin from cyberspying  the sanctions were a response to putin s team of hackers doing trump a series of favors by hacking his political opponents and releasing any and all information they could that could assist him in becoming president  reuters reports the treasury department said in a statement it would allow u s  companies to make limited transactions with the intelligence service that are needed to gain approval to import information technology products into russia the broader significance of the sanctions exemptions were not immediately clear  the treasury department often issues general licenses such as the one announced on thursday to help u s  companies overcome unintended business consequences of sanctions u s

concluded the fsb first broke into the democratic national committee s computer system in the summer of  and began monitoring email and chat conversations they say fsb was one of two russian spy agencies believed to have been involved in a wide ranging operation by top ranking individuals in russia s government to discredit democrat hillary clinton and help trump win the election when obama imposed the sanctions  vladimir putin announced that he would wait to respond until after trump became president because he expected a response that favors him  this move was just the first of many we can expect to benefit vladimir putin  this is the same group  fsb  that  just a month ago  our intelligence community determined was responsible for the attack on our democracy   rep  eric swalwell  d calif   ranking member of a house cia subcommittee  said in response to trump  rewarding  putin for his help during the election   we just made it easier for the same group to import into russia the
