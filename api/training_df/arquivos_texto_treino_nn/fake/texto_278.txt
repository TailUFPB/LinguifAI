tea party darling and deadbeat dad extraordinaire joe walsh managed to be douchier than is typical on sunday when he attacked michael che for saying something mean about donald trump it may seem nonsensical that the  fuck your feelings  crowd gets sad every time someone says something to  trigger  them  but walsh apparently needs a safe space after snl s michael che called donald trump a  cracker   among other things  like all conservatives at some point in their lives  walsh became  economically disenfranchised   the media s term for racism among trump voters  enough upon hearing trump described as a  cracker   the name of an all white minor league baseball team in atlanta  georgia in the early parts of last century  to bust out the  n gger  word naturally  the people were not amused you thinking there is any equivalence between those two words demonstrates how thoroughly out of touch you are   bob clendenin   bobclendenin  october    do white conservatives want to say that word so bad  it s very weird   kai   kaisiobhan  october    effort to justify tweeting that word out  is as transparent as it is vile   john pavlovitz   johnpavlovitz  october    even fucking close  joe  way to use the n word though for no reason   harribly bigly   blindfordrumpf  october    pines for the days that a mediocre white man could spout it like an adjective   snarrky   snarrky  october    me when were white people called  crackers  by people that owned them    oh right   carling jaye   carlingjaye  october    took perhaps his most severe beating from joy reid  who correctly pointed out that walsh  like all  conservatives  was looking for a reason to say it you ve been dying to say it  haven t you  joe  you probably say it on your own all the time  well your hood is off now  we see you  https   t co   joy reid   joyannreid  october     walshfreedom oh and kindly pay your child support  your children would be better served by your money than your pernicious influence   joy reid   joyannreid  october    know what  if walsh is mad that a black man called trump a  cracker   i ll go ahead and help out here  i  a white man  feel that donald trump is a willfully ignorant  racist  xenophobic  bathmophobic  traitorous cracker who wants to have sex with his daughter and has said as much on many occasions  the same goes for mr  walsh  possibly without the bit about incest fantasies   who habitually fails to pay child support and probably smells like bourbon and the booths at a sketchy adult video store the majority of the time if mr  walsh wishes to fire back  i regularly receive love letters calling me a  jew   that should get him started
