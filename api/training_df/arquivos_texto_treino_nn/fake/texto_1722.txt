donald trump seems to think he can squeeze congressional democrats for border wall funding by offering them something in exchange  and he also seems to believe he s hit the jackpot on just what to exchange  he ll hold subsidy payments to insurers on the obamacare exchanges hostage until democrats agree to fund his wall  if they continue to stonewall  then  when the aca s insurance marketplace implodes or the government shuts down  or both   he ll blame democrats and the whole country will  too he s not seeing both sides  though  the democrats actually hold all the good cards here why  surely we can see how both sides have a decent hand  can t we  trump s budget director  mick mulvaney  even said  we d offer them   of csr payments for   of wall payments  right now that s the offer that we ve given to our democratic colleagues  a one for one trade sounds nice and equitable  doesn t it  trump gets his wall and we get continued stability in the health insurance market  and the government keeps operating  here s what he s not seeing  democrats aren t the only ones who don t want to waste money on a big wall along the southern border  many republicans don t  either  and that gives democrats major leverage over trump chuck schumer s spokesman issued a statement that said  the white house gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of americans  in order to force american taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the president said would be paid for by mexico is a complete non starter f the administration would drop their  hour demand for a wall that democrats   and a good number of republicans   oppose  congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal  some in the gop have privately said that it would help if the trump white house would move on from the border wall because there are too many in congress who don t want to fund it  furthermore  republicans and democrats in congress are busy working toward creating a more bipartisan spending bill  but they know that  with control of the entire federal government  they will own a healthcare disaster and they will own a shutdown no matter what trump decides to say about it republicans want to avoid a shutdown   they ve long since figured out that the country blamed them for the  shutdown  that means working with democrats  including scrapping funding for the wall if doing so means democrats will agree to other things house minority leader nancy pelosi recognizes that democrats have all the leverage here  and that they need to use that leverage to their advantage  republicans control both congress and the white house   people are not going to blame democrats for a shutdown or for destabilizing the insurance marketplace under these circumstances mulvaney actually thinks that congress should get out of the way of trump s agenda  this president should be allowed to have his highest priorities funded even though the democrats rightly have a seat at the table because of the senate rules  the border wall is a non starter and possibly dead  at least for now  there are more important things to think about than a wall that won t do anything that trump claims it will featured image by shawn thew   pool via getty images
