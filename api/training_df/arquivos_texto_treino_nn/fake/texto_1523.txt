by now  the whole world knows that the investigation into donald trump and his campaign s ties to russia is likely what led to the firing of fbi director james comey  however  new reporting also reveals that comey really didn t think much of trump in the first place  according to a report in the week  comey had expressed concern about trump s temperament as it related to the presidency and the leadership of the nation  he allegedly told confidantes that trump is  crazy  and  outside the realm of normal  like the rest of the sane people in america  comey also seemed to believe that trump s lack of self restraint and his impulsive and reckless statements on twitter were a danger to the nation  further  it seems that trump was angry with comey on several occasions as well  when comey testified in open congressional hearing that there was no evidence to corroborate trump s claim that president obama wiretapped trump tower  trump was incensed  the same is true of comey s refusal to pledge loyalty to trump instead of the united states constitution daniel c  richman  a close adviser to comey  says of the situation  with a president who seems to prize personal loyalty above all else and a director with absolute commitment to the constitution and pursuing investigations wherever the evidence led  a collision was bound to happen  indeed  and that is the problem  trump doesn t give a damn about the constitution or the rule of law  in fact  he seems to only care for himself and what benefits him and makes him look good  he doesn t care about the american people  or the nation  this whole sorry excuse for a  presidency  is nothing more than the ultimate reality show for an incompetent  unfit fool with the biggest ego in the world  unfortunately  we re all paying the price featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
