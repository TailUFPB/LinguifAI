cnn viewers will no longer be entertained by the car crash caliber antics of trump s trailer park propaganda minister kellyanne conway  politico reports that the trump white house will be freezing out news organizations that do not  promote  his hateful agenda   and the donald s favorite  fake news  outlet is the first victim of this extremely questionable policy  we re sending surrogates to places where we think it makes sense to promote our agenda   a white house official explained  a cnn reporter had a more honest explanation of what is going on  they re trying to cull cnn from the herd  white house press secretary  notorious liar and legendary moron sean spicer  claims that the network is not being frozen out because he sometimes answers the network s questions but he does not deny that administration officials are not appearing on cnn  i m not going to sit around and engage with people who have no desire to actually get something right   he said ironically  apparently forgetting that he famously falsely claimed that trump had the biggest inaugural crowd  ever  just last month  trump refused to take a question from cnn because he says they are  fake news  this move is unprecedented  while presidents have feuded with news networks in the past   president obama and fox news  for instance   they did not intentionally freeze out the networks  obama officials  for example  appeared on fox regularly this is a clear attempt to damage cnn s ratings by denying them access to the trump white house   an immature and unpresidential move by a thin skinned bully  and it is entirely unacceptable to only send representatives to networks that are willing to lie for him if the standard for the trump white house sending representatives to a network is their willingness to  promote  his agenda  everyone should aspire to be exactly like cnn  no news network should ever promote any president s agenda when it conflicts with the facts featured image via screengrab getty images  drew angerer
