there are no two crazy people ever mentioned more in the news than the leaders of west and east  donald trump and kim jong un  for the citizens of america and north korea  unfortunately  no two crazy leaders are more alike  from out of control hair to ludicrous proclamations  trump and kim are like brothers from another  deeply disturbed  mother we thought we d take a look at some of the ways the two are alike  starting with what we ve already mentioned kim jong un was the undisputed world champion of insanity until right around the middle of trump s run at the presidency here in the united states  how could anyone compete with kim s reclamation of one half hour from the japanese on august      years after the korean dignitary says japan  stole time  from north korea  it s hard to keep up with a man who learned to drive at only age three trump does his best  though  on day one of his presidency  he insisted that it stopped raining just as he began to give his inaugural address   which was news to those in attendance getting wet as it began raining at precisely that moment  that same day  donald looked out at a crowd roughly half the size of the previous inauguration to take place and declared it  the biggest crowd at any inauguration  ever  kim is famous for using doctored video to fake missile launches  a  show  of his military prowess and resolve  trump prefers to lie the old fashioned way  by just making shit up and hoping nobody calls him on it  we don t actually have room here for a more complete documentation of all of the outright lies from either toddler tyrant  but rest assured that the lists are extensive  although their rallies look slightly different uniforms  flowers  and colorful dresses line the streets of north ko razy  pool getty fans display a makeshift sign made of used beer cases  justin merriman getty in july  upon release of the hwasong  missile  kim  who is literally never seen out of uniform  reportedly  expressed satisfaction  saying it looked as handsome as a good looking boy and was well made  just one month earlier  trump was waxing romantic about his own terrible toys  pitching the sale of  beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the united states  while he was in the middle east  there was no uniform for trump that day  but only because he wasn t on an aircraft carrier remember that time kim jong un said   it would be perfect for obama to live with a group of monkeys in the world s largest african natural zoo and lick the breadcrumbs thrown by spectators  through the korean central news agency i d pretty much put an equals sign between that and the time trump told the former president of trump plaza hotel   casino that  laziness is a trait in blacks  frankly  that s gross  so i m not going to spend a whole lot of time on this entry  other than to say that trump s  you can do anything  looks exactly the same to me as kim s  pleasure squad  so this one s kind of misleading  kim jong un inherited a state media from his dad  they pretty much just say whatever he tells them to say  and he has the final word on whether anything anyone in his country ever says makes it into print  there is no internet for regular citizens in north korea trump  on the other hand  is trying to get there by delegitimizing our constitutionally protected press and supporting television programming that serves as propaganda maybe you ve heard of some of north korea s brutal executions for  crimes  as petty as falling asleep during an event  but do you remember that time donald trump took out full page ads in every paper in new york calling for the execution of the  central park five   a group of teenage boys who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn t commit  they were completely exonerated by dna evidence  and reimbursed   million by the state for their ordeal  trump reiterated his belief that the boys  then men  were guilty as recently as    what were they doing in the park  playing checkers   he tweeted a few years back  to recap the last four horrid sentences  trump wanted the death penalty for a non capital crime that the people didn t commit how could i forget this one  although we don t know the extent of kim jong un s corruption  we can make a pretty educated guess  based on the fact that like his father before him  he lives like a king while the citizens of north korea literally eat sawdust to keep from starving trump s corruption  however  can be more accurately tracked because there are websites dedicated to chronicling it all  i would hate to see the internet run out of available pages  though  so hopefully we get rid of this guy soon  in fact  he never should have been president in the first place  because like all fascists the kim family  of course  has always been in power in the secretive kingdom  but that doesn t stop them from  electing  their leaders   who run unopposed  of course trump s dark ties to russia  however  may prove to be the end of his presidency  for all the indignity we ve suffered in even allowing donald trump to assume the presidency of the united states  we at least still have a constitution and some semblance of democracy  and we have something north koreans don t  bob muller and a grand jury i m sure you could comment on this with more examples of similarities between the two supreme leaders  in fact  feel free  but bookmark the page for when you get into arguments on the internet   there are a lot of useful links in this article  in fact  forward this thing to your right wing uncle  and tell him to click everything he sees it can t possibly hurt him to know his favorite politician is basically a crazy asian dictator read more featured image via wikimedia commons
