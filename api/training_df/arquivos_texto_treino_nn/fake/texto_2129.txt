rand paul is a self described libertarian  but his idea for how to fix our healthcare system sounds awfully socialist  on the right  paul has been one of the biggest critics of trumpcare  calling it  obamacare lite  what we think is being hidden from conservatives is there s a lot of  obamacare lite  in their bill   the kentucky republican said on cnn s  new day  friday   there s a new entitlement program    there is also a cadillac tax or something similar to the cadillac tax that was in obamacare  and there s also an individual mandate  believe it or not  instead of paying the mandate to the government  they re going to tell you you have to pay the mandate  by law  to an insurance company  paul  speaking at a freedom works rally  had his own proposal  which might as well have been an advertisement for the national rifle association  his suggestion is that people should be able to buy health insurance through the nra here s the video  you see what he did there the truth is  this isn t the worst idea in the world  the nra is a sizable membership organization  but it s far from the biggest  the fact is  large groups people have a lot more clout than individuals  aaa has  million members  as compared to the nra s    the aarp would probably be happy to negotiate with insurance companies and sell policies to their members inadvertently  though  the rabidly anti union  but pro gun  republican  made the case for unions  individuals don t have much if any negotiating power with insurance companies  or really  anyone  still  republicans want to leave individuals on their own  with the imagined idea that somehow  shopping is equivalent to negotiating  it s not  if you have the option to buy from six overpriced plans  you re still paying too much  but hey  you got a choice the third largest membership organization in the world is a union  unfortunately  you have to work for them to get the benefits of their negotiations  but if more people had access to unions  prices would drop across the board but  there is one major problem with paul s idea  most employers  including most union employers  pick up at least part of the monthly tab  that s where the government subsidies that republicans hate would come in  if an organization like aaa or even the nra were to offer health insurance  it would still cost a lot more money than a decent employer plan  at least without some government help sorry  republicans  but unions aren t synonymous with corruption anymore than the corporations that supply the paychecks  but they do give workers a voice  and in the case of goods and services  they give workers negotiating power  all free market republicans should be behind more negotiating power  but the truth is  republicans only want the market to be free for large corporations  all the rest of us should be at their mercy still  even at half bad  it s better than trumpcare featured image via video screen capture
