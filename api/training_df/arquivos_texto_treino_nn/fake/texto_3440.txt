just like with every presidential inauguration year  washington  d c  will become complete chaos during the week of the ceremony  trump supporters  though  might find it a lot more difficult to find places to stay  though  users of airbnb  the housing share site  are pulling their listings because they don t want trumpsters staying in their homes most in the country expected that it would be hillary clinton who would be inaugurated on january   so the town was pretty well booked with democrats  unfortunately  the mostly blue city was slapped with a dose of electoral college reality and those reservations are being cancelled in droves  but the people who were set to make bank by renting out their homes aren t necessarily putting the listings back up  at least not for the inauguration  i have a visceral reaction to the thought of having a trump supporter in my house   said one host  who was planning on renting one of three of her bedrooms to an inauguration guest   no amount of money could make me change my mind  it s about moral principles  another host  identifying herself as  meredith   told the huffington post that she was concerned about what trump supporters would do to her condo  particularly to the  priceless  works of art she d collected on her international travels   we don t trust trump supporters to stay in our place   meredith said though she did note that she didn t mind overcharging  or  gouging   trump loving guests as punishment for their support  if the opportunity presented itself yet another  ellie  said she was  feeling afraid  of  the white men  who might want to rent a bedroom in her home  she noted that she needed the money  however  and would just have to  look past our differences and happily welcome them  source  heat streettrump supporters  naturally  are flipping out  calling the airbnb hosts hypocrites and noting that the left wouldn t put up with the same being done to gay people or people of color  they seriously misunderstand the law  though  yes  it s illegal to discriminate based on race  gender  and in d c   sexual orientation  but political affiliation is not a protected class and it wouldn t matter if it was  airbnb hosts aren t discriminating  they re taking their homes off the market  even democrats who are protesting trump s inauguration wouldn t be able to rent them featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
