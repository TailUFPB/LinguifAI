when donald trump addressed the boy scouts  national jamboree monday night  nobody could possibly have expected the cluster bomb of impropriety he detonated in the middle of a crowd of kids  from regaling the youngsters with tales of  interesting  yacht outings and real estate moguls  to leading them in a chorus of boos at the expense of barack obama  trump essentially used a gathering that usually represents the best of america as a campaign rally with a captive audience that s just how former cia director john mclaughlin saw it  as well trump s boy scout speech had the feel of a third world authoritarian s youth rally   john mclaughlin   jmclaughlinsais  july    an interview with business insider  mclaughlin said the speech  gave  the creeps  it was like watching the late venezuelan  chavez  you want to signal to young people the concept in democracy of loyal opposition  of remaining loyal to government he was attacking his predecessor for no good reason  and his competitor in the last election  he was showing disloyalty to his subordinates ranting on about financial stories in new york from the insider trump basically told the boy scouts  don t respect your opponents  only believe me  and cheer for me   mclaughlin said   what message is this giving to young people  mclaughlin  a republican  was not alone in his assessments  in addition to noted conservative commentator bill kristol  who mclaughlin was responding to on twitter  parents of scouts across the country were outraged  many threatened to pull their kids from the organization  and some even vowed to returned their badges if the bsa didn t issue an apology for trump s behavior at the jamboree  the boy scouts  facebook page was inundated with comments after they posted a half hearted  perspective  on the president s visit   a tepid response that did nothing to address the content or tone of the speech  the power of the presidency is the power to inspire   mclaughlin said there was nothing inspiring about trump s completely inappropriate speech in front of   kids featured image via george frey getty images
