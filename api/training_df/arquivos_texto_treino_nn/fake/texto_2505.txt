if you want to know how trump treats the press  you need only read the white house press pool report from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s visit the pool was then ushed into the oval  potus and benjamin netanyahu sat in two chairs set up in front of the fireplace  flotus sat on the couch to potus s right  sara netanyahu sat on the opposite couch  potus referred to the press as   the nicest people over there  this remark was a clear attempt to soften up the people trump usually demonizes as  fake news  and the  lying media   in fact  the report says trump even went out of his way to compliment  fake news  cnn s sarah murray on a recent story  it was then that murray  undeterred by the donald s effort to win her over with a couple compliments  asked her question and all hell broke loose he called out to cnn s sara murray and complimented a recent story  she asked potus to comment on whether his advisors contacted russian intelligence officer during the campaign   trump did not respond to her question   pool was asked to leave this should have been an easy question for trump  the answer is  yes   calls between key trump staffers have not only been intercepted and made public by our own intelligence agencies and those of our allies who now have to spy on us because trump is likely compromised  michael flynn just resigned because of his discussions of sanctions with the russian ambassador while obama was still president instead  trump said nothing  no admission of wrongdoing  no promise to vet his people better or to actually do his f cking duty to the american people  nothing the terrifying thing is that trump doesn t have to say anything house oversight committee jason chaffetz   that s the guy who led the charge against hillary clinton  has already vowed that he will never satisfy their desire to bring down donald trump   rand paul accidentally admitted that republicans won t back a trump investigation because they re too busy taking healthcare away from our country s most vulnerable  besides  it s not like trump is a democrat  right  i just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation  particularly of your own party   paul says   we ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do  like repealing obamacare  if we re spending our whole time having republicans investigate republicans  i think it makes no sense  think about that  trump wasn t joking when he said he could shoot someone in public and not lose support   and he wasn t just talking about voters  at this point  we can pretty safely assume that our government is compromised to the point that he can literally get away with anything  you either have a country or you don t   a small handed orange man once said a few billion times  call your congressmen  demand they do the right thing and investigate and impeach donald j  trump now  while we still have a country featured image via getty images win mcnamee
