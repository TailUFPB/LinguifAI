donald trump is a complainer  but he really only has himself to blame long before election day in   a lot of books and articles had already been written about trump  but since taking office  news about trump has skyrocketed for some reason  trump has a problem with it fascinating to watch people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me   have zero access   fake news   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    myself have written about trump so many times that i have to take mental health breaks from time to time trump has apparently forgotten that everybody has access to him  not only that  the man is constantly talking about himself   he can t keep his mouth shut  over the years he has appeared on radio and television  and has even repeatedly phoned into fox news trump s twitter feed alone is a rich source that has spawned thousands of articles and  yes  it could fill a book or two it s never ending for him  he is obsessed with being the center of attention and if he s not he will do or say something to become the center attention trump is such a public person that it makes sense that there s enough material out there to fill up books and give journalists and bloggers things to write about on a daily basis trump s other problem is that people who have personal access to him  such as aides and white house staffers  are leaking information  that s how the media has a good idea of what is going on inside the white house it s how we know trump s white house is chaotic make no mistake  trump is whining because he thinks every book and article written about him should be nothing more than propaganda that makes him look good but as long as he keeps acting like a buffoon on twitter  and during public appearances   he can expect the truth to continue to be written whether he likes it or not featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
