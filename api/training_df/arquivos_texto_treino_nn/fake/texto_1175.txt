fox news loves to point the finger at  snowflakes  and anybody they think should buck up and not complain about the way of the world  ironically  they also are the first to freak out over any type of artistic expression that they think puts the president in an unflattering light  a disgusting new york city play depicting the president brutally assassinated   is how fox and friends began a news segment about an nyc shakespeare in the park play they found to be offensive  fox apparently succeeded at stoking conservative outrage because even donald trump jr  seems to have his panties in a bunch over the play i wonder how much of this  art  is funded by taxpayers  serious question  when does  art  become political speech   does that change things  https   t co jfomllbjcn  donald trump jr    donaldjtrumpjr  june    what is this outrageous performance  a play called the tragedy of julius caesar  which was written by william shakespeare all the way back in    way before the donald got his greasy paws on the white house most people are familiar with julius caesar from high school english class  the plot highlights the agony of brutus  caesar s pal who ends up conspiring to murder him  this particular version seems to be confusing fox and friends because of its anachronistic interpretation   the players are dressed in the clothes of today according to fox  they are sure this is a depiction of a trump assassination because the actor looks very similar to the tall  blond businessman elected president in   it s definitely a unique interpretation of the play  but modern updates of shakespearean plays are very common   think  s romeo and juliet on top of that  the play doesn t depict caesar s assassination as a positive event nor the assassins as heroes it s pretty snowflakey for fox to be this pissed about a shakespeare play  grow up feature image via screencapture of fox and friends news segment
