donald trump  despite having a face and hairline made for radio  is convinced that the way to run a government is to hold casting calls  he wants to choose cabinet nominees who look the part  rather than nominees who are qualified  presentation is very important because you re representing america not only on the national stage but also the international stage  depending on the position   said trump transition spokesman jason miller to lead the pentagon  trump chose a rugged combat general  whom he compares to a historic one  at the united nations  his ambassador will be a poised and elegant indian american with a compelling immigrant backstory  as secretary of state  trump tapped a neophyte to international diplomacy  but one whose silvery hair and boardroom bearing project authority source  washington postfor some reason  die hard conservatives are not at all bothered by this method of choosing the people who will be responsible for our health and safety  he likes people who present themselves very well  and he s very impressed when somebody has a background of being good on television because he thinks it s a very important medium for public policy   said chris ruddy  chief executive of newsmax media and a longtime friend of trump   don t forget  he s a showbiz guy  he was at the pinnacle of showbiz  and he thinks about showbiz  he sees this as a business that relates to the public  the look might not necessarily be somebody who should be on the cover of gq magazine or vanity fair   ruddy said   it s more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger  trump allegedly chose marine gen  james mattis as his nominee for secretary of defense because he is  the closest thing to general george patton that we have   that s in reference to a physical resemblance  not his abilities as a general  trump also chose mike pence for his looks and teased that he was going to choose mitt romney for secretary of state for his looks  if our republican congress gave a crap about the people they represent  they would shut down these  central casting  nominees from the start  but this style of hiring fits right in with the republican agenda  which is to take the government down from the inside featured image via ty wright getty images
