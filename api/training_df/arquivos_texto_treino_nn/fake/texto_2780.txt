in what can only be seen as a groundbreaking and unprecedented move  starbucks chairman and ceo howard schultz delivered an open letter to all their partners  employees  regarding donald trump s muslim ban he titled the letter   living our values in uncertain times  and here it is  dear partners i write to you today with deep concern  a heavy heart and a resolute promise  let me begin with the news that is immediately in front of us  we have all been witness to the confusion  surprise and opposition to the executive order that president trump issued on friday  effectively banning people from several predominantly muslim countries from entering the united states  including refugees fleeing wars  i can assure you that our partner resources team has been in direct contact with the partners who are impacted by this immigration ban  and we are doing everything possible to support and help them to navigate through this confusing period we are living in an unprecedented time  one in which we are witness to the conscience of our country  and the promise of the american dream  being called into question  these uncertain times call for different measures and communication tools than we have used in the past  kevin and i are going to accelerate our commitment to communicating with you more frequently  including leveraging new technology platforms moving forward  i am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack  and want to use a faster  more immediate form of communication to engage with you on matters that concern us all as partners i also want to take this opportunity to announce specific actions we are taking to reinforce our belief in our partners around the world and to ensure you are clear that we will neither stand by  nor stand silent  as the uncertainty around the new administration s actions grows with each passing day support for daca  as i wrote to senators graham and durbin this week  we are enthusiastically behind their work to support  dreamers  across our country   including those young men and women who are part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program  there are nearly three quarters of a million hardworking people contributing to our communities and our economy because of this program  at starbucks  we are proud to call them partners and to help them realize their own american dream  we want them to feel welcome and included in our success  which is why we reimburse them for the biennial fee they must pay to stay in the program and why we have offered daca related services at our opportunity youth hiring fairs hiring refugees  we have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world  this is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war  violence  persecution and discrimination  there are more than  million citizens of the world recognized as refugees by the united nations  and we are developing plans to hire   of them over five years in the  countries around the world where starbucks does business  and we will start this effort here in the u s  by making the initial focus of our hiring efforts on those individuals who have served with u s  troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support building bridges  not walls  with mexico  we have been open for business in mexico since   and have since opened almost  stores in  cities across the country  which together employ over   mexican partners who proudly wear the green apron  we have sourced coffee from mexico s producers and their families for three decades and last fall  we also announced the creation of a farmer support center in chiapas to help accelerate our collective ability to grow and export some of the world s finest coffees from this important growing region  while donating more than   million to support the livelihood  food security and water quality of coffee producing communities in oaxaca  with the support of thousands of starbucks partners and millions of customers  we have also donated over a million coffee trees to support   families  and we will be expanding the initiative this year to generate another  million tree donations  coffee is what unites our common heritage  and as i told alberto torrado  the leader of our partnership with alsea in mexico  we stand ready to help and support our mexican customers  partners and their families as they navigate what impact proposed trade sanctions  immigration restrictions and taxes might have on their business and their trust of americans  but we will continue to invest in this critically important market all the same our healthcare commitment to you  finally  let me restate what we have recently communicated with you about the affordable care act   our commitment remains that if you are benefits eligible  you will always have access to health insurance through starbucks  many of you have expressed concerns that recent government actions may jeopardize your ability to participate in the affordable care act  if the recent executive order related to health care remains in place and the affordable care act is repealed causing you to lose your healthcare coverage  you will always have the ability to return and can do so within  days of losing that coverage rather than having to wait for an open enrollment period  if you have any questions or concerns  please contact the benefits center at    in the face of recent events around the world  let me assure you that we will stay true to our values and do everything we can possibly do to support and invest in every partner s well being while taking the actions that are squarely within our ability to control  this is our focus  providing a third place of respite for those around the world who seek it  daily starbucks has and will always stand for opportunity   opportunity for our young people who are working to land their first job in the  countries where we do business  opportunity for our farmers who care so deeply for the highest of quality coffee we offer to customers all around the globe  and yes  opportunity for those who come to america in search of their own fresh start   whether that is with starbucks directly  or through our suppliers or our partner companies if there is any lesson to be learned over the last year  it s that your voice and your vote matter more than ever  we are all obligated to ensure our elected officials hear from us individually and collectively  starbucks is doing its part  we need you to use the collective power of your voices to do the same while respecting the diverse viewpoints of the  million customers who visit our stores in more than   locations around the world so  while we seek to understand what the new administration s policies mean for us and our business both domestically and around the world  i can assure you that we will do whatever it takes to support you  our partners  to realize your own dreams and achieve your own opportunities  we are in business to inspire and nurture the human spirit  one person  one cup and one neighborhood at a time   whether that neighborhood is in a red state or a blue state  a christian country or a muslim country  a divided nation or a united nation  that will not change  you have my word on that onward howard well said  mr  schultz  and you are a better american for all that was said  your dedication to what truly makes america the land of the free and the home of the brave will forever be noticed featured photo by christopher furlong getty images
