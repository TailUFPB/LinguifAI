if republicans listen to this sage advice  donald trump would be a lame duck president before completing his first  days in stunning testimony to congress on monday  fbi director james comey confirmed that donald trump lied when he accused president obama of wiretapping him for more than two weeks  trump has been desperately trying to make his accusations against president obama stick  but has repeatedly failed to provide evidence to support his claims that culminated in comey s testimony under oath in which it was revealed that trump is full of shit and he is being investigated for colluding with russia during the  election apparently  the investigation has been ongoing for months  which means trump s russia scandal just got a whole lot worse  especially for republicans who continue to defend him comey s testimony was aired on national television and was seen by millions of americans at a time when trump s poll numbers are in the toilet  one would think that republicans would abandon his sinking ship before they drown with him  but so far  republicans are stubbornly standing by him because they don t want to lose their rubber stamp in the white house joe scarborough and mika brzezinski  however  are urging republicans to run away from trump or face serious consequences in  when the midterm elections roll around and give americans their first chance to tell trump and his republican allies to go f ck themselves  republicans have to understand right now  if this continues  and this is awfully early to say this  but if this continues  at least in the house  and there were a lot of senate seats  they are going to be shocked on election night if they don t take care of themselves   scarborough predicted  if the republican party doesn t start taking care of itself and stop making fools of themselves for a guy who is going to keep tweeting lies and nonsense   they can t chase that around   scarborough continued   they can t defend the indefensible  here s the video via youtube  if republicans continue to pretend that trump is not a threat to our nation there will be hell to pay  millions of trump voters are experiencing buyer s remorse right now and millions of voters who sat out in  are itching to make up for that mistake in  and   but regardless of what republicans in the house and senate do  they should be ousted from office anyway  they had a chance to prevent trump from ever becoming president and put their greed and lust for power above the security and well being of the nation  they betrayed the united states by turning a blind eye to trump s associations with russia and vladimir putin and they continue to betray our country now  republicans should abandon trump to save their souls  not their jobs featured image screenshot
