despite having to deal with an absolute imbecile as her challenger for several months  hillary clinton was always poised  gracious and respectful during the election   and that hasn t changed  even after an undeserving donald trump won however  clinton hasn t forgotten that she was actually the candidate that the american people truly wanted  in her final  message to her supporters  the former secretary of state made sure to note the fact that she d won the popular vote by almost  million more than trump  of course  clinton s supporters know very well how badly she beat him  but the president elect and his followers are still in a disturbing amount of denial   so it s useful to remind them of the facts once in a while  true to form  clinton did this in a subtle  classy manner in her thank you note to her supporters  clinton wrote  before this year ends  i want to thank you again for your support of our campaign  while we didn t achieve the outcome we sought  i m proud of the vision and values we fought for and the nearly  million people who voted for them  sixty six million   a number that trump certainly cannot claim  as he just scraped by winning the election purely because of the electoral college votes  knowing that she still has a responsibility to be an example and to fight for the american people  clinton rallied her supporters to continue being  stronger together   she wrote  i believe it is our responsibility to keep doing our part to build a better  stronger  and fairer future for our country and the world  the holidays are a time to be thankful for our blessings  so let us rejoice in this season and look forward with renewed hope and determination  clinton closed her message by wishing her supporters a great new year  suggesting that this would hardly be the last time they hear from her  she made it clear that she s going to continue working on america s behalf because that s real presidents do  and that s what she s always done through her decades of service to this country  i wish you and your family health  happiness  and continued strength for the new year and the work ahead  i look forward to staying in touch in   onward  featured image via drew angerer  getty images
