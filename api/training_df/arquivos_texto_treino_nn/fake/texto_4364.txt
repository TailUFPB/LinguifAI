when conservatives refer to black people as  slaves  it totally undermines what little effort they put into trying to get their votes but a conservative writer did exactly that in a racist article published by mediaite on tuesday in an attack on lebron james and mary j  blige for endorsing hillary clinton in the opinion piece titled  lebron james  mary j  blige tell blacks to remain slaves to hillary  vote their color not their conscience   author crystal wright referenced slavery and compared blacks to livestock right out of the gate in support of donald trump  slavery ended in    wright began   yet blacks still act like the political chattel of the democrat  party  each election cycle blacks allow the democrat party and its proxies to tell them how to vote  and they follow orders like loyal slaves  the  election is turning out to be no different  wright then goes on to whine about lebron james s recent endorsement of hillary clinton  when i look at this year s presidential race  it s clear which candidate believes the same thing   james said   only one person running truly understands the struggles of an akron child born into poverty  and when i think about the kinds of policies and ideas the kids in my foundation need from our government  the choice is clear  that choice is hillary clinton  how does hillary understand the struggle of a black kid born into poverty  as james wrote  when she s spent her entire  year career as a politician doing nothing to fix the problem   wright responded let s start by pointing out that hillary clinton has been a lifelong advocate for ending poverty  something the clinton administration actually made significant progress in achieving during the  in    percent of black families lived in poverty  but during the clinton years when the economy boomed  that percentage was cut to only  percent  which is the lowest it has been in the last  years similarly  poverty stricken black families headed by single women also dropped to all time lows during the clinton years  from  percent in  to  percent in  by the time the clintons left the white house  more african american had been lifted out of poverty than during any other presidency  but those gains were soon reversed after republicans took over in january  in short  why should black voters risk things getting even worse under trump when they can put a woman in the white house who was there when things were getting better but wright wasn t done insulting black voters  of course  we know lebron s op ed is directed only to blacks   she continued   because white people don t look to professional athletes for voting instructions  white americans are not a monolithic voting group  which is why their vote influences policy  lebron james did not instruct black people to vote for clinton  he asked them along with everyone else  that s because james has white fans  hispanic fans  and female fans  too  just because he is black doesn t mean he only has black fans  assuming otherwise is blatantly racist  also  assuming that white people are not influenced by athletes is just ridiculous wright then concludes by telling black people to vote for trump as for hillary  she is no more viable a candidate for blacks than she is for women  the only life that matters to hillary is her own  and a career long obsession with winning the office she s coveted for a lifetime yet celebrities like lebron james want blacks to feel good voting for their color over their conscience  what do blacks have to lose voting for trump  absolutely nothing actually  black people have everything to lose if trump wins when the conservative controlled supreme court struck down a key portion of the voting rights act  it was a signal that republicans intend to tear down landmark legislation that protects the constitutional rights of african americans  republicans  including trump  have also called for repealing the  amendment  which overturned the dred scott ruling that americans descended from african slaves can t be united states citizens furthermore  republicans have enacted voter suppression laws in several states  which primarily targets black people also  trump s track record with black people is pretty shitty  for one  he s only just now beginning to reach out to them  but that s only because his poll numbers suck and he is desperate  but he called for the death penalty for the central park five  who spent years in prison for a rape they did not commit  and trump was sued in the  for refusing to rent to black people  plus  unlike the clintons  trump has no record to offer as reasons why black people should vote for him  hillary clinton does clinton is still a champion for reducing poverty and caring for children and families  and her husband s economic policies helped lift millions of blacks out of poverty  wright talks about black voters as if they are mindless drones on some kind of modern plantation  but the fact is that democrats have fought for equality and civil rights for decades while republicans have done nothing but stand in the way or try to roll back the progress made  while democrats have worked hard to earn the support of black voters  republicans turned their backs on them a long time ago and have done nothing over the last century to earn back their support  donald trump will not change that  especially when his biggest supporters are white supremacists calling black people slaves just because they support a certain party is reprehensible and it s a reason why black voters reject conservatives  but you can be certain that trump s kkk buddies are absolutely thrilled about wright s words  after all  they really do want black people to be slaves featured image  joe raedle getty
