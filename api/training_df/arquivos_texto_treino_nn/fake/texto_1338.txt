in a recent interview with cnn  former senator and republican presidential candidate rick santorum hinted that president trump s time so far in office would be more successful and that he still has the ability to become a better leader if he makes one simple change   just stop tweeting during sunday morning s edition of state of the union with dana bash  santorum made his point clear in absolutely no uncertain terms   if you tweet every day and complain about the media and complain about how you are being treated  you re going to be sidetracked and you re not going to get your deals done  that s the message   santorum said  almost trying to channel the president directly by staring straight into the camera and using terms that trump could relate to in order to get his advice across donald trump has just concluded his first ever overseas trip as president of the united states  a nine day journey into the middle east  and during that time he had been using social media a lot less  staying more focused on the task at hand  however  almost immediately upon his return to the white house  the president took to twitter to voice his displeasure at a number of topics  but mainly on opinions that differ to his own in what has become his latest catchphrase  the  fake news  british prime minister may was very angry that the info the u k  gave to u s  about manchester was leaked  gave me full details   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    anyone notice how the montana congressional race was such a big deal to dems   fake news until the republican won  v was poorly covered  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may     it is very possible that those sources don t exist but are made up by fake news writers   fakenews is the enemy   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    you see the words  sources say  in the fake news media  and they don t mention names    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the white house are fabricated lies made up by the  fakenews media   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    seems more than a little ironic that a president who ran an entire campaign based on information gathered from unnamed sources would be so against their use when others do likewise and rick santorum agreed  stating that focusing on these petty grudges is what is preventing trump from concentrating completely on his duties as president  the last nine days have hopefully shown the president that if you stay on message  you stick to the script  you focus on policy  you drive home the messages that you talked about during the campaign and that people in america are excited about  you can be a great president   santorum said  the fact is that this administration should be doing so well  and could be doing so well  if they just focused on getting their agenda passed  not one to take criticism  constructive or otherwise  in his stride  president trump decided to air his dissatisfaction at santorum s claims in the only way he knows   by taking to twitter the fake news media works hard at disparaging   demeaning my use of social media because they don t want america to hear the real story   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    image via christopher furlong getty images
