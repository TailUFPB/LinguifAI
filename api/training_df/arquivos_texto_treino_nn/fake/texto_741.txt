according to lawyers for donald trump  it was completely fine for the now president to have encouraged supporters to use  reasonable force  to remove disruptive protestors from his campaign rallies last year  as he was just exercising his right to freedom of speech by doing so the claim came during an emergency motion asking the us appeals court to throw out a lawsuit filed by three people who believe they were manhandled at a trump rally that took place during march last year in louisville  ky  fortunately for the two women and one man  u s  district judge david hale refused to dismiss the case  stating that the plaintiffs  lawsuit  described a chaotic and violent scene in which a crowd of people turned on three individuals   with the plaintiffs being punched  kicked and verbally abused  according to trumps lawyers  one of the plaintiffs  an african american woman  had held up a  sign depicting trump s face on the body of pig  trump kept saying   get them out  get them out   and people in the crowd began pushing and shoving the protesters   said alvin bamberger  one of the audience members at the rally who was cited in the lawsuit and the one whom the plaintiffs described as the  most aggressive   the president s lawyers felt the need to add that  in trump s defence  he did say at the time   don t hurt  em  if i say   go get  em   i get in trouble with the press  the most dishonest human beings in the world  the plaintiffs are attempting to sue trump and his campaign  but the real question here is whether trump should be deemed responsible for having incited  or at the very least  provoked the violence in the first place  the three people beaten and abused at the louisville rally do  hence the reason why they re seeking damages from the president for what they believe was a reckless incitement of violence president trump s lawyers claim in their latest motion that protesters who  initially purchased tickets and entered the rally in a peaceful manner  can also be forcibly removed if they become disruptive  it also makes no difference whether the crowd reacted with unlawful violence beyond what mr  trump advocated  because the hostile reaction of the crowd does not not transform protected speech into incitement   the lawyers added in their statement judge hale believes the plaintiffs  complaint is more than enough to proceed toward a trial  writing in his march  order it is plausible that trump s directive to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force   is stated in the imperative  it was an order  an instruction  a command  trump s lawyers  however  believe that  not only is that a reasonable order for trump to give  it is also his right  without this court s intervention  this litigation will inflict irreparable harm on the trump defendants by subjecting them to punitive litigation as the price of exercising their core first amendment rights   washington attorney michael carvin said wrote  mr  trump had a first amendment right to call for the removal of disruptive protesters from his campaign rally  and it is a bedrock principle of law that the right to exclude another   includes the right to use reasonable force  furthermore  trump s lawyers filed a  writ of mandamus  with the u s   circuit court this week  asking the appeals court to remove the case from hale  their argument was that trump cannot be held liable for  negligently inspiring third parties to engage in violence  featured image via justin merriman getty images
