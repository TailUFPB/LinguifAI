reince priebus  the soon to be ex chairman of the rnc and trump s new chief of staff  went on television to justify one of trump s biggest lies since getting elected  last week  trump alleged that millions had voted illegally in the presidential election after he heard that jill stein was seeking recounts in three states  that s a serious claim to make and he made it without basis whatsoever  priebus  though  apparently doesn t care that s a lie  and went on national television to hold it up as some kind of bizarre example cbs   face the nation  host  john dickerson  asked priebus about that claim and even pointed out that there s no evidence that millions voted illegally  priebus played all innocent in his support of trump at first  well i don t know if that s not true  john  i mean  there was an article in the wall street journal the other day and it had a certain percentage of people voting that shouldn t be voting  there are estimates all over the map on that  and here s the problem   no one really knows  but dickerson wasn t done  he also asked this   when you re president  can you just offer a theory that has no evidence behind it  or does he have to tighten up his standards of proof  he should have to tighten up his standards of proof  but priebus may well be afraid he ll lose his new job as one of trump s lap dogs if he criticizes him at all  so here s priebus vigorously defending trump s lies  i think he s done a great job  i think the president elect is someone who has pushed the envelope and caused people to think in this country  he s not taking conventional thought   on every single issue and has caused people to look at things that maybe they have taken for granted  so basically  it s okay for trump to lie or say things no president should say because it starts national conversations  it s okay for us to have a president who lies because it  makes people think  in ways they might not otherwise way to go  america  watch priebus  full segment below featured image via screen capture from embedded video
