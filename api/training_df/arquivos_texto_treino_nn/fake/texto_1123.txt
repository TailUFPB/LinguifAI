according to a gallup poll released on thursday  republican satisfaction with the direction in which the usa is heading took its biggest hit between the months of may and june in the time since donald trump took office  dropping a massive  points while satisfaction among democrats and independents also fell during the same time period  one and three points  respectively  the level of satisfaction among republicans plummeted from   in may to only   in june  to add insult to injury  these latest numbers bring the overall satisfaction rating among americans to a paltry    the lowest since july    which came on the heels of a spree of killings of african american men at the hands of police officers and then a spate of shootings of law enforcement officers  pushing the country to the brink  that s a pretty tough act to follow the latest drop in trump s satisfaction rating comes amid a slew of controversies in the last several weeks  especially his decision to abruptly fire fbi director james comey  the man who just so happened to be responsible for handling the investigation into russian interference in last year s presidential election  the fact that it was revealed that trump may have also divulged highly classified information to the russians only compounded the problem what comey had to say under oath at his senate inquiry last week didn t help matters for the president much  either  such as the revelation that trump had not only asked comey in february to drop the fbi investigation into former national security advisor michael flynn  but also asked for comey s  loyalty   fortunately for all of the united states of america  comey instead promised his honesty if president trump can take any satisfaction from any of this  it is the fact that the previous six us presidents also suffered dwindling satisfaction ratings of their time in office  perhaps not to this extent within the first five months  but it did happen eventually featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
