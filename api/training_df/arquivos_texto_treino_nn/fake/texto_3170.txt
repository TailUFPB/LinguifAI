the situation that  year old ahmed khalifa saw was disgusting  he was on board a brooklyn subway train  listening to his headphones like many teens do  when he looked up and saw a man deck a woman who s an orthodox jew  she was just reading a book on the train  and he went up and slapped her so hard that he shattered her glasses and knocked her unconscious  khalifa says he could almost feel it  it was a very hard slap  i almost could feel the slap  he was  foot   and a very big  big guy  he could have decided not to get involved  after all  he s muslim and she s jewish  and we all know muslims are evil jihadists who especially hate jewish people  he s a teenaged boy and the woman s attacker was huge  he could have stuck his head back in his headphones and minded his own business except he decided that catching the guy was his business  so  as rayvon jones ran  khalifa held the train s doors open and yelled to the conductor to stay at the station and call for help and then he took off after jones  while also calling the cops  khalifa later said  on camera  i felt bad for her because she was innocent  like innocent  she did nothing wrong  he did lose jones briefly  but another orthodox jew asked him what happened  and then offered to help khalifa find jones  when they found jones at a bus stop  they called what s known as the shomrim  or the jewish safety patrol  jones climbed on a bus and pulled his hoodie over his head  prompting khalifa to shout  get out you coward  why are you trying to hide  when the police got there and pulled jones off the bus  he got aggressive and kept screaming he was going to kill everyone  he was taken into custody and charged with assault  and one of the shomrim drivers took khalifa home  the woman was taken to the hospital in stable condition khalifa sees everyone as people  people asked him why he would help a jewish woman when he s muslim  and it s his nature to treat everyone the same way  obviously  when someone needs help  he helps  regardless of who it is   us vs  them  doesn t seem to have touched him the way it s touched so many others  people  especially fearful  bigoted conservatives  could learn a lesson or two from this teenager khalifa  while he doesn t see himself as a hero  is a hero  watch a video of jones  capture and an interview with khalifa below  featured image via video screen capture
