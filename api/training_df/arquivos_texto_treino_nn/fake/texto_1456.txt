it seems only natural that donald trump  the lowest rated president in modern history  should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much americans refuse to support him aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban  there s another policy that americans overwhelmingly despise   the american health care act  also known as trumpcare  while it s been widely known that americans prefer obamacare  the affordable care act  much more than trump s shady  disastrous alternative  the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought  it turns out  one poll states that over   of americans don t want trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones this recent poll cited that the american public s support for trumpcare is only    which basically means that trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of obamacare  almost half     of americans stated that they were against trumpcare  with most     responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it so while trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing  we have yet to see it reflect in the american public s opinion of him and his policies  people are passionately resisting trumpcare  and have even taken to gop town halls to openly protest against and condemn gop lawmakers who are trying to help trump take out obamacare trump may not want to admit it  but he s dying in the polls  it s also been reported that only   of americans felt trump was right to fire fbi director james comey  and   of the public wanted the russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission the more trump tries  the more he fails  as time goes on  we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country featured image is a screenshot
