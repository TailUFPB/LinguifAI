this is totally unpresidential behavior throughout the campaign  donald trump repeatedly attacked senator elizabeth warren by calling her  pocahontas  just because warren has native american ancestry warren fired back on multiple occasions and often destroyed trump to the point where he stopped attacking her trump s nasty attacks on warren were outrageous during the campaign  and they are even more outrageous now that he occupies the white house as the so called  president of the united states  during a meeting with republican and democratic senators on thursday  trump brought up warren s effort to read a letter by coretta scott king to the senate in which king condemned jeff sessions  racism and voiced her opposition to his nomination for a federal judgeship back in  as warren tried to read the letter  mitch mcconnell silenced her and republicans voted to basically censure her because they claim the letter impugned sessions   character   you know  because calling out a racist has somehow become a bad thing in our society politico reports according to participants in thursday s meeting  trump referred to warren several times as  pocahontas   the moniker he gave her during his campaign  and told the democrats he was glad warren is becoming the face of  your party  seriously  trump actually referred to a sitting united states senator as  pocahontas   which at this point should be considered a racial slur the way he is using it  republicans apparently had no problem with trump s disgraceful attack on warren trump is no longer a bombastic political candidate trying to get attention  he is the f cking president now and this kind of behavior is embarrassing and stains the dignity of the office make no mistake  donald trump not only owes warren and the democratic party an apology  he owes america an apology this kind of behavior is intolerable and he should be ashamed of himself featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
