doesn t corporate america get enough breaks at the expense of the everyday american  apparently not  because they re working on a bill that would limit the ability of the american consumer to sue  even in cases of gross negligence and flat out illegal acts  already it s difficult to sue due to all the legal fine print that corporations use specifically to make it harder to sue  and now republicans want to expand and cement corporations immunity from responsibility of course  they gave it a name intended to deceive us into believing they re making things more fair for everyone  leveling the playing field  things like that  it s called the  fairness in class action litigation act of    it s anything but fair   it tips the balance of lawsuits so far towards corporations that it s obscene class action lawsuits  are often the only avenue for americans to hold corporations accountable if they are victims of widespread illegal behavior   in other words  victims of fraud and scams  unsafe products and workplaces  and of human and civil rights violations  would have little to no recourse  according to a detailed analysis from elizabeth burch from the university of georgia s school of law other egregious behavior companies could get away with include price fixing  gender discrimination  securities fraud could go unchecked  deceptive or even false advertising could likewise go unchecked  and so much more sure  there are laws in place that prohibit all of that  but holding companies truly responsible for the harm that their lawlessness causes involves hurting their bottom line  do republicans plan to put inspectors in every corporation there is  just to ensure that they all follow the law  class action suits really are our only method of holding a corporation s feet to the fire when they break the law should this bill pass  it s anything but  america first   and as such  it s a major kick in the face to regular consumers  republicans are disgusting featured image by mark wilson via getty images
