another racist just found out the hard way that racism will result in unemployment pamela taylor thought she could get away with insulting first lady michelle obama without consequences last month  she posted a racist comparison of melania trump and michelle obama on facebook that drew national and local outrage  it will be refreshing to have a classy  beautiful  dignified first lady in the white house   taylor wrote   i m tired of seeing an ape in heels  taylor worked at the clay county development corporation  a non profit taxpayer funded organization that works with the state and local government  including mayor beverly whaling  who replied to taylor post by telling her it  made my day  comparing black people to apes  monkeys  or gorillas has been considered a racial slur for decades whaling remained silent in the wake of being caught supporting taylor s racism  taylor  on the other hand  claimed that criticizing her for being a racist is a  hate crime   which did not improve her situation in the slightest in fact  she was suspended from her job and whaling resigned in disgrace and then she was reinstated to the disbelief of many who thought that taylor would rightfully be terminated since it s clear she can t do her job fairly because of her hatred of black people but justice soon prevailed as governor earl ray tomblin s office released a statement announcing that taylor  was removed after the state reached an agreement with the nonprofit s board of directors  and so  pamela taylor no longer has a job  thus creating a job opening for someone who has stronger character and human decency when will racists learn that what they say and write can be read by their employers  more recently  a firefighter in michigan was fired for calling a black woman the n word on facebook after the remark was brought to the attention to the fire chief clearly  it is time for racists to slither back to the fringes of society where they belong  some will undoubtedly whine that their freedom of speech is being attacked  but freedom of speech doesn t mean you can t be fired for saying something stupid  especially when what you say alienates and angers potential customers or opens your organization up to accusations of discrimination so racists  beware  people on social media can see what you write  and if they can see it  your boss will end up seeing it  too featured image  chip somodevilla getty images
