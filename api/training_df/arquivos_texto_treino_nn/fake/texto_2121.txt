the republican bill meant to dismantle the affordable care act has been hit on all sides as nonsensical  dysfunctional and sinister  the plan  which appears to be scrapped together with little thought to the consequences  has been shown by the congressional budget office as well as many outside reviewers an excellent way to cost tens of millions of people their health insurance while also not saving very much money for anyone but the wealthy and critics of the bill now have a perfect soundbite  from president trump himself in an astonishing interview with fox s tucker carlson  trump casually admits that the plan put forth by paul ryan and endorsed by his administration will make millions lose insurance  even more incredible  trump acknowledges that the deepest harm will be felt in poor  red states   states that overwhelming voted for him  only a man who inherited millions  never worked a day in his life  and lives in a literal gold tower could be so nonchalant about essentially admitting that his plan will destroy access to healthcare to the american public carlson  who to his credit presses trump on how damaging this healthcare replacement bill is  points out that the  centerpiece  of the bill is a tax cut the ultra rich  on the flipside  the bill disproportionately harms poor people  a bloomberg analysis showed that counties that voted for you   middle class and working class counties   would do far less well under this bill  trump s response   oh  i know that  i know  yikes trump later tried to salvage the admission by saying that while this bill clearly screws over his own voters  there will be other   so far nonexistent   additions that will magically help those affected  he never bothers to explain how exactly this would happen  no proposal has even been suggested that addresses these issues  like a chef admitting he poisoned the food but who still expects his customers to eat up because he may have some pepto bismol lying around somewhere  only the food poisoning will kill you and the chef is a known liar and the pepto bismol is more tax cuts for the rich featured image via fox news
