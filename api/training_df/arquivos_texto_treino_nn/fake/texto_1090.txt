a horrifying incident took place in the early hours of monday morning in finsbury park in london a van plowed into a group of muslim worshipers as they were leaving prayers at a pair of north london mosques yep   you read that right  a terrorist attack has happened in london against muslims  this incident follows two recent terrorist attacks in london in which vehicles have been used as weapons  both on bridges over the thames river  so far this attack has left one person is dead and  others injured  this is being treated as a terrorist attack   said metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner neil basu told reporters  he added that the driver of the van was arrested on suspicion of murder according to the washington post  witnesses said the driver of the vehicle was heard shouting that he wanted to kill muslims thankfully  the driver didn t get away  the washington post reports that abdulrahman aidroos and his friends were attending to an elderly man who had collapsed on the ground when suddenly he saw a man in a van driving  straight into us  when the driver of the van jumped out of the vehicle and tried to run  i tackled him on the floor until the police came   aidroos told the bbc   when he was running  he said  i want to kill more people  i want to kill more muslims  it s absolutely appalling and to think another human being has done this though it s clear there s something wrong with this attacker  we need to stop fear mongering when it comes to muslims  the worst has now happened as a result muslims are entirely separate from isis just like the kkk is separate from the christian church  just like nazism is entirely separate from germans  there are bad people   evil people   in the world  but attacking innocent people won t stop the problem or rid the world of evil  it just hurts innocent people and their loved ones we need to stop being so divided and scapegoating other people  that won t solve any problems   it ll just create new ones featured image by carl court getty images
