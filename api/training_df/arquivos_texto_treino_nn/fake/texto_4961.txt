republican presidential candidate donald trump decided to reach out to black voters by traveling to an almost all white town to tell african americans that they are uneducated  jobless and poor  donald used inaccurate statistics  too  that was his minority outreach effort to black voters on sunday morning  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway attempted to defend the donald s remarks mediaite reports that host george stephanopoulos of abc s this week told conway that many people found trump s comments offensive  but many in the african american community saw that as insulting because they say most african americans don t live in poverty and that mr  trump was making those comments in communities that are more than  percent white   stephanopoulos remarked but conway explained that she lives in a white community and said she was very  moved  by the remarks  those comments are for all americans  and i live in a white community  i m white  i was very moved by his comment   she said   in other words  he is trying to tell americans that we can do better  and the thing that he said that i think got a great deal of resonance is that maybe hillary clinton looks at you as voters as your   takes you for granted  i look at you as people  once again  we see that others within the trump camp have to clarify their candidate s controversial remarks  we re going to need a donald translator if this babbling man baby gets the keys to the white house  and you   again  george  if you think  percent of unemployment in the african american youth community is a good idea   she continued  adding   then absolutely please go vote for hillary clinton  everyone  she actually repeated the false statistics that donald used that have already been debunked  in order to arrive at   percent  one would have to add in all black youth who are currently enrolled in high school and college  but that s not racist at all  mkay  but he s saying  you can t do any worse   she concluded watch there s nothing like a white person explaining to black people how they should live   and by using false statitisitics  in   donald tweeted   president obama has absolutely no control  or respect  over the african american community   they have fared so poorly under his presidency  we re sure ms  conway doesn t find that offensive either a  year old white man feels that african americans should be  controlled  and that s the same white supremacist thinking that also supports his candidacy  imagine that  what a coincidence in june  trump was found to have garnered a whopping one percent among african american voters  it s only surprising that he has any support at all featured image via screen capture
