a few days before thanksgiving  a food bank in central texas received a letter that was so hateful it could only have been written by a trump supporter dear foodbank i don t understand who these poor folks are that need food  i assume they consist primarily of illegals  who come to texas for  free stuff   and of course  our unemployed africans  who find work too much trouble  especially when they can collect the equivalent of    a year on welfare  and other  benefits  offered to the unfit  the lazy  and the under educated and of course  the drug addicts i expect that most who need food are marching around whining that the congenital liar  hillary rodham clinton  lost the election  too bad  how sad i also wonder if your organization is not one of those phoney baloney  so called  charities   designed primarily to provide a good living to its organizers in sort  no way signed citizen robespierrenaturally  the food bank was mortified  the lack of empathy was disturbing   says paul gaither  marketing and communications director for the food bank   most of the letters we receive say things like  we don t have anything to contribute  or  please take me off your list   but this one was a little different  it s important that we don t categorize the people we serve as  takers  gaither said   most of the people we serve have fallen on hard times or are the working poor who just can t make ends meet  and that can happen to anyone  source  givingcityaustinbefore i tackle how this proves we need food stamps  let s talk about the misconceptions in the surprisingly literate letter  first off  food should never be treated as a luxury  you can absolutely not call yourself pro life while at the same time advocating that people should starve  of the  million people who are fed every year by food banks   million of them are children and  million are seniors as for undocumented immigrants  well  they aren t crossing the border to eat at food banks  they are crossing the border  for the most part  to work and that s what they do  collectively  undocumented immigrants contribute almost   billion each year to our country because they pay taxes and get nothing in return  we should be thanking them instead of sending hateful notes about them it s not just unemployed people who need food banks  so do people who work minimum wage jobs  texas happens to be among the states with the very lowest wages  only alabama  arkansas  tennessee and mississippi have lower wages  in other words  in states like texas  laziness has nothing to do with the ability to put food on the table now  back to the food stamps argument  one republican argument has always been that if the government stops offering a social safety net  private charities will pick up the slack  while that sounds like a beautiful idea  sort of   it s simply not true  people s ability to eat should not depend on the whims of people  nor should it depend on the economy or whether a charity can effectively market itself  we tried that in the past  it didn t work instead  that time in history proved that privately funded charities can be both bigoted and very selective in who they cover  if you can imagine the writer of this letter  for example  giving to any charity  do you honestly think  s he d give to a charity that serviced minority areas  no  that s where government comes in  making sure americans have enough food is our moral prerogative  relying on bigots like citizen robespierre should be out of the question  no matter who is hungry as for the central texas food bank  well  they are a damn good charity  they score  out of  on charity navigator  the vast majority of the people they serve are not homeless    of the recipients are white featured image via state farm flickr
