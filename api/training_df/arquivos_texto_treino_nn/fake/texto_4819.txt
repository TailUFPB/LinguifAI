if you want to watch trump s campaign manager crash and burn  this is the interview you ll want to see kellyanne conway may be a new name and face to most americans  but she has been peddling lies on behalf of republican candidates for years now  she also been getting called out for it  too in   conway attempted to defend todd akin of  legitimate rape  infamy on cnn during an interview with anderson cooper during the interview when it came time for conway to explain akin s outrageous blunder  she tried to change the subject by spouting off a big abortion lie that sex selective abortions are rampant in this country  you ve got all these little baby girls being killed just because they re girls in this country   she said before citing guttmacher institute as her source a shocked cooper informed conway that there s really no evidence that sex selective abortions are occurring in the united states  but statistically  there s not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the united states  amongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant  conway insisted that she is correct and told cooper to check her source here s the video of conway s lie via youtube and that s exactly what cooper did during the commercial break and when the show resumed he took a moment to thoroughly humiliate conway with the facts  before the break  kellyanne  you mentioned the guttmacher institute information on sex selective abortion in the united states  here s what they actually say in a may  press release titled  sex selective abortion bans  a disingenuous new strategy to limit women s access to abortion  the study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas  as we mentioned  and perhaps in certain asian american communities in the united states in small numbers   copper continued   but  quote   in the united states  meanwhile  there is limited data indicating that sex selective abortion may be occurring in some asian communities  although the u s  sex ratio at   males for every female is squarely within biologically normal parameters   so i just wanted to put that out there  here s the video of cooper smacking conway down via cnn in short  kellyanne conway got totally owned on the air for lying about abortion statistics clearly  when donald trump was searching for a new campaign manager he was looking for someone is lies and is allergic to facts like himself featured image via spencer platt getty images
