the daily show needs to go after fox news more often because jon stewart would definitely be proud of this earlier this week  bill o reilly sent his goon  jesse watters to chinatown in new york city to make fun of asians using every stereotype in the book  watters asked the residents  some of whom couldn t speak english  everything from if they know karate to if they can take care of north korea for us asian american organizations were not amused and swiftly condemned fox for the segment and demanded an apology but nobody ripped fox news a new one better than daily show correspondent ronny chieng  first of all  let me get this straight   they say china in the debate so you go to chinatown  in new york   chieng frustratingly asked   so  when they mention mexico  do you send someone to taco bell  chinatown is nothing like china  they have nothing to do with each other  it s like if i want to talk about women s rights  i decide to go to fox news to get opinions  but it was nothing compared to the idiocy that followed   chieng continued after showing some of the footage fox put together  which included watters asking if he should bow and if it s the year of the dragon  chieng went off on him  no  it s actually the year of go f ck yourself   chien yelled before taking watters to the woodshed for all the racist stereotypes he used for the segment  if you re going to with racist  at least get your stereotypes right  you ignorant sack of sh t  karate isn t chinese it s japanese and you re doing it in a tae kwon do studio which is korean  you f cking jackoff  jackoff  jackoff  f ck this guy  and  seriously  mr  miyagi  update your reference material  that s like me making fun of americans for  saturday night fever  and mr  t  but that s wasn t the end  watters also got his ass handed to him for trying to talk to residents who didn t understand english  a shole  they don t speak english  that s why they re silent   chieng said   it s easy to make fun of someone when they can t respond  i ll show you  chieng threw an image of watters on the screen and began asking him questions and each question was epic  hey  douchebag  why do you look like a guy who carries around a pack of roofies just in case  why do you look like you have a hooker on speed dial  and is it hard to fit bill o reilly s entire scrotum in your mouth  and in the final take down of watters and o reilly  chieng spoke with chinese americans himself about the segment  asking one about jesse watters  this is how he replied  the chickensh t reporter who came here and thought he was funny because he talked to people who couldn t speak english  the one who was sent here by the larger chickensh t who wouldn t come into chinatown because he was afraid to do it himself  the one with no testicles  who came down here  who said  let me talk to some old people and let me put them on camera without asking them and sort of put them on national television and made fun of them in the worst possible way  as i said before  epic here s the video via the daily show the daily show has largely chose not to go after fox news very much since jon stewart left  and that has been an absolute shame  so you know fox news did something incredibly outrageous when the daily show really has no choice but to cover it and mock it relentlessly  let s just hope they focus on slamming fox more often featured image via screencap
