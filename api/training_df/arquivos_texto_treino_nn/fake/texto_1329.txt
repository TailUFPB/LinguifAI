donald trump doesn t particularly have a filter  when the president of the united states is unhappy about an issue or feels somehow short changed  he will immediately take to twitter at any time of the day or night and vent  letting the world know his true feelings  this alone makes trump s half hearted tweet on his secondary twitter profile about the deadly portland train attack three days after the event seem more than just a little insincere police in portland  or  charged jeremy joseph christian on saturday with two counts of aggravated murder and one count of attempted murder for stabbing three citizens on a light rail train last friday  men who had come to the aid of two teenage girls that christian was racially abusing  destinee magnum and a friend who was wearing a hijab were riding the light rail when christian started yelling at the pair in what police describe as  hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions  he told us to go back to saudi arabia and he told us we shouldn t be here  to get out of his country   mangum  a non muslim  told kptv   he was just telling us that we basically weren t anything and that we should just kill ourselves  frightened  the two girls moved to the back of the train while three men intervened to defend the girls   me and my friend were going to get off the max and then we turned around while they were fighting and he just started stabbing people   she said   it was just blood everywhere and we just started running for our lives   ricky john best    of happy valley  died at the scene  while taliesin myrddin namkai meche    of portland  died later in hospital  micah fletcher    is still in hospital being treated for serious injuries america  and indeed the world  was horrified by the attack  with democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton tweeting soon after heartbreaking  no one should have to endure this racist abuse  no one should have to give their life to stop it https   t co   hillary clinton   hillaryclinton  may    america wanted to know what their president thought of the attack  an outspoken leader who is obsessed with social media and so disgusted by terrorism and hate crimes  trump was overseas for his first official international trip as the american president on friday  but surely the news of the heinous attack couldn t have slipped past him  nonetheless  the american people were kept waiting finally  three days later  president trump took to his  potus twitter account  not his personal  realdonaldtrump account  which has almost  million followers  and posted the following half assed token response the violent attacks in portland on friday are unacceptable  the victims were standing up to hate and intolerance  our prayers are w  them   president trump   potus  may    terminology that a parent would use on a child that brought home bad grades or a boss warning a hungover employee  president trump called the actions of a man who took the lives of two innocent people defending two teenage girls from racial abuse  unacceptable  on his secondary  rarely used twitter account trump is still yet to mention the attack on his  realdonaldtrump account  but this tweet alone gives a true insight into how little the president really cares about the incident featured image via sean gallup getty images
