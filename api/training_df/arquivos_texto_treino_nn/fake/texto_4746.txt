one of donald trump s top advisers repeatedly tried to change the subject during an interview on msnbc on monday but tamron hall was having none of it from the republican nominee s refusal to release his taxes to his illegal donation to pam bondi to his immigration policy  hall grilled a j  delgado until she was burned to a crisp delgado bragged about  retired military veterans endorsing her boss and claimed that it s because trump is constantly fundraising and donating money to veteran s organizations  delgado also claimed that hillary clinton doesn t have a record of helping veterans as usual  trump is slandering hillary clinton by lying about what she has done according to correct the record  hillary clinton worked tirelessly in the senate to pass legislation aimed at helping veterans she introduced the heroes at home act of  and  to help  families care for veterans with traumatic brain injuries or post traumatic stress disorder  she fought to  increase the survivor benefits for military families from    to     in addition  she helped author a new g i  bill of rights and fought to expand retirement and disability as well as family medical leave for veterans as well hall pointed out that trump  on the other hand  hasn t really proved that he donates a lot to veteran s groups because he refuses to release his tax returns delgado once again dragged out the tired old excuse that trump can t release his taxes because he is being audited  but hall immediately called bullshit  yes  you can   hall said   there s nothing that prevents you  delgado  who is supposed a lawyer  argued with hall by repeatedly saying that he can t until she finally conceded that legally he can release his taxes  but then she tried to make the discussion about hillary clinton s health  why is it you want them released   delgado asked   i think the bigger issue is hillary clinton s medical records  unperturbed  hall made it clear why american voters have the right to see his taxes  we don t know where he s invested his money  there was a new york times report about ties to chinese banks  potential investments in russia  we need to know more about this presidential candidate  why not release that information  frankly  it s time for the irs to speed up and finish their damn audit so that trump can no longer use it as an excuse hall moved on to slamming trump for whining about hillary s ties to foreign leaders and claiming that she ran a  pay to play  as secretary of state  but hall pointed out that trump is involved in a real pay to play  scandal right now because florida attorney general pam bondi dropped an investigation into trump university shortly before trump donated to her campaign  it sounds like a situation of pay for play   hall said  prompting yet more whining from delgado and yet another attempt to pivot to hillary clinton  pam bondi asked for that donation before she even knew that some complaints had come into her office  hundreds of complaints   delgado said  which brings up another question  why would bondi kill an investigation even though there were complaints flowing into her office against trump university  it definitely sounds like bondi was paid off to drop it hall pointed out that if hillary had donated to bondi and had a case against her magically dropped that trump would lose his shit over it  he would say that there s no way hillary clinton had this conversation and that this lawsuit did not come up   hall said   remember all the suspicions regarding  and bill clinton on the plane  donald trump would not accept that as answer  delgado then tried to portray the irs fine against trump for his    donation as resulting from a  clerical error   hall knew that delgado would keep trying to pivot back to attacking hillary clinton and she quickly shut her down  i fully realize that you ve come locked and loaded but what we re going to do is we re going to talk about what your candidate is now saying on the campaign trail  days out   hall said before playing a clip of trump flip flopping on his immigration message once again  delgado was reduced to desperately trying to pivot to hillary clinton instead of answering for her boss  clear flip flop here s the video via youtube and once again  tamron hall proves that she will not take any bullshit from trump s campaign featured image via screenshot
