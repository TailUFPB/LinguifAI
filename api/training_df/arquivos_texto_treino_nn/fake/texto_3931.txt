bill maher surprisingly thanked donald trump on friday night for doing at least one good thing during this campaign for years  conservative  christians  have said that they want a president who shares their values and morals  but that all went out the window in  when trump became the republican nominee but as we have witnessed  even though trump definitely has no moral compass and has been nothing but a vulgar bully who incites violence and hate the evangelical community has embraced him anyway and that made the real time host very giddy  before leaving this election behind  we must all thank donald trump for the one good thing he did   maher began   he exposed evangelicals  who are big trump supporters  as the shameless hypocrites they ve always been  republicans didn t get to play the jesus card this time around   maher continued   because it s hard to bring up the ten commandments when your candidate spent his life breaking all of them  trump s commandments are like the regular commandments with lol at the end  maher expressed how good it felt not having religion shoved down our throats throughout this election season as in other elections in the past  and he wondered how so called  values voters  can still support trump  a man who literally has committed adultery on several occasions  brags about sexually assaulting women  and lies in every sentence he utters  and as maher explained  trump definitely has nothing in common with jesus  trump has nothing in common with jesus  who was from the middle east  trump wouldn t even let him in the country  jesus healed the blind  trump mocks the handicapped  jesus turned the other cheek  trump grabs your pussy  jesus turned water into wine  trump just whines  the bible says   thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s wife   trump says   fine  what about my daughter  maher pointed out that evangelicals had a full bench of religious nut jobs to choose from during the primaries  including mike huckabee  rick santorum  and ted cruz  but they went for the thrice married foul mouthed  pussy grabber   maher said before going on to praise the mormons for not supporting trump here s the video via youtube featured image via video screen capture
