even though donald trump projects his own narcissistic confidence that he ll be a great president  most americans disagree a new gallup poll shows that the american people do not believe trump will be able to handle the responsibilities of the presidency according to gallup as donald trump prepares to take the presidential oath on jan    less than half of americans are confident in his ability to handle an international crisis      to use military force wisely     or to prevent major scandals in his administration      at least seven in  americans were confident in barack obama  george w  bush and bill clinton in these areas before they took office so donald trump is entering office with far less support than other presidents have in recent years trump s vindictive and divisive behavior combined with his bad temper and utter disregard for established foreign policy are making americans nervous about how he will respond if a foreign nation merely criticizes him trump s predecessors  on the other hand  enjoyed a solid majority of public confidence to do the job  and that includes president george w  bush the deficits in trump s ratings relative to his predecessors  are largely because of the low scores he gets from supporters of the opposing party  on average    of democrats have confidence in trump across the five presidential duties for which americans also rated bush and obama  all except handling the economy and defending u s  interests abroad   by contrast  for the same five areas  an average of   of republicans were confident in obama and an average of   of democrats were confident in bush  these data underscore the much more polarized partisan environment in which trump will be taking office donald trump may believe that everyone likes him but the results clearly show  like the popular vote  that americans really despise him also  as trump enters the white house with an approval rating below  percent  president obama is exiting the office with an approval rating of  percent  one of the highest on record for a president leaving office and higher than the historical average featured image via joe raedle getty images
