in an interview with washington examiner reporter salena zito  donald trump managed to utter one of the dumbest series of sentences in human history i mean  had andrew jackson been a little later  you wouldn t have had the civil war  he was a very tough person  but he had a big heart  and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the civil war  he said   there s no reason for this   people don t realize  you know  the civil war  you think about it  why people don t ask that question  but why was there the civil war  why could that one not have been worked out now  if trump was an intelligent human being  he might admit he is completely uneducated regarding andrew jackson  the civil war  and pretty much everything else  he would apologize  he would say he was wrong  but trump  well  he s a f cking moron in what appears to be an effort to convince people he was somehow right when he claimed that andrew jackson used the psychic powers bestowed upon him by satan himself in exchange for that whole trail of tears thing steve bannon keeps saying we should do again  at least  we can reasonably assume bannon says that  to foresee  a conflict that occurred  years after his death   and he was f cking pissed about it president andrew jackson  who died  years before the civil war started  saw it coming and was angry  would never have let it happen   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  may    jackson would have  had he actually possessed the magical ability to foresee the future  almost certainly used his powers for evil  slaves represented the majority of jackson s income  he owned  of them when he died  if jackson had actually known what was coming  he would have done all he could to ensure a southern victory   you know  had he not died  years before the civil war began  trump is correct that our seventh president would have been very  angry  about what he would certainly call the war of northern aggression  however had he had a heartbeat trump s attempt to smooth things over by claiming that jackson was a psychic didn t quite go over in the world of twitterville  with americans stopping by to collectively ask  what the f ck is wrong with you   realdonaldtrump you wish that andrew jackson an owner of hundreds of slaves should ve just made a deal w the south to allow slavery   pic twitter com   william legate   williamlegate  may    realdonaldtrump was he angry because he had   slaves  just wondering because pragmatically  that s a slave owners view  https   t co   kevin   thekevindent  may    thekevindent  realdonaldtrump do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound   margaret owens   margaretchloe  may    realdonaldtrump he owned slaves  caused the trail of tears  and didn t care about human rights  you need to read a history book   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  may    realdonaldtrump what did andrew jackson see coming   he had  slaves  robert maguire   robertmaguire  may    realdonaldtrump you stupid motherfucker   bendavid grabinski   bdgrabinski  may    realdonaldtrump andrew jackson committed genocide  he was a butcher   was a slave owner who believed in the institution   al letson   alletson  may    realdonaldtrump how was your emergency civil war history briefing  did they do it in crayon so would  kind of  understand some of it   tommy campbell   mrtommycampbell  may    realdonaldtrump yes  from his deathbed  the slaveowner had a vision of a war over slavery and was super pissed about it  a   analysis  as usual   jason bailey   jasondashbailey  may    realdonaldtrump we have a new contender for the most insane thing you ve ever said  and there s a lot of competition   nick jack pappas   pappiness  may    realdonaldtrump ha  a slave breeding  slave trading  genocidal  ethnic cleansing  venal  vindictive heart of ashes  no civil war  jackson  emancipation  ha   james morrison   jamespmorrison  may     folks  we hate to break it to you but our president  is an idiot  we should probably demand that republicans think about their country for a goddamn second and get him out of office while we still have a country to maga at all featured image via getty images  alex wong  screengrab
