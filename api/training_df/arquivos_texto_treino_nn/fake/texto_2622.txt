on wednesday  donald trump once again lashed out at the media with a scathing article about   fake news  stories that have been published since trump became president    fake news stories reporters have run since trump won  https   t co   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  february    site featuring the list  the federalist  is a known purveyor of right wing hoaxes and is about as reliable as betsy devos in any of the many bear attacks that occur in our schools year round  but trump saw a headline he liked and tweeted it out because  to him  fact checking is a waste of time  besides  trump is in the middle of the largest anti media campaign since adolf hitler went out of his way to discredit the media to allow him to more effectively consolidate power   and this article aids that goal nicely we are in the midst of an epidemic of fake news  there is no better word to describe it than  epidemic   insofar as it fits the epidemiological model from the centers for disease control  this phenomenon occurs when  an agent and susceptible hosts are present in adequate numbers  and the agent can be effectively conveyed from a source to the susceptible hosts  the  agent  in this case is hysteria over trump s presidency  and the  susceptible hosts  are a slipshod  reckless  and breathtakingly gullible media class that spread the hysteria around like well  like a virus it is difficult to adequately sum up the breadth of this epidemic  chiefly because it keeps growing  day after day  even hour after hour  the media continue to broadcast  spread  promulgate  publicize  and promote fake news on an industrial scale  it has become a regular part of our news cycle  not distinct from or extraneous to it but a part of it  embedded within the news apparatus as a spoke is embedded in a bicycle wheel whenever you turn on a news station  visit a news website  or check in on a journalist or media personality on twitter or facebook  there is an excellent chance you will be exposed to fake news  it is rapidly becoming an accepted part of the way the american media are run the list that follows  unsurprisingly  contains stories with mostly minor errors that were all corrected quickly because that s how it works when initial reporting is incorrect  others are simply stuff donald trump has done that the federalist elected to simply say are  fake news    like his threat to send troops into mexico  trump s decision to ease sanctions on russia  and the gop rolling back obama era regulations that prevent the mentally ill from owning guns fortunately  not everyone is as stupid as trump s followers and the donald was quickly called out for sharing this list from such a disreputable source oh for pete s sake  not one of these supposedly  fake  stories is actual  fake

trump likely doesn t actually believe the things he falsely calls  fake news  are fake news  sebastian gorka  deputy assistant to president donald trump  explained monday that the administration will keep using the term until the media realizes they are wrong for attacking trump with facts  there is a monumental desire on behalf of the majority of the media  not just the pollsters  the majority of the media to attack a duly elected president in the second week of his term   he says  that s how unhealthy the situation is and until the media understands how wrong that attitude is  and how it hurts their credibility  we are going to continue to say   fake news   gorka is a former editor for white supremacist propaganda website breitbart  which president steve bannon used to run yes  fake news exists  you usually see it on sites like nbc com co  org  but none of these stories  even the ones with errors  earn that classification  what does qualify as  fake news  is president asterisk s
