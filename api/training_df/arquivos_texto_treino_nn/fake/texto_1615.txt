the office of government ethics has said that ivanka trump must file financial disclosure forms  and that she s barred from participating in anything related to the trump family s businesses because she s an adviser to her father in the white house  the ethics office was never contacted about her role  revealing yet another area in which the white house is either sorely ignorant or sorely corrupt  most likely both  senators elizabeth warren and tom carper asked the ethics office about the rules that ivanka is supposed to follow  at the time they asked  ivanka was in the process of getting her government issued devices and a security clearance  and her lawyer had already said she would stick to the same ethics rules applied to every other government employee this is what the ethics office told warren and carper about the ethics rules applying to her  he primary criminal conflict of interest statue prohibits senior white house appointees and other executive branch employees from participating personally and substantially in particular matters directly and predictably affecting their financial interests  among other things  this prohibition extends to the financial interests of companies in which they have ownership interests the primary criminal conflict of interest statute prohibits ms  trump from participating in particular matters affecting her financial interests  including the financial interests of trump family businesses and other companies in which she has an ownership interest  that conflict of interest statute also covers her spouse s financial interests  which are imputed to her  so even if her husband  jared kushner  didn t have his own white house office  he still couldn t participate in the trump organization either ivanka s company was granted trademarks in china the same day she had dinner with chinese president xi jinping  the company said that the new trademarks are normal for the business that they do  and she did place her company in a trust and resigned from her position in the trump organization to accept her white house role  the trump organization  however  has likewise received a number of trademarks in china since trump took office she maintains financial control of her own company  though  as well as an interest in washington s trump international hotel  according to the new york times  these ethics rules apply to financial interests  even for employees and executives who ve formally resigned from their positions in their businesses  and those chinese trademarks  granted after she took her post in the white house  could violate the ethics rules to which she s bound  her ability to approve or deny certain deals through her trust may violate those rules as well unfortunately  ethics compliance is under the purview of the white house  and the white house is pretty loyal to donald trump and has shown zero interest in ensuring ethical compliance  the ethics office doesn t have enforcement power   they just issue guidance  congressional democrats now have a powerful case against ivanka should it come to light that she s violating these rules  though there s word for this if she doesn t bring herself into full compliance  corruption featured image by sean gallup via getty images
