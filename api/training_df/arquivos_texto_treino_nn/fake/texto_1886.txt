on march   donald trump declared april  national sexual assault awareness and prevention month   on april    less than one week later   he said fellow scumbag bill o reilly didn t do  anything wrong  when he seemingly sexually harassed a large number of his female staff over the years  but then  donald trump himself has been accused of numerous sexual assaults and harassment  so birds of a feather the new york times got an exclusive interview with trump and walked away with two bombshell findings  both awful in their own unique way  first  trump duped veteran journalists maggie haberman and glenn thrush into publishing a slanderous claim that susan rice  the former national security adviser under obama  had committed a crime  that would be a huge story if not for the fact that when asked to produce a single shred of evidence  trump refused to do so  i think it s going to be the biggest story   mr  trump said in an interview in the oval office  declining repeated requests for evidence for his allegations or the names of other obama administration officials   it s such an important story for our country and the world  it is one of the big stories of our time  he declined to say if he had personally reviewed new intelligence to bolster his claim but pledged to explain himself  at the right time  and he s currently already nursing several other claims    million people illegally voted  obama illegally wiretapped him   which he has also failed to provide any proof for  despite these repeated offenses  habermann and thrush ran the story as if trump weren t the biggest bullshitter in the world  that s inexcusable but trump wasn t done  after pretending to uncover a major political scandal  trump moved onto his friend bill o reilly  o reilly is currently embroiled in scandal that may cost him his job after having been exposed as settling at least five sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him from female coworkers  trump  five days into sexual assault and prevent month  jumped to his friend s defense  i think he s a person i know well   he is a good person   said mr  trump  who during the interview was surrounded at his desk by a half dozen of his highest ranking aides  including the economic adviser gary cohn and chief of staff reince priebus  along with vice president mike pence  i think he shouldn t have settled  personally i think he shouldn t have settled   said mr  trump   because you should have taken it all the way  i don t think bill did anything wrong  here s what trump considers innocent behavior   locker room talk  if you will   by o reilly the women who made allegations against mr  o reilly either worked for him or appeared on his show  they have complained about a wide range of behavior  including verbal abuse  lewd comments  unwanted advances and phone calls in which it sounded as if mr  o reilly was masturbating  according to documents and interviews the reporting suggests a pattern  as an influential figure in the newsroom  mr  o reilly would create a bond with some women by offering advice and promising to help them professionally  he then would pursue sexual relationships with them  causing some to fear that if they rebuffed him  their careers would stall trump  of course  has a large list of his own offenses against women  during the campaign  over a dozen women came forward to recount times he had assaulted or attempted to assault them  trump himself seemed to back up their claims in a leaked audio recording where he bragged about grabbing and kissing women even without their consent  other women have also come forward to describe times trump was sexually demeaning or suggestive to them to watch trump and o reilly  both with histories of abuse  cover for each other is truly nauseating featured image via alex wong getty images
