republicans are lying when they claim to be  fiscally conservative   and donald trump s wall proves it throughout the campaign  the central promise trump made to his supporters was that he would build a massive wall along the u s  mexican border and force mexico to pay for it and then one day during the home stretch of the  election  trump slipped up by admitting that american taxpayers would be paying the price tag and immediately followed up by claiming that mexico will  reimburse  us for the cost well  that cost is estimated to be   million or more and donald trump is now asking republicans in congress to pass funding for the wall  all while continuing to insist that mexico will pay the united states back apparently  trump and republicans want to start with   billion  keep in mind that these are the same republicans who claimed to be worried about the national debt and frequently obstructed every piece of legislation they could over the last six years because they complained it cost too much or was a waste of taxpayer dollars clearly  republicans only think it s waste of taxpayer dollars when democrats try to pass something and are only  concerned  about the deficit and debt when democrats are in charge  but they have absolutely no problem blowing up the debt and spending like drunken sailors when they are in power and joy reid along with fiscal conservative political journalist josh barro  nailed republicans for being complete hypocrites  today  the president elect got slightly more detailed about who will actually pay for the wall and  surprise  it s you   reid began reid pointed out that republicans are stuck between a rock and a hard place because they are now faced with angering trump s racist supporters if they don t fund the wall  or angering the american people by wasting taxpayer dollars and revealing themselves to be  fiscally conservative  hypocrites josh barro agreed  it starts adding up to real money  a billion here  a billion there   he said   it s something that ends up being a non trivial item in the federal budget if we foot the bill for it  i think they have to be worried in both directions  if they try to not appropriate the money to build the wall they could be attacked in the primary but if they do go along with spending what ends up being   billion or whatever on this wall  that s something they can be attacked for in the general election  here s the video via vidme and it would  indeed  be american taxpayers who get stuck with the bill  because mexico has repeatedly declared that they are not going to pay one dime for trump s wall  and such a wall would still not stop immigrants from crossing the border  even the berlin wall built by the russians to keep east germans from crossing over to west berlin did not stop people from getting across  and that barrier was  to  feet in height made of concrete and boasted border guards and tanks prepared to kill anyone who dared try to escape  it even included  subsidiary walls  trenches  electric fences and an open  death strip  overseen by armed guards in  watchtowers  plus  the berlin wall was only  miles long  the southern border between mexico and the united states  however  is nearly   miles long and trump claims his wall will only need to cover   miles of it  and that means it will be far more expensive than the berlin wall and would be far less effective unless trump and the republicans are proposing to militarize the wall like the soviets did to the berlin wall  of course  that would only make the cost skyrocket even higher and hurt america s image as a beacon of freedom the bottom line is that trump s wall is a money pit that will drain our resources and do nothing to curtail immigration  it will be useless and give america a black eye because we would be compared to the soviet union  and while that might be fine with trump and his buddy vladimir putin  it won t be fine with a majority of the american people who still believe in our constitutional values featured image via screenshot
