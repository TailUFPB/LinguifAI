hillary clinton has a much better run campaign than donald trump does  she has a ground game  and get out the vote operation  and she also has voter targeting and demographics on her side  however  despite all of this  the polls are tightening in these final hours  so  what is hillary doing to make sure everyone remembers just who trump is  why  bringing out a secret weapon that has been one of trump s biggest pieces of kryptonite of the entire campaign  khizr khan we all remember how khan  the father of a fallen muslim american soldier  army captain humayun khan  excoriated trump at the democratic national convention this summer  as a result  the notoriously thin skinned trump went on a tirade against khan  he insulted khan s wife in a fight there was no way he could win politically as he lost control of himself and spent nearly a week attacking the gold star family  now  khan plans to campaign with hillary in the  hour this all important joint campaign trail appearance between hillary and mr  khan will happen sunday night  just two days before election day  trump is already feeling anxious and aggrieved  thanks to the fact that his path to  electoral votes is so much more narrow than hillary s  in trotting out mr  khan  hillary is setting the perfect trump trap   especially if khan lays into trump the same way he did at the democratic national convention now  this late in the game  it could be argued that everyone is already in their corners  and many have already voted  there s likely nothing either candidate can do or say between sunday and tuesday to make a supporter not vote the way he or she had planned to vote  but   what a trump meltdown of khan level qualities could do is to remind soft and independent voters  who were going to hold their noses and vote for trump  just what makes them so uneasy about his being president  and they will stay home   or maybe even vote for hillary featured image via justin sullivan getty images
