with the election of donald trump  many people are pointing fingers in many different directions to try and figure out what exactly just happened  how the hell did the united states just elect a failed businessman turned reality television host and beauty pageant coordinator to commander in chief perhaps  in part  the media is very much to blame  they treated trump s campaign as a joke for the better first half of it  likely not thinking he would get as far as he has  he was entertainment  people tuned into to see whatever crazy thing trump said next  unlike his competition  pretty much every rally was televised  he had endless interviews and free air time  and he was sensationalized beyond comprehension no one was really calling out the awful things he was saying in the mainstream media   that was left to those on twitter on the liberal blogosphere  ironically  the same liberal blogosphere that is being blamed for his win and dubbed  fake news  by those who don t like to admit its honest relevancy  they were some of the only ones to highlight how horrific trump actually is cornering jake tapper of cnn at los angeles international airport was none other than tmz  they asked tapper about the media s role in the election  and he responded  well  that s an extremely loaded question  i think there were a lot of media mistakes this season in all sorts of directions  i think polling needs to be re examined quite a bit  adding  this is probably a subject for a three hour dissertation  not an airport drive by  certainly there s a lot of people whose behavior and professionalism this election season should be re examined  thinking about how to do better and how to be better  that s saying it lightly  the mainstream media didn t do its job  they propped trump up on a pedestal but at the same time never took him seriously enough to properly criticize the horrifying things he consistently said  so yes  we do need to think about how to do better and how to be better watch the interview via tmz here featured image via video screen capture
