this is exactly what bill maher had in mind when he invited milo yiannopoulos to come on his show in response to yiannopoulos being unable to speak at uc berkeley earlier this year because protesters refused to let him spew his hate on their campus  maher decided to bring on real time  after scheduled panelist jeremy scahill dropped out in protest  maher blasted the decision  liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like mr  scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women  respect for minorities  separation of religion and state  and free speech   maher said in a statement   if mr  yiannopoulos is indeed the monster scahill claims   and he might be   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on friday night  and expose him he certainly did yiannopoulos attacked transgender people during the show which drew condemnation from the audience and a beat down from larry wilmore  i think it s just sad because these are the same arguments that were used against gay people  like they were aliens who just wanted to f ck anything that moved  and that s why we should avoid them   wilmore said yiannopoulos tried to interrupt but wilmore would have none of it and continued schooling the alt right hate monger  there is a difference without a distinction  it s like when people try and compare gay and black  yeah  they re not the same thing  but we share the same invisibility  people didn t see us in society  and gay people hid out from society  but there are a lot of the same issues that you have to deal with when you re marginalized  proving that he lost the argument  yiannopoulos went on to insult wilmore by telling maher he should book guests with  high iqs   this coming from a college dropout who makes his money by spewing sexism and anti gay rhetoric despite being raised by his mother and grandmother and being gay himself well  wilmore didn t let yiannopoulos get away with it  hold on  bill  first of all  you can go f ck yourself  if your argument is that these people are stupid  you didn t hear a word this man said   wilmore fired back in reference to malcolm nance  an intelligence analyst who worked in naval cryptology   because he can talk circles around your pathetic douchey little ass  here s the video via youtube milo yiannopoulos fell flat on his face and demonstrated why he shouldn t be be booked to speak anywhere ever again featured image via screenshot
