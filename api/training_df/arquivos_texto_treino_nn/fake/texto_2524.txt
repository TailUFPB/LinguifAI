a scant few republicans on capitol hill want investigations into michael flynn s ties to russia  and by extension  trump s  others are sweeping it away by saying the issue took care of itself with flynn s resignation  and then there s rand paul  who just told us the truth about why they were so insistent on investigating every last little thing about hillary  but won t investigate flynn or trump despite far more demonstrable evidence of treason while paul may have a small point when he says it s not always a good idea to do investigation after investigation  that would really only apply if the gop was impartially doing its job they aren t  they never were  paul s actual words were  i just don t think it s useful to be doing investigation after investigation  particularly of your own party  really  it s a good idea to waste time  effort and money repeatedly investigating hillary s emails and her handling of bengazi  but it s not worth it to investigate real treason when it means investigating your own party please at least he s finally admitted it  we already saw this with jason chaffetz and other republicans saying they didn t think they were going to investigate the trump administration s ties to russia  but paul just put it out there in the open furthermore  it seems he s suddenly quite interested in doing anything else  we ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do like repealing obamacare if we re spending our whole time having republicans investigate republicans  i think it makes no sense  but if flynn and the president were democrats  it would make all the sense in the world  paul and others would be screaming  treason   over and over and setting up special independent panels everywhere to get to the bottom of this it s possible even likely that they re afraid of how all this reflects on them  make no mistake  it reflects badly  not only do they look like complete idiots for not stopping trump during the primaries when they had the chance  but now they look like treasonous hypocrites  the funny thing is  they d be less complicit in the treason if they d investigate it featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
