senators from both parties were frustrated with the intel chiefs who refused to answer their most important questions during wednesday s senate intelligence committee hearing  sen  john mccain  r ariz   like many of his colleagues  was clearly fed up with their silence mccain asked director of national intelligence dan coats about a recent article published in the washington post that said he told his associates that donald trump had asked him to intervene in the russia probe on his behalf  coats insisted that he couldn t talk about what had already been published by the post  and everywhere else at this point  in a public hearing  obviously irritated  mccain couldn t help but notice the  orwellian  nature of the world we are living in today  you know  it just shows what kind of an orwellian existence that we live in   mccain exclaimed   i mean  it s detailed as you know from reading the story as to when you met  what you discussed  et cetera  et cetera  and yet  here in a public hearing before the american people  we can t talk about what was described in detail in this morning s washington post  coats again argued that he couldn t talk about private conversations publicly  but this didn t take away mccain s aggravation at the current state of affairs  i m certainly not blaming you but it certainly is an interesting town in which we exist   mccain said he then added that whether the information published by the post was classified or not  it really makes no difference now as it has already been made public  so  it s kind of a moot point you can watch john mccain marvel at the  orwellian existence that we live in   here featured image via video screen capture
