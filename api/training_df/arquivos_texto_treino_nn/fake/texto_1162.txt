the republican party has always had a problem with racism  that s no accident  after all it was their racist  southern strategy  that got them the votes of racist white southerners once the civil rights act was signed  modern day republicans like to point out that it was the democrats who were the party of the ku klux klan and other racists  but the parties switched sides once the civil rights act was signed by president lyndon b  johnson  because southern democrats couldn t abide the idea of de segregating the south and starting down the path of trying to kill racism as a matter of policy and practice as they knew it  that s how the racists wound up in the gop  and the democrats lost the south for a generation  it s also why  to this day  the gop has such a hard time with minority voters  however  something amazing has happened to the republican party in this area with donald trump as its titular head  they have literally become the party of white supremacists   and they aren t even trying to hide it anymore just a few years ago  no one would have thought this possible   not even elected republicans themselves  for instance  when notoriously racist rep  steve king   r  iowa  made his infamous comment about mexican immigrants having  calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling  pounds of marijuana across the desert   then  house speaker john boehner said  from a podium to the press that the comments were  hateful   and  offensive   there were also reports that boehner said privately that king is an  asshole  for saying what he said that was just three years ago in   to compare  here in   when king made a much worse remark   the infamous and openly white nationalist  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  tweet   current house speaker paul ryan was tepid in his response  only saying that he is sure that rep  king  misspoke  to top it all off  king tweeted that in support of far right dutch candidate for high office geert wilders  who literally wants to outlaw the religion of islam  something tells me that if given the chance  steve king would outlaw islam in america wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny  we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies  https   t co   steve king   stevekingia  march    king doubled down on the remarks  speaker ryan said nothing  further  only a few gop elected officials had the nerve to rebuke king   almost all of them minorities  this is because these people know who their base is  who donald trump s base is  and they know they need the racists and white supremacists that helped propel trump to the white house to get reelected this is all perfectly in line with trump s infamous call to ban muslims from entering the nation  and of course  there was former new york mayor and close trump confidante rudy giuliani s admission that trump asked him to put together a way for him to ban muslims that would pass constitutional muster then  we get to the donald trump campaign itself  let s not forget   trump entered the political arena by trying to delegitimize the first black president by spreading the racist lie that president barack obama was not born here  and forcing him to show his birth certificate in a  show me your papers  boy  type of way  even when trump let his birtherism go  he still lied and said hillary clinton started it also  we all remember how long it took trump to disavow david duke and the ku klux klan when jake tapper asked him about it  only then did house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rebuke him  however  that was before trump had secured the nomination  too  there was radio silence from gop leadership on the open racism and anti semitism and misogyny of the trump campaign unless they were cornered  as when  nevertrump conservative radio host charlie sykes forced house speaker paul ryan to answer for trump s repeated retweets of anti semitic images as for the trump administration itself   there are no words for the level of bigotry allowed therein  first  we have trump campaign ceo turned white house chief strategist stephen k  bannon  who ran the openly racist and anti semitic website breitbart com prior to joining trump s campaign  bannon is a literal white supremacist  he has said that one book that shapes his world view is a french novel called  camp of saints   which fantasizes that immigrants   conveniently of the black and brown variety   are coming to destroy the white race  every educated analysis of the novel reveals that it is virulently racist   this is a book that also happens to be a favorite of steve king   then  we have head speechwriter and immigration policy maker stephen miller  who shares this ideology and has for a long time  after all  this is a guy who spent his high school years harassing latino students  then  there is adviser sebastian gorka  who wore a medal from a hungarian nazi group to trump s inauguration  the group said they were proud to see gorka wearing the medal through all of these clearly white supremacist appointments  prominent gop leaders have been silent  nothing from house speaker paul ryan  senate majority leader mitch mcconnell  or any of the others  in fact  when asked about bannon  speaker ryan only said he hadn t met him  well  i haven t met david duke either  but i let his past work inform my opinion of him  when mcconnell was asked about bannon  he was silent  then told the reporters in his office   it s great to be with you guys today   then  aides rushed the reporters out before anyone could press further what did senate majority leader mitch mcconnell have to say today about steve bannon s appointment  not much  pic twitter com   the last word   thelastword  november    let s not forget attorney general jeff sessions  the guy who they all say isn t a racist but was deemed too racist to be confirmed to a federal judgeship by a gop controlled senate in ronald reagan s administration in   there s also white house press secretary sean spicer s saying that nazi leader adolf hitler never used chemical weapons   all while referring to nazi death camps as  holocaust centers   and there is the white house s engaging in holocaust denial by omitting any mention of jewish people from their holocaust remembrance day statement  it turns out that this was deliberate  which is definite holocaust denial because while other minorities died in the holocaust as well  hitler s  final solution  was to eradicate the jewish people from the planet  in short  the holocaust was specifically about jews  and the white house is deliberately denying this  here is video of their statements regarding their omission of the original purpose of the holocaust  and why they deliberately omitted the mention of jews i could go on  but you get the picture  the gop  in the past  had no issue rebuking open white nationalism  they do now because that is literally who they are  there are white supremacists working in the white house  and all throughout trump s government  and the mainstream leadership of the republican party has absolutely no problem with that at all   because the people with those same repugnant ideas are their base  this is who the gop is so  i implore you to look at all the evidence provided here and think   if you are a republican  but you abhor racism  anti semitism  and white supremacy  why are you still a member of the gop featured image via brendan smialowski afp getty images
