donald trump s first trip overseas was an absolute disaster  and it s becoming obvious that trump has full intention of making his second one just as bad trump kicked off his second international tour with a joint press conference with poland s president  andrzej duda  and it seemed as though trump totally forgot which country he is supposed to be leading  when trump was questioned about russia by msnbc white house correspondent hallie jackson  trump betrayed america in front of the entire world jackson asked trump  will you once and for all  yes or no  definitively say that russia interfered in the  election   trump responded by trashing u s  intel and former president barack obama  i think it was russia and i think it could have been a lot of people interfered  i said it very simply  i think it could very well have been russia  but i think it well could have been other countries  and i won t be specific  but i think a lot of people interfere i think it s been happening for a long time  it s been happening for many years  now  the thing i have to mention is that barack obama when he was president found out about this in terms of if it were russia  found out about it in august  now  the election was in november  that s a lot of time  he did nothing about it  jackson pressed trump further  asking the unhinged potus why he refused to agree with what u s  intel is currently saying about russia  your intelligence agencies have been far more definitive  they say it was russia  why won t you agree with them and say it was  trump made u s  intel look like a joke  let me start off by saying i heard it was  agencies  i said boy  that s a lot  do we even have that many intelligence agencies  let s check it  we did some heavy research  it turned out to be three or four  and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting and had to apologize and correct  you can watch trump throw u s  intel and obama under the bus below this disgusting move has been condemned by many already  morning joe host joe scarborough called trump s comments  nothing short of disgusting  as we ve said before  you re on foreign soil  this is remarkable  for a sitting president of the united states to be on foreign soil  you can t really underline this enough  and attack america s intel community  on foreign soil  and attack america s free press on foreign soil   for him to attack american institutions two days after the fourth of july on foreign soil  the day before we meet america s chief adversary is nothing short of disgusting  trump never ceases to surprise us by taking the country to new lows featured image via drew angerer    getty images
