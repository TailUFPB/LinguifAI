as there is more and more demand by politicians and electoral college electors for a bipartisan investigation into russia s involvement in the  election  our president elect has very conveniently decided to go into hiding according to bloomberg  trump is unable to handle the heat and rising suspicions so he has canceled his first press conference since his undeserved win  bloomberg said  president elect donald trump is postponing until next month a previously announced news conference to outline how he ll handle his far flung business operations while in the white house  according to senior trump transition officials trump had planned to make the announcement dec   but wants more time because he s been occupied with filling out his cabinet and top administration posts  according to the officials  who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations  he s preparing to reveal his choice for secretary of state as soon as tuesday  they said  first of all  all you need to do is look at trump s twitter history to know that he hasn t been so swamped with his cabinet appointments to have a press conference   after all  he still has time to insult people on social media and attend his  victory tour  rallies  this is merely the pathetic excuse trump s advisors are using to prevent trump from screwing up even more before the electoral college has to vote on him in a few days  and of course  trump s team recognizes that having a press conference where trump is supposed to address his conflicts of interests and business issues is probably not a good idea right now the cancellation of this contest marks another first for trump   he s the first president elect since  who has not held a press conference after winning the election  in fact  trump hasn t done any press conferences since july   and ironically he invited russia to hack hillary clinton and leak her emails during that press conference  not suspicious at all  trump featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
