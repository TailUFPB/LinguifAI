trump is working his tail off to undo absolutely everything president obama ever did  because the black man who once occupied the white house apparently hated all of america and everyone in it far more than his royal orangeness  and that includes ending the deferred action for childhood arrivals  daca  program  that program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children that was one of obama s more controversial executive orders  with republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power  but trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration  he promised to remove  million undocumented immigrants from the country  who  in his mind  are here because obama and the democrats favor open borders  and by golly  he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people like those protected by daca so obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to trump s cold blooded fuckery on facebook  naming every single thing wrong with trump s move  including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable  he also pointed out what should be obvious  but apparently isn t  to anyone who believes the gop s lies  kicking  out won t lower the unemployment rate  or lighten anyone s taxes  or raise anybody s wages  for eons  the gop has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain  white  working class americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy it s a matter of basic decency  according to obama  he knows as well as the rest of us that trump has no decency to him  because if he did  he wouldn t do this  let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to congress  ultimately  this is about basic decency  this is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of america  or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated  it s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be  the ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the constitution s letters  but not its spirit  like all those allegedly  constitutional  republicans and conservatives who blasted obama over daca  and now stand with the racist in chief on this  read his full post below featured image via alexander scheuber getty images
