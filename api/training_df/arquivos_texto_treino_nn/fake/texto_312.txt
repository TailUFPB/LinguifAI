donald trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on nfl players who refuse to stand during the national anthem in a stand against social injustice  trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism  but most americans know that trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one democrat is calling him out for it rep  hakeem jeffries  d n y   blasted trump on the house floor on monday and attacked the undeserving potus for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as stephen curry  lebron james and the nfl players  in his powerful  fiery speech  jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know   how dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic    you can watch this epic speech below just defended    kingjames   on house floor  how dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic   pic twitter com wfbtdajtld  hakeem jeffries   repjeffries  september    that s not the only time jeffries has spoken out against trump about the potus  recent attacks on athletes  in an interview with cnn  jeffries called trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged  jeffries said  he uses race to advance his own ends  we couldn t have said it better  it is no coincidence that trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left  trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises  so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place  trump s remarks about the nfl are disgusting and deserve to be condemned again and again featured image is a screenshot
