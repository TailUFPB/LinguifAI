libertarians are convinced that their presidential ticket should be getting security briefings too  just like the democrats and the republicans  why  because they seem to think there is some possible scenario where they could come out on top in november donald trump and hillary clinton began receiving security briefings shortly after they officially became the nominees for their respective parties  apparently  poor gary johnson is feeling left out even though it is uncommon for third party candidates to get these kinds of briefings  it wouldn t be a first  the last third party candidate to receive security briefings was john anderson  an independent  in   and now  the libertarian party thinks that johnson and his running mate  former massachusetts gov  bill weld  should be eligible to receive security briefings  too libertarian national chairman nicholas sarwark wrote a letter to the general service administration  gsa  on thursday  arguing that the libertarian candidates should be getting national security briefings since they are on the ballot in all  states  even the federal government is in the business of attempting to pre select voters  choices for president and vice president  three tickets will be on the ballot in all  states and the district of columbia  but only two are receiving taxpayer funded national security briefings  that is just wrong  and we urge the gsa to provide the same information to governor johnson that is being given to mr  trump and sec  clinton  the presidential transition act of  makes it so that all presidential candidates are able to receive security briefings  including third party candidates  however  the law also says that the candidates must have a  significant level of public support  in national polls and need to be  realistically  thought to have a chance at winning the presidency even though johnson s name will be on the ballot in all  states  he s only polling at   percent  which is not enough  public support  to get him onto the debate stage  let alone the white house  so i m not sure how  realistic  the possibility of a johnson presidency actually is on the other hand  perhaps a national security briefing or two would be good for johnson  maybe they could tell him what the heck aleppo is featured image via george frey getty images
