it what can only be seen as a situation where you want to feel bad for a person  but really don t  one supporter of repealing obamacare just learned the hard way that they re against their own healthcare all names have been blacked out  so pardon the anonymity  however  helen kennedy from twitter seemed to get her hands on the really sad conversation it began with a post on facebook from this someone who is against  obamacare  and posted the vote and said  one step closer to fixing this mistake  and only a couple weeks left of barry s regime   is already looking up  this is when it gets sad  someone pointed out that repealing the affordable care act will strip health aid from those who desperately need it  this is when the person responds   first we re talking about obamacare  not the aca  secondly  my health insurance is through the aca  so i m definitely not the kind of person to look down on others for needing help this is when someone points out to this person that they re on obamacare  which is just another name for the affordable care act this original posters replies  i m not on obamacare  my health insurance is through the aca  affordable care act   which was what they had to come up with after obamacare crashed and burned as bad as it did  so i m gonna be fine  then response after response came in explaining that they are  in fact  the same thing  and as of the screengrab  the original poster hadn t responded here s the tweet facebook nitwit celebrating obamacare repeal finds out obamacare is another name for the aca he depends on  pic twitter com ehstqchxqq  helen kennedy   helenkennedy  january    makes you wonder how many people out there really don t know that obamacare and the affordable care act are the same thing  and it s actually kind of sad  they ve been spoon fed lies by republicans to hate the very thing they are now reliant on just by calling it another name that associates it with obama  which  by the way  is the only reason they want the repeal  so obama doesn t have the legislative victory this poor person  hopefully  they change their stance sooner rather than later  but it seems their entire world has been rocked featured image via giphy
