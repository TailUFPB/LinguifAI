after a terrorist attack in london  donald trump used the occasion to brag about himself and smear president obama the united states has been fighting isis since   most of that fighting has been done under the leadership of president obama but nine months into his own presidency  trump is now declaring that he has done more against isis than president obama we have made more progress in the last nine months against isis than the obama administration has made in  years must be proactive   nasty   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september     as usual  trump is completely full of shit under obama s strategy and leadership  the united states military killed over half of the commanders isis had and various military strikes wiped out well over   isis fighters  some reports say over     all while reducing isis  territory from a wide swath of the middle east stretching from syria through iraq to just a few remaining city strongholds in addition  isis lost most of their valuable resources and recruitment dramatically declined and in december   united states officials announced that  percent of all isis fighters have been killed by contrast  isis cheered when trump took office and have been using him as a recruitment tool  trump is also responsible for killing more civilians in nine months than president obama did in just over two years  which is just helping isis radicalize more fighters to their cause basically  trump is waging a desperate destructive campaign to kill the remaining isis fighters and leaders so he can boast that he is  doing more  against isis  but his campaign is full of unnecessary collateral damage that is only helping isis recruit in military parlance  trump s campaign is merely a  mop up  operation  which is what takes place after the military has already gone in and wiped out most of the enemy forces president obama s strategy and leadership resulted in isis being crippled  trump is only getting the crumbs that obama did not have time to finish off  and he can t even get that right because killing civilians is the best recruitment tool that terrorist organizations like isis and al qaeda  another terrorist group president obama crippled  use to remain relevant so trump can brag all he wants  it doesn t change the fact that president obama was a better commander in chief featured image  jack gruber pool getty images
