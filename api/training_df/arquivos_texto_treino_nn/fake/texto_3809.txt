most of the people with brains in this country knew that donald trump  a reality television star  was not fit to be the next president of the united states and should not be allowed anywhere near the white house  unfortunately  trump was able to rile up enough hate and divisiveness in this country to get himself elected  but he s already proving that he s going to be a disastrous commander in chief no one has to look any further than trump s twitter account to understand how much of a mistake electing him was  despite the fact that he promised he would be restrained on social media  trump is incapable of changing  and instead of getting to work and laying out his vision for the country  he spent several hours on sunday attacking the new york times  are you embarrassed for america  you should be here s how our thin skinned president elect went after a top newspaper twitter it s worth mentioning that although trump continues to deny that he ever said japan should have nukes  he most certainly did say that  but seriously  presidents who actually do their job don t spend hours on twitter attacking the free press  they don t have time  and they have more important things to focus on   things that go beyond what trump is capable of handling the new york times didn t hesitate to call trump out on his lies twitterwe re proud of our election coverage   we will continue to  hold power to account   here s what we told our employees   our subscribers  pic twitter com   nytco communications   nytimescomm  november    s safe to say that trump didn t actually believe he was going to win the election  and he s miserable now that he has  his priorities have not changed one bit since becoming the president elect  trump has no real interest in actually running the country  and his twitter account proves that he s going to fail and pull the rest of america down with him featured image via chip somodevilla   getty images
