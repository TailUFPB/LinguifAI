right wingers everywhere have been trying to disprove overwhelming climate science that shows the earth is warming rapidly  they seem to believe that if it s cold outside  well  then the earth isn t actually warming breitbart news is no different  and they decided to try to use a video from the weather channel to disprove climate change and wrote an entire article touting claims that we re not actually warming  however  the weather channel just struck back and responded with their own article titled   note to breitbart  earth is not cooling  climate change is real and please stop using our video to mislead americans  note to  breitbartnews  earth is not cooling  climate change is real and stop using our video to mislead americans https   t co  pic twitter com   the weather channel   weatherchannel  december      note to breitbart  earth is not cooling  climate change is real https   t co ufjmofuirq  the weather channel   weatherchannel  december    s actually more horrifying than breitbart trying to purposefully misinform people is that the house committee on science  space  and technology actually tweeted the breitbart article  giving it credit where absolutely no credit was due   breitbartnews  global temperatures plunge  icy silence from climate alarmists https   t co   sci space  tech cmte   housescience  december    weather channel then when through claim by claim made and thoroughly debunked the misinformation  and even said  here s the thing  science doesn t care about your opinion  cherrypicking and changing the facts will not change the future  nor the fact  note fact  not opinion  the earth is warming  here are the debunked claims claim   global land temperatures have plummeted by one degree celsius since the middle of this year   the biggest and steepest fall on record  truth  this number comes from one satellite based estimate of temperatures above land areas in the lower atmosphere  data from the other two groups that regularly publish satellite based temperature estimates show smaller drops  more typical of the decline one would expect after a strong el ni o event temperatures over land give an incomplete picture of global scale temperature  most of the planet   about  percent   is covered by water  and the land surface warms and cools more quickly than the ocean  land plus ocean data from the other two satellite groups  released after the breitbart article  show that earth s lower atmosphere actually set a record high in november  claim   it can be argued that without the el ni o  and the so called  pacific blob     would not have been record warm years    david whitehouse  global warming policy foundation  quoted by breitbart truth  noaa data show that the   el ni o did not even begin until october   it was a borderline event until mid   barely above the el ni o threshold  el ni o clearly added to the strength of the record global warmth observed since late   however  if the el ni o spike is removed   is still the warmest year on record and  the second warmest  according to climate scientist zeke hausfather  berkeley earth  claim   many think that  will be cooler than previous years  myles allen of oxford university says that by the time of the next big united nations climate conference  global temperatures are likely to be no warmer than the paris cop in   this would be a strange thing to happen if  as some climate scientists have claimed  recent years would have been a record even without the el ni o    david rose  u k  daily mail  quoted by breitbart truth  there is nothing unusual about a drop in global surface temperatures when going from el ni o to la nina  these ups and downs occur on top of the long term warming trend that remains when the el ni o and la ni a signals are removed  if there were no long term trend  then we would see global record lows occurring during the strongest la ni a events  however  the last year to see global temperatures hit a record low was   and the most recent year that fell below the  century average was  watch the full video and breakdown from the weather channel here as horrible as all of this is  it s actually kind of hilarious that the weather channel so thoroughly threw breitbart under the bus  they deserve to be condemned and the fact remains that climate change is absolutely real and we need to start doing more to combat it featured image via the weather channel screen capture
