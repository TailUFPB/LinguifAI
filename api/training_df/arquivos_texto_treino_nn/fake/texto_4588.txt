jason kander is a democrat running for a united states senate seat in missouri  the seat is currently held by roy blunt  a republican  kander  who is  years old and is also missouri s current attorney general  recently released probably the best political advertisement we will see in the  election kander s opponent has been attacking him for supporting more effective background checks on gun sales that was a major mistake for blunt  that s because kander is an afghanistan war veteran  which means that he knows his way around firearms  which kander demonstrates perfectly in his campaign video  the thirty second advertisement busts a myth that the right wing has made about gun law reformers for decades   that enacting smart safety regulations is tantamount to unilateral gun confiscation in reality  despite what the nra would have people think  gun law reformers want to create laws that should be considered common sense  such as say  not letting people on terrorist watch lists purchase firearms in the ad  kander stands in front of a table with a dissembled rifle on the table  kander proceeds to assemble the weapon while blindfolded  while kander assembles the rifle he says  i m jason kander and senator blunt has been attacking me on guns  well  in the army i learned how to use and respect my rifle  in afghanistan  i volunteered to be a gun in an unarmored convoy of suv s  in the state legislature  i supported  amendment rights  i also believe in background checks so that terrorists can t get their hands on one of these  when kander finishes assembling the rifle  he removes his blindfold and says   i approve this message because i d like to see senator blunt do this  a majority of americans are in favor of expanding background checks  yet  congress has not taken action to support legislation that would create such a system  that s because the nra is holding our congress hostage  they donate huge amounts of moneyto political candidates  in   so far the nra has spent    dollars in campaign contributions  a paltry sum compared to the total amounts of money they have spent influencing politics  overall  they have spent more than a quarter million dollars supporting blunt they also work endlessly to brainwash their supporters into thinking that all gun reformers want to get rid of the second amendment  which is absolutely not true  this ad effectively smashes that conflation in mere seconds you can watch the ad below in full https   www facebook com kanderformissouri videos  feature image from video screenshot
