if there is a special place in hell for a woman who works against the best interests of women  this trump supporter already has a reservation young turks reporter jordan chariton went to donald trump s rally in north carolina on wednesday before it began to interview several trump supporters when chariton asked one woman if she had a birthday message for hillary clinton  rather than say something nice the woman said   trump that bitch  we could care less about her birthday   the woman continued  going on to remark that she hopes hillary won t be in the white house the woman then proceeded to tell chariton that she won t be happy about a clinton being in the white house  even though it would mark the first time in american history that a woman has been elected president of the united states   absolutely not   she said and instead of citing her policies or anything else  this trump supporter said she opposes clinton because of her gender   i don t believe there should be a woman president   she said and that means any woman  but why  i believe in christianity and i see that she does not stand for the christianity   she went on to say  does christianity say you can not have a female president   chariton followed up  it doesn t say   she replied   i just don t believe there should be woman leaders  i believe women should stand back from things like this  especially the white house  in other words  this trump supporter believes that a woman s place is being submissive to men just like conservative  christians  believe  the woman chariton interviewed doesn t even think women should be  speakers   translation  women should shut up and stay in the home and not have any say in political matters whatsoever later in the video  the same trump supporter reversed herself by saying that jesus might frown upon a woman being a leader and further stated her belief that donald trump feels the same way she went to say that she thinks the  women who have accused trump of sexually assaulting them were paid by the clinton foundation to do so  it s an accusation with zero evidence to support it  but there is lots of evidence suggesting that donald trump is a sexual predator here s the video via youtube to recap  donald trump thinks women are sex objects for men to conquer and do with as they please  his supporters don t give a damn about the victims he has harmed over the years  trump supporters have also been calling for the  amendment to be repealed  which would strip women of the right to vote  and now we have video of a trump supporter saying that no woman should ever be allowed to be a leader or speaker and yet republicans wonder why women continue to leave the gop featured image  screenshot
