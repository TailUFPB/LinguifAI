donald trump just can t help himself  the man who fancies himself the world s greatest deal maker thinks that if he can just talk some mafia like sense into the people investigating him  everything will be alright  what he doesn t realize is that when he does that with special counsel robert mueller  he s just stacking up another crime on top of all of those mueller is investigating him for according to trump s chief counsel  john dowd  trump has been sending messages of  appreciation  to mueller  he appreciates what bob mueller is doing   trump s chief counsel john dowd told usa today in an interview tuesday   he asked me to share that with him and that s what i ve done  trump s legal team has been in contact with mueller s office  and dowd says he has passed along the president s messages expressing  appreciation and greetings  to the special counsel  the president has sent messages back and forth   dowd said  declining to elaborate further source  usa todayhere s the video we can only guess what that  appreciation  consists of  perhaps the messages read something like   we really appreciate all that you ve done for this country  it would sure be a shame if anything were to happen to it  this so called appreciation seems rather odd  given that trump seems to be looking for a reason  any reason  to fire mueller  he s also regularly tweeted that mueller s investigation was a fraud and a witch hunt they made up a phony collusion with the russians story  found zero proof  so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story  nice  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    are witnessing the single greatest witch hunt in american political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people   maga  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    would actually be surprising if trump didn t try to influence mueller  he tried to influence former fbi head james comey  who he ended up firing remember  this is the man who loves to accuse bill clinton of trying to influence an investigation by talking to attorney general at the time  loretta lynch on a tarmac if trump is trying to influence mueller  this would be yet another violation of the law  but at this point  trump doesn t care  he s in so much legal hot water that pouring another cup in the tub isn t that big a deal  although  this one wouldn t take much investigation read more featured image of donald trump via pool getty images   featured image of robert mueller via alex wong getty images
