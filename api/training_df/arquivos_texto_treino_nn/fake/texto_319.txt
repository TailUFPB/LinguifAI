as the investigations into how russia meddled in our election escalate  facebook has turned records relating to ad buys from russian actors over to congress  facebook has found itself in the crosshairs of democrats and republicans alike because of this  and for other reasons   and mark zuckerberg is finally  finally wondering if maybe he should be taking a more active role in his own company why  because facebook sold over   pro trump and pro right wing ads to fake accounts run by russians and people with ties to russia  they turned those records over to the house and senate intelligence committees and to special counsel robert mueller  they re going to re evaluate the processes they use to review political ads  and they will supposedly  offer a higher standard of transparency  on those ads than what the law requires for radio  television and other platforms for many  it s too little  too late  though  trump was elected  a hostile foreign power helped him win  and the true scope of how russia used and manipulated facebook is still unknown  when they first came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news following trump s  win   zuckerberg s excuse was that they were a technology company  not a media company  the implication was that they couldn t be held responsible for any of that they re only now starting to come around to the truth  but the sad thing about this is that zuckerberg was warned about people misusing his platform to swing the election several times  in fact  none other than president obama himself literally pulled zuckerberg aside during a conference in peru to practically beg him to take the threat of fake news and disinformation seriously  obama told zuckerberg that  unless he actually paid attention  this would only be worse in four years but zuckerberg blew him off  he told obama that such messages weren t widespread on his platform  and that there wouldn t be an easy solution to it  like his pathetic excuse of being a tech company  zuckerberg shirked any and all responsibility for it  obama tried  zuckerberg didn t really seem to care discovering that another country would even dare to try and influence our elections should be a horrific epiphany for any american  it s true that neither zuckerberg  nor anyone else at facebook  or anyone really  could have sufficiently predicted that anything like this would happen  as recently as two to three years ago  most of us would have made fun of the conspiracy theorists making bizarre claims about shady and hostile foreign actors working to swing our elections to their favor  that s reality now  but early warnings like obama s seem to have slid right off zuckerberg s back  as he was more concerned with his product than with how his product was being misused russia weaponized facebook  and it s not over  facebook has its part to do and they need to get to it post haste  but another part may lie with washington  with our lawmakers  it may well be time to apply laws similar to those that govern political advertising elsewhere to social media  facebook hasn t yet provided many details about how they ll be transparent  especially given the fact that many of their political ads don t meet current legal definitions for political ads  they are  however  talking the talk  now they need to walk the walk  or be forced to do so under law featured image via justin sullivan getty images
