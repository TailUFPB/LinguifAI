the investigation into donald trump and his associates  possible collusion with the russian government to fix the  presidential election is moving at lightening speed now  with trump s openly admitting that he fired fbi director james comey due to the russia investigation   hell  he even admitted it to the russians   it looks like we may have a pretty clear case of obstruction of justice on the part of this alleged  president   and it seems that the white house counsel s office knows it  too according to cnn  the white house counsel s office  headed up by don mcgahn  is now actively consulting experts on what the impeachment of donald trump might look like  apparently  it is simply in the internal research phase at this time  and the  white house counsel thinks that the gop controlled congress will cushion the blows and cover for trump when pressed for comment on this development  the white house simply says   it s not true   that comes as no surprise  though  because that is what they always say when it comes to news stories that are unflattering to them or their orange leader   whether said stories are true or not i am personally more inclined to believe the reporting from cnn  which says the legal discussions are part of a broader internal effort to bolster the president s legal defense  which has become more complicated with the justice department s appointment of a special counsel to pursue the investigation into russian meddling in the  election in other words  they realize that the special counsel who has been appointed by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein in the form of former fbi director robert mueller will not be bullied  intimidated  or manipulated  they also realize what it would look like if trump just up and fired mueller the way he did james comey  so that particular trick is off the table at this point trump and his cronies are in deep shit  and their days are numbered  if we re lucky  the whole treasonous  corrupt bunch will be chucked out of our white house and hauled off to jail by the time this is all said and done featured image via win mcnamee getty images
