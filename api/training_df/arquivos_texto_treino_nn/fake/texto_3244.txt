the gop has long been a place that only held the interests of white men   but no republican has ever had the guts to admit this until now  yesterday  independent presidential candidate evan mcmullin   the candidate that many conservatives hoped would have beaten donald trump   sent out a series of tweets blatantly exposing the racism that exists within the republican party in his revealing tweetstorm  mcmullin condemned conservatives like carl paladino  who had recently made these offensive comments about first lady michelle obama  i d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of zimbabwe where she lives comfortable in a cave with maxie  the gorilla   paladino said twitter mcmullin also stated that many republicans were aware that there is a racism issue in the gop  but they are up against a majority of conservatives who are too invested in their white privilege to explore a better way forward twittertwitter mcmullin also made sure to throw trump under the bus for his racist  divisive rhetoric   as he has had a major role in how racism played out in our country over the last year twitter mcmullin s tweets were surely going to infuriate most republicans who insist that america is post racial instead of addressing their ignorance  but he also made someone else angry  former kkk leader and avid trump supporter david duke was among the first to respond to mcmullin and bash him for being so transparent twitter and of course  mcmullin s response couldn t have been more perfect  racism within the republican party has been a massive issue  and some gopers have made lesser attempts to point this out  years ago  south carolina senator lindsey graham said   we re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term   and yet  the gop has still ignored the fact that racism exists and continues to promote platforms that exclude minority voters  hopefully  mcmullin s brutal honesty will encourage the republican party to take a good hard look at itself featured image via george frey getty images
