sometimes you get the feeling that paul ryan has forgotten exactly who he works for  despite the fact that while campaigning  donald trump had his supporters chant  lock her up   in reference to hillary clinton using a private email server  ryan believes that republicans wouldn t call for the impeachment of a democratic president accused of actions similar president trump s while james comey confirmed in his hearing before a senate committee that he has no doubt that russia interfered in the  presidential election and that trump tried to influence a criminal investigation  in response to a question from a reporter at his weekly capitol press conference as to whether republicans would be in favor of impeachment at this point  ryan s answer was one of simple denial  no  i don t think we would  actually  i don t think that s at all the case   ryan said  despite belonging to a party that impeached a president over oral sex ryan admitted on msnbc the previous night that it was  obviously  inappropriate to ask for the then fbi director s loyalty  but claimed during the capitol press conference that he felt sympathy toward trump when it came to the topic of james comey telling the president that he personally wasn t under investigation  what i got out of that testimony is  we now know why he was so frustrated when the fbi director told him three times there s no investigation of him  yet that speculation was allowed to continue   said ryan maybe if the president wasn t so self centered and perhaps a little smarter he would ve reworded his question  because comey made the point clear during his testimony   the fbi has no individual file on donald trump  thus trump himself wasn t personally under investigation  his campaign  on the other hand  is and that consists of more people than just donald trump  and if trump became a person of interest and was directly under investigation  it would create a duty to publicly correct the record but since when has donald trump ever really thought about anybody besides donald trump featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
