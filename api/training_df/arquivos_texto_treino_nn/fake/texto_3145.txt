a california fast food ceo has seen the light  and now supports minimum wage increases after seeing for himself that they are good for business wetzel s pretzels  ceo  bill phelps  says he and his investors were concerned that minimum wage hikes passed by california lawmakers in   and again in   would negatively affect his business apparently  republican fear mongering over the minimum wage got to him like it gets to many other business owners who actually believe republicans are telling the truth for years  republicans have opposed raising the minimum wage because they claim doing so hurts businesses  they say it will force businesses to raise prices or lay off workers  but that s just simply not the case in reality  the exact opposite happened  as it turns out  the minimum wage hike created a boom in business because workers had more money in their pockets to spend on things like pretzels  i was shocked   phelps told kqed during an interview about how the law has impacted business owners   i was stunned by the business  in fact  wetzel s pretzels saw their profits increase significantly after each minimum wage increase  which now stands at    an hour in california  and the positive effect is being witnessed by franchise managers like mike jacobs  my overall sales were something like  percent ahead after the first minimum wage bump  and now they re about  percent ahead this year   jacobs said   it isn t because i m such a great manager or smart guy  but the buying public has more money in their pocket  here s the interview via kqed but donald trump  his labor secretary pick andrew puzder  and the republican controlled congress threaten all of that success trump has repeatedly flip flopped when it comes to the minimum wage  he has called for it to be eliminated at the federal level  which would let republicans drastically lower wages in states they control  he has said that he supports raising the minimum wage to   an hour  which would nearly match california  but trump s choice of fast food ceo andrew puzder as labor secretary makes it clear that he opposes minimum wage hikes  trump and puzder both wrongly believe that raising wages for american workers makes us unable to compete with foreign businesses but that s a load of bullshit that corporate vultures like trump spew as an excuse to manufacture their products in china and mexico instead of paying american workers a fair wage to manufacture the products in the united states the fact is that raising the minimum wage helps more people than it harms  but puzder opposes the minimum wage and will be in a position to viciously attack it along with overtime pay rules and rules that require breaks for workers so while business is booming in california because lawmakers there understand that paying workers more increases the amount of money people will pump back into the economy  trump and puzder will be working with republicans to sabotage the economy by killing the minimum wage laws that made us an economic powerhouse in the first place featured image via twitter
