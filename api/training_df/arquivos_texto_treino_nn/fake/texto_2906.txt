kellyanne conway tried to spin white house press secretary sean spicer s lies as  alternative facts  and got her ass handed to her by chuck todd the impromptu press briefing came two hours after trump whined about media estimates of the inauguration crowd size during a visit at the cia spicer lashed out at the media in an embarrassing display of how trump apparently intends to use press briefings over the next four years  yesterday  at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power and  as the president said  the transition and the balance of power from washington to the citizens of the united states  some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting   spicer claimed he then argued at length that  this was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration   period   both in person and around the globe  both claims are blatantly false as aerial photographs taken at the time of the inaugural address show that trump s crowd was significantly smaller than both of president obama s inaugurations in  and   trump also only drew  million viewers on television  which is  million less than president obama drew in  spicer also tried to blame the count on the secret service  but even they refuted spicer s claim that  magnetometers  prevented people from filling the national mall overall  spicer s attack on the media for accurately reporting on the size of the inauguration crowd was petty and a complete pile of bullshit but kellyanne conway defended spicer s lies on sunday during an interview on meet the press conway began by once again bragging about the election results  which happened nearly three months ago  in response to todd asking why trump would send spicer out to  utter a provable falsehood  conway played the victim and then threatened todd for asking questions she doesn t like  and then she said this  don t be so overly dramatic about it  chuck  they re saying it s a falsehood and our press secretary  sean spicer  gave alternative facts to that  yes  conway literally called the lies that trump ordered spicer to spew  alternative facts   and todd proceeded to hammer conway for it  wait a minute  alternative facts  four of the five facts that he uttered were just not true  alternative facts are not facts  they re falsehoods  you sent the press secretary out there to utter a falsehood on the smallest  pettiest thing  and i don t understand why you did it  conway then played the victim again and told todd that the media can t prove that spicer s numbers are wrong  i don t think you can prove those numbers one way or the other  you can laugh at me all you want  you are  and i think it s actually symbolic of the way we re treated by the press  i ll just ignore it  i m bigger than that  i m a kind and gracious person  here s the video via nbc but the media has already proven spicer s claims wrong  again  we have time stamped aerial photographs that prove trump s crowd size was sparse  in fact  at most  trump drew    which is smaller than numbers drawn by president obama in  and  even politifact rated spicer s temper tantrum as  pants on fire  spicer said   that was the largest audience to witness an inauguration  period  to support his claim  spicer offered a few pieces of misleading or inaccurate evidence he said that floor coverings highlighting empty spaces on the national mall were not used for previous inaugurations  but these were in place for obama s  inauguration he claimed metro ridership was higher for trump s inaugural than for obama s  inaugural  but he compared numbers for the morning of obama s inaugural to the whole day for trump s spicer suggested   attended trump s inauguration  while organizers said they expected   to    and trump himself estimated   million  all of those figures are less than the   million people who attended obama s  inaugural we rate spicer s claim pants on fire featured image via screenshot
