the fallout from what s turning out to be a thousand times worse than mitt romney s   percent  comment is spiraling out into the ether  those who are still loyal to trump are reaching ever further in a sad and sorry attempt to explain away his bragging about sexually harassing and assaulting nancy o dell back in  first up is sean hannity  who s so far up trump s ass it s hard to tell where he ends and trump begins  he ll say anything as long as it keeps him trump s good graces  even to the point where it causes problems with his colleagues at fox news  but he really went too far in excusing trump s behavior  king david had five hundred concubines for crying out loud   sean hannity  who i can t believe i m watching but there it is   ross douthat   douthatnyt  october     king david had  concubines so it s okay for a man who s trying to appeal to christians who abhor adultery supposedly to screw around  except it wasn t  screwing around   that implies it was mutual  clearly  hannity is laboring under the delusion that all the outcry is because trump cheated on melania  trying to rape a woman is not just  cheating   hannity s response is actually worse than ben carson s response  where his spokesperson ended his statement by saying  the flesh is weak  the chair of the washington state republican party is little better  blaming democrats for this washington state republican party chair susan hutchison defends trump comments  says they  were made when he was a democrat  bno news   bnonews  october    it s all okay because he wasn t a republican then  this would never happen now  except trump hasn t changed and won t change so it most definitely can happen now   maybe she s worried that this will reflect badly on the gop  it does   they chose this misogynistic stale beer fart for their standard bearer  saying it happened when he was a democrat  as if that makes it all okay  just looks even worse give it up  guys  your candidate is done featured image by drew angerer getty images
