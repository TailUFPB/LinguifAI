all hell broke loose on monday when the city of charlottesville held their first city council meeting since torch wielding white supremacists took over the small virginia town  leaving a counter protester dead in their wake  residents were more than ready to let the city council know just how they felt about the city allowing nazis to march through their streets  you had multiple opportunities to intervene and you did not intervene one time   we told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing   one man told the city council members at the meeting two protesters who were holding a sign that read  blood on your hands  climbed up on top of the dais  at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away  police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them  which prompted the crowd to chant shame  and  shut it down  vice mayor wes bellamy  was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters  who have every right to be pissed off that nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout charlottesville  the protesters called for mayor mike signer to resign from his position  chanting  signer must go  after making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town  they also demanded the removal of confederate monuments from charlottesville  the city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues watch more on the mayhem here  via wvir   wvir charlottesville  va news  sports and weatherfeatured image via video screen capture
