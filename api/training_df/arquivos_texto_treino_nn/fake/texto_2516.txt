kellyanne conway is definitely going to whine about this cnn may have reversed their ban on kellyanne conway  but if mika brzezinski has her way  she won t ever be able to spread her lies on morning joe again in the latest backlash against donald trump  the morning joe host declared that kellyanne conway will not be booked on the msnbc program ever again because or her constant lies in defense of her tyrannical boss  i know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show   brzezinski said on the air   i won t do it  i don t believe in fake news or information that is not true  that is   every time i ve ever seen her on television something is askew  off  or incorrect  indeed  kellyanne conway lies so much on every media outlet she appears on it s a wonder her nose hasn t grown like pinocchio s ever since she joined trump s campaign she has been whining about how the media covers trump and has insisted that her lies are the truth  fact checkers have had to work overtime to make sure the american people know that she is lying joe scarborough opined that conway lies because she isn t as close with trump as shes says she is  she s just saying things just to get in front of the tv to prove her relevance because behind the scenes she s not in these meetings and any reporter can ask anybody in that white house and they will say the same thing  she s not in these meetings  so why does the president allow her to keep going out and spreading false information  apparently  trump is hoping that if kellyanne conway keeping repeating the lies that americans will accept them as the truth but mika brzezinski refuses to take part in that effort  so she made it very clear that conway will not be invited on to morning joe as long as she is hosting  kellyanne conway does not need to text our show  as long as i m on it   brzezinski said   it s not happening here  here s the video via youtube conway has been an embarrassment since day one  her most recent embarrassments include peddling ivanka trump s product line in violation of federal ethics rules and making up a terrorist attack in bowling green  kentucky in defense of trump s travel ban  beyond that  she fumbles so much that we ve lost count the media should ban conway from appearing on all shows across the board  all she does is spread propaganda and false information  and if scarborough is right that she really doesn t know what s going on inside the white house then she shouldn t be considered a source worthy of interviewing featured image via screenshot
