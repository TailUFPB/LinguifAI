donald trump has no real platform other than be afraid  be very afraid  in trump s imaginary world  we are all about to be wiped out by terrorists  but not the gun toting right wing trump follower type  no  we re all about to be killed by green card holding people from countries from the middle east  but not actually from the countries that have ever attacked us  earlier in the week  trump s press secretary said this  i don t think it should be any surprise that the president  when it comes to rooting out radical islamic terrorism  which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on  he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his   keeping this country safe   spicer said source  opbif that s the case  then why the hell is the fbi terrorism task force worried about some peaceful protesters in the midwest the guardian reports that the trump administration has its fbi terrorism task force harassing people who are protesting the dakota access pipeline in north dakota  instead of working to protect the lives of  you know  the american people  instead  trump seems to be redefining the word terrorism to fit anyone who interferes with his corporate or personal agenda  in this case  it s people who might interfere with oil company profits  the idea that the government would attempt to construe this indigenous led non violent movement into some kind of domestic terrorism investigation is unfathomable to me   said lauren regan  a civil rights attorney who has provided legal support to demonstrators who were contacted by representatives of the fbi   it s outrageous  it s unwarranted   and it s unconstitutional  source  the guardiannot only is this about enriching his buddies  but there is apparently a direct conflict of interest trump  a former investor in energy transfer partners  the texas based firm behind the pipeline  took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project  on wednesday  workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the missouri river there is so much that s disconcerting about this  three days after a right wing trump supporting actual terrorist shot up a mosque in canada  trump removed any mention of right wing terrorism from the website  instead  he said he wanted to focus strictly on islamic terrorism  so where exactly do protesters in the midwest  many of whom are native american fit in  it s simple  they don t  trump is creating a new police state  we are either with him or against him and if we are against him  well  we too could be called terrorists  oh  and did i mention that he wants to torture terror suspects featured image via mario tama getty images
