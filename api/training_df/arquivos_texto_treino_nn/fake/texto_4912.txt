you d think we would no longer be surprised when an athlete or someone famous gets away with being in trouble  especially a white  male athlete  however  nope  this is still pretty damn awful after ryan lochte s drunken douchebaggery vandalizing a gas station in rio de janeiro  brazil  then subsequently lying about it  and then getting away with it  he s now likely about to join the abc hit show dancing with the stars according to us weekly  multiple sources tell us weekly that ryan lochte signed on for season  of dancing with the stars following his rio robbery scandal  in which he said he overexaggerated  his story about being robbed at gunpoint  apparently  an  insider  has said  doing dwts will be great for ryan s image  he will be able to show america that he s a good guy who made a mistake  he s still an olympic champion  he will be great on the show  a good guy who made a mistake   ha it must be nice to be able to get away with that sort of behavior and then given the opportunity to make money with a reality television celebrity dance competition show the cast for the upcoming season hasn t been announced but according to us   reps for the show never comment on casting rumors  but this season will likely include a few olympic athletes  and unfortunately  a scandal always intrigues the masses and people would likely tune in to see a douchebag act like a fool on the dance floor  who cares about principles  really lochte did apologize  saying  i want to apologize for my behavior last weekend   for not being more careful and candid in how i described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the olympics  so  basically  he s sorry he got caught  he also did a sorry  not sorry  because he added  it s traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country   with a language barrier   and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave you still lied about it  lochte  and you re a  year old man   grow up we  as a society  really need to stop rewarding those who do bad things  it perpetuates the dialogue  the very true dialogue  that some are above the law and not worth of condemnation  and in some cases  punishment hopefully  it s just a rumor that lochte with appear on the abc hit show  but if not  maybe they ll come to their senses and choose someone else who children can look up to featured photo by matt hazlett getty images
