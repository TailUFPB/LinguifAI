there s something about donald trump and his surrogates  they threaten information that s bound to doom their opponents and then  nothing perhaps the most obvious example was when donald trump insisted that he sent investigators to hawaii to examine president obama s birth certificate  he promised that his investigators  cannot believe what they re finding  apparently  they couldn t believe what they found because it was literally nothing  barack obama was born in hawaii and trump s promise of a surprise never panned out now we have tacit trump surrogate julian assange making promises of emails that will destroy hillary clinton  this was supposed to happen before the debate last monday night  it didn t  then  he promised that the emails would be released next week  they won t be  he s blaming  security  due to security concerns at the ecuadorian embassy  julian assange s balcony announcement on tues has been cancelled  per  wikileaks  jesse rodriguez   jesserodriguez  september    trump campaign is probably reeling  roger stone  the cnn pundit  who  until just last week  was double dipping on trump s payroll as well  tweeted this on saturday  is done   wikileaks   roger stone   rogerjstonejr  october    the security concerns are real or perhaps they re not  still  as someone on twitter pointed out  assange has other platforms  like video  why does he need that particular balcony to make his big  oh so damning announcement  jesserodriguez  wikileaks okay  i can understand the balcony announcement being cancelled but will julian make a video news announcement   susan reaney   ssreaney  october    far  assange s leaks have been pretty weak  the most damaging was during the primaries when he released emails damning to the dnc head  debbie wasserman schultz who trash talked bernie sanders  yes  there were a lot of problems with this leak  and yes  schultz did deserve to lose her job  but there was no evidence of any actual wrongdoing  it just looked bad while the dnc leaks showed that they were likely colluding with hillary clinton  assange s motives are much more suspect  it s likely that russia is behind the hacking  which would mean that trump is being assisted  in a scenario that would have made even richard nixon say  whoa   by foreign nationals  trump even asked russia to hack clinton  that may be treason featured image via carl court getty images
