conservatives are now committing sexual assault because they are emboldened by donald trump during the campaign  audio surfaced of trump telling billy bush that he likes to grab women  by the p ssy  without their consent  national outrage ensued and women had more proof that trump only treats women like objects well  a republican lawmaker in connecticut was arrested on wednesday for grabbing a woman by the genitals in the greenwich town hall christopher von keyserling has been serving on the greenwich representative town meeting board since   but when the  year old crossed paths with a woman in the hallway and engaged in a political debate  he told her  i love this new world  i no longer have to be politically correct  and then grabbed her between the legs without her consent  it would be your word against mine and nobody will believe you   keyserling told the woman in an effort to scare her from reporting the incident to police so keyserling must have been shocked when law enforcement arrested him at work and charged him with fourth degree sexual assault keyserling s lawyer  phil russell  likely another creepy guy who thinks sexual assault is like flirting  defended his client by claiming the act was nothing more than a  playful gesture   even though police have video footage of the crime that corroborated the woman s story  in almost  years of practicing law in this town  i would say mr  von keyserling is the one person i would never suspect of having any inappropriate sexual predilections   russell claimed   there was a playful gesture  in front of witnesses  it was too trivial to be considered anything of significance  to call it a sexual assault is not based in reality  let s make this clear  keyserling s attorney is literally saying that grabbing a woman by the genitals is not sexual assault  but simply a trivial playful gesture that women should find flattering this  ladies and gentlemen  is how rape culture continues to be a plague in our country  and donald trump is only making it worse featured image  ty wright getty images
