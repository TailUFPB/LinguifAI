donald trump is apparently so upset about his inauguration s turnout  and the negative press attention afterward  that he s literally used his power as president to declare it a historic day   four days after it happened using the power of the executive order  donald trump has arrogantly designated january    as the  national day of patriotic devotion  no  this isn t a joke  this is reality  and no  this isn t north korea  this is the united states of america the order reads  in part  now  therefore  i donald j  trump  president of the united states of america  by virtue of the authority vested in me by the constitution and the laws of the united states  do hereby proclaim january     as national day of patriotic devotion  in order to strengthen our bonds to each other and to our country   and to renew the duties of government to the people while millions of women march for equality  the white house press secretary lies to the american people  and the unavoidable conflicts of interests and russian secrets sow doubt in american minds  trump decides to make his  special day  a national holiday  for the people  this is what american politics has come to i m young enough to remember when republicans thought president obama was arrogant and narcissistic for putting arugula on his hamburger but trump wants to proclaim a day all for himself and his glory  after losing the popular vote by  million   not a peep from the right imagine the outcry from the republicans and fox news if president obama had even referred to his inauguration day as such   to say nothing of what they d do if he d ordered it remembering that trump did indeed lose the popular vote by  million  it would seem inappropriate to declare his inauguration a national day of  devotion  no one devoted themselves to trump  no one devoted themselves to mike pence  and no one devoted themselves to the government  want to know why  the government devotes itself to the people  not vice versa trump has turned the office of the presidency into a spectacle showboat of admiration for himself  woe to all the pundits and those in the media who promised and hoped for a pivot  and an even bigger woe to all those who voted for him thinking the same thing move over kim jong un  there s a new  dear leader  amongst us featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
