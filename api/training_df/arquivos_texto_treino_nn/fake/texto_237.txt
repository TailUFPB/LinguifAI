when deandre harris was beaten by a mix of white supremacist trump supporters  nazi trump supporters  racist trump supporters  and trump supporters who don t subscribe to any particular single white power group  at a nazi rally in charlottesville  his life was changed forever not only was this young man forced to deal with the incredibly shitty reality that white people may at any moment turn on him like rabid dogs  but the harassment kept coming while police dragged their feet in arresting his attackers  waiting only until social media had identified the majority and had given them no choice in the matter  harris and his family continued to receive death threats from donald trump s  very fine people  at the same time  the nazis worked round the clock to  painstakingly compile the video evidence  that ultimately led to harris  arrest   yes  harris was arrested  wcpo reports  deandre harris  a black man whose brutal beating at the hands of charlottesville white supremacists was captured on video  is now wanted on charges of unlawful wounding in connection to the aug   incident a magistrate  not the police department  issued the warrant  although a news release said police officers had verified other video that led to the arrest  harris is accused of attacking a man in the group that beat him harris  attorney  lee merritt  who called the charge a  clearly retaliatory  effort from white supremacists after harris used social media to identify suspects in the beating  said his client would turn himself in within  hours journalist chuck modi posted video of the attack  which took place in a parking garage near the university of virginia campus  on twitter  in the clip  white supremacist marchers   some in white polos  some in riot gear   beat harris with signs and poles while he struggles to stand in case you somehow forgot what happened  here is a refresher this video is horrifying fight broke out  nazis beat black kid w sticks at end  i kick one in back  help   he runs after me  kid is safe but bloody  charlottesville pic twitter com   chuckmodi     august     the nazis are celebrating this new turn of events that they apparently helped orchestrate i would like to thank everyone who helped us with the deandre harris case particularly those who painstakingly compiled the video evidence  hunter wallace   occdissent  october    see  since they have gotten harris charged with a crime  they can move on to their endgame   which is apparently getting harris  gofundme shut down we need to stop his go fund me   i ve reported it long ago https   t co   joni job   jjtalking  october    reported the campaign too   chris    fireychris  october    also shared his thoughts on heather heyer  the woman who was run down by a nazi at the same rally did you know heather heyer was morbidly obese and died of a heart attack  probably not because that story didn t fit the narrative either https   t co   hunter wallace   occdissent  october     evidence  the nazis collected is  seconds of video that appears to show harris hit a nazi who was trying to jab another protester with a pole  while one would normally assume that acting in defense of another would be something law enforcement would understand  this is the same law enforcement that allowed a nazi to try to shoot someone and walk away while they watched of course they were going to charge harris with whatever they could  to do otherwise would conflict with the traditionally terrible response charlottesville has had to nazis marching in the f cking street  attacking people  and even committing murder daniel borden  one of the numerous attackers  has also been arrested in connection with the brutal gang assault  no one else has been charged aside from harris   the victim featured image via screengrab
