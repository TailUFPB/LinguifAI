on saturday night  donald trump once again casually threatened nuclear war against the country of north korea  the last time he did that  he came back with an arguably weak package of sanctions  which penalized only individuals doing business with the dictatorship  this time  snowflake trump was triggered by north korea s foreign minister speaking at the un ri yong ho told the assembly that the week s exchange of insults between trump and his apparent arch nemesis kim jong un made our rocket s visit to the entire us mainland inevitable all the more   apparently threatening to aim north korean missiles directly at the united states  the isolated peninsular nation  by all accounts  is years away from developing technology that will actually reach us trump  fired  back just heard foreign minister of north korea speak at u n  if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man  they won t be around much longer   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  september    has now added an adjective to his new nickname for kim  further trumpifying  rocket man  into what he surely believes is a dagger through the heart of the  year old dictator  they won t be around   of course  includes the  million inhabitants of north korea  as even the smallest of our nuclear weapons would cause inconceivable damage to the geographically insignificant country trump is undoubtedly attempting to deflect some attention away from his weekend misadventures in alabama  which earned him the scorn of every sports fan in america over his racist call for nfl owners to fire players who kneel during the national anthem   unpatriotic   he calls it  i don t think donald trump knows what patriotism is it certainly isn t making america look like a global bully that takes offense at the most meaningless of statements from a hostile foreign minister featured image via spencer platt getty images
