terrified and unable to accept that he s destroyed almost all chances of winning this election  republican nominee donald trump is still whining that everything is rigged   from claims of media bias  sabotaged debate microphones  dishonest polls  and voter fraud  trump isn t letting it go  and even his own party isn t willing to support him on his ridiculous claims anymore  earlier monday  trump tweeted  of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day  why do republican leaders deny what is going on  so naive  well  someone came forward to put trump s lies to rest once and for all  election law expert rick hasen finally had enough of trump s idiocy and issued some brutal fact checking on twitter  hasen was the perfect person to come forward and annihilate trump   he s spent his career studying voter fraud  and was more than qualified to drop this brilliant truth bomb on unsuspecting trump  in an epic tweetstorm  hasen ripped trump a new one and proved that trump s fear mongering about voter fraud has been taken way out of proportion and is a blatant exaggeration twittertwittertwittertwittertwitterand these are only a few of the tweets of hasen slamming trump  you can see the full sh tshow here  hasen didn t stop with a social media rant  either   he wrotehasen didn t stop with a social media rant  either   he wrote a scathing op ed on talking points memo  claims of voter fraud are often exaggerated by orders of magnitude  consider the claims about non citizen voting  matt drudge recently had a headline stating   report     illegal voters in virginia   and dan scavino  jr  tweeted   terrible  we know who the    illegal aliens are not voting for  a fixed presidential election in the making  will we ever know      but if you look at the underlying report  they have identified only  actual non citizen voters in virginia over the last  years  no doubt there are some more  as not all the counties have responded yet  but it is not   plus non citizens voting in va    in the  jurisdictions that provided us with lists of aliens recently removed from their voter rolls  we discovered that  non citizens had cast a total of  votes between  and   the most alien votes were cast in  followed by   the year president obama was elected to his first term    emphasis omitted    don t believe all the hype  non citizen voting is a real  but pretty small  problem  because the penalties are high and the payoff low   unfortunately  we know trump isn t going to shut up because he only gets louder after being proven wrong  thank goodness we only have to tolerate a few more weeks of him featured image via jeff swensen   getty images
