note to conservatives who want to pretend to be journalists  be sure that where you get your information is not a satirical site  or you ll be humiliated like this idiot this is especially true if you decide to attack a professional scientist  because if you haven t done your research properly you can rest assured they will discover that fact when they research your claims in this case  that s exactly what popular scientist neil degrasse tyson did to right wing radio host neal larson this week after the conservative mouthpiece repeated the charge that tyson  mocked  a little girl for wanting to live on jupiter  a planet where no human could survive the alleged  mocking  supposedly took place in front of a crowd and on twitter  larson crowed in the vicious hit job on tyson and his character in an op ed criticizing tyson for simply inserting math into the olympic medal count  the scientist pointed out that while america earned more medals than hungary  hungary is actually beating us when we adjust to account for total population  then the victory for medals to population ratio goes to hungary larson believes this is tyson attacking america when in reality he was only stating a mathematical fact that also happenes to be interesting larson went on to whine about tyson because he constantly calls out conservatives for getting science wrong  he also attempted to assassinate tyson s character by using the following tale as an example  i ve listened to neil degrasse tyson before  and what i observe is a smart guy who consistently enjoys asserting his intellectual supremacy over others more than he actually likes educating  in one of his worse moments  tyson mocked a  year old girl who suggested she d like to live on jupiter  he ridiculed her in the midst of a crowd  then later  several times  on twitter  that told me everything i needed to know about neil degrasse tyson for that moment he was just a horse s astrophysicist  the only problem is that the story never actually happened  and tyson schooled larson for it  the  incident  with a  old girl never happened   tyson responded and he s right  as it turns out  the story relayed by larson is complete satire  it looks to be a hoax   tyson continued   no such tweets ever existed on november     or on any other day  so you abrogated your journalistic integrity by not verifying what you read in somebody else s article  before using it as a foundational pillar in yours  in short  larson just got lit up by tyson and those pesky things called facts that conservatives are allergic to for some reason featured image via screen capture
