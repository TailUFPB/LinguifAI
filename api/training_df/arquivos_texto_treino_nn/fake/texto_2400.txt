in yet another example of the rash of hate crimes that has accompanied donald trump s presidency  a  year old man was arrested thursday night after opening fire in a crowded bar  his reason  some folks were a little too  dark  for his taste adam purinton was arrested thursday just after midnight at an applebee s in missouri after he bragged to a bartender that he had shot someone  he mentioned he had been involved in a shooting and we went out there and picked him up   assistant clinton police chief sonny lynch said  explaining that the restaurant s bartender had contacted law enforcement  earlier in the night  purinton was drinking at austin s bar and grill in olathe  kansas  according to a bartender he began using  racial sluts  before drawing his weapon and opening fire on srinivas kuchibhotla and alok madasanim  two regulars at the bar who work as engineers at gps manufacturer garmin as well as ian grillot  a random bar patron who heroically stepped in to help the men  from what i understand when he was throwing racial slurs at the two gentlemen  kuchibhotla and madasani   ian  grillot  stood up for them   bartender garret bohnen says   we re all proud of him   according to other witnesses  pruinton yelled  get out of my country  before opening fire  grillot went above and beyond in defending the two victims of this vicious attack  the independent reports  grillot said in an interview from his hospital bed that when the shooting broke out  he hid until nine shots had been fired and he thought the suspect s gun magazine was empty  i got up and proceeded to chase him down  try to subdue him   grillot said in a video from the university of kansas health system posted on the star website   i got behind him and he turned around and fired a round at me  grillot said that the bullet went through his hand and into his chest  just missing a major artery  it s not about where he  victim  was from or his ethnicity   grillot said   we re all humans  so i just did what was right to do  kuchibhotla died at an area hospital and madasani and grillot were taken in for treatment  they are in stable condition   unlike the man who committed this hate crime and his ideological clones  while it seems pretty clear that this is a hate crime  fbi special agent eric jackson explains that it s too early to make that determination  this was a violent crime and we want the best prosecution that relates to this because there are victims of this crime and we want the community to know that   he says   we re looking to make sure that the individual involved in this is held accountable for his actions  unfortunately  we can expect to see more and more of this as trump continues to amp up the anti immigrant rhetoric  recently  it was made public that the donald intends to remove neo nazis and other white supremacists from the  countering violent extremism program  which will focus solely on muslims  not white almost certainly christian terrorists like purinton this is one act of terrorism that trump will not mention featured image via screengrab
