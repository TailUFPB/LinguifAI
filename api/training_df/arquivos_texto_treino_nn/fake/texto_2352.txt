breaking news out of trump s white house indicates that marijuana use may have contributed to the violent events at bowling green and perhaps even in sweden at least  in the opinion of attorney general jeff sessions  that could be the case  despite repeated promises by trump on the campaign trail to leave states alone that have legalized recreational cannabis  the trump administration appears to be gearing up to take aim at the legal marijuana industry  on monday  he told reporters at the justice department that  real violence  is connected to cannabis use sessions further said that experts have told him there is  more violence around marijuana   than one would think  you can t sue somebody for a drug debt   sessions said  on monday   the only way to get your money is through strong arm tactics  and violence tends to follow that   business insider  i don t think america is going to be a better place when people of all ages  and particularly young people  are smoking pot   sessions said   i believe it s an unhealthy practice  and current levels of thc in marijuana are very high compared to what they were a few years ago  and we re seeing real violence around that  if he was just a tiny bit smarter  he d realize he s actually arguing in favor of legalization  i live in portland  oregon  here s a couple of notes about the recreational dispensary located a convenient four blocks from my house   first  they are a small business  small businesses aren t in the habit of fronting people inventory  you typically pay for what you re purchasing  and leave  the second point here is going to require a bit of imagination let s imagine that they have fronted me untold amounts of cannabis  and i haven t paid  so they send a strongman to my house to get the money and i just call the cops  because weed is legal  i m not incriminating myself by calling  and using  strong arm tactics  to get money you are owed is illegal  federal courts aren t going to treat it as a legitimate product  sure  but the answer to that is complete legalization  not wasting millions of dollars in pointless enforcement and court battles with individual states he said some other genuinely dumb shit as well sessions then appeared to criticize a column the washington post published tuesday by sam kamin  professor of marijuana law and policy at the university of denver  in the op ed  kamin argues that the opioid crisis is  a reason to expand access to marijuana rather than to contract it   a  study from columbia university s mailman school of public health found  adverse consequences of opioid use  decreased over time in states where marijuana is legalized as individuals substituted marijuana for opioids to treat pain but sessions scoffed at kamin s reasoning  give me a break   sessions said   this is the kind of argument that has been out there   almost a desperate attempt to defend the harmlessness of marijuana or even benefits  i doubt that s true  maybe science will prove me wrong    my best view is that we don t need to be legalizing marijuana  well  sessions  science has  indeed  proved you wrong  your  best view  is both behind the times and demonstrably false  there is so much information out there demonstrating the benefits of cannabis in combating the opiate epidemic and treating chronic pain that if you re the attorney general  and ignorant of it  it s by choice it s time for the failed war on drugs to draw to a close  all prohibition of cannabis accomplishes is driving people who self medicate or are prescribed cannabis for chronic pain to use prescription opiates instead  finances the cartels and fuels violence  and makes the fox news crowd happy  the  gateway drug  shtick is old and false  sean spicer and jeff sessions think that increased recreational use of cannabis has led to the opiate epidemic  rather than excessive and improper prescriptions  as evidence shows   this is so wrong and out of touch that it shows they have no interest in  actually helping or rehabilitating heroin and oxy addicts   they are only interested in using them as a political prop that justifies attacking rights they don t believe people should have  so much for  small government   eh featured image via zach gibson getty images
