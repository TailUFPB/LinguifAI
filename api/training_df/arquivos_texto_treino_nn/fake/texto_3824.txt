since republicans had such a problem with president obama going on vacation and playing golf  they ll be totally opposed to donald trump doing even more of both  right because while president obama and his family moved into the white house and took less vacation time than any republican president in the last  years  it looks like trump wants to spend much of his term playing golf or relaxing at his gold plated apartment in trump tower according to the new york times mr  trump  a homebody who often flew several hours late at night during the campaign so he could wake up in his own bed in trump tower  is talking with his advisers about how many nights a week he will spend in the white house  he has told them he would like to do what he is used to  which is spending time in new york when he can the questions reflect what mr  trump s advisers described as the president elect s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically  they say that mr  trump  who was shocked when he won the election  might spend most of the week in washington  much like members of congress  and return to trump tower or his golf course in bedminster  n j   or his mar a lago estate in palm beach on weekends in other words  trump isn t interested in being president full time  he wants to vacation and golf  and if he gets the schedule he wants  he would end up spending  days away from washington over the course of four years  far more days than the  days president obama spent on vacation in eight years and that s not even counting official vacations trump will likely take furthermore  if trump plays one round of golf every weekend  he will play more golf in two years than president obama played during his whole first term so while trump is away  it s likely the responsibility of governing will be left to his advisers and cabinet members if donald trump is serious about governing  he should be in washington full time  also  he should never take a vacation or play a single round of golf during his term because for years  trump and his supporters bitched every time president obama left the white house for just about any little thing  and they definitely despised him for playing golf  doing either of these things would make trump a hypocrite  especially since he could end up doing more of it over four years than obama did in eight featured image  ian macnicol getty images
