we hear a lot from republicans about how they re going to repeal the  job killing    healthcare killing   big government law unofficially called obamacare  these unsung heroes of the nation  almost all of them representing red state america  are going to free us and their states from the shackles of socialized medicine   or so they say should republicans get their way  they will absolutely decimate their states  economies according to the economic policy institute  an american think tank in washington  d c  across the country    million people would lose their health insurance if the affordable care act were repealed more than doubling the number of people without health insurance  and   million jobs would be lost not just in health care but across the board so not only will america overall be taken back to the dark ages of pre obamacare  red states will be hit the hardest  in terms of the increase in the uninsured rate per state  of the top  that will be hit hardest   are red states that voted for donald trump so how much will the uninsured rate increase with an obamacare repeal  here s the list  top   for trump states the blue states that would be most affected by the repeal would be massachusetts  new hampshire  illinois  oregon  and washington if republicans think their town hall events are bad now  just wait until they see what the summer of  will produce  democrats got the brunt of it in   now it s time for the gop to reap what they ve sown leaked audio from the republican retreat in philadelphia showed that many gopers were divided on whether to repeal or reform obamacare  many expressed concern with how their constituents would react if a full repeal were put in place  at the retreat  one republican  tom macarthur of new jersey  yelled  we re telling those people that we re not going to pull the rug out from under them  and if we do this too fast  we are in fact going to pull the rug out from under them  rep  virginia foxx chastised macarthur and other weary republicans as  weak kneed  rep  macarthur is correct in his fears  if obamacare is repealed  and people lose their health insurance  republicans are going to be cast as the enemy for pulling the rug out  and as the economic policy institute showed  there are a lot of red state americans who will be affected given trump s immense unpopularity  an obamacare repeal would almost certainly hand the democrats a house and senate majority in  featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
