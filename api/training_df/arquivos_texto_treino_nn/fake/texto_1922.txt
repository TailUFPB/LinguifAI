hearing about violence at trump s rallies was a regular occurrence during his  campaign and that violence was often brought on by trump himself at a rally back in march of   trump yelled   get  em out of here   referencing the peaceful protesters in the crowd  which then prompted his supporters to physically attack them  the protesters who were attacked brought suit against trump and it looks like he s finally going to have to pay for it   in more ways than one trump s lawyers have been using the free speech defense  but a federal judge isn t buying it  citing case law from  s student protests and race riots  judge david hale of kentucky  rejected motions to dismiss the case and said that trump did indeed cite violence at his rally  it is plausible that trump s direction to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force  unlike the statements at issue in the cases cited by the trump defendants   get  em out of here  is stated in the imperative  it was an order  an instruction  a command  trump craves the sound of people cheering him on  and no doubt probably enjoyed seeing his supporters attack people who were brave enough to show up and stand against him  so it wasn t surprising when trump denied wrongdoing of any sort and blamed it all on the  bad dudes  who were protesting  in fact  that phrase became a regular mantra for trump  we have some protesters who are bad dudes   he said  they have done bad things  and they are really dangerous and get in there and start hitting people  and we had a couple big  strong  powerful guys doing damage to people    it s usually the police  the municipal government because i don t have guards all over these stadiums  i mean  we fill up stadiums  the suit against trump also names the three individuals responsible for the attacks  one of whom  matthew heimbach  is a leader of the white supremacist group traditional youth network from paoli  indiana  which will probably make it that much worse for trump  watching him try to squirm his way out of this one should be really fun featured image via getty sarah rice
