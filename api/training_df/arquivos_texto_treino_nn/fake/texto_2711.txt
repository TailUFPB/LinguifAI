donald trump was once a democrat  but that s no more  donald trump was once pro choice  but not now  donald trump didn t used to hate lgbt people but that was before he ran as a republican  there is one enduring trait that has remained consistent for as long as america has known donald trump  though  he is a narcissist  when his ego and his vanity are threatened  he does something about it despite this  on saturday  trump promoted senior advisor  former breitbart head and neo nazi  steve bannan to head the national security council  making him arguably the most powerful man in washington  many are now calling bannon the  de facto president  and the actual president but a new executive order  politicizing the process for national security decisions  suggests mr  bannon is positioning himself not merely as a svengali but as the de facto president in that new order  issued on saturday  mr  trump took the unprecedented step of naming mr  bannon to the national security council  along with the secretaries of state and defense and certain other top officials  president george w  bush s last chief of staff  joshua bolten  was so concerned about separating politics from national security that he barred mr  rove  mr  bush s political adviser  from n s c  meetings  to the annoyance of experienced foreign policy aides  david axelrod  president barack obama s political adviser  sat in on some n s c  meetings  but he was not a permanent member of the council source  new york timesthe new york times wasn t the only paper saying that steve bannon was now the most powerful man in the country gq magazine carried an article that states   in case it wasn t clear yet  steve bannon is our president  politico ran with  the man behind trump  still steve bannon   and foreign policy writes about  president bannon s hugely destructive first week in office  this is a good thing  trump wears his achilles heel on his poorly tailored sleeve  it s hard to imagine that he s the great deal maker he claims when it s so clear that he can be led by no more than his ego  you stroke trump s ego  you re solid  you threaten it  you re the enemy  he s fired people who disagree with him  he hung up on the prime minister of australia   australia  since the election  trump has bragged about his electoral victory  calling it a landslide  it wasn t  he s battled back and forth over the obvious fact that his inauguration was an attendance disaster if we want to get rid of the neo nazi that s secretly running the white house  it s actually pretty easy  we need to keep writing and sharing articles like this  our biggest weapon against trump is to appeal to his ego  trump can t even resist obsessing about an unflattering saturday night live parody   something that every president since gerald ford has had to endure  there s no way in hell he will put up with being demoted to second in charge in washington  so we need to keep telling him that that s exactly what he is  bannon will be gone within a month featured image via win mcnamee getty images
