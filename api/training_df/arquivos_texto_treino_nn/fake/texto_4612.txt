rex huppke  of the chicago tribune  is not exactly known for his formality or reverence toward pretty much anything  he also voices a lot of support for hillary clinton in his columns  there are probably a lot of readers who take him to task for that  but one apparently stood out to him  and he just had to highlight it on twitter this person asked   rex  are you being paid by the clinton crime family foundation  here s huppke s answer reader email   rex  are you being paid by the clinton crime family foundation  my response  pic twitter com   rex huppke   rexhuppke  september     that s pretty much all of the right s major conspiracy theories and fear filled talking points right there  he did forget the one where hillary and obama are coming to take everyone s guns  but that can be overlooked  the  hail hydra   finishes this answer off with a nice  neat little bow there s nothing the hillary haters love more than a good conspiracy theory  can t find solid evidence that she s a criminal  it s because she and her husband have paid everyone off  she s coughing and has pneumonia  she s covering up a brain tumor  brain damage and parkinson s  if she s not outright dead and has a body double doing her appearances for her  people disappear out of the public eye  obviously  hillary had them murdered she s close to her assistant  huma abedin  so they must be secret lesbian lovers  and of course  the conspiracy mongers are still benghazhingly benghaziing their benghazist benghazis  which spawned the entire email scandal  which is another conspiracy theory of its own a lot of this is being fueled by donald trump himself  because he actually encourages this type of thinking among his loyal subjects  he loves conspiracy theories too   he s the one who put the birther movement into the spotlight  he also claimed that ted cruz s father may have helped assassinate john f  kennedy  one of his favorite phrases seems to be   something s going on   and he declares loudly that we must find out what it is  which adds fuel to the fire while it s not clear whether huppke responded to a trumpkin or a left wing hillary hater  the truth is that the line between the two is increasingly blurred  huppke replied to that conspiracy filled question in the only way that works featured image via twitter
