if there is one political ideology that every american should despise  it s nazism  but conservatives don t seem to mind it one bit on inauguration day last month  nazi richard spencer got punched in the face by a protester during an interview spencer  along with others of his ilk  support donald trump and hail his presidency as a new era of white nationalism where fascism and racism flourish it s no secret  of course  conservatives have been moving further to the extreme right for decades and the end of that side of the political spectrum is nazism rather than run away from nazism and people like spencer who advocate in favor of it  conservatives decided to give spencer credentials to attend their annual cpac conference spencer attended on thursday  and he had a lot to say to reporters as supporters flocked to him like moths to a flame when asked how he feels about being at cpac  spencer said he  feels welcome  richard spencer  at cpac   i feel very welcome here  nobody s punching me yet   travis waldron   traviswaldron  february    then praised donald trump for being a supporter of white nationalist causes richard spencer tells reporters at  cpac he thinks trump represents the alt right more than conservatives   pic twitter com   kira lerner   kiralerner  february    organizer matt schlapp apparently had no problem with spencer attending the conference despite claiming to disagree with him just talked to cpac organizer matt schlapp  said he didn t endorse richard spencer s ideas but won t kick him out of the conference   fake matt pearce   mattdpearce  february    then it appears someone felt that spencer was getting too much adulation at cpac so they had him escorted out by security here s the video via youtube richard spencer should never have been approved to get credentials to cpac in the first place  especially if conservatives really don t agree with nazism but the fact that spencer was allowed to attend makes it pretty clear that conservatives are more okay with nazis than they would like us to believe  and that s an insult to the millions of americans who fought to stop the nazis and their evil agenda during world war ii featured image via youtube
