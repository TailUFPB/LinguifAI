on top of all the problems this country faces under a donald trump administration  anti vaxxers are hoping he ll make widespread disease great again anti vaccination advocates literally believe that vaccines are harmful to children despite an avalanche of scientific research and the fact that we have nearly eradicated many viruses that used to kill thousands of people as proof to the contrary leading anti vaxxer andrew wakefield  the moron who made parents panic by claiming to link vaccines to autism  got to meet with trump to spew the same fraudulent claims that cost him his medical license  for the first time in a long time  i feel very positive about this  because donald trump is not beholden to the pharmaceutical industry   wakefield said   he didn t rely upon  to get him elected  and he s a man who seems to speak his mind and act accordingly  so we shall see  now americans have to fear a world where anyone around them could be carrying a disease that could have been easily prevented by a harmless vaccine because trump is listening to a crackpot thus far  the anti vaxxer movement has caused outbreaks of whooping cough  rubella  and measles  just to name a few  measles had been declared eradicated in   but after many parents had a collective freak out they stopped vaccinating their damn kids and opened the door for measles and other diseases to return  measles kicked that door down in  when the disease struck many who were unvaccinated after a visitor from another country carried it and spread it to others at disneyland at the height of the outbreak  fox medical expert dr  marc siegel blasted anti vaxxers and defended vaccines as necessary for the public health  let me be clear on this  i see no debate whatsoever   siegel said   period  this is the greatest vaccine that has ever been created in the history of vaccines  you know we stamped out measles in the united states in   it was incredible because measles is the most contagious virus known to man  if you had measles there would be a  percent chance that i would get it by sitting next to you if i weren t vaccinated  it s so much more contagious than the flu  we were talking about ebola  this is a million times more contagious than ebola  your celebrities did not go to medical school  in california  there s   parents that are taking a personal belief exemption  allowing their kids to go to school without that second mmr vaccine  you need one after you re  year old  and then you need one again before you re  or  years old  i think these parents are putting children at risk in schools  i think schools should consider not allowing these kids in  make them be homeschooled if they don t have this vaccine  why should my child be a risk because your child isn t vaccinated  later that year  the first american in over a decade died after contracting measles and if donald trump aids anti vaxxers by changing federal policy  he will become a direct threat to the public health as it becomes more likely that diseases once considered eradicated in this country thanks to vaccines return with a deadly vengeance all because we let a bunch of stupid people who reject science influence policy featured image  mnn
