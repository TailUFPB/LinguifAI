on tuesday  our resident manchurian couch potato met with the head of chicago s fraternal order of police to talk about the  carnage   as trump calls it  in the city that prompted trump to  send in the feds  in january  sadly  our police are often prevented from doing their jobs   trump told union officials at the meeting   in too many of our communities  violent crime is on the rise  these are painful realities that many in washington don t want to talk about  we have seen it all over  trump thanked the union president dean angelo for the support he and the union gave during the campaign and  as is custom  took a moment to tell them how much cops love him  describing the numbers in his favor among law enforcement as  extremely lopsided  then  he said something that would be taken as a joke when uttered by most people   but not by someone who installs people in various government offices to serve as loyalty police  i m just trying to figure out the few people who voted the other way  who are they  who are they  find out who they are  please  and let us know  the room filled with uncertain  muffled  uneasy laughter was trump joking  who knows  after all  ever since he came to power he has treated the act of firing and threatening anyone who disagrees with him as a regular  everyday activity watch this extremely uncomfortable moment below featured image via chicago tribune
