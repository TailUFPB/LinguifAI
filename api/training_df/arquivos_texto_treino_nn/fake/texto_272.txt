clearly  donald trump intends to do absolutely nothing to prevent future mass shootings the las vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in american history  fifty people are dead and over  are wounded after a gunman used a machine gun to mow people down from his hotel room at mandalay bay as   concertgoers fled for their lives predictably  the national rifle association has remained silent and republicans like trump are only offering  thoughts and prayers  instead of taking meaningful action trump fumbled his first response to the shooting by offering his  warmest condolences  on twitter  of course  we all know that if the shooter were brown with a muslim sounding name trump would be calling this an act of terror and would be once again calling for a muslim ban but this shooter was an old white guy who used an assault rifle so the terrorism label won t be used and there will be no call for a gun ban by trump and that was made further clear by trump s remarks to the nation this morning as he suggested that the only real way to stop these violent acts is to unite in prayer for peace  in moments of tragedy and horror  america comes together as one  and it always has  we call upon the bonds that unite us  our faith  our family  and our shared values  we call upon the bonds of citizenship  the ties of community  and the comfort of our common humanity  our unity cannot be shattered by evil  our bonds cannot be broken by violence  and though we feel such great anger  at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens  it is our love that defines us today  and always will  forever we pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace  and we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear  here s the video of trump s full remarks via youtube not once did trump call this an act of terrorism  not once did trump mention the need for gun control  he said the word  pray  an insufferable amount of times as if prayer is the solution to gun violence  the only thing he offered these victims was prayers and a reference to the bible and god that s unacceptable  it s time for republicans to acknowledge that white men commit acts of terror and it s time for them to ignore the nra and do something to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring this was an opportunity for trump to actually do something courageous in response to tragedy  he failed spectacularly as usual  thoughts  prayers  and god will not prevent mass shootings  we need gun control measures now more than ever and a renewed focus on stopping home grown domestic terrorists  the american people need real action  not false platitudes featured image  screenshot
