a major indicator that donald trump s campaign might be over just occurred  the republican national committee has put a temporary halt on their program aimed at getting trump into the white house  according to an email obtained by politico  at least one top vendor in what is called the  victory  program and one official at the rnc are named in the email s cc line   politico reports  in an email from the rnc to a victory program mail vendor  with the subject line  hold on all projects   the committee asked the vendor to  put a hold  on mail production    please put a hold stop on all mail projects right now  if something is in production or print it needs to stop  will update you when to proceed   lauren toomey  a staffer in the rnc s political department  wrote in an email that was obtained by politico  officials with the rnc have yet to release a statement on the matter this  of course  comes after an audio recording was released where trump can be heard talking about violently groping women  trump has a long record of using hateful misogynistic language towards women  after hearing trump s remarks in the recording  several republicans in congress have called for trump to drop out of the race  this includes a video that senator mike lee posted to his facebook page  where he said that  if anyone spoke to my wife or my daughter or my mother or any of my five sisters the way  has spoken to women  i wouldn t hire that person  even mike pence  trump s running mate released a statement where he lambasted trump for the comments  if your wingman in your campaign has to call you out for making violently misogynistic comments  then your campaign is probably doomed the evidence is beginning to mount that trump s reign of terror may finally be over  while trump dropping out at this juncture would almost assure democratic nominee hillary clinton s victory   it was beginning to look like she already had the election in the bag anyway  it isn t too hard to imagine the gop accepting that they are damned with trump or without him  they may have figured the best they can do at this point is to give up and try and conserve their resources rather than try to back a loser featured image from alex wong getty images
