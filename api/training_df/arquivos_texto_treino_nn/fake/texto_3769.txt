you know how the nra constantly tells us that their army of  good guys with guns  are ready to swoop in at the first sign of danger to save those in distress  well  as an incident from hollis  maine  shows us  sometimes it may be better if they just don t  year old joshua weldon had good intentions when he saw a woman s boyfriend assaulting her and made the decision to step in and stop it  according to police   year old andria richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend   year old ryan gilliken  on wednesday when weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman  unfortunately  his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant weldon fired his weapon multiple times  hitting richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times  richardson is recovering from her wounds  but family members say she is lucky  notably  neither the attacker nor the  savior were injured by the gunfire last year  another  good guy with a gun  made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car  he missed the criminals  but shot the victim in the head it s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad   but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle  say  close range combat against an unarmed attacker  with a victim nearby   without causing some form of  collateral damage   in this case  our hero almost killed the person he was trying to save gilliken has been charged with domestic violence assault  a class c felony  weldon has not been charged with a single crime watch a report on the shooting below featured image via screengrab
