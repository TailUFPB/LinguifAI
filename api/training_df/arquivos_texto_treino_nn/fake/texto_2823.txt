on the campaign trail  donald trump said he wanted to bring back waterboarding  now  as president  he is doubling down and says that waterboarding is a okay because it isn t really even torture anyway during an interview on thursday  trump told fox news  sean hannity that waterboarding doesn t qualify as  real torture   it does  and claimed that it is an effective interrogation tool to get valuable information  it s not   i mean  torture is real torture  ok  waterboarding is   i m sure it s not pleasant  but waterboarding was just short of torture   trump said   when   you know  all of a sudden  they made it torture  i spoke with people the other day who are in this world that were talking about it  absolutely  it works  absolutely   he added trump told abc news earlier this week that he is all about bringing back banned torture techniques  such as waterboarding  and said that he will be relying on the advice of his national security team  but he made it clear that he has no doubt in his mango tinted mind that torture works  however  secretary of defense james mattis has long since denounced the practice of waterboarding  as far as i m concerned  we have to fight fire with fire  now  with that being said i m going with general mattis  i m going with my secretary because i think pompeo s gonna be phenomenal  i m gonna go with what they say   trump said  but i have spoken as recently as  hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence  and i asked them the question   does it work  does torture work   and the answer was   yes  absolutely     he added  i will rely on general mattis  and i m gonna rely on those two people and others  and if they don t wanna do it  it s  percent okay with me  do i think it works  absolutely  once again  trump is using alternative facts  not only does waterboarding most definitely constitute torture  but it also isn t effective when it comes to getting information  according to a report published by us senate select committee published in   which analyzed the cia s detention and interrogation program  torture does not work the report clearly states that the  use of the cia s enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or gaining detainee cooperation  the report also points out that people who are tortured often make up false information just to bring an end to their suffering  they will tell you whatever you want to hear to get you to stop hurting them  even if it isn t true  because they are desperate you can watch trump declare that waterboarding is not  real torture   here featured image via video screen capture
