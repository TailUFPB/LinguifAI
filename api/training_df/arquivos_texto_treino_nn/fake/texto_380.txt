this is what happens when racists don t get their way with a single deal  donald trump enraged his racist base  including iowa gop rep  steve king on wednesday  democrats announced that they had struck a deal with trump to revive the deferred action for childhood arrivals program put in place by president obama to prevent the deportation of   people who were brought to the united states as children by their undocumented parents when trump first scrapped the program  his conservative base cheered while the rest of the nation expressed revulsion but trump also left the issue to congress  thus opening the door for legislative action to save the program  so  senator chuck schumer and rep  nancy pelosi offered trump a deal  daca will be restored and enshrined in law and trump will get some enhanced border security that does not include a giant useless expensive wall trump took the deal and now conservatives are furious in fact  steve king went on cnn to whine about the deal and even threatened trump with political ruin  the base will leave him   they can t support him anymore  i am talking about my constituents in iowa that will say you need to be behind trump  i am  i support his entire agenda  i support the agenda trump had when he went into office and i support almost every piece of the agenda   except the amnesty piece being dangled  and that s so destructive to a first world country  if you do not have the rule of law or respect for that law  the people writing the immigration laws are the people breaking them  we had a protest here  dreamers coming up demanding we give them amnesty  what right do law breakers have to make demands from the citizens of the united states of america  if anything  they should be pleading for it and not demanding  king also predicted that   things are going to be going downhill real fast or the republicans will be done for  and   here s the video via youtube amnesty is term used for people who broke the law  these   people did not break any law  their parents did  these children had no control over their parents  actions and did not understand that a law was being broken  therefore  these children should not be forced to go back to a country they know nothing about  america is their home furthermore  king is a seriously depraved individual if he thinks these people should have to beg to stay in the country  they did nothing wrong  but king is clearly showing that he lacks compassion and is nothing more than a racist who has no business being a member of congress featured image via screenshot
