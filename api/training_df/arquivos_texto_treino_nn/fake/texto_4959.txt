we re just days into experiencing the leadership skills kellyanne conway  donald trump s new campaign manager  has to offer  and so far it s a disaster  an interview on cnn s state of the union gave us a taste of conway s ability to handle a little bit of grilling from the press before her rise to the top  conway had called out trump for his refusal to release his tax returns  dana bash  the show s host  wasted no time bringing up the matter during the interview  ok  now you re in charge of donald trump s campaign  given that  given how you feel  are we going to see donald trump s tax returns soon  conway  who is apparently not interested in creating any original talking points  went straight to the  there s a media conspiracy against trump  line  conway insisted that cnn should be more concerned with covering corruption relating to the clinton foundation   which  seeing as there is no real conspiracy against trump  they did  conway said  so  now that i m on the inside  i know something i didn t know then  which is he is under audit and what that means  and  he has said very clearly  and i back him up completely  that when the audit is completed he will release the tax returns  and let me just say something about transparency  it comes in many different forms  dana  as does accountability and as does truthfulness  and we can t imagine going up against a less transparent  less accountable  more sort of rigged and corrupt individual as our political opponent than hillary clinton  she s had a terrible week when it comes to being transparent and accountable  whether it s the revelations of the pay for play at the   in the state department  that i know that cnn is very much on top of and your reporting is  dana  as well as  as well as  the   what happened at the clinton foundation  which is a big hot mess  bash responds saying  and we are talking about that for sure  but in this particular interview and these questions are about donald trump  and you mentioned the audit  according to his lawyers  the years  to  are no longer under audit  so would you release those tax returns  conway continues to evade the question  saying  no  i would not  and this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me in the following sense  i don t think that it creates one job  gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance  particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out of our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses  what i think people are most concerned about is  how would a president trump  or how would a president hillary  affect their tax bill  conway just proved that she is going to offer more of the same from the trump campaign as we saw under the manafort era  same messaging and words  just a new mouth saying them you can watch the exchange below https   www youtube com watch v  image via video screen capture
