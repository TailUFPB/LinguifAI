a children s home in oklahoma literally refused to take a donation from a man because he isn t a christian the murrow indian children s home claims to care about helping orphaned children but when matt wilbourn tried to make a   donation on behalf of the muskogee atheist community an employee called him and rejected his donation  i filed out the paperwork and i put my wife and i s name on the paperwork   wilbourn recounted   at the bottom  it asks if there is any person or organization you want to put it in memory of and i put the muskogee atheist community  she called my desk phone at work and told me that they would not be accepting our donation because it would go against everything they believe in   he continued founded in  by reverend j s  murrow to take in and care for orphaned native american children  the home was taken over by the american baptist mission home societies and moved to bacone college in muskogee  where it houses dozens of children in need of a home in   it was reported that the murrow children s home was in desperate need of supplies including  laundry detergent   gallon garbage bags  sandwich bags  one gallon and quart freezer bags  serving tongs  snacks  toothpaste  band aides  dishwashing soap  napkins  comet cleaner  pine sol  lysol  bleach  furniture polish and storage bags  so if any organization needs donations  it s the murrow children s home  and that s what makes their rejection of wilbourn s donation so outrageous he donated    which would go a long way toward purchasing many of the items on that list but his donation was rejected simply because he isn t a christian  which makes one wonder just exactly what the murrow children s home employees are teaching the kids in their care undeterred  wilbourn came up with an idea  in fact  it s a fantastic idea he decided to start a gofundme with the support of the muskogee atheist community to raise more money for the children s home to see exactly how much money it will take for them to ignore his non belief and accept the donation but it appears the murrow home cares more about religion than they do about making sure the children have everything they need  i emailed the director of the murrow home and told her that i m raising the amount to     wilbourn said   no reply from her  so far  the gofundme has raised a whopping    and the murrow home still won t accept because wilbourn and his group are atheists  it s taken food off their plate  clothes off their back and shelter over their heads   wilbourn said it s truly sad that an organization would reject perfectly good donations just because the person doing the giving is not a christian  that amounts to stealing from children  the murrow home is a non profit so clearly they are only able to care for children solely out of the kindness of people who open their wallets and donate money  the bible says  judge not lest ye be judged  and there s this part called the  golden rule  that commands us to treat people the way we want to be treated  thus far  the  christians  at the murrow home have failed to adhere to both  they judged wilbourn to be a bad person because he s an atheist and even when he treated them with kindness and generosity the murrow home continued to do the opposite to him frankly  it sounds like these kids need new caretakers because the murrow home is clearly failing them and their best interests to contact the murrow home  visit their facebook page to contribute to the gofundme  click here  because even if the murrow home rejects the amount raised  it will still go toward a great cause called camp quest  which is a non religious summer camp for kids murrow home ought to be ashamed of themselves for choosing bigotry and hate over the well being of the kids they claim to care about featured image  facebook
