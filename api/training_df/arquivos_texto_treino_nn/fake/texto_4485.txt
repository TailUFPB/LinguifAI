kansas is bleeding money and jobs and governor sam brownback doesn t want the people to know how devastating his economic policies have been in   the tea party governor was so confident that his economic policy of massive tax cuts for the wealthy and reduced spending would turn kansas into an economic powerhouse that he created a special group charged with writing reports on the results but brownback s experiment has failed so spectacularly that the state is billions of dollars in debt  education funding is suffering  and job growth is pathetic  so pathetic that kansas is losing more jobs than it has gained in january  brownback couldn t handle a report put together by his group that admitted  kansas sometimes was faring worse than it had before brownback became governor   so he made every effort to cover it up in other words  he censored it because his group was supposed to report that the economy is soaring  not falling to the ground like a rock kansas center for economic growth executive director heidi holliday blasted brownback for killing the report  he specifically asked the council to hold him accountable through rigorous performance metrics  five years later  the metrics clearly show his tax experiment has failed while business leaders and local chambers of commerce across the state openly ask him to change course  in fact  brownback is so desperate to keep the people of kansas from calling for tarring and feathering him in a public square that he is turning to the federal government  instead of writing their own independent reports  the group is now restricted to getting their information from the federal reserve  which conservatives often claim is responsible whenever economic issues occur that particularly surprised kansas house minority leader tom burroughs  who was quick to point out the irony  the missed revenue marks  missed job reports  missed projections shed light on his failed policies  i kind of find it a little ironic they chose to go to a federal government report after they blamed president obama for our economic problems  governor brownback s economic experiment is a complete failure and a joke  kansas  economy is now in shambles and republicans have no one to blame but themselves  they believed that by implementing an extreme conservative fiscal policy without interference from democrats that they would prove trickle down economics as a total success  instead  it failed miserably and now they want to censor any results from being reported by all rights  brownback should have ousted by voters in   but now kansas is stuck with him and his failed policies for at least another two years  meanwhile  the wealthy are laughing all the way to the bank featured image via liberalbias com
