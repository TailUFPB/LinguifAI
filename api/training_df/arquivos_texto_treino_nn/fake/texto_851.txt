star trek legend george takei gloriously shredded donald trump s dipshit son in a column which includes a poem for trump jr  to read to pass the time in his prison cell as we all know by now  trump jr  released an email chain of himself agreeing to a meeting with a russian lawyer who offered to give the trump campaign dirt on hillary clinton to use in the  election  the information was received from the russian government through aras agalarov  a russian oligarch who is close to vladimir putin and one of donald trump s friends it has since been revealed that a former soviet intelligence officer also attended the meeting  which took place inside trump tower in a scathing column published on saturday  takei recounts the news of the scandal and proceeds to inform trump jr  that he is going to jail  the latest  i can t believe this actually happened  bombshell concerns  of course  not trump himself but his namesake  donald  jr   whose emails confirming russian support for his father and meddling in the election present such low hanging evidentiary fruit that even jeffrey beauregard sessions iii could pick them   takei wrote the emails  released by junior in advance of a damning story by the times  no doubt in a vain attempt to blunt the story s impact or at least divert its media coverage  has had something of the opposite effect  importantly  junior also had copied then campaign manager paul manafort and jared kushner on his response  indicating that the campaign s senior staff were willing to accept damaging information on the democratic opponent from a foreign hostile state  their subsequent attendance of the meeting confirmed this  in attendance at the meeting itself was not only a lawyer from the russian government but also a known russian counterintelligence officer  the story grows  and darkens  this email string thus comprises the first direct evidence of coordination between the campaign and the russians  but unlikely the last in light of these damning revelations  takei wrote a poem to commemorate trump jr s crimes against the united states lest there be any confusiondon jr  has dispelled the illusionhis emails revealedwhat they thought was concealednow he s gonna do time for collusiontakei went on to point out that on the very same day of the meeting  trump wrote a speech about how russia has a  blackmail file  on clinton  and delivered it later that same month along with a plea to russian hackers to continue attacking her and the dnc in search of emails takei couldn t resist taking note of the irony of it all the president  in tepid defense of his son  remarked that junior is a  good boy   a  high quality person   and that he applauds his  transparency   i can t but help think the president probably wishes that level of transparency would render junior invisible right about now  for with now another member of his immediate family caught up in the russia investigation  and the curious timing of his speeches  it becomes increasingly implausible that all this was happening without the president s knowledge and what poetic irony it would be if trump s downfall resulted from emails indeed  it would not only be  poetic irony   but poetic justice as well featured image  frederick m  brown getty images
