donald trump has made a fine art of p ssing off other world leaders  thanks to our fearless orange tweeter in chief  colombia s government is now furious with us too according to colombia reports  donald trump met with former president andres pastrana     and former president alvaro uribe      an opposition leader  at mar a lago  current colombian president juan manuel santos  who has not yet gotten to meet with trump himself  is not impressed santos has spoken to trump to express his concern that uribe s lobbying in the u s  is a major inconvenience for the government of colombia  but the only response he has gotten from the white house is that trump will take care of it personally  vice president oscar naranjo said uribe and pastrana have overstepped by pushing their own political interests rather than those defined by the official government  presidents and their foreign ministers are those who really establish and maintain these relations  with foreign governments  naranjo explained uribe and pastrana have both made it abundantly clear that they are opposed to the peace process and they are kissing up to trump because the u s  is the only country that has not yet promised to offer financial aid colombia reports writes only last week  senators of uribe s hard right democratic center party wrote a letter in which they asked the us to not financially support the peace process on sunday uribe published a letter to us congress on twitter  warning that the efforts to end  years of political violence could lead to colombia becoming an authoritarian communist state similar to venezuela additionally  the former head of state claimed that the transitional justice court that could try him for a number of war crimes is being set up by communist sympathizers juan carlos pinzon  colombia s ambassador in washington  said that uribe and pastrana made their meeting with trump sound much more important than it actually was  there was an encounter  not a meeting or a formal date   pinzon said so  it seems we can now add colombia to the list of countries that trump has offended by being a moron without the slightest understanding of foreign policy  lovely featured image via joe raedle getty images
