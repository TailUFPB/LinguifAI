donald trump is desperately trying to find a list entertainers to perform at his inauguration in january  trump s friend  famed opera singer andrea bocelli  backed out of performing at trump s big event after a backlash ensued  it s a hot mess  the inauguration is only a few weeks away and team trump can t find any top talent willing to perform  he has the worst ratings historically of any president elect  on thursday morning  former campaign manager and aide kellyanne conway was named as donald trump s new counselor to the president  conway insists someone is booked to perform at the inauguration but she refused to say who it was during an interview on good morning america  that s probably because there is no one confirmed for trump s big event abc s david muir asked conway at the end of her interview about the news that bocelli backed out  adding   can you give us anyone on the list  i won t    conway said   but i can tell you that this is not the academy awards  it s the inauguration for the people  the way that it s been the election for the people  by not being the academy awards  we can only conclude that she s saying there is no a list talent booked muir asked   anyone lined up yet  uh  yes   replied conway as she laughed nervously after saying someone was booked  she then inadvertently admitted she doesn t have a clue about that she continued and clarified   no one put me in charge of the entertainment  i m a little bit too geeky for that  watch  year old jackie evancho will sing the national anthem at the event  page six is reporting that the beach boys may or may not be performing  trump s name is so toxic that the once coveted gig for a performer is not so valuable to an entertainer under his presidency  let s just say that entertainers just aren t into trump as john legend said   creative people tend to reject bigotry and hate  we tend to be more liberal minded  when we see somebody that s preaching division and hate and bigotry  it s unlikely he ll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him  past performers at inaugurations include beyonc   kelly clarkson  frank sinatra  barbra streisand  and aretha franklin trump has tried to spin the lack of enthusiasm he s receiving from entertainers by saying he doesn t like  over the top  fancy events anyway featured image via spencer platt getty images
