during the last presidential debate  many people were live tweeting their responses to the candidate s answers  one of those people happened to be the legendary shonda rhimes  creator of pretty much every amazing drama on abc at the moment during one point in the debate  donald trump was talking about late term abortion  however  he didn t seem to have all his facts right  and he somehow thinks that babies are ripped from the womb in the  month not being able to refrain from trump s clear lack of knowledge of women  pregnancy  abortion or the birthing process  rhimes tweeted out  fyi   ripping baby from womb in  month  is called c section   vaginaeducation fyi   ripping baby from womb in  month  is called c section   vaginaeducation  shonda rhimes   shondarhimes  october    is exactly what it is  if a women is nine months pregnant and wants the baby removed  they would do that via c section  and the baby would be fully developed  if the baby was removed for any other reason that late in the pregnancy it s likely for some tragic reason and trump really has to keep his orange mouth shut because he has no idea what he s talking about on the other hand  hillary clinton s response during the debate regarding late term abortion was absolutely on point  she said roe v  wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account  and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case  the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking  painful decisions for families to make  i have met with women who have  toward the end of their pregnancy  get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy  i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions  so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and health of the mother taken into account  however  trump doesn t seem to care about women or the life of the mother and is instead catering to his dimwitted base who has no knowledge of basic science  let alone what goes on when a woman is pregnant  nor does he himself even care to know  he just knows how to sell a point to his audience  he is  after all  a scam artist businessman good on rhimes for giving trump some  vagina education    it d be nice if he learned a little about them before just walking up and grabbing them featured photo by bryan bedder getty images for vulture festival   twitter
