we on the left are all wondering why  out of the vast field of gop candidates  donald trump roared to the nomination  toppling traditional candidates like jeb bush  marco rubio  and even hard right bigots like ted cruz  no  they picked the donald  and no matter how vulgar he was  how bigoted he was  how dangerously unhinged he was  they still picked him  then  they got him elected president  to the horror of most americans and to the delight of that swath of people who were so entranced by trump from the moment he rode down that escalator well  now  we are  days in  and the trump presidency is just as chaotic and terrifying as we all knew it would be  trump is incompetent and dangerous  as well as an embarrassment on the world stage  yet  his voters are sticking with him  and bill maher  host of hbo s real time  thinks he knows why  remember when trump said he could shoot someone in the middle of new york city s fifth avenue and not lose voters  that s likely true  and maher has the answer as to why  he said in his  new rules  segment on friday night  trump supporters aren t changing their minds because the problem isn t in the mind  it s lower  it s emotional  he could have ann frank s skeleton in his closet  they d all vote for him again  he continued  letting liberals know why facts  vulgarity  incompetence  and any other outrage trump might commit matters not to his devoted followers  i think it s a gut feeling that the world has changed and they don t like it  trump is going to change it back to the way it was  maher then went on to mock trump voters in a hillbilly affect  saying things like  i ain t no racist  but why does american need to have a black santa claus  and did i mention bruce jenner has tits now  returning to his normal voice  maher explained  i think i speak for most liberals when i say  i don t care about black santa  i don t think it s going to make the little drummer boy start cutting himself  but to trump voters  making santa black is unthinkable  it d be like making jesus middle eastern  maher concluded  summing up just why trump voters put him in the white house  despite the fact that he is clearly the last person who should be president  this is why building that stupid wall is still a key issue for them  it represents keeping out not just immigrants but everything that is new and different and scary and unfamiliar  and this is just it  these people don t care what trump does  he ll make america comfortable for them again  in their minds  there will be no more religions besides christianity  there will be no lgbtq rights  black people and other minorities will know their places  women would be in the kitchen and the bedroom where they belong rather than in the boardroom  and white men will control everything again this is about cultural anxiety and bigotry  it really was  as van jones says  a white lash  therefore  don t try and woo trump voters away from him with facts  they seriously don t care watch bill maher s very important message below featured image via video screen capture
