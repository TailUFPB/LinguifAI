sean spicer s time as press secretary has been a particularly humiliating one  each time he goes up to the podium  he lies or fumbles  and today  he reached a particularly pathetic low point when he seemingly erased the holocaust from history with a single outrageous claim  the timing was especially bad as trump s administration dodges accusations of anti semitism and the jewish community celebrates the holiday of the passover seder according to spicer s version of events  hitler never gassed people watch  sean spicer   you had someone as despicable as hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons   pic twitter com   yashar   yashar  april    comment came while he hamfistedly attempted to justify bombing syria because of the assad regime s use of chemical weapons  in an effort to prove his point  spicer claimed hitler   perpetrator of the worst mass murder in history   never used chemical weapons because he found them so immoral  undoubtedly spicer was referring to the fact that hitler was said to have opposed chemical weapons on the battlefield because of his experience being gassed in world war i  however  hitler and the nazi party had absolutely no qualms with gassing their victims in the concentration camps  which they did on an industrial scale   in fact  the idea that hitler was gassed in wwi is actually suspected by historians to be a lie invented by hitler himself to cover for his long history of mental illness  passing along this myth is perpetuating an artful piece of propaganda invented by hitler  nice going  spicey  to suggest that hitler wouldn t  sink to using chemical weapons  is an outrageous way of dehumanizing those who died in the holocaust  for him to say this while standing at the podium at the white house is sickening  more hypocritically  trump himself praised the use of chemical weapons by saddam hussein as recently as last summer  suggesting they allowed him to keep his enemies in line  his bombing of syria came as a shock precisely because he has shown absolutely zero interest in preventing chemical warfare up until this point  disturbingly  the united states has a sordid history with chemical weapons stockpiles dating back to the first world war  it was not until the  that the u s  firmly committed to getting rid of them asked for clarification  spicer then tried to make a distinction between jews and germans  gassing the jewish people in concentration camps is different than gassing  your own people   another defense that neo nazis continue to use to this day  the hole spicer is digging keeps getting deeper press sec  on hitler assad comments   he was not using the gas on his own people the same way he brought them into the holocaust centers   pic twitter com   abc news   abc  april    image via twitter
