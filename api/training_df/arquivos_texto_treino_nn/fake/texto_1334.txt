donald trump showed up at arlington national cemetery to give the memorial day address  but things got a bit weird when the national anthem played as others stood with their hands over their hearts or saluting   a sign of respect for our fallen soldiers   trump apparently became confused  thought he was at a baseball game  and began emphatically belting out the lyrics with a smile on his face as the music to the national anthem played trump is super extra during the national anthem  almost like he s overcompensating for something  pic twitter com nioznxyruo  lauren werner   laurenwern  may    know who wasn t smiling  literally everyone who watched trump spit in the face of people who lost their lives serving our country  bessbell did he yell out  play ball   at the end   jaime robledo   roblizzle  may    bessbell i resist this man as a human being   inquisitive one   mostnquisitive  may    bessbell what a way to spit in the faces of those who died while in the service of our country   ross h  hockman   therosshockman  may    bessbell wow  the imagery here is strikingly buffoonish   darren l     may    bessbell looks like the medication just kicked in   carol marie     may    bessbell more evidence of dementia  my granny used to sing along like this at inappropriate times too   kelly d   kellylovesco  may    bessbell it s not a baseball game  christopher lonigro   cclonigro  may    bessbell that s his solemn and respectful look   hollywood wrecker   hollywoodwreck  may    bessbell it looks like he completely forgot why he is there   redwillow   elliput  may     trump became confused during a press conference with israeli war criminal  prime minister benjamin netanyahu  and  wandered off   he had to have someone fetch him and bring him back it is unclear if trump has inherited his father s alzheimer s disease or if he is feeling the strain of his impending impeachment and possible imprisonment  his tweets make it clear that the russia investigation is getting to him    maybe he just is completely unwilling to show respect   but one thing is clear  something is very clearly wrong here featured image via screengrab
