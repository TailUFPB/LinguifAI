trust funny or die to come up with something like this  they ve released a video starring brent spiner  a k a dr  okun from independence day  and data from star trek  the next generation  and he  ahem  takes on a new role here to lampoon the hell out of both trump and his quack of a doctor spiner actually introduces himself as dr  bornstein  and immediately launches into what he knows about trump  i m making this video because there s something they don t want you to know  trump s not from here  and i don t mean not from america  i mean not from this planet  okay when i wrote that ridiculously glowing letter in five minutes  i thought you d see through it for the obvious farce that it was  indeed  that letter has been the subject of controversy for trump  seeing as how bornstein used language that doctors generally don t use in it  he said that trump s lab results were  astonishingly excellent   for one thing  he also declared trump the healthiest person ever to run for president  which is something he can t possibly know spiner hilariously touches on all of that  too  in his role as the infamous dr  bornstein  he then goes back into discussing trump s alien anatomy  i did a chest exam  and to be honest  i was not expecting to find a heart  and guess what  i didn t  what  bornstein  did find in place of a heart is even funnier than trump s obvious lack of one  from there  it just spirals  watch below to find out what else  bornstein  knows about trump
