everyone knows that donald trump absolutely hates melissa mccarthy s portrayal of white house press secretary sean spicer  well  this week s edition of snl certainly will not please the donald  because mccarthy s  spicey  came back with a vengeance the segment opened with aidy bryant doing an absolutely perfect impression of sarah huckabee sanders  the deputy press secretary and daughter of former arkansas governor mike huckabee  filling in for spicer as she has been doing all week since trump fired fbi director james comey and sent washington reeling once again  huckabee sanders  points out that she is doing  spicer s  job because he is on naval reserve duty  however  in this episode  he is outside in the bushes  just as the real sean spicer did in a pathetic attempt to hide from reporters after the comey news broke  bryant s huckabee sanders insisted that this was part of a naval reserve exercise  though then  a couple of members of the white house press corps asked if  huckabee sanders  could replace  spicer  permanently  before she could answer   spicer  bursts in with a fire extinguisher and blasts a reporter s pants with it  insinuating that he was lying by pointing out all of  spicer s  flaws a reliably contentious press conference followed  focusing on the fallout from the comey situation  just as press briefings have all week in real time  after spicer finally ends the briefing abruptly  he rides to new york city to find alec baldwin s trump  of course   trump  is not at trump tower  so he then continues on to one of trump s golf properties  where he asks trump if he is about to be replaced by his deputy press secretary  trump  assures spicey that he is safe  and then gives him a dramatic kiss   the kiss of death the real donald trump is going to be absolutely furious with this  further  rabidly homophobic mike pence will insist that spicer has to go now that snl has taken to mocking him and trump with same sex kisses this will definitely fall under the heading   in trump s mind  of course   of making his employee look weak i d be willing to bet we ve seen just about the last of the real life spicey  that isn t so bad  though i will miss melissa mccarthy s version watch the hilarious segment below featured image via video screen capture
