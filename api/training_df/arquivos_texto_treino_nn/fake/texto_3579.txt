much of my day is spent scanning the news  so when this headline came up from the washington post  i was inconsolable  what i read was of no comfort  trump  it seems  has total carte blanche for destroying the world  no one can stop him if you recall  a few months ago trump spoke with a foreign policy expert  trump allegedly asked the expert three times why we can t use nuclear weapons beyond that  we know that trump is terribly thin skinned and set for vengeance upon anyone who dares offend him yes  that s terrifying  but doesn t congress provide checks and balances  even congressional republicans certainly know the consequences of nuclear war  right  it turns out  it doesn t matter  with congressional approval or without it  trump can do whatever the hell he wants with nuclear weapons now they re his  when trump takes office in january  he will have sole authority over more than   warheads  there is no failsafe  the whole point of u s  nuclear weapons control is to make sure that the president   and only the president   can use them if and whenever he decides to do so  the one sure way to keep president trump from launching a nuclear attack  under the system we ve had in place since the early cold war  would have been to elect someone else why in the world would a single person ever have that much responsibility  well  the short answer is that no one ever anticipated that in our electoral system  there would be a president donald trump the more complex answer is that the president is the check to balance a hawkish military the members of congress who wrote the law  largely with the backing of the scientists who worked on the manhattan project  framed it explicitly as a question of who controls the power to use nuclear weapons  is dropping an atomic bomb a military act or a political one  if it is inherently political  above and beyond a regular military tactic  then that power could not be entrusted to the military  ultimately  the president was supposed to be the check against the pentagon pushing to use nukes more often one person did predict a trump of sorts  while the country was still reeling from watergate in    year air force veteran maj  harold hering asked how could he be sure that an order to launch his missiles was lawful  how could he be sure  for example  that the president wasn t insane  instead of an answer  he got the boot  an aborted promotion and an administrative discharge for  failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership  and for indicating  a defective mental attitude towards his duties  now  there is one person between the president and nuclear annihilation  the secretary of defense  the sod is actually the person to carry out the launch  not the president  but the sod  unlike congress  works for the president  it s unclear if he  or she  can even say no  trump s nominee is james  mad dog  mattis  he s a war hawk who once said that killing people was  a hell of a lot of fun   in other words  even if he could tell his boss no  he probably wouldn t featured image via ty wright getty images
