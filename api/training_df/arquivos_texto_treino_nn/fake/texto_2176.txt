vermont senator bernie sanders has been a nightmare for the gop ever since he announced his presidential campaign  with his amazing ability to connect with progressives and activists in america  sanders has been a massive thorn in the republican party s side as he routinely dismantles every crooked policy they try to enact the republican party s latest disastrous move is their obamacare replacement plan  which has attracted criticism from the second it was announced  it only makes sense that sanders would weigh in on such a repulsive move  and it only took him  seconds to dismantle what house speaker paul ryan wants to use to replace obamacare on cbs s face the nation  sanders gave a damning response to a question about whether or not the gop s replacement would get  votes in the senate  he said  i hope not  it is an absolute disaster  it is a disgrace  and by the way  this really has nothing to do with healthcare  what this has everything to do with is a massive shift of wealth from working people and middle income people to the richest people in this country  it is a  billion dollar tax break for the top two percent  millionaires will get about    a year in tax breaks  while at the same time   million people are going to lose their health insurance  premiums are going to soar  the aarp says that if you are  years of age and you re making about   a year  you re going pay up to    more for you re health insurance  they re going to defund planned parenthood  deny over  million the right to choose they healthcare that they need  they re going to decimate medicaid  which is why the american medical association  the ama  and the american hospital association oppose it  in addition to the aarp  this is a disgrace  and by the way  they are so cowardly that they want to go forward before the cbo gives an estimate of what it will cost  and how many people will lose their insurance  you can watch sanders explain it all below sanders couldn t be more correct  the gop s replacement is a massive failure and will not only strip millions of americans of life saving health care  but it will make americans pay more for less the republicans are trying to promote their own interests with this bill  and it s absolutely pathetic  the ones who will truly benefit from such a horrible piece of legislation are the wealthy and insurance companies  hopefully  people will listen to sanders and fight this bill featured image is a screenshot
