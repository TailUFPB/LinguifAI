trumpkins fancy themselves true american patriots  despite their lord and savior  donald trump  being the opposite of american patriotism  they re so secure in their not patriotism that they threaten anyone who doesn t want to vote for trump with violence  and death those anti american threats have extended to newspapers like the arizona republic  which endorsed hillary at the end of september  that endorsement represents the first time in the paper s  year history that they ve endorsed a democrat they started receiving death threats shortly after the first debate  today  the paper s president put trumpkins to shame by telling them what real patriotism looks like  and it looks nothing like donald trump  free speech requires compassion   the woman who answered the phone at the republic s offices got to hear an angry caller wish doom on them  and invoke the name of one of the paper s reporters who was assassinated  years ago  she reported that caller to the authorities  but she also prayed for the caller  despite the threat  free speech requires an open debate   nicole  the paper s editor in charge of the news staff  led her reporters to a trump rally following their endorsement  knowing the jeers and harassment they would receive  trumpkins had said the republic would burn  should be shut down  etc   and still she did her job in covering both sides of the election  free speech requires bravery   trumpkins also said that anyone with whom they disagree should be punished  the republic s editorial page editor  phil  who s a lifelong republican  calmly denounced trump  over and over  despite the escalating problems with trump s fans  free speech is part of a society that values hard work and opportunity   this one should be obvious because trump s fans allegedly value hard work above all  the young men and women who sell republic subscriptions door to door were so frightened after getting spit on  bullied  and threatened with violence that they didn t want the paper to publish their first names  yet  they still come to work and still go door to door  free speech is sometimes the only way to hold the powerful accountable   trump fans called the paper s staff  hacks  and  losers   it was an investigative reporter at the republic who first broke the story about the horrid treatment veterans receive at the phoenix va  his work brought that out into the open  led to uncovering more scandals  and now  maybe real change can happen  do trump fans value vets  not nearly enough  do they know how to research  no  free speech  and a free press  comes at a cost   trumpkins told the paper that one of their legacy publishers  gene pulliam  was spinning in his grave over their terrible transgression in endorsing a democrat  gene s wife  nina  sat at the bedside of the reporter who was assassinated  years ago  and watched him die slowly for the crime of doing his job  freedom of religion is a fragile and precious thing   the republic s current president  mi ai parrish  has a grandfather who is a christian pastor  trump fans who have deluded themselves into thinking they re christian said jesus would judge her  that she would burn in hell and that non christians should be kept out  she invoked her grandfather  who is an example of real christian persecution  he and a friend were imprisoned and tortured for refusing to deny christ one of the biggest insults to christians who suffer such persecution in the world is all the pseudo christians here who are crying about persecution because they can t force their religion down our throats  these people are sorry excuses for christians on those grounds alone the paper was also asked what right they had to endorse hillary  parrish has family that grew up under an oppressive dictator  her mother had no right to free speech  no right to free press  no right to education  and no right to vote  the trump fans would take all of that away from us just so they re more comfortable  one man can make a difference   at its core  that is what america stands for  jobe couch  an army cultural attach  living in alabama  sponsored parrish s aunts and mother when they came over from korea  his generosity helped many immigrants  who are now citizens and earning their livings as teachers  engineers  pastors  lawyers  and more  the trump fans who told the republic s staff that they should go live with those immigrants they love so much  in the countries they come from  have forgotten what america is what s the first amendment all about  it s all about the above  trumpkins have no clue what patriotism is   if they did  they d be appalled at anyone who behaved the way they and trump himself do to read the arizona republic s entire moving response  click here featured image by zeb micelli  public domain  via wikimedia commons
