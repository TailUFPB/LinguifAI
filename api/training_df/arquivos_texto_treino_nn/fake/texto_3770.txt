the democrats weren t able to outright win the senate back from the gop  but the gop s majority isn t exactly huge or secure  and there s still a senate race in louisiana that has gone to a runoff  to be held on dec    john kennedy and foster campbell are both up for that particular seat  and should it go to campbell  the democrat  it would close that margin even more think it can t happen because louisiana is a deep red state  they elected a democratic governor just last year after republican governor bobby jindal ran them into the ground  also  their runoffs  despite deciding who actually wins an election  have pretty low turnout  if people in the state are unhappy enough with trump and with the gop  those people could turn out for the runoff and swing it to campbell s side easily okay  so that s just one seat and republicans would still control the senate with a   margin  there are two independents senators bernie sanders and angus king who both tend to vote with the democrats  so    with one uncalled race  should campbell win  that s effectively a   margin we can math  and so can you  so we all know  is less than   to achieve a majority  someone else has to switch sides  oddly enough  that isn t exactly impossible  either  senator john mccain has already made it clear he s not going to play ball with everything trump wants to do  in fact  mccain is more than a little annoyed over trump s bromance with vladimir putin  to mccain  putin is a dictatorial tyrant to whom we absolutely should not cozy up that could mean bucking his own party to the point where he just switches sides evidently  rand paul and susan collins may be ripe for flipping  too  and if even one of them does  along with mccain  then voila  democrats effectively control the senate again however  it s pretty far fetched  campbell could easily win the louisiana seat but getting republican senators to change sides  and either vote pretty much entirely democratic or actually become democrats  is considerably harder in today s partisan environment  that means hoping and praying the gop senators who are all  principled  right now stay principled enough to thwart their party and donald trump if and when it comes to that in short  don t hold your breath  but don t give up hope  either  we didn t think trump could win  and he did  and there are a lot of republicans and conservatives who are just as unhappy with that as we are  since the next four years started off with the nearly impossible  then hoping for more  impossibilities  may not be in vain if you would like to help campbell win his runoff election and give the democrats another seat in the senate  you can donate to his campaign here  you can also read all about him and what he stands for here featured image by alex wong via getty images
