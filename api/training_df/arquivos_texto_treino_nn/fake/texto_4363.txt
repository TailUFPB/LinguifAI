republicans are so scared and desperate about the pence kaine debate that they ve resorted to distorting tim kaine s record as a defense attorney   in which  yes  he had to defend murderers  but anyone who took a civics course  or has half a brain cell  knows that everyone  even accused murderers  are entitled to representation in a court of law it s   why is that still being debated seeing as though there s nothing shocking about that drummed up  scandal   a real scandal lies on the horizon  and it has to do not with tim kaine  but mike pence after serving  years of a  year sentence  keith cooper   who was accused of shooting michael kershner and his mother  nona canell   was found to be innocent after the victims admitted they were wrong  dna evidence proved he was not at the scene  and a jail informant admitted to lying after filing a pardon request  in which the board unanimously voted that pence should indeed pardon mr  cooper  pence balked  why  ut of respect for the judicial process   pence claimed  saying that cooper s paperwork wasn t  in order  after a two year delay by the state  pence s office admitted they haven t given th case much thought  but somehow thought it appropriate to slam cooper s lawyer  saying they need to  do a better job  cooper s attorney  elliot solsar  then claimed pence bucked the case because he s running for president  and is instead trying to pass it off to his successor  if he wins in november  we are really disappointed in governor pence s failure to provide justice to an innocent man  it s clear that he has punted the petition to the next governor because it s election season is that what trump  pence s running mate  means when he says they are the  law and order candidates  i wonder if the circumstances would be different if cooper were white  instead of a black man  black people  after all  are wrongfully convicted at higher rates than white people the national registry currently cites a total of   exonerations   the majority of which are attributed to black defendants by the registry s own statistics broken down by race and crime  total exonerations for  all crimes  numbered  for hispanic persons   for caucasian persons  and  for black persons  the largest gap is associated with sexual assault  a difference of  exonerations   with the second largest belonging to homicide  a difference of  exonerations  not only are black people more likely to be victims of wrongful conviction  they also wait longer to exonerating than others in   pamela perez  professor of biostatistics at loma linda university  told the huffington post blacks who are exonerated after a bogus conviction have served   years on average before the good news  it takes just   years for whites and   for latinos racist governors like mike pence  while being stubborn and cruel  continue this system that has shown to be immoral  unfair  and unethical towards black americans in modern society tim kaine would be wise to bring this major issue up at the first debate featured image via justin sullivan getty images
