as if the republican party couldn t possibly look any worse thanks to donald trump s exploding russia scandal  some of the party s top members are hellbent on destroying conservatives  reputation even further on wednesday morning  rep  steve king  r ia  went on cnn to propose a heartless  revolting solution to getting trump s border wall paid for  king is apparently accepting mexico s refusal to pay for trump s moronic border wall  even as trump still insists that the country will pay  and has come up with another solution   cutting food assistance to low income americans  and while he s at it  he d also like to slash planned parenthood funding this disgusting suggestion came up when alisyn camerota asked king if he would be  comfortable with providing    billion of taxpayer money not from mexico to bill that wall   this question was prompted by the house republicans  threat to democrats on tuesday  where they suggested a government shutdown if    billion for the border wall wasn t included in the  budget  king responded  absolutely yes and more  and i d throw another   billion on the pile  and i would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of planned parenthood s budget  and the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations  camerota  of course  was speechless  she did a double take and asked  you want to take food from people who are on the lowest rung in terms of the nation s safety net and their children  in terms of foot stamps you re happy to take money from them in order to give the    billion for the border wall  king tried to defend himself  stating that the border wall would create jobs  then  he jumped to the school lunch program that michelle obama had created  he said  i would just say let s limit it to that anybody who wants to have food stamps  it s up to the school lunch program  that s fine  you can watch king turn into an absolute piece of sh t below these food stamps   provided by the supplemental nutrition assistance program  snap    are responsible for assisting  million people  trump has already proposed that this program be cut   over the next  years  and king wants to cut it even more to support an ineffective border wall that most americans strongly oppose  by cutting snap and planned parenthood funding  king is solidifying himself as a conservative who doesn t care about low income americans  he s truly living up to the gop s reputation featured image via justin sullivan   getty images
