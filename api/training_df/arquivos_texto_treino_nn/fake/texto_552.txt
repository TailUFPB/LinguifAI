while donald trump  a man who speaks in hyperbole and absolutes like  bad  and  sad   is finding it difficult to condemn violent racists  the great great grandson of robert e  lee  the civil war general whose statue spurred the protest  spoke out against the hatred and said that the statues should be taken down the violence in charlotte  virginia erupted over the weekend during a planned white supremacist protest over the fact the city s plans to remove the statue after the city council voted  saying that the monuments to the civil war are   painful reminders of the violence and injustice of slavery and other harms of white supremacy that are best removed from public spaces  there s no place for that   robert e  lee v tells newsweek  referring to the white supremacist protesters who carried torches and marched through charlottesville on friday   there s no place for that hate  while he didn t mention trump by name  the younger lee said that even his great great grandfather would have done a better job denouncing the neo nazis and white supremacists  we don t believe in that whatsoever   lee says  he is quick to defend his ancestor s name   our belief is that general lee would not tolerate that sort of behavior either  his first thing to do after the civil war was to bring the union back together  so we could become a more unified country  we don t want people to think that they can hide behind robert e  lee s name and his life for these senseless acts of violence that occurred on saturday   lee says as for whether the statues should remain  lee says yes  but in proper context  i think that is absolutely an option  to move it to a museum and put it in the proper historical context   lee says   times were very different then  we look at the institution of slavery  and it s absolutely horrendous  back then  times were just extremely different  we understand that it s complicated in   when you look back at that period of time  if you want to put statues of general lee or other confederate people in museums  that makes good sense  in other words  much like holocaust memorials  memorials to the most divisive  cruel and violent time in american history should be educational and cautionary  not something to be worshiped it s pretty clear that lee is right about what his ancestor and namesake would have thought  it s well documented that even the original robert e  lee didn t want the civil war memorialized  he wanted the nation to heal  i think it wiser   the retired military leader wrote about a proposed gettysburg memorial in    not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife  to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered  featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
