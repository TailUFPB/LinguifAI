if you thought leaving congress would somehow make former benghazi witch hunter jason chaffetz smarter  you were utterly  woefully wrong in an appearance on his new home  fox news  chaffetz whined that jared kushner and donald trump jr  have to testify before the senate intelligence committee because of that teensy little meeting they had with a  russian government lawyer   a kgb spy  and a russian money launderer where they expected to receive damaging information about hillary clinton from the russian government instead  he says  chelsea clinton should be dragged in to testify about benghazi  republicans need to get a backbone   chaffetz said   every time the democrats say they need to call up jared kushner or don jr    call up chelsea clinton  call up the clintons  so every time a democrat says  i gotta talk to donald trump jr    then go up and bring chelsea clinton in there  chaffetz said  falsely claiming that chelsea clinton was  involved in the benghazi situation  because of her association with the clinton foundation  they would never  ever do this to the clintons   chaffetz said of kushner s testimony despite the fact that  they  literally did this to hillary clinton  forcing her to withstand  hours of ridiculous questions   notably in public  unlike kushner and his cohorts watch it below featured image via screengrab
