very few people with significant money or power in this country are voting for donald trump  even the koch brothers are publicly backing off supporting the toxic  self described billionaire  one silicon valley billionaire is happy to be on the trump train  even after the allegations of sexual assault surfaced  perhaps that s because paypal cofounder peter thiel  who is also a facebook investor and a    million trump donor  doesn t really think sexual assault is a big deal in   thiel wrote a book called  the diversity myth  multiculturalism and political intolerance on campus   if you think that sounds like a trump esque screed against political correctness  you d be right the book isn t just about saying offensive words or about cultural appropriation  according to the guardian s article on it  thiel complained that in many cases  complaints of date rape were just regret by the victims in a case about a  year old stanford freshman who said she was raped in a dorm room while drunk  thiel and his cowriter and paypal partner  david o  sacks  wrote  although  was clearly guilty of serving alcohol to an underage woman and taking advantage of her resulting lack of judgement  there was no sexual assault   understandably  however  the woman regretted the whole incident afterwards  this argument has never made sense to me  in rape cases  the benefit of the doubt always goes with the accused rapist  a rape victim opens herself up to slander  to character assassination and to accusations exactly like the one above  wouldn t the more logical response to regret to be to deny it ever happened thiel also believes that rape necessarily involves physical injuries  which would mean that those influenced by date rape drugs would likely have no claim  at least in his perfect world  it is ludicrous to believe that anyone who had been forcefully violated would not know it and bear physical marks  then  there s this  because you know  men are always the victims  the purpose of the rape crisis movement seems as much about vilifying men as about raising  awareness   thiel s book  as described in the guardian  goes on to complain about the many ways whites  and white men in particular  are victimized and vilified in this country  is it any wonder he is supporting donald trump featured image by alex wong via getty images
