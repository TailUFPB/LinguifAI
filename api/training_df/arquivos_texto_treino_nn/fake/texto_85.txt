maybe  thoughts and prayers  aren t the remedy following a shooting  after all  at the first united methodist church in east tennessee  about  senior citizens gathered around for a holiday meal  after the meal  the group of elderly churchgoers decided to discuss gun safety  there has  after all  been a spate of mass shootings recently   as many as  so far this year  they got the idea for the conversation reportedly after a nearby county s sheriff s department held similar seminars at its local churches  according to tellico plains police chief russ parks  well  i ve got my gun on me   an  year old member of the church in tellico plains said  according to parks   the washington post reports  the man then pulled out his holster in which he had a   caliber ruger handgun  he promptly removed the magazine for everyone to see  then cleared the chamber and showed the gun to his fellow parishioners the churchgoers discussed how to safely bring guns to church  then spoke of the deaths with recent mass shootings  like  for example  the recent texas massacre in which a gunman shot  people dead as they sat in church the  year old man put the magazine back into the gun and put the gun back in the holster  parks explained  but then later  while parishioners were cleaning up  one church member who had missed the demonstration asked the man to see the firearm   and that s when everything turned chaotic inside the church the  year old accidentally pulled the trigger without realizing the gun was loaded  then a bullet fired across the palm of the man s hand and toward his  year old wife  who was sitting in a wheelchair next to him  entering her lower left abdomen  then it went out of the right side of her abdomen  into her right forearm and out the backside of her forearm  following that  the bullet then ricocheted off the wall and landed under his wife s wheelchair  parks said that prompted panic in the church because some of the folks thought an active gunman was on the premises  they had their backs to it   parks said   somebody hollers   he s been shot  she s been shot  call   due to a lot of panic during the calls to   the dispatcher assumed someone had entered the church and was shooting  so several schools were put on lockdown the injured husband and wife were flown to the university of tennessee medical center where they are listed critical condition we re waiting for the nra to say   if only the wife had a gun  she could have protected herself  image  ken wilcox via flickr  under creative commons license
