let s get something straight here   americans did not elect donald trump  our system did  and although republicans retained majorities in both houses of congress  they did so extremely narrowly  and it s very likely that more people voted democratic than republican  sound unfair  it is with that in mind  it s not over  it s never over  the causes progressives fight for still need our voices  our action  and in the not too distant future  our votes  we need to start organizing right now  today  to undo all of the damage republicans are going to do over the next two years  there are no other options on the table other than to fight tooth and nail at every level luckily  it appears that some democratic leaders understand that  jason kander  a veteran and rising star in the democratic party  was the secretary of state in missouri   a very red state  you may remember him as the candidate that advocated for background checks while assembling a rifle blindfolded kander lost by only three points in a red state that voted for trump by  percent  while running against an incumbent with  years in washington   republican senator roy blunt  that s huge   and if democrats hope to regain power  they re going to need candidates like kander that can help them stay competitive when it comes to communicating with the white working class  who just massively voted against their own interests   that s why it s extremely heartening to see that he s far from giving up  in a statement on his campaign website  jason kander states this is the message where i m supposed to thank you for all you ve done for me  tell you how much it meant to me  and then say my goodbyes and wish you luck on your journey  i m supposed to say something like   perhaps our paths will cross again  but that s not how i roll  of course  i am thankful to you and i m forever grateful for this experience  but why wouldn t i be  let s talk about something important we re all disappointed about tuesday night s results  we lost an election  in fact  we   the democrats   lost a whole mess of elections on tuesday but please know that i m going to be fine  my wife is gorgeous and brilliant and my son true is my best little buddy in the world  we are not the people who will be hurt by these election results  so please don t spend any time being sad for me  if you re going to be sad for someone  make it the single mom who has cancer and is scared to death about being unable to keep her insurance to continue treatments without obamacare  worry about the undocumented student who has only ever known this country and is worried about what happens to her now  worry about the minimum wage worker trying to stretch   into a full grocery trip  let your heart go out to the college student saddled with enormous debt and unable to get help from a parent whose own graduate degree has forced him into bankruptcy i met each of those people  in real life  during this campaign  and it fueled me the whole way  but here s the thing  that fuel is still in my tank  why  i love this country and i won t let losing an election force me away from the process pick yourself up  dust yourself off  yes  donald trump is going to be president and the republicans control the house and the senate  but i need that to double your resolve  not cause you to give up on our politics you can read the rest of his statement here if you agree this is exactly the attitude we need right now  make sure to share this around  we cannot afford to ever give up featured image by whitney curtis getty images
