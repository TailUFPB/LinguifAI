former fbi director james comey is now one of the most dangerous men in washington to donald trump  there is nothing that could harm trump like comey testifying under oath in an open session of congress   yet that is exactly what comey plans to do  special counsel robert mueller has reportedly cleared comey to testify  and boy will that testimony be a doozy of course  we all remember the reports that comey kept meticulous notes on his conversations with trump  because the orange wannabe  president  unsettled him with his inappropriate requests  we also remember how one of those memos was leaked  and it alleged that trump tried to obstruct justice  now  new reports suggest that comey plans to tell the world about every contentious conversation he ever had with trump   including the parts where what trump requested of comey could indeed amount to obstruction of justice regarding the russia probe   which is  of course  a felony because of the addition of special counsel mueller to the investigation  there will likely be no testimony regarding what is going on inside the investigation himself  however  that matters not in this instance  as it appears that when comey sits down before the senate intelligence committee  he plans to sing like a canary  in fact  reports say he can t wait to do it  from cnn but he appears eager to discuss his tense interactions with trump before his firing  which have now spurred allegations that the president may have tried to obstruct the investigation  if it happens  comey s public testimony promises to be a dramatic chapter in the months long controversy  and it will likely bring even more intense scrutiny to an investigation that trump has repeatedly denounced as a  witch hunt  indeed  this should be very interesting  we won t have long to wait  either  while there is no date set in stone just yet  comey s remarks may be up to be scheduled within the next week or two  all he has to do is to make sure that he knows the bounds he must stay within before moving forward pop the popcorn for this one  folks  it will definitely be interesting featured image via andrew harrer pool getty images
