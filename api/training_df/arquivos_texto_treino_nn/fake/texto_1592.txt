ever since donald trump won the election  unfairly  with the help of russia   americans have been calling for his removal from office  these pleas have only gotten louder as trump s presidency went on  as the incompetent potus repeatedly proves that he cannot do his job properly and is a danger to the country  and world  now that trump has passed his first  days  the calls for his impeachment couldn t be clearer  he s proven that he can t get anything done and wants to play golf instead  he s involved in numerous probes regarding his russia scandal and business conflicts  amid the controversies and a historically low approval rating  even gop lawmakers are abandoning trump at record speed   and many are calling for impeachment or for invoking the  amendment  which allows presidents who are mentally unfit to be replaced  some lawmakers have even said trump isn t going to finish his first term stephen moore  a senior economist at the heritage foundation and trump campaign adviser  commented on trump s plummeting approval rating in an interview with the new yorker  you can t govern this country with a forty per cent approval rate   you just can t  nobody in either party is going to bend over backwards for trump if over half the country doesn t approve of him  that  to me  should be a big warning sign  jerry taylor  president of the libertarian niskanen center  also weighed in on why trump s presidency is failing so quickly  the reality is  he is governing as if he is the president of a third world country  power is held by family and incompetent loyalists whose main calling card is the fact that donald trump can trust them  not whether they have any expertise  my guess is that there s only between  and  republican members of the house that are truly enthusiastic about donald trump as president  the balance sees him as somewhere between a deep and dangerous embarrassment and a threat to the constitution  sen  mark warner  d va   the top democrat on the senate intelligence committee  has even predicted trump s odds for impeachment as a striking   professor of constitutional law at harvard law school laurence tribe said that it s entirely possible that we will invoke the  amendment  well before    and that it s not a  liberal fantasy  but instead can be  an entirely plausible tool    especially in trump s case  at this point  getting trump impeached would be a blessing featured image via scott olson   getty images
