a few years ago  teenage pop star justin bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought holocaust victim anne frank would have been a  belieber   today  the  year old president of the united states and his enablers pulled a similarly bone headed stunt  bieber was  at the time  what s trump s excuse visitors to trump s mar a lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend  his staff hung banners  honoring  abraham lincoln by photoshopping a  make america great again  trucker hat onto the former president s head this is genuinely hanging in mar a lago for a dinner honoring lincoln  pic twitter com   b   bxbyrne  march    banner went up in conjunction with a republican party of palm beach county dinner to celebrate  lincoln day   honoring lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments  but connecting him to donald trump they were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well the cover of the  lincoln day dinner program for republican party of palm beach county tonight at mar a lago   wptv pic twitter com   andrew lofholm   andrewlofholm  march    only person who might find this stunt in good taste is donald trump   who recently learned that abraham lincoln was a republican  great president  most people don t even know he was a republican  right  does anyone know  a lot of people don t know that  we have to build that up a little more  the florida republicans hosting the dinner  which  itself  is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it  seemed to take trump s idea and run with it that s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking  while it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for  years would make of modern life  the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race baiting grifter like donald trump is hard to picture  trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him  adding to that  the fact that lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps america s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently i mean  seriously  look at this garbage  look  having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer  dr  john trump at mit  good genes  very good genes  ok  very smart  the wharton school of finance  very good  very smart you know  if you re a conservative republican  if i were a liberal  if  like  ok  if i ran as a liberal democrat  they would say i m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true  but when you re a conservative republican they try oh  do they do a number  it s not exactly  four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent  a new nation  conceived in liberty  and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal  if lincoln were alive today  he would probably have a really articulate  beautiful way of saying  donald trump  go screw yourself   i ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that featured image via joe raedle getty images
