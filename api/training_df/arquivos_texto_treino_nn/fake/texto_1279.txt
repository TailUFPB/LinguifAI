donald trump has been in office for several months now  and he still hasn t figured out the proper way to respond to a terrorist attack  trump demonstrated his idiocy to the world earlier this week when he responded to the terrorist attack in london by using the tragedy as an opportunity to promote his muslim travel ban trump got blasted on social media for his disgusting  insensitive response   but top democrat nancy pelosi found the perfect way to slam trump   by actually showing him how he should have responded  unlike trump  pelosi didn t blame london s mayor or use it to promote any agenda  her response was completely presidential and serves as a perfect example of how trump should behave while completely humiliating him at the same time in a beautiful statement of solidarity  pelosi said  today  the american people stand in solidarity with the people of the united kingdom  and share in the shock and outrage of this brutal attack  we send our thoughts and prayers to the fallen  the injured and those still waiting for news of their loved ones  terrorists will not succeed in dimming the strength and spirit of the people of the united kingdom  last night s vile attack   the third act of terror to target the united kingdom in three months   was met with courage and resilience from first responders and from civilian heroes who refused to be intimidated by violence and hatred  and unlike trump  pelosi reached out to our allies to send a message of unity instead of divisiveness  the united states will continue to proudly work side by side with the u k  to defeat terrorist threats and defend the security of all peace loving people  may the people of the united kingdom find solace in knowing that the american people stand with them during this difficult time  hopefully  trump will see pelosi s response and a light bulb will go off in his head  but we all know he s incapable of learning from his mistakes so that s not going to happen pelosi s response is the kind of reaction that we d come to expect from our leaders  especially after having eight amazing years under former president barack obama  unfortunately  we ve gone in quite the opposite direction under trump  every time there is an incident  trump further humiliates america and insults the world with his response featured image via alex wong and win mcnamee getty images
