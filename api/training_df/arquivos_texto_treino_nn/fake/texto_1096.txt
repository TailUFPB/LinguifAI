ever since his presidential campaign  donald trump has proven himself to be a loose cannon that no one can control  trump s administration should have known better than to try and reign him in  and to have any hopes that he might be able to restrain himself once he won the election  perhaps they would be handling his behavior better now  instead of abandoning the disgraceful potus at the moment when trump s russia scandal is exploding and he needs his team more than ever  the white house has had it with trump s incriminating twitter rants  they once tried to control trump in various ways such as keeping his schedule tight and only feeding him pro trump news  but now they re letting trump do whatever the hell he wants  to make this even worse for the abandoned man baby in the white house  his lawyers are also at their wit s end  because no one is controlling trump  he s become impossible to defend as he continues to make his scandals worse gabriel sherman stated this basically seals the deal   trump is going down  not that his team has ever been very successful at keeping him level headed  but now that they re deliberately taking a hands off approach  he is doomed  his lawyers cannot possibly compete with the amount of damaging tweets trump puts out every week  proving to the world that no one can take him down better than the man himself  trump is an absolute nightmare for a legal team  as he repeatedly sabotages all efforts to mend his scandals no one should be surprised that this is how trump s administration is going down  the entire staff is made up of incompetent people who can t stand up to trump   and he knows it  the administration was dysfunctional from day one  and proved unable to reach trump and convince him that shutting up was his best option  now  trump is left to his own devices with attorneys who don t even know how they re going to save him anymore featured image via win mcnamee   getty images
