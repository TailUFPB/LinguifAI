donald trump and the republicans are about to prove once and for all that they are incapable of governing despite having control of congress and the white house  republicans are on the verge of causing a government shutdown because trump is demanding that funding for his useless border wall be included in the budget the deadline to pass a new budget is friday  when the temporary funding bill that was passed in december expires over the weekend  trump s budget director mick mulvaney made it clear that trump is obsessed with funding the massive wall and that not funding the project would be unacceptable  this suggests that trump will veto any budget that does not include it  we ve finally boiled this negotiation down to something we want very badly that the democrats really don t like and that s the border wall   mulvaney claimed   at the same time  there s something they want very badly that we don t like very much  which are these cost sharing reductions in the obamacare payments  trump followed up with a series of tweets on sunday obamacare is in serious trouble  the dems need big money to keep it going   otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    democrats don t want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms  gang members   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april     but at a later date so we can get started early  mexico will be paying  in some form  for the badly needed border wall   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april     mulvaney and trump are literally threatening to take healthcare away from americans if democrats and republicans continue to refuse to waste taxpayer dollars on a wall that won t do anything to reduce the number of undocumented immigrants crossing into the country as the berlin wall demonstrated  people will still find a way to cross the border if they are desperate enough  even at the risk of death also  the number of people crossing the border illegally is already way down and has been for some time  the number was even dropping while president obama was in office  the drop in the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border makes trump s wall even more unnecessary the wall would not only cost billions to build  it s likely that a mexican company would be contracted to do the work and it would irreparably harm migration patterns of animals and destroy habitats overall  the wall is a bad idea  but trump is desperate to achieve anything as his first  days come to a close  trump made a lot of promises about what he would do in his first  days  and the border wall was his top promise but the wall is an unpopular idea as well  only  percent of americans support it  and republicans and democrats in the southwest agree that it shouldn t be built if trump and republicans continue to insist on wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall  a government shutdown is inevitable and democrats won t be at fault the last two major government shutdowns were in  and   in both instances  a democrat was in the white house  but republicans controlled congress in  and controlled the house in  while democrats controlled the senate  albeit without a  vote majority and the fact that republicans obstructed everything the point is  however  that the american people blamed republicans for both of those shutdowns  and they will definitely blame republicans again because republicans control the white house and congress this time republicans are literally facing a no win scenario republicans in the house and senate need democrats in order to pass trump s wall funding because  votes are needed in the senate and it s likely that hardline conservatives will vote against the budget in the house and since many republicans also don t support the wall  it s looking like trump will have to be the one to back down and we all know that trump doesn t like backing down  and that means he will be the one responsible for causing a government shutdown that will hurt our country  no matter hard hard he tries to pin the blame on democrats  democrats do not control congress  nor do they control the white house  this is all on trump and republicans featured image  mark wilson getty images
