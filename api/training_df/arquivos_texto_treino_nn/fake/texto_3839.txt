as if the election of donald trump couldn t get even more disastrous and hypocritical  senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a right wing extremist to nation s highest court all year long  republicans have been blocking president obama s nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick  and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted  they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyff tv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him  which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obama s nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election  i m here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obama s nominees  i expect them to give trump s nominees a fair shake  he won this election  he will pick a conservative  i would put ted cruz on that list  if they try to block this pick  they will regret it  if you don t honor trump s nominee  you re making a huge mistake  democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger since antonin scalia died in february  there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled  the body wasn t even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him  going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing  that s far from the  fair shake  graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against women s rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril  in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing  nor should they respect any of trump s conservative choices for the court  republicans should have thought about  fair shakes  before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump  again  senate republicans didn t even give garland a hearing or a vote  they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama  and so that s exactly what democrats should do to trump  turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame featured image  ethan miller getty images
