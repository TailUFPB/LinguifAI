during an interview on msnbc s hardball with chris mathews on friday  trump surrogate jack kingston claimed that hillary clinton was the person who started the birther movement  mathews did not hold back when he pressed kingston on the accusation that is  frankly  as absurd as the claim the birther movement originally put forth already sounding a bit peeved at the assertion  mathews asks kingston   where did you see this  kingston claims that he saw an inter party email from  that was put out by the clinton campaign  from the clinton campaign itself  you ve seen this  kingston says that he has seen a copy of the e mail  no  you can t say hillary clinton is the mother of the birther movement and not have evidence   mathews says   you knew you were coming on the show  why didn t you bring it with you  i may even have it my briefcase  chris i don t know  mathews tells kingston that the show is live and they have enough time for him to find it if it is  this is a live show  we ve got an hour  find it  congressman  dead serious  if you can find something from the clinton campaign   not some blogger out there   but somebody who actually worked for hillary clinton under her direction who said that the president wasn t born in this country that would be news  if you can produce it now  of course  kingston cannot produce any evidence because it is a lie  should such an e mail exist  it wouldn t just be news  it would be a bombshell that would severely cripple the democratic party  it probably would not convince many democrats to start buying red hats and voting for trump  though it would certainly make even her most die hard supporters cringe kingston is merely trying to deflect from the fact that trump still has not apologized for perpetuating the birther conspiracy theory  the allegations that trump put forth about president obama during the early years of obama s administration were trump s first foray into the political spotlight  his allegations were what built his base of radical right wing conservatives  he cannot apologize for fear of alienating that base of supporters trump would love for most of the world to forget that he ever was a birther  we won t  it s important  no matter how many surrogates trump s campaign throws out there to try and change the narrative surrounding the controversy  we won t forget you can watch the interview below https   www youtube com watch v  image from video screenshot
