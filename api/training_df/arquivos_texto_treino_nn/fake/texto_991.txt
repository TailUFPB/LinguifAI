donald trump woke up on wednesday morning and lashed out at the media again the temper tantrum was aimed at the new york times because they talked to a republican senator who attended a meeting at the white house trump organized to discuss the healthcare bill earlier this week  the congressional budget office reported that the trumpcare bill will cause  million americans to lose their insurance and that premiums would skyrocket by  percent on top of taking away many of the protections that the affordable care act currently provides faced with heavy opposition to the republican repeal effort  trump invited senate republicans to the white house to discuss the matter  it did not go well  the meeting went off the rails because  the senators found  trump doesn t know a damn thing about the bill according to the new york times a senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the white house with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy again  the times spoke to a person who was actually at the meeting but trump whined about the report anyway and complained that the times did not call him to confirm the story  which we all know he would not have done because trump thinks any news story about his incompetence is  fake news  the failing  nytimes writes false story after false story about me  they don t even call to verify the facts of a story  a fake news joke   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    even laughably claimed that he know all about healthcare some of the fake news media likes to say that i am not totally engaged in healthcare  wrong  i know the subject well   want victory for u s   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  june    reality  trump has admitted that he doesn t know much about healthcare in america  back in february  he told a meeting of governors that  nobody knew health care could be so complicated  apparently  trump is the only person in this country who didn t know that healthcare is a complicated issue in america  one can t exactly  know the subject well  if one has no clue how complicated the subject is featured image  joe raedle getty images
