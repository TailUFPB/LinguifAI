this house republican didn t see this humiliation coming during an interview on cnn with brianna keilar  gop rep  marsha blackburn embarrassed herself  her home state of tennessee  and the united states by making a false claim about the immigration vetting process and demonstrating her complete lack of knowledge about how our immigration system works keilar  who made a name for herself during the  election by repeatedly standing up to and humiliating trump supporters  asked blackburn for her response to the terrorist attacks in berlin  blackburn immediately began vilifying muslim immigrants in this country by claiming that they haven t been properly vetted and that our immigration system is flawed  her source  just random people she hears things from  one of the things that i m hearing from women  especially  is their deep concern over public safety and making certain we are dealing with the terrorist cells that are located in the united states   blackburn said   they re concerned about what is happening with the refugees and the realization by many people that our governors and our mayors do not know when refugee populations are coming into the communities many of these individuals are not vetted  keilar  who immigrated to america from australia  knows what the vetting process is like  so she was able to put blackburn in her place with firsthand knowledge that every immigrant  even from australia  are thoroughly vetted  can i stop you on that  really quick   keilar asked   because you said many refugees are not vetted  and i know certainly there are concerns  the vast majority of refugees are peaceful  there are many people arguing there are risks when you open yourself up to people coming into the country  but you say they re not vetted and yet  i ve gone through the process and it s pretty extensive  keilar also informed blackburn that several government agencies  including the department of homeland security are involved in the process mic  dropped and  of course  blackburn responded by insisting that all these government agencies aren t doing their jobs and proceeded to treat keilar like a child who doesn t know anything keilar once again countered blackburn by pointing out that cnn has looked into these claims and what they found proves that blackburn is only trying to spread fear to advance the gop s anti immigration agenda  when there is someone and they don t know who they are or where they re coming from  they don t let them in   keilar said   there s a process to make sure  do you know of specific instances where people are completely bypassing what is actually a quite labyrinth process to get into this county  but rather than answer the question  blackburn demonstrated that she s full of shit by evading it completely  insisting that keilar visit an immigration reception center and question the case workers keilar reminded blackburn that immigrants are vetted by the dhs and the fbi along with several other government agencies  that s when blackburn threw them under the bus by accusing them of not doing their jobs properly  she also repeatedly danced around keilar s question  proving that blackburn can t point to any specific examples of a syrian immigrant being poorly vetted here s the video via youtube the fact is that immigrants face a two year wait as they are vetted thoroughly to gain entrance into this country  they are then settled into this country after the long and grueling process and are often the targets of harassment and abuse even though they went through hell to get to the land of freedom and opportunity if and when a muslim refugee commits an act of terror  it s not that they came here with that intent  it s most likely that they were radicalized many years after they arrived here  and that s because they ve had to deal with the constant discrimination and hate from people like blackburn who demonize muslims and blame them for every problem  stuff like that pushes people over the edge plus  immigrants are less likely to commit a crime than a citizen who was born here  but you don t hear blackburn or her republican colleagues calling for years of extensive vetting for every baby born on american soil  they certainly haven t called for vetting white supremacists after they commit acts of terrorism  that s because republicans are hypocrites and are just using muslims as a scapegoat for political gain featured image  screenshot
