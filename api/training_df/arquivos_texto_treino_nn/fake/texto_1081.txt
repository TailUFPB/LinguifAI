donald trump s white house is the leakiest in living memory  this is because the people around him understand that he is incompetent and never should have been president in the first place  they simply work there to hold things together  not because they like it  working for donald trump is the hardest job in washington these days  to make that worse  trump is increasingly volatile due to the fact that he now realizes just how much trouble he could be in over the special counsel investigation into russia when a trump adviser was interviewed for a politico article on the russia scandal and trump s flirtation with ordering the firing of special counsel robert mueller  naturally at one point a comparison to president richard nixon s  saturday night massacre  was made  however  it might be nixon s ghost that keeps trump from doing it  it seems that the orange wannabe president is not oblivious to how nixonian people think he is  it has also been pointed out that many lawyers in the modern day department of justice likely would not do trump s bidding  no matter how many people he fired  brian fallon  formerly of the obama justice department and the clinton campaign says of the situation  i think the watergate scenario would make most self respecting lawyers loath to put themselves in the role that bork ended up playing  most career minded independent lawyers that have high regard for the justice department as an institution would be loath to be the modern day equivalent to bork  an unnamed adviser to trump says that trump is definitely aware of what such actions would look like  from politico but trump  too  is cognizant of the comparison to nixon  according to one adviser  the president  who friends said does not enjoy living in washington and is strained by the demanding hours of the job  is motivated to carry on because he  doesn t want to go down in history as a guy who tried and failed   said the adviser   he doesn t want to be the second president in history to resign  of course he doesn t want to look like a loser to the entire nation and world  trump only got himself elected to prove that he could do it  he never actually wanted the job  or even believed he could do it  he just wanted to prove everyone wrong and sit in the oval office like some kind of king  lording over everyone  however  he is quickly learning that the federal government is not the trump organization  and that he is not above the law  the best thing that could happen is for the whole administration to wind up in prison for treason  and we get a new election and elect someone competent to run this great nation featured image via mark wilson getty images
