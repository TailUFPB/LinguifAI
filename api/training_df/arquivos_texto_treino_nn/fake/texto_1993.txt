the fact that german chancellor angela merkel is no fan of donald trump is no secret  however  being the diplomatic  experienced world leader that she is  chancellor merkel took the time she was forced to spend at the white house with trump in stride  she smiled at the cameras at all the right times  held a joint presser with him  and was cordial to all  as real world leaders do  this all comes as trump insulted merkel more than once during the visit  we all know that he infamously embarrassed our nation by petulantly refusing to shake the chancellor s hand  and now  there is a new report out that trump actually gave merkel an  invoice  for expenses that he believes germany owes for defenses provided by the north atlantic treaty organization  nato  according to the hill via a report from the times of london  trump s insane bill  charges  merkel roughly  billion pounds  a response from a german minister on trump s childish stunt was predictably and deservedly scathing  essentially saying that merkel has no intentions of stooping to trump s level  the concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side  but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations  the same minister said that merkel  quote   ignored the provocations   of course  the white house says that trump never gave merkel the invoice  but that s likely just another lie to cover up for trump s petulant  childish  and internationally embarrassing behavior in fact  it is perfectly plausible that trump gave merkel this  invoice   because he had already had aides calculate just how much below  percent of germany s gross domestic product  gdp  was spent on nato defense in the last  years  countries within nato all commit to spending  percent of their gdp annually to support nato  trump even had the people doing the calculations add interest this is just beyond embarrassing  here is another ally we are on the rocks with  all because we have a president who acts like a whiny school yard bully instead of leader of the free world featured image cheriss may nurphoto via getty images
