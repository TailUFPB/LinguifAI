rep  adam schiff  d ca  is the ranking member of the intelligence committee in the house of representatives  he is also a rising star in the era of donald trump  due to his clever  sharp tweets  and open contempt for the man baby  president   every chance rep  schiff gets  he appears on cable news shows   and even on political comedy shows   in order to let the world know how dangerous he thinks trump is in the white house  therefore  it comes as absolutely not surprise that rep  schiff had much to say about trump s weak showing when it came to the much anticipated meeting with russia s autocratic leader  vladimir putin at the g  summit in hamburg  germany taking to twitter saturday night and sunday morning  rep  schiff ripped trump  who had just tweeted about how he pressed putin on russia s election hacking  schiff s response was brilliant putin s claim that  potus agreed with him re  hack all but inevitable after trump himself refused to acknowledge the obvious only day before https   t co blkakbuidz  adam schiff   repadamschiff  july     schiff then went on to scold trump for daring to air his hot war with the american intelligence community on foreign soil no art to this deal  what kind of  tough negotiator  goes into talks undermining his country s own position  as you did attacking us intel  https   t co   adam schiff   repadamschiff  july    s the thing   trump might want to bill himself as tough  but he is anything but  he s a russian stooge  and it s obvious putin has something big on him  there s that  and he wants to be just like putin  but never will  because he ll never have the stones to be anything close to that  further  luckily for the american people  trump is too stupid to ever turn into an actual dictator  he just plays one on television and in washington during his wannabe reality show  presidency  i love these responses from rep  schiff  he really tells it like is  that likely gets under trump s skin  further  given his position on the intelligence committee  it could very well be rep  adam schiff who ultimately  along with special counsel robert mueller  takes trump and his whole administration down  oh  wouldn t that victory be sweet featured image via steffen kugler  bpa via getty images
