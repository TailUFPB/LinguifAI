congressional republicans plan on dogging hillary and the fbi about her emails and use of a private server from now until kingdom come  it s a matter of mishandling classified info  they say  she potentially put our national security at grave risk  they claim  we have to investigate every last letter of every last word of every last sentence here  they insist  but when it comes to investigating a true threat to national security  they re blocking attempts at every turn of course  we re talking about donald trump s potential ties to russia  congressional democrats keep running into roadblock after roadblock in trying to open an investigation into that  gop staffers told the daily beast that while it seems their bosses are privately concerned about the issue  they would rather continue harping on hillary it s politics  disgusting politics that really does put us at risk  the problem is likely that trump is their nominee which really should make it all the more concerning  given the gop s apparent need to protect our security  they re angry with obama for not going after isis the way they want in addition to insisting that hillary jeopardized our security with her email server   one would think they d be all over this intelligence briefings given to both the senate and house intelligence committees point to russia using hacking as a means to influence our elections  communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since  by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the russians going by  guccifer     but analysis by private sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the russians to cast doubt on their culpability two other hacks   both of state election boards   have also been loosely tied to potential russian hackers  in illinois  thousands of voter role records were accessed  and arizona was also targeted  though nothing was done to influence elections in those states  experts believe russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election  it s true that some republicans are suffering some measure of  buyer s remorse  over the party s nomination of trump  but in blocking investigations that are this important  all they ve done is unmask themselves as the impostors they are  to some  this is black and white  kurt eichenwald of newsweek went on twitter to call them out for this blatant hypocrisy gop congress spends a year and a half investigating clinton emails  but refuses to investigate whether russia is hacking our election  wtf   kurt eichenwald   kurteichenwald  september    he s got it  republicans have attacked hillary on everything under the sun because they hate her  and they fear her  and they don t want her to be president  it s not about national security with her  they won t go after trump for something far more dangerous and frightening because they re protecting their own  it s republican politics at its finest featured image via aude guerrucci pool getty images
