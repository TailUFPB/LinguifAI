by winning the presidency  donald trump just made the world more unsafe than ever before any anti america groups who want to punish the united states and send a message to trump can easily do so by targeting trump s hotels and resorts around the globe and they will be easy targets  too  because they all have trump s name on them donald trump is about to become the face of the united states  as horrifying as that is  joy reid explained during meet the press on sunday that terrorists can now provoke trump and challenge the united states by attacking buildings with his name on them  you start to have anything with a trump name on it around the world becoming an instant terrorist target   reid said  how do we react to a world in which the name of the president of the united states is plastered all over hotels and hot spots  indeed  this is yet another reason why donald trump should sell his company  continuing to own it places thousands of people around the world at serious risk  hotels have been a prime target of terrorists for years  and trump becoming president gives terrorists a new target  if president bush or president obama had had hotels with their names on them in other nations you can bet terrorists would have targeted them as well  but they didn t  trump  however  does  and trump s thin skin makes him an even better target because these terrorists want the united states to go bankrupt with never ending wars  and if anyone will be quick to take america to war anywhere on earth  it s donald trump trump s foreign entanglements also make him and our country vulnerable reid explained that trump s foreign business ties could threaten our foreign policy because other nations could seek to re write our policy by threatening trump s businesses or calling in a debt  we cannot discount how his personal conflicts of interest wind up influencing his foreign policy   reid said   we don t know to what international banks he is in debt  we don t know the extent to which his own pecuniary interests might influence his foreign policy  if his children are still running his company and there s a hotel to be built in dubai  does that influence his reaction if the government of dubai acts in a way we don t want  in turkey or other countries  here s the video via vidme it is absolutely critical that trump put an end to his conflicts of interest  and the best way he can do that is to sell his company  because any building with his name on it will become a target of terrorism over the next four years and there is not enough security to protect every building he owns  he owns hotels in las vegas  chicago  and new york city just to name a few in the united states and he owns properties in turkey  panama  south korea  the philippines  india  panama  and uruguay  again  just to name a few so there are literally dozens of targets in the united states and around the world for terrorists to attack and trump s name will be the bulls eye  terrorists are going to attack these properties to piss trump off  and they are hoping trump will launch war after war in retaliation so that more american treasure is wasted  and more american blood in spilled featured image  wikimedia
