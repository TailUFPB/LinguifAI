again  when will conservatives learn that their hateful social media activity can cost them their employment because a real estate agent in peoria  illinois learned that the hard way this week after he viciously attacked comedian patton oswalt on twitter for posting in support of former deputy attorney general sally yates after yates was fired by donald trump for refusing to enforce an unconstitutional muslim ban trump   you leave this white house now   sally yates rides bus to city  becomes a taxi dancer  leads dance revolt against pimp  triumphs   patton oswalt   pattonoswalt  january     that was enough to set off trump supporter tony brust  who proceeded to attack oswalt with a series of tweets that have since been deleted  i tweeted out a very positive  very benign tweet in support of sally yates  and her risky stand on principle  which cost her her job   oswalt recounted on facebook   the realtor s response tweet was along the lines of   oh  the nasty little troll has another opinion  stick to show business and shut up   i m paraphrasing  another person who hates my twitter feed s content who nevertheless follows me  i tweeted out something in support of someone  he reacted with immediate disgust and offense  fine  whatever  oswalt has dealt with hateful trump supporters before so he is used to ignoring them  except this time  brust decided to make things incredibly personal and actually used oswalt s deceased wife to attack him  i m a psychic and i m channeling his wife s opinions   brust wrote in response to one twitter user who asked everyone to stop having opinions needless to say  the remark was a deep stab to oswalt  who was not having a good day his wife michelle mcnamara had passed away not even a year ago and he is still dealing with the pain of his loss as soon as brust posted his comment he had made a serious mistake as twitter users were quick to inform brust s employer of how nasty he was being on social media  not only was this twitter exchange very public  brust was using his professional twitter account to do it would ve happily ignored tony brust if he hadn t sent this tweet  but he did and it caught me at a dark moment  pic twitter com yflamusaqo  patton oswalt   pattonoswalt  january    that point  oswalt began trolling brust  and at some point  he noticed that brust had removed his social media accounts  and then oswalt discovered that brust s employer had posted a notice on the company website making clear that they did not want to be associated with him and the nasty things he said i saw that other people were giving him shit about the  dead wife  joke  i figured it was going to blow up in the poor slob s face without zero help from me  in the morning  his account was gone  he d closed it down  i assume   he d also closed down his facebook profile and professional page  and then the realty company he worked for posted a message to their website about how mr  dead wife joke did not represent their company and that he was no longer employed by them indeed  the chicago tribune tracked down michael maloof  owner of the real estate agency  and learned that brust had been fired  we were made aware that this had gone on and we parted company   maloof said so here we are once again  another trump supporter racist conservative has been fired and he only has himself to blame  rather than just simply disagree with oswalt and move on  brust chose to publicly harass a celebrity  he attacked oswalt in a way that threatened the reputation of his employer  because while businesses don t really care about the political affiliations of the employees  they definitely care about what their employers say and how they say it in public  the internet is forever and while brust deleted most of his tweets  he wasn t able to erase every one of them  and now he is unemployed for being a total dick conservatives have previously been fired for publicly attacking michelle obama using racist remarks  which cause all sorts of problems for businesses because business owners care about their reputation and image  how employees represent themselves can have positive or negative effects on the business but since donald trump took office  his supporters have been emboldened to say and do things that disgust the rest of civilized society  and they actually believe they can get away with it without consequences just because trump has taken over the white house as oswalt concluded in his facebook post  trump supporters are wrong to think that way the main thing that trump supporters are excited about  now that he s president  is that finally  at loooooong last  all of the awful things they want to say  that used to lose them friends and jobs and marriages  they re excited about potentially getting to say them with zero repercussions  just like trump did  all the way into the white house  all the way into unlimited  forever power to spew any awful shit that comes to your head and no one dares correct you  rolls their eyes  or punches you in the nose but i m afraid peoria realtor is going to be the first in a long line of trumpers who will realize  on the other side of firings and divorces and black eyes  that trump s teflon umbrella covers trump and no one else featured image via youtube
