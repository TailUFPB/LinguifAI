when one becomes any sort of public figure   especially a political public figure   one s past is often scrutinized  therefore  it is pretty much standard practice for potential campaign officials to vet the potential candidate prior to launching any sort of run for public office  however  when gop nominee donald trump s original campaign manager  corey lewandowski  sought to do this  trump himself pulled the plug on any such endeavor according to bloomberg politics  lewandowski requested that trump s past be looked into before he even filed to run for president  however  trump refused  which means that his campaign officials have been caught completely off guard by things like the lewd tape from the access hollywood bus  as well as by the subsequent allegations that he groped multiple women without their consent over the years  apparently  the same thing happened with trump s second campaign manager  paul manafort  allegedly  manafort wanted to vet trump just like lewandowski did  but was rebuffed  as a result of this  the only things lewandowski was prepared to combat were trump s monetary contributions to democratic causes and politicians  and his iraq war comments  all the rest was off limits this is exceedingly odd  considering that any information found on the part of team trump would be used to prepare for any backlash relating to things that might come out from the candidate s past  as has happened in the last week and a half or so  such secrecy would lead one to believe that there is something out there so bad that trump feared people bailing on his then fledgling campaign if they should find out about it as for trump s current spin master campaign manager  kellyanne conway  well  she s just as in the dark as her predecessors were  she went on fox news on thursday and said of the dumping of information on trump s past  i don t know what s out there  there s no way to know what is and isn t out there  ohhh  kellyanne  dear  dear kellyanne  you might not know exactly what else is out there  but you seem to be an intelligent pollster gop operative  you can figure it out  and  as a woman and as a mother  you should be ashamed of yourself for continuing to deflect and defend a man whose past includes such behavior featured image via scott olson getty images
