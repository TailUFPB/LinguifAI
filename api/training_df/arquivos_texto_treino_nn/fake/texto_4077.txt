donald trump is a lot of things  but presidential is not one of them  kellyanne conway is trump s campaign manager  so it s her job to  polish the turd  that the republican party nominated and make him something palatable to the majority of american voters  unfortunately for both trump and conway  even she doesn t believe that trump is presidential  at least that s what a video dug up by cnn s jake tapper says the subject was trump s latest obsession  which is that the election is somehow rigged against him  tapper noted  on sunday s state of the union  that there s no evidence whatsoever of election rigging  as proof  he pulled out a not so old video of conway basically saying the same thing  back in april when you were working against donald trump  when you were working for ted cruz and advising his super pac  you had some tough words for mr  trump when he was lashing out at the time against the system being rigged   tapper told conway before refreshing her memory with a video clip  we hear from the trump campaign  the rules change  it s not fair   conway had said in april   he can whine and complain all he wants that he didn t know the rules  conway  to her credit  didn t skip a beat and said   we love watching that clip together  that was about what was happening on the weekends  when donald trump would win the vote  he would basically win all the electoral votes in a state  and on the weekends  the cruz campaign would go back and follow the rules and get back some of those delegates  so no  it s not a pattern for him  source  raw storythen  she once again tried deflecting from trump s accusations that the election is rigged against him personally and said that the election is about the system being  rigged  against the  little guy  here s the video of course  trump s rigged election claims have never been about the  little guy   unless trump is trying to claim that as an alleged billionaire  born on  base  he s a  little guy  the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary   but also at many polling places   sad  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  october    image via video screen capture
