donald trump is back to his pre election habit of saying rude  dismissive  and bigoted things about black voters in america  in another of his strange post election rallies  trump brought up the topic of black voter turnout  and then proceeded to say that one set of blacks are not as good as another president elect donald trump claimed friday night that african americans came through for him  big league  in the november election and said those who stayed home were  almost as good  as those who voted for him trump s comments came during a rally in grand rapids  mich   the latest stop on an ongoing  thank you  tour of states where the republican prevailed against democratic nominee hillary clinton as has been the trend for decades  trump was trounced among black voters who voted for clinton by a margin of  percent to  percent  it s an almost standard part of republican rhetoric to ignore the lopsided vote among this key set of americans instead of denigrating the choices this group of citizens has made at the ballot box during the campaign  trump also generated a backlash among black voters  describing the black community as crime ridden and uneducated  while telling black voters they had  nothing to lose  by voting for him  a vast majority of them evidently rejected his message  perhaps in large part coming from his decision to woo white supremacist support while also supporting the racist birther conspiracy against president obama while clinton did not get as strong a turnout with black voters as obama did  she earned enough of their vote to end up with a popular vote victory over trump  leading him by   million votes and making him the second republican in  years to win the presidency without getting most of the votes perhaps if trump was less flippant or dismissive with black voters  his party would be competitive in that arena instead of the constant routs featured image via flickr
