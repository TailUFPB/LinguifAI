the only state keeping the republican party viable at the national level in presidential races is the state of texas  texas and its  electoral votes help to form the backbone in any republican quest for the  electoral votes needed to win the presidency republicans have not lost texas since   when jimmy carter defeated gerald ford after nixon resigned in the wake of the watergate scandal  whether republicans have won or lost the overall race  texas has been blood red  mitt romney won by   there in   but now with donald trump as the republican nominee  suddenly the race has seriously narrowed in texas donald trump is still winning in the deep red state  but his advantage has dropped precipitously from double digits to under  percent in the last two weeks  the last three polls in the state show him ahead of hillary clinton by only  points in a washington post surveymonkey poll   points in a university of houston poll and  points in a survey usa texas tenga poll all of those most recent polls were conducted after the oct   release of a tape in which trump bragged about sexually assaulting women  polls conducted in the prior month show the gop candidate leading by at least  and up to  points  a couple of earlier polls had signaled the race might be closer than expected  but there hasn t been consistent evidence until now a clinton win in texas isn t required for there to be considered a major ground shifting development  even a single digit texas loss would be a huge step forward for democrats there  and a shock to the system for republicans the growing latino population in texas has consistently raised democratic hopes that the state could be tipped into their column like it has been in colorado  nevada  and new mexico  democrats are also hoping for success in arizona  where incumbent senator john mccain recently denounced trump for his crude comments with billy bush things are changing in the southwest  and they might change faster than anyone expected featured image via flickr
