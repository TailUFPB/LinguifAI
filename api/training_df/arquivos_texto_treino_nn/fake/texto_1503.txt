president donald trump told his account of a private dinner he had with james comey to lester holt but now it appears a lot more happened that he didn t mention and a lot of what he said went on  didn t according to trump  the dinner was set for comey to ask to keep his job  on its face  this is farcical  the fbi director is appointed for terms of ten years so comey didn t have to ask trump to stay on  secondly  trump claims he asked comedy about any investigation into the president and that the answer was   you are not under investigation   that doesn t make any more sense comey s side of the story is a lot different  according to the new york times   as they ate  the president and mr  comey made small talk about the election and the crowd sizes at mr  trump s rallies  the president then turned the conversation to whether mr  comey would pledge his loyalty to him  when comey refused to offer such a pledge  trump persisted  while comey did say he would be honest with trump  the new york times is reporting that   mr  comey declined to make that pledge  instead  mr  comey has recounted to others  he told mr  trump that he would always be honest with him  but that he was not  reliable  in the conventional political sense  loyalty has always been super important to trump throughout his life  as a businessman  it makes sense  you need to know that your proprietary information is going to stay private  when you are the leader of the united states  or any other country   this is not the same thing  it reeks of dictatorship of course  the white house is pushing back hard on the claims that the dinner in question was not the way comey describes it  that is not surprising  the white house seems to come away from most events  from the inauguration to pretty much everything that happens everywhere  with a different view than the rest of us perhaps the best way to look at this is how former congressman john dingell tweeted it s a bit wild to see the trump administration begin the same way nixon s ended i d be laughing my ass off if i weren t so damn worried   john dingell   johndingell  may    image via alex wong getty images
