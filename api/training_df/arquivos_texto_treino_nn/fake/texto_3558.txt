ben carson dr  ben carson dr  ben carson the brain surgeon has been tapped as one of donald trump s cabinet members  now  despite carson s expertise being in medicine  donald trump has chosen carson to head the department of housing and urban development  hud   which is the agency that gives low income families access to housing despite living in the inner city of new york for all of his life  donald trump has a long habit of conflating black people with the inner city  republicans in general have that habit during the second presidential debate  donald trump was asked whether he could be a president to  all the people in the united states   he had a very specific answer   i would be a president for all of the people  african americans  the inner cities   he replied  later in the debate  he spoke again of how he was going to help  the african americans   who lived in  inner cities   suffering from high poverty rates  bad educational systems  and no jobs source  the atlanticwell  it s simply not true  most african americans do not live in the inner city and most live above the poverty line  but that doesn t stop trump and republicans from their two dimensional view of african americans  which is likely the exact reason trump chose carson as his inner city spokesperson  carson is african american  and the fact that he has literally no experience at doing anything remotely relevant to that job is completely beside the point  you see  black people  according to trump  are black before they are anything else   even black brain surgeons  am i reading too much into the nomination  well  here are trump s words  i am thrilled to nominate dr  ben carson as our next secretary of the u s  department of housing and urban development  ben carson has a brilliant mind and is passionate about strengthening communities and families within those communities   trump is quoted as saying in a statement released by his transition team monday source  washington postto be fair  carson did grow up in public housing  although  he turned his back on the inner cities and despite the fact that he wouldn t be where he is without government assistance  he  like so many republicans  wants to deprive others of government assistance and then there s the fact that he has no experience in the government  and even he acknowledged that he was too inexperienced for a position he might have actually been qualified for  his name had been fielded for being in charge of the department of health and human services  carson is reported to have turned it down  citing his lack of government qualifications so why is he suddenly qualified for hud  well  it s likely because the trump administration has no plans whatsoever to help those in need find housing  carson will be a figure head  but his skin is dark  so who better to tell poor people that they ll be screwed for the next four years featured image via ty wright getty images
