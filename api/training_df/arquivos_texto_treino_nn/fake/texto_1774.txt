of course  when there s violence in protests  we hear a lot of blame getting thrown around  however  the loudest cries of injustice always seem to come from those who don t believe injustice happens to anybody but them   the nationalist  racist  white supremacist alt right  such is the case today with the violence that erupted at the berkeley protests  the problem is  the alt right was all over twitter working to incite violence against the  antifa   or anti fascists  whom they ve branded as terrorists ignoring for a moment the fact that these guys wouldn t know what actual terrorism is if it bit them  one particular person on twitter spent much of the last six weeks telling his fellow alt righters what to carry to berkeley and how to set it up  they seem to think that attaching flags to sticks will disguise the fact that they re weapons check out what one of the  leaders   named general deplorable  posted to twitter general deplorable s diagram up there is about how to ensure those sticks always legal  so they can carry them into  battle   as well as how to put them together so they re harder for  enemies  to pull away from them  in battle  here are two other tweets that are incitements to violence as well and this is general deplorable s twitter profile pic and info  which actually contradict each other here s the thing  this crowd of miscreants calls their flag poles  based sticks   this is what they really are this is what  basedstick means  a flagpole that doubles as an insurrectionist s weapon   berkeleyprotests https   t co   marie walshe   lacanlune  april    berkeley police department sees these as weapons  in fact  any stick pole  post  or the like that can be used as a bludgeoning tool  along with anything else that can be used as a weapon  are prohibited  to listen to these guys talk on their social media feeds and on their livestreams  though  it s the anti trump protesters who started everything  and berkeley pd is horrifically biased  yet  look at what they confiscated here are some of the prohibited items that have already removed from the park today  https   t co  pic twitter com   berkeley police   berkeleypolice  april    american flags belonged to the alt right  and the black flags and red and black flags belong to what look like black bloc anarchists  lately they ve shown up at protests and rallies specifically to cause violence  they re who every  real american  conservative thinks are the  violent liberals   but they are a minority fringe group which currently lacks broad support it s not likely that they ll ever change their minds on that  either  people were arrested and of course  general deplorable and others are decrying the arrests and berkeley pd for being biased towards the anti trump side  because of course but they didn t go there to hold a peaceful rally  all of this shows that they went there specifically for violence watch a short video of melee below demonstrators are punching each other and even using skateboards and helmets as weapons in  berkeley  https   t co  pic twitter com   nbc bay area   nbcbayarea  april    image via screen capture from embedded video
