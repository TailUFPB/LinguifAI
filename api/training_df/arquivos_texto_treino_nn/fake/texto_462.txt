in between defending white supremacists and pardoning a white supremacist  donald trump makes half hearted attempts at convincing the nation that he s not racist  in reality  he s only convincing his followers  most of whom presumably have  black friends  and  don t see race  like his followers  trump has a difficult time making a convincing case that he s not racist  even when he s trying  he famously tried during the presidential campaign  when at one rally  he pointed to a man  calling him  my african american   of course  claiming ownership over another human being is always a really  really bad idea  but it s especially bad if you re trying to come across as woke  even by trump s standards what s worse  though  is that the man who trump called  my african american  wasn t even a trump supporter  and nothing has changed  except for the fact that greg cheadle is now more convinced than ever that trump is horrible for black people trump called cheadle out by skin color at a rally in june of last year watch   look at my african american over here  look at him   donald trump says while addressing man at calif  rally https   t co   nbc nightly news   nbcnightlynews  june    didn t bother cheadle  though cheadle later downplayed the exchange to npr  saying during an interview   i was not offended by it  because he had been speaking positively about black people prior to that statement  people around me were laughing  that he noticed me  and everybody was happy  it was a jovial thing  he claimed  however  that he wasn t a trump supporter and only went there to see what he was really like  i am not a trump supporter  i went to go hear donald trump because i have an open mind   he added source  newsweekof course the internet was skeptical that cheadle wasn t really a trump supporter  and it was right  cheadle is a republican and he ended up voting for trump  but mostly because he didn t like hillary it appears now that cheadle is regretting that vote  i would like for him just to show an interest in black people   cheadle said   why can t he go to a black city  why can t he trumpet black business  why can t he have more black people in his administration  he contended trump s call for  law and order  is really  code language for   we re going to arrest more black people  to put that in some perspective  he didn t think obama did enough for black people either still  cheadle hasn t completely turned on    he says his support is  on life support  after trump s charlotte comments  i m not sure what it might take for him to finally pull the plug featured image via joe readle getty images
