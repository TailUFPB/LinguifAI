donald trump has not even taken office yet and republicans are already launching a full scale war on women s rights emboldened by the thought that trump will only appoint anti choice judges to the supreme court  ohio republicans tacked an amendment on a child abuse bill banning abortion six weeks after conception known as a fetal heartbeat measure  the amendment would be the most extreme anti abortion law in the nation if governor john kasich signs it most women don t even know they are pregnant by the time six weeks passes  which means they would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term  and that includes women who are raped since the amendment did not include an exemption for rape and incest ohio senate president keith faber said his party made the move because donald trump won the election  a new president  new supreme court appointees change the dynamic  and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward   faber said if trump is able to replace deceased justice antonin scalia on the supreme court  not much would change from when he was alive since scalia was anti choice himself  however  if trump gets to replace a liberal like ruth bader ginsburg  it could tip the scales and pave the way for a ruling that destroys roe v  wade  which ruled abortion constitutional by a   margin in  in addition to the fetal heartbeat portion of the amendment  doctors would be imprisoned for performing an abortion after six weeks  which also flies in the face of the supreme court decision in roe  which barred states from outlawing abortion until fetal viability around  to  weeks of pregnancy donald trump is already a disaster for women s rights and reproductive health and he hasn t even taken office yet  and you can bet that other red states are going to be emboldened by his election as well so we will see more fetal heartbeat bills or worse over the next four years featured image  eduardo munoz alvarez getty images
