welcome to the big leagues  kid donald trump s supreme court justice only made it through senate confirmation because republicans changed the rules so they could complete their robbery of the seat from president obama pick merrick garland neil gorsuch now sits on the high court and his first day was monday  and of course  just like trump  he embarrassed himself from the get go gorsuch s first case involved a census bureau worker who had been dismissed and filed a lawsuit over it the former government employee s lawyers want the entire case to be allowed to move forward instead of only part of it being heard by the federal appeals courts  rather than keep his mouth shut and learn  gorsuch apparently decided to try to prove that he belonged there and he didn t waste time  gorsuch was argumentative and spent lots of time on wording  in other words  it looks like gorsuch is going to be an asshole judge who is going to base every decision he makes on exact wording and his interpretation of those words  he s going to nitpick and decide cases on technicalities but then gorsuch decided to go even further by changing the decorum of the court  channeling trump  gorsuch literally accused attorney chris landau of lying in open court according to bloomberg landau asked the court to let the man s entire suit go forward in a federal district court  rather than waiting for part of the case to be addressed first by a federal appeals court  when landau said he wasn t asking the court to  break any new ground   gorsuch gave a pointed response  no  just to continue to make it up   gorsuch said but landau is correct  as bloomberg points out  there is plenty of precedent of the supreme court allowing such lawsuits to move forward in their entirety  so landau really isn t asking the high court to do anything different than it has before  he s asking them to uphold precedent  something gorsuch clearly has no interest in doing regardless of what the law says but justice elena kagan was quick to put gorsuch in his place and humiliated him in the process  this would be kind of a revolution   she began   i mean  to the extent you can have a revolution in this kind of case  the room laughed as everyone recognized a good supreme court burn so just like donald trump  gorsuch is an embarrassment frankly  not only should trump be impeached  gorsuch should be impeached as well  he doesn t belong in the position he currently holds  it s clear he has no respect for supreme court decorum and that he will make partisan decisions regardless of precedent and the law  and republicans are the ones to blame for this  they chose trump to be their leader and they forced gorsuch upon the supreme court  it s up to democrats to fix both of these embarrassments as soon as they take back control of congress featured image  win mcnamee getty images
