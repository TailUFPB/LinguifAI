things got heated on  the view  on friday between whoopi goldberg and jedediah bila on the subject of planned parenthood  and bila got schooled the ladies began talking about how house republicans plan to include defunding planned parenthood in their obamacare repeal bill  which really upset goldberg goldberg went on the offensive by reminding the audience that not one dollar of federal funding pays for abortion services  but by defunding the organization  republicans would be stripping millions of low income women of vital healthcare services such as breast cancer exams  pap smears  and contraceptives that would prevent unwanted pregnancies in the first place  do people still not have their facts straight about who s going to actually be affected by planned parenthood s removal   goldberg began   there is no line item in the federal budget that goes to planned parenthood  no tax dollars  can we just say that again  because the myth of federal tax dollars for abortions has been discredited  we ve said it a million times  all those videos you keep seeing have been discredited  the videos goldberg is talking about  which she later correctly labeled as  bullshit   are the deceptively edited videos illegally recorded by anti abortion fanatics to try and portray planned parenthood as a profiteer off abortions  in reality  planned parenthood does not profit off of fetal tissue  the organization merely gets reimbursed the cost of shipping from medical and scientific organizations and facilities who need the tissue for research  the only people who are going to eat it when planned parenthood goes away are women who need the services   goldberg continued bila jumped to defend conservatives by whining about how  religious  people don t want their tax dollars going to an organization they don t agree with  and then she had the gall to claim that conservatives don t have a problem with women choosing to have an abortion  which we all know is bullshit considering all the anti abortion laws conservatives have been pushing for over the years apparently it s not  because if it was my right  you wouldn t give a crap whether i was having an abortion   goldberg fired back   whether you subscribe to people having abortions or not should have nothing to do with what i do or what i need  if i m a low income person and i ve been raped you don t have the right to tell me if i should have an abortion  and then goldberg dropped the hammer on bila by telling her that if conservatives don t want their tax dollars going to planned parenthood  then she doesn t want her tax dollars going to paying for trump s wall  look  i don t want to pay for this new wall that suddenly we are now paying for  my religious background says that i m supposed to make sure that people are serviced  that s what my religion says  i m not there to judge  god judges  i m paying for stuff i don t want to pay for  she added   i don t want to pay for a wall my thing about america is that people have to pay their fair share for things they don t like and things they do like  you may not like abortion don t have one  here s the video via youtube and goldberg is absolutely right  after all  taxpayers were forced by republicans to pay for abstinence only sex education programs that don t work  not to mention costly wars in afghanistan and iraq and let s go ahead and include the salaries of every republicans who sat on their ass and did nothing but obstruct over the last eight years instead of helping president obama rebuild america  i m sure many taxpayers object to their money being used for that as well the fact is  however  that planned parenthood provides healthcare services to millions of low income women across the country and only  percent of those services has to do with abortion  and if republicans really care about women  they ll stop trying to take their healthcare provider away from them featured image via screenshot
