president donald trump likes to call most of the press  fake  so when the white house is called disorganized or unprofessional  it is easy for him to discount the criticism  fox news  however  is one of his favorite outlets this week it is hard to call the white house anything but a hot mess  the communications office  for instance  does not seem to have any idea of what s going on  but even chris wallace  the host of fox news sunday  is saying any problems in the white house communications office should be laid at the feet of the president wallace said   one of the problems has been the disarray at the white house communications shop  the president has been blaming that on them  but the fact is it should be blamed on him  because he didn t seem to trust them enough to give them advanced notice  there have been reports that despite not having given his staff the information they needed to develop a coherent and comprehensive strategy  trump was up watching the television coverage of comey s firing  yelling at the set and blaming the people around him for not defending the decision  wallace said that he has been trying to book a white house spokesperson all week to go on his sunday show and has had no success  he said   they still haven t given us anybody  we can t even reach anybody   they re not available  they re not answering the phone  featured image via joe raedle getty images
