meryl streep and viola davis weren t the only ones who blasted donald trump at the golden globes dr  gregory house  also known as british actor hugh laurie  also won an award on sunday night for his role in the night manager and used about one minute of his speech to mock trump and republicans as we all know  trump and his republican fans hate the press  foreigners  and hollywood  so seeing as how the golden globes are put on every year by the hollywood foreign press association  it s safe to say the golden globe awards is not their favorite at all and during his acceptance speech  hugh laurie absolutely torched trump and the republican party  thank you first to the hollywood foreign press association for this amazing honor   lauire began   i suppose it s made more amazing by the fact that i ll be able to say i won this at the last ever golden globes  i don t mean to be gloomy  it s just that it has the words hollywood  foreign and press in the title  to some republicans  even the word  association  is slightly sketchy i accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere  here s the video via youtube as previously mentioned  meryl streep and viola davis also delivered blistering messages to trump  but so far  trump has only thrown a temper tantrum over streep s speech  calling her  overrated  and a  hillary flunky  on twitter  seriously many conservatives are whining about the golden globes  claiming that it s inappropriate to deliver political speech at an awards show  but the first amendment says otherwise the golden globes is a platform that reaches millions of americans so it s the perfect place to make a political stand that will be seen and heard  if donald trump and his conservative supporters don t like that  they can go f ck themselves featured image via wikimedia
