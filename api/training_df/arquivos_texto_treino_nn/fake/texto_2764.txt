ah  trump and voter fraud  the subject that he can t let go because  on his warped planet  he s so beloved by everyone that there s no way he lost the popular vote  donald trump is just not a loser in any way  shape or form  so why is it that so many people around him are guilty or caught up in one of the things he himself decries  being registered to vote in more than one state  his chief strategist  steve bannon  is guilty of that  which is bad enough what s worse is that the person trump is getting his   million people voted illegally and if it weren t for them i d have won everything  information from is likewise registered to vote in multiple states the associated press has learned that gregg phillips  who praised true the vote for allegedly uncovering  thousands of duplicate records and registrations of dead people   is registered to vote in alabama  texas  and mississippi  three states this is proof that voter fraud is rampant  har de har har don t make us laugh too hard  it hurts now   gregg phillips  isn t exactly a unique name  what the ap found  though  was that all three of these registrations had identical social security numbers  that makes it a little harder to claim that these registrations are to three different people who all happen to have the same name this is the guy who tweeted  back in november  that he had evidence of three million people voting illegally and then never provided or published said evidence  but trump jumped on it anyway  which is dangerous as hell phillips is on twitter now  pretending that it s voter fraud in every case except for his ap just wrote and said i am still registered to vote in ms  a place i haven t lived for  years  makes my point  elections are broken   gregg phillips   jumpvote  january    that s a fair point  what phillips totally fails to mention  because of course he does  is that it also illustrates the fact that being registered to vote in multiple states isn t indicative of voter fraud at all  instead  it shows that the states aren t psychic  most people registered to vote in multiple states didn t do that intentionally   they moved away  or died  and the states didn t realize that all these people vote multiple times except for the two anal pustules known as trump and phillips sure  right  there is no proof there  and if trump wants to pretend there is  then he s got to find better evidence than one man who s registered to vote in three states trump and his little bestie here  at least  insofar as voter fraud is concerned  need to shut their goddamn mouths on this once and for all featured image by andrew harrer via getty images
