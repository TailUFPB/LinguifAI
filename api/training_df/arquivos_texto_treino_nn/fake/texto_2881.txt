donald trump is moving the united states closer to a war with china over some tiny islands the relationship between the united states has been cordial and peaceful for decades now  but trump plans to change all that  for someone who claims that our military is depleted  trump sure has no problem putting our country on the brink of war china is currently making claims to islands in the south china sea  which is an international body of water  the matter could probably be settled through diplomacy  but trump has chosen to bully china instead  and he is inviting a catastrophic war in the process according to reuters the comments at a briefing from white house spokesman sean spicer signaled a sharp departure from years of cautious u s  handling of china s assertive pursuit of territory claims in asia  just days after trump took office on friday  the u s  is going to make sure that we protect our interests there   spicer said when asked if trump agreed with comments by his secretary of state nominee  rex tillerson  on jan   that china should not be allowed access to islands it has built in the contested south china sea  it s a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of china proper  then yeah  we re going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country   he said tillerson s remarks at his senate confirmation hearing prompted chinese state media to say the united states would need to  wage war  to bar china s access to the islands where it has built military length air strips and installed weapons systems the strong language suggests trump is considering military action or a naval blockade to keep the islands out of chinese hands  but even chinese state media has warned that such action would lead to war between the two nations and that would be a catastrophe  not only would this be a war between two nuclear powers  it would be a war between the two largest economies in the world  which means a war between china and the united states would have serious global ramifications but war is apparently what trump is thinking about as he has repeatedly treated china with antagonism since before election day and americans should not expect our allies to help us either  if trump starts a war with china  america would be on its own  our troops would be fighting and dying because of trump s fragile ego  the deficit and the national debt would also skyrocket  especially since trump has promised corporate america that he will cut their taxes in half  which would deprive the government of revenues to keep our military strong  that means trump will get the revenues from the middle class and the poor china s military and navy are improving rapidly  and they are the most populous nation on earth  that means trump would have a reinstate the military draft he himself dodged during the vietnam war to get enough soldiers to put on the front lines  even thinking about a military confrontation is insane the longer trump is allowed to remain in office  the more dangerous he becomes  this country is now on a path to a war that will cripple our nation and trump doesn t give a damn because he thinks it makes him look tough  in reality  it just makes him look like an idiot featured image  spencer platt getty images
