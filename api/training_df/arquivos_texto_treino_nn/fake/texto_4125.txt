this lack of oversight proves that donald trump is totally unfit to be president earlier this week  the republican nominee winked at birthers by inviting president obama s estranged kenyan muslim half brother as his honored guest for wednesday night s debate between himself and hillary clinton it s trump s way of trolling president obama and giving a not so subtle shout out to all the conservatives out there who believe the sitting president of the united states is a secret muslim who was not born here in america but trump and his campaign team clearly did not do their homework on malik obama  because despite trump s claims that he will be tough on terrorism  trump s guest is allegedly a supporter of hamas  an anti israel group that denies the holocaust and commits acts of terrorism to achieve their ultimate goal of wiping israel off the map the times of israel reports in january  the daily mail uncovered a photograph showing malik obama with a traditional arab headscarf decorated with slogans of the palestinian terror group hamas the scarf  called a keffiyeh  was draped around obama s neck and carried the arabic phrases for  jerusalem is ours   we are coming  and  from the river to the sea   both popular hamas chants the photograph was taken at a  conference in yemen here s the image via twitter trump fan   estranged obama bro wears hamas scarf blaring  jerusalem is ours we are coming     from the river to the sea    greenfootballs  pic twitter com   noga tarnopolsky   ntarnopolsky  october    inviting malik obama to the debate  trump has said  i look very much forward to meeting and being with malik  he gets it far better than his brother  trump apparently doesn t get it at all after spending all of that time accusing president obama of supporting terrorists and hating israel  trump literally is welcoming a man who actually does as a supporter of his campaign wow  how can trump and his supporters actually look themselves in the mirror without seeing the word  hypocrite  tattooed on their foreheads featured image  drew angerer getty images
