legendary news anchor dan rather just gave us a new name to use when referring to those who deny climate change and facts in general as we all know  trump supporters and conservatives now think science and anything the media reports is a hoax  instead  they live in their own little echo chamber where they will only believe what right wing media tells them to believe but dan rather has come up with a new name to call them in a facebook post  rather talks about how he once visited the northwest passage to report on climate change and how warming temperatures are going to one day melt all of the ice and open it up  well  the new york times now reports that temperatures are spiking in the arctic  and rather s report is actually happening with his lifetime  i think at this point  we can stop calling them climate change deniers   rather wrote   reality deniers is closer to the truth  a few years back  i traveled to the famed northwest passage  to report on how climate change might eventually melt the icy blockades which had thwarted explorers for centuries  well  later  seems to have become much sooner than scientists expected and the leader of the reality deniers is about to take over the white house  indeed  donald trump is the king of denying reality and he apparently intends to pretend that climate change is not real and wants to purge the government of employees who research it  which is why he sent a letter to the energy department demanding the names of people who work on climate change and the labs where climate change research is taking place this is dangerous to our country considering that sea level rise will likely wipe out the coastline if we continue to deny reality and do nothing to prevent these impending disasters climate change is real and those who refuse to believe the scientists are going to pay the price for their ignorance featured image  larry busacca getty images for ifp
