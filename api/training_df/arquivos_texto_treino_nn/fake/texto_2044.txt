trump s disgusting brand of misogyny was laid bare for all to see during the election cycle and it should have sunk him  because he literally bragged about sexually assaulting women by kissing them without waiting  and also saying women would let him  grab them by the pussy   because he was famous  if you thought that his being elected would have toned that down  you thought wrong  and he doesn t seem to care who s around when he gets lewd and disgusting like that last month  japanese prime minister shinzo abe met with trump at his mar a lago resort in florida  these kinds of meetings often require translators  and in this case  the translator was a woman  and trump couldn t stop thinking about her  from vanity fair  intage trump is not going anywhere anytime soon  a couple of weeks earlier  during a visit by the japanese prime minister  shinz  abe  the president told an acquaintance that he was obsessed with the translator s breasts although he expressed this in his own  fragrant fashion  seriously  he said  practically right in front of another world leader  that he was obsessed with a woman s breasts  was his mind even on the meeting or was he just staring at her breasts the whole time those comments  which trump and his loyal subjects dismissed as mere locker room talk  led to men assaulting women on subways and sidewalks  literally yelling   grab her by the pussy   trump normalized objectifying and assaulting women because hey  if he can do it  then why can t everyone and he s still at it  now the question is  how often does this happen while he s meeting with diplomats and world leaders  what about the foreign press  does he do this all the time  and nobody says anything  he s not just a joke  he s a vile  disgusting pig of a joke featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
