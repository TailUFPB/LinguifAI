president elect donald trump recently asked his advisers how many nights a week he would have to spend in the white house  trump  who obviously feels being president is a part time gig  wants to spend as much time at his ritzy penthouse in manhattan as possible  previously  it was believed that melania trump would move to washington but that s not going to happen future first lady melania trump and  year old son barron will not be moving to the white house after donald trump s inauguration in january  according to the new york post barron is halfway through a school year in new york  melania is extremely close to barron  and they have become closer during the campaign   a source told the post   the campaign has been difficult for barron  and she is really hoping to keep disruption to a minimum  according to another source  the future first lady will travel to the white house as needed  but her primary focus is on her son  melania is very supportive of her husband and is fully on board of doing everything that s needed as first lady   said the second source although no plans are in place  the source said it s possible that melania and barron may move to the white house at the end of the school year the president elect has been using trump tower as his headquarters which has raised concerns over security costs for the city it s cool with us if melania wants to remain in new york city but if michelle obama had made this same choice  the outrage from conservatives would have been deafening  and we think it s great melania has a close relationship with her young son  mrs  obama enjoys an amazing relationship with her daughters  too  however  she did move them to the white house where first families live  it s called a double standard the role of the first lady includes acting as white house hostess  we re wondering if ivanka will fill the role of first lady in melania s absence now  barron s tuition as the private school is approximately    photo by chip somodevilla via getty
