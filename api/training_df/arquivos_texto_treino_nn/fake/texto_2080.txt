the investigations into the trump russia scandal are an increasing problem for trump as he desperately tries to steer any and all spotlights away from him and onto  well  pretty much everything else  unfortunately for him  rep  adam schiff drew an absolutely brilliant map between trump and russia during his statement this morning schiff left absolutely nothing out of his statement  his map is as follows schiff does acknowledge that all of this could just be a bunch of wild coincidences  but with a caveat  is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated  and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence  yes  it is possible  but it is also possible  maybe more than possible  that they are not coincidental  not disconnected and not unrelated  and that the russians used the same techniques to corrupt u s  persons that they have employed in europe and elsewhere  we simply don t know  not yet  and we owe it to the country to find out  he s right  when mapped out  this string of  coincidences  is pretty damning indeed  we need an investigation  and if trump really were innocent  he and his minions would likely not be trying to deflect  they d be saying   go ahead  investigate us  investigate to your heart s content  you won t find anything  but they aren t  this scandal is about to blow up again  watch schiff s full statement in the videos below featured image by drew angerer via getty images
