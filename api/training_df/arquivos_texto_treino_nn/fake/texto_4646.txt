if you haven t noticed  donald trump isn t quite the epitome of the average working american  he s a guy who was born into wealth  got his start through his father  and claims he s a terrific businessman  as the old saying goes  he was born on third base but thinks he hit a triple out on the campaign trail pointing out this utter disconnect between trump and working america is none other than president obama  the president can t seem to quite wrap his head around the fact that people would choose a man who can t relate whatsoever to the plight of working america to represent them while speaking at a rally for hillary clinton  obama said  really  this is the guy you want to be championing working people  this guy who spent  years on this earth showing no concern for working people  this guy s suddenly going to be your champion  he spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could  and now this guy is gonna be  the champion of working people   huh  i mean  he wasn t gonna let you on his golf course  he wasn t gonna let you buy in his condo  and now suddenly  this guy s gonna be your champion  and the answer to that would be  no  he s not  trump is only in this race for trump and no one else  that s been made clear from the start watch the president go after trump and his bold claims to be best for american workers here obama says trump has never been a champion for working people   he wasn t going to let you on his golf course   https   t co kouzvjrewd  nbc news   nbcnews  september    image via video screen capture
