donald trump has been obsessed with the fact that he lost the popular vote to hillary clinton ever since the election results came in  not satisfied with the electoral college victory that handed him the white house  trump has continued to double and triple down on an insane and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud is what cost him the popular vote well now  with the power of the presidency behind him  trump has taken a terrifying step  saying he will open a  major investigation  into the  election  he also seems to be laying the groundwork for even more voter suppression and disenfranchisement of voters who are least likely to vote for him  he tweeted early wednesday morning of his plans i will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud  including those registered to vote in two states  those who are illegal and    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january     those registered to vote who are dead  and many for a long time   depending on results  we will strengthen up voting procedures   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    makes this even more disturbing is that trump s attorney general pick  alabama senator jeff sessions  has a long and storied history of opposing civil rights  and specifically voting rights  this is just a way for republicans to sow discord and deny facts  and to help assuage trump s ego by allowing him to make himself feel better in this new world of  alternative facts   that white house counsel kellyanne conway infamously pushed on sunday this is dangerous beyond anything we ever could have imagined  we have a conspiracy theorist as president  who also happens to be a narcissistic madman who cannot accept the truth  even worse  he has people around him who are defending his antics  and who are perfectly willing to lie to the american people about the most trivial of matters  if they ll lie about this  what else will they lie about this administration is a threat to our democracy  regardless of political ideology  it has to be concluded that trump is undermining the fabric of our republic before our very eyes featured image via drew angerer getty images
