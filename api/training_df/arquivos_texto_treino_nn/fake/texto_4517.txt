another day  another racist dog whistle echoed by donald trump  while the urban unrest in charlotte  north carolina continues  trump   in a pathetic attempt to sound presidential   blamed the rioting on drug use  without citing any facts to back up his claim the comment  made in a speech in pittsburgh  was off script  if you re not aware  drugs are a very  very big factor in what you re watching on television  somehow  everyone but donald trump is unaware of the  factors  contributing to a legitimate unrest that stems not from drugs  but from the black community being continuously fed up with racial injustices and the murders of unarmed men who posed no credible threat to law enforcement what donald trump is seeking to do is sow the seeds of a racist  stereotype that plagues this country  blacks are on drugs  and it makes them violent the facts are out there  white people do more drugs  and serve less time  this notion that because black americans are fed up with injustice is somehow attributed to drug use or a yearning for drugs is  yes  racist  it reaffirms people s ignorant and misguided stereotypes about urban black communities while simultaneously deflecting from other drug crises that are affecting white communities at much more critical levels recent findings in the american journal of public health  the abuse and dependency on  hard drugs  are less common among delinquent african american youth than those who are non hispanic white   white people  in general  are also more likely to deal drugs than black people  so the people selling drugs to our kids  parents  and members of the community are more likely to be white than black  but yet black people are still seen as the culprits of america s drug problem and donald trump s claim  no matter how minuscule it may be  just makes the problem worse instead of accusing black americans of being drug induced degenerates  maybe trump should travel up to new hampshire and maine  where an unprecedented opioid addiction is killing hundreds of white citizens every year  and nothing is being done to combat it donald trump says the unrest in charlotte would not happen in a trump administration  would new england s drug epidemic be stopped under his administration  would the killing of unarmed black people   which is the only contribution to the unrest   stop in his administration  would he end the dog whistle stereotypes that continue to blatantly fester in people s minds  regardless of what the facts are trump s going to get a huge wake up call with black voters in november if he keeps this up featured image via sarah d  davis getty images
