with donald trump throwing a twitter tantrum from the very early morning throughout the afternoon on sunday  it makes you wonder what exactly he plans to do once he s actually inside the oval office  he clearly has anger issues and he doesn t know how to handle any sort of conflict  especially criticism against him he s even been saying that he won the popular vote which he so very clearly did not  because hillary clinton currently holds a   million vote lead that continues to climb  then he says that there was voter fraud in other states in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide  i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    voter fraud in virginia  new hampshire and california   so why isn t the media reporting on this  serious bias   big problem   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november     of course  being states hillary won  so of course he s saying there s fraud there since the states he supposedly won are the ones currently being looked at for a recount  he s throwing his typical  i know you are  but what am i   behavior that he became notorious for over the course of the entire election he is literally spiraling out of control noticing this clear spiral was none other than snl alum and entertainer extraordinaire  rachel dratch dratch tweeted out the obvious that no one seems to want to point out  the fact that no one seems to have the power to take his damn  phone  away makes me extremely nervous about all the other buttons  the fact that no one seems to have the power to take his damn  phone  away makes me extremely nervous about all the other buttons  rachel dratch   therealdratch  november    is exactly right  if he can t control his twitter habits  and no one else seems to be able to control him either  what the hell is going to happen when he gains control over our military  or scarier yet  our nuclear codes  it s absolutely horrifying it s certainly going to be an interesting next few weeks as recounts get underway featured photo by brad barket  drew angerer getty images
