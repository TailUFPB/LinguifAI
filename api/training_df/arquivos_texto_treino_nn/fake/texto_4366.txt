in a surprising twist  former homeland security secretary michael chertoff announced that he will be throwing his support behind hillary clinton rather than donald trump chertoff s endorsement isn t shocking just because of his work with president george w  bush s administration or because he is a prominent republican  indeed  in this respect  he simply joins an ever growing list of influential conservatives and ex bush officials who have decided that they simply cannot support the gop s orange hued nominee chertoff s support comes as such a surprise because he was one of the prosecutors during the congressional investigation into the whitewater controversy  which involved the clintons and their real estate investments chertoff  who served as the lead gop counsel on the senate whitewater committee  told bloomberg that threats of terrorism override all the  insignificant  issues that were so prominent in the   and with these threats in mind  hillary clinton is clearly the better option for the presidency  i realized we spent a huge amount of time in the   on issues that were much less important than what was brewing in terms of terrorism   has good judgment and a strategic vision of how to deal with the threats that face us   he said  people can go back decades and perhaps criticize some of the judgments that were made  that is very  very insignificant compared to the fundamental issue of how to protect the country  the breaking point for chertoff was last week s presidential debate  trump s sense of loyalties are misplaced   he said  chertoff said he will be backing clinton and cited various comments trump has made about foreign policy as his primary reason  some of our nato allies sent troops overseas  at the same time  he is defending russia and trying to dismiss what was widely acknowledged to be russian intrusions into the databases of our political parties and political figures   chertoff explained according to the long time republican  trump s comments about russia during the debate were the equivalent of making enemies of your friends and cozying up to your adversaries  trump s fat shaming of a former miss universe didn t sit well with chertoff either  this issue came up at the debate about miss universe   he said  referring to alicia machado  a clinton supporter  not only did he seem at the debate to lose his temper  but to get up at   a m  and reach for your smartphone is to me a hysterical reaction   chertoff said of trump s late night twitter tantrum   if you re president  the button you reach for is not the twitter button  it s the nuclear button  the whitewater controversy started as an investigation into real estate investments the clintons had made in arkansas when bill was governor of the state  they had invested in the whitewater development corporation and lost money on the venture featured image via justin sullivan getty images
