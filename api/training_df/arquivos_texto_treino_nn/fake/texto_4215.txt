while holding back tears in manchester  new hampshire on thursday  first lady michelle obama addressed the sexual assault bombshells that have been raining down upon the republican nominee for nearly a week now mrs  obama has mostly tried to refrain from commenting on trump s sexual misconduct towards and remarks about women  but she felt she could no longer hold back  she roundly condemned trump and explained how his remarks make him totally unfit to be president  the fact is that in this election  we have a candidate for president of the united states who  over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign has said things about women that are so shocking  so demeaning  i simply will not repeat anything here today  and last week  we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women  and i can t believe that i m saying that  a candidate for president of the united states has bragged about sexually assaulting women  and i have to tell you that i can t stop thinking about this  it has shaken me to my core in a way that i couldn t have predicted   she continued  telling the audience that she can t  pretend  that everything is normal because it would be  dishonest and disingenuous for me to move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream  this is not something we can ignore  it s not something we can sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season  because this was not just a lewd conversation  this wasn t locker room banter  this was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior  and actually bragging about kissing and groping women  using language so obscene that many of us are worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the tv  to make matters worse  it now seems very clear this isn t an isolated incident  it s one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life and  have to tell you that i listened to all this  and i feel it so personally  and i m sure that many of you do too  particularly the women  the shameful comments about our bodies  the disrespect of our ambitions and intellect  the belief that you can do anything you want to a woman  it is cruel  it is frightening  and the truth is  it hurts  it hurts  unlike many republicans who think otherwise  michelle obama made it clear that trump is not a role model for children and urged parents to protect their kids by voting against trump on election day  in our hearts we all know that if we let hillary s opponent win the election  then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they re seeing and hearing is perfectly okay  we are validating it  we are endorsing it  we are telling our sons that it is okay to humiliate women  telling our daughters that this is how we deserve to be treated  that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable  is that we want for our children  let s be very clear  strong men  men who are truly role models don t need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful  here s the full speech via youtube donald trump is a disgrace to this country and our values  and it looks like only the american people can stop him  because republicans are too cowardly to strip trump of the nomination and admit that they were wrong to make him the leader of their party  this national nightmare needs to be put to an end once and for all and the only way to do that is to defeat trump by a landslide in november featured image via screenshot
