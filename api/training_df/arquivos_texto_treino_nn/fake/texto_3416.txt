there are several movements out there to try and stop trump from officially becoming president and most of them center on the electoral college now  alexander hamilton wrote  in federalist   that the purpose of the electoral college was to prevent unqualified individuals  like demagogues such as trump  from assuming the highest office in the land  one lawyer  who s actually a former presidential candidate himself  says that at least  republican electors are ready to uphold hamilton s ideal and reject trump we need  of them to flip their votes to anyone else  while it s unlikely they ll vote for hillary instead  just denying trump the minimum  votes he needs to secure the white house could have a major effect on how congress decides the issue  according to larry lessig  who is a constitutional law professor at harvard  obviously  whether an elector ultimately votes his or her conscience will depend in part upon whether there are enough doing the same  we now believe there are more than half the number needed to change the result seriously considering making that vote  lessig s anti trump group  known as  electors trust   has been giving legal counsel to republican electors who don t want to vote for trump  they ve also been giving these electors a way to discuss their intentions privately  which is extremely important given that trump has threatened to destroy any of  his  electors who don t vote for him of course  the rnc disagrees with this statistic vehemently  they ve been conducting a whip operation  which is basically an effort to ensure that all their electors plan to vote  properly   they re only aware of chris suprun  a texas elector who has gone on record numerous times as saying he s unable to vote for trump  he s also been trying to convince his fellow republican electors to follow his lead why would any republican elector openly admit to the rnc that they re considering casting their votes for someone else  that s one thing the rnc doesn t seem to be considering  in fact  they re acting clueless about the discontent over trump that exists within their party and frankly  most of us would lie through our teeth if we were afraid an autocratic  thin skinned  egotistical manchild of a cheetolini was going to try and ruin us for defying him this isn t set in stone  and we only have five days left before the electoral college formally recognizes or denies donald trump  so there s no time to lose  if there s anything you know of that could help convince more republican electors to drop trump  now s the time to do it featured image via drew angerer getty images
