as of tuesday morning  it seemed that trump was still obsessed with the size of his inaugural audience  he s so intent on proving that his crowds were enormous big enough to serve as evidence of his total  utter and complete awesomeness that he s planning to post a panoramic photo of the inauguration in the press halls of the white house  and he tweeted it out with a thank you to the photographer ordinarily  that would just be another facepalm worthy tweet  however  given his fixation on crowd sizes  penis sizes  maybe both   we can probably safely assume that he s putting these photos in the press halls as a giant  told you so  to the press that so shamefully refused to report the truth about his crowds  based on that  one would also assume he d want the photo to be as accurate as possible  so as to avoid any potential embarrassment it didn t work  here s the photo image via twitterand here s the problem  the caption reads  january      which is the date of the women s marches that so enraged him over the weekend image via twitteras ms  kalb points out  he s posting an error in the press halls  way to stick it to them  cheetolini this follows not just the poorly thought out presser on saturday  where sean spicer scolded the entire white house press corps and left them with their jaws on the floor  but it also follows yesterday s press briefing where spicer whined that the press isn t focusing enough on trump s successes and achievements  he s been in office for five days  what successes does he think the press should be reporting on right now   the man is ridiculous  there are more important things to think about  trump  however  is obsessed  and the reason it s important to keep pointing this out is because it s evidence of his instability  his willingness to turn lies into truth  and his inability to actually be a real leader featured image via twitter
