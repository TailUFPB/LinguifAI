as we all know  republican presidential nominee went to mexico last week in an attempt to look presidential  while on the surface it may have seemed that he succeeded at first  we soon learned that this was not the case  when asked about whether or not he and president enrique pena nieto discussed payment for trump s infamous border wall  trump lied  and president pena nieta called him on it via twitter  there s that  and we saw a tale of two trumps that day  as when the real estate tycoon returned to the united states to do a rally in arizona  he went right back to his hardline stance with a vengeance   so much so  in fact  that the republican national committee dropped plans to praise trump because the speech was so hateful well  to hear trump tell it  one event eclipses those mishaps to make trump s trip a roaring success  the fact that one of the organizing officials of the trip from mexico was just fired  trump said wednesday evening during nbc s commander in chief forum  we ve been badly hurt and if you look at the aftermath today  the people who arranged the trip in mexico have been forced out of government  that s how well we did  and that s how well we have to do  no  mr  trump  this is not an indicator that your trip was a success  quite the opposite  in fact  the official who was forced out of office  finance minister luis videgaray  left because the mexican people have witnessed the appalling disrespect trump has leveled at them throughout his travesty of a presidential campaign  and they did not want him in their country  videgaray was a main champion of the trump visit  and therefore it is damage control with the population of that country who are rightfully outraged that sparked this person s removal from office  that is the opposite of success then again  it s trump  and therefore he can t help twisting the facts to make himself look good  so  no surprise there  the trip wasn t a success  in fact  it was clearly anything but featured image via by alex wong getty images
