the state of michigan has  since the gop takeover of   been a petri dish for libertarian republican policies  and nearly all of them have been complete and total failures while most of the nation knows about the water crisis in flint  michigan  in which the town s residents are drinking lead filled water because republicans insisted on changing the source of flint s water in a money saving exercise there have been fewer headlines about another of michigan s experiments  people who occasionally need help from the government have long been demonized by republicans  it s assumed that somehow  just because someone is poor  they are somehow pulling something on the rest of us  clearly  that makes no sense at all  but the stereotype lives on  most predominantly  republicans insist that poor people must  just must  have substance abuse problems  so before being given the most paltry sustenance possible  they must be tested  that s what michigan is doing  they are drug testing some welfare recipients  guess how many positive results came up  none  not a single one this wasn t done on a particularly large scale  republicans passed a new law two years ago that allowed the state to drug test any welfare recipients that might be suspected of drug abuse  after the law passed  michigan did one intelligent thing  they tested it  for one year beginning in october of   they tested  potential substance abusers out of  welfare recipients dhhs conducted the pilot in allegan  clinton and marquette counties between oct      and sept      the report said although a total of  people in those counties were either receiving or applied for cash assistance during those  months  previous court decisions limited the actual drug testing to individuals who failed a substance abuse screening test the report said that  of the  people were identified as potential substance abusers  of those    were already getting treatment through community mental health  three had their cases closed for other reasons and  went through the screening test source  michigan liveone of those tested  was found by a clinician to have a reasonable suspicion of use of a controlled substance and require a substance use test   the person agreed to the test  but the case  for some reason  was closed prior to the test  not a single other person even raised a red flag these results are hardly surprising  in states where they have enacted drug testing for welfare recipients  the results have been similar it s doubtful these results will do much  republicans feel that poor people must be punished  that any assistance must be micromanaged  while corporate welfare needs no oversight whatsoever in   despite lack of evidence that programs in other states accomplished their goals  three more states have implemented similar regimes  and a thinkprogress survey of the  states that now have these programs in place found that they continue to be expensive and not especially effective  all told  states spent another     on the testing regimes in  to uncover just  positive tests in more than one state  none at all this came after a february  thinkprogress examination of the seven states that had implemented drug testing programs for tanf applicants and or recipients  at that time  those states had spent about   million to create and implement a complicated system of screening and urine testing and found just  drug users in other words  this supposedly fiscally conservative position is not at all about saving money  it s expensive and punitive  but hey  it s trump s america  where being an unscrupulous billionaire gets you the presidency and being legitimately poor labels you a criminal featured image via sean gallup getty images
