republicans are literally using every excuse they can come up with to avoid investigating donald trump after years of frivolously investigating hillary clinton and president obama  republicans are refusing to investigate trump over his various ties to russia  which includes russia interfering in our election process on his behalf and michael flynn illegally negotiating with russian officials about the sanctions put in place by president obama and lying to mike pence about it republicans have claimed that investigating trump would be a waste of time and money  conveniently ignoring the fact that they wasted millions and spent years investigating benghazi  an investigation that surpassed the   and watergate investigations as the longest in american history  and that effort turned up nothing however  republicans know that if they investigate trump they will end up actually finding evidence that would warrant immediate impeachment  and they don t want to lose their rubber stamp in the white house and piss off conservative voters in the process house intelligence chairman gop rep  devin nunes is even going so far as to claim that such an investigation would be a witch hunt similar to mccarthyism  this is almost like mccarthyism revisited   nunes said at a republican convention in california   we re going to go on a witch hunt against  against innocent americans  you read that right  nunes actually just claimed that trump and his accomplices are totally innocent even though the evidence is stacking up according to nunes  the intelligence community has no evidence of trump and his administration doing anything suspicious  at this point there s nothing there   nunes continued   once we begin to look at all the evidence  and if we find any american that had any contact with russian agents or anybody affiliated with the russian government  then we ll be glad to  at that point  you know  subpoena those people before the house and let the legislative branch do its oversight and then we would recommend it over to  you know  the appropriate people  of course  that s complete bullshit  not only did the intelligence community agree that russia interfered with the election  michael flynn was forced to resign for being in contact with russian officials prior to trump taking office  also  trump and his team are trying really hard to kill any talk of an investigation  even desperately asking the fbi to shut it down trump s business has ties to russian oligarchs who are close to vladimir putin  trump s taxes would probably show his ties to russia but he refuses to release them because they would incriminate him russia has literally been a scandal for trump since before election day and it has only continued to get bigger since he took office last month but nunes is ignoring all of that  claiming that an investigation against trump would be  against the american people   he also subscribed to trump s claim that the media is  fake news  at this point  we can t go on a witch hunt against the american people  any american people who have not had any contact just because they appeared in a news story   nunes concluded again  this is outrageously absurd  the only reason republicans don t want to investigate trump is because they don t want to investigate one of their own  if trump were a democrat  republicans would have impeached him on day one  it is the duty of congress to investigate trump s russia scandal  that s not mccarthyism because joe mccarthy accused hundreds of people of being communists without any proof whatsoever  there is a lot of proof that trump is in bed with the russians  but republicans are hypocrites and that s why they should all be thrown out of office in  so that democrats can take over congress and impeach trump and his entire administration featued image via andrew harrer   pool getty images
