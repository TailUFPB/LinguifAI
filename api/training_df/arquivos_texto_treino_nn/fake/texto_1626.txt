fox news made a desperate effort to convince everyone that donald trump is having more economic success than president obama did  and it was shamefully dishonest trump has been touting his first  days as the best since world war ii despite the fact that his first three months in office have been a complete embarrassment  no major legislation has been signed and trump has issued a ton of destructive executive orders trump has been especially bragging about the economy  and fox news tried to help him by comparing the economy after trump s first  days with the economies under obama  george w  bush and bill clinton in their first  days dow jones industrial average   change after first  months in office  trump vs  obama vs  bush vs  clinton  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  april    wages after the president s first  months in office  trump vs  obama vs  bush vs  clinton  pic twitter com kmjqhbteed  fox news   foxnews  april    rate after first  months  trump vs  obama vs  bush vs  clinton  pic twitter com   fox news   foxnews  april    added during first  months   trump vs  obama vs  bush vs  clinton  pic twitter com pabpjhfnin  fox news   foxnews  april     fox news apparently ignored the fact that presidents inherit the state of the economy from their predecessors for instance  president obama inherited the great recession from president bush  which is why the economy during his first  days stood in shambles as   million jobs were lost  unemployment topped  percent  and gdp dropped by  percent in other words  president obama was not responsible for those economic losses  but he did reverse them after eight years in office  president obama managed to bring down the unemployment rate to   percent  oversaw the longest streak of job creation on record and created   million jobs  obama s best year for average gdp growth was in  at   percent  but he did have many months that topped three percent  and he did all of this despite republican obstruction at every turn donald trump inherited obama s economy  which is why he is touting it as his  achievement  the fact is  however  that we won t really know what trump s economy will be until his policies take effect so far  trump has touted   jobs created  but that number is lower because he included the entire month of january  which rightfully should be in obama s column  trump s first three months in office also shows a gdp of   percent  far lower than the  percent he promised on the campaign trail but again  trump inherited obama s economy  so he owes the positive growth rate that he is starting with to president obama when it comes to wages  trump also doesn t have a leg to stand on  many states passed laws increasing the minimum wage in  and   many of which went into effect this year  meanwhile  the federal minimum wage remains at    an hour  republicans refused to raise the federal wage during obama s presidency  trump himself opposes raising the minimum wage and his first labor secretary appointee supported killing minimum wage laws entirely  republicans also still largely oppose the minimum wage  with that much opposition to minimum wage  including trump s own opposition against it  he can hardly take credit for the minimum wage boosts that have occurred these graphics were incredibly misleading and were clearly designed to make trump look good at the expense of president obama  but the tweets backfired spectacularly as twitter users pointed out that they were not only lies  but demonstrated that republican presidents inherit good economies from democratic predecessors  foxnews what a stupid comparison  obama inherited bush s   trump inherited obama s  the rate of job growth has declined       under trump   william legate   williamlegate  april    foxnews fixed it for you   foxnews pic twitter com   danny sullivan   dannysullivan  april    foxnews fox just proved that republicans leave office with high unemployment rates and democrats fix it   tony posnanski   tonyposnanski  april    foxnews this is an ad for democrats   matthew savener   msavener  april    foxnews the most misleading statistic imaginable  are fox viewers really stupid enough to fall for this shit   wideangle   wideangle  april    gourmetspud  foxnews they keep running this bullshit  it just indicates the terrible economy that clinton   obama inherited from their gop predecessor   kevin bartner   heshsson  april    foxnews that s a dumb tweet  here s some labor data https   t co blvrnosxzw pic twitter com   robert maguire   robertmaguire  april    foxnews looks like clinton and obama did a great job of setting up their successors  who then screwed things up  thanks clinton and obama   alex zalben   azalben  april    democratic presidents have inherited economic messes and have left the economy in much better shape for their gop successors  got it  https   t co   julie roginsky   julieroginsky  april    news just got owned featured image  win mcnamee getty images
