president obama couldn t be more different from his successor  donald trump  obama has so much class and grace  as for trump  well  not so much  their responses to the death of fidel castro say so much about who these men  and their supporters by default  really are  and the differences between them are abundantly clear obama responded with respect and compassion  his carefully crafted words are just one more example of the quiet dignity we have come to expect from this man and his family  here is what the president had to say on castro s passing at this time of fidel castro s passing  we extend a hand of friendship to the cuban people  we know that this moment fills cubans   in cuba and in the united states   with powerful emotions  recalling the countless ways in which fidel castro altered the course of individual lives  families  and of the cuban nation  history will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him for nearly six decades  the relationship between the united states and cuba was marked by discord and profound political disagreements  during my presidency  we have worked hard to put the past behind us  pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends   bonds of family  culture  commerce  and common humanity  this engagement includes the contributions of cuban americans  who have done so much for our country and who care deeply about their loved ones in cuba today  we offer condolences to fidel castro s family  and our thoughts and prayers are with the cuban people  in the days ahead  they will recall the past and also look to the future  as they do  the cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the united states of america trump s response had none of the elegance that president obama is so well known for  naturally  trump started off with a tweet fidel castro is dead   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  november    trump was slammed for his four word response  he released a statement that was every bit as crass and hateful as you would expect from a bombastic billionaire who built his campaign on fear and bigotry today  the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades  fidel castro s legacy is one of firing squads  theft  unimaginable suffering  poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights while cuba remains a totalitarian island  it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long  and toward a future in which the wonderful cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve though the tragedies  deaths and pain caused by fidel castro cannot be erased  our administration will do all it can to ensure the cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty  i join the many cuban americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign  including the brigade  veterans association that endorsed me  with the hope of one day soon seeing a free cuba trump s statement  when compared to president obama s response really does say it all  doesn t it  we are in for a very long four years  here s to hoping the  election comes before the four horsemen featured image via sean gallup getty images and scott olson getty images
