donald trump swears he had no idea that former national security adviser  michael flynn  had lobbied for turkish interests  none at all  mike pence says he was also clueless that flynn had basically been a foreign agent  hearing that story today was the first i d heard of it   pence told fox news  bret baier on thursday night now  this may come as a shock to you  but they lied  i know  i know  who d of thought something said by the trump administration would turn out to be a steaming load of crap   insert eye roll here  business insider reports that  rep  elijah cummings  the ranking member of the house committee on oversight and government reform  sent sent pence a letter on november  requesting more information about the potential conflicts of interest posed by flynn s lobbying work  recent news reports have revealed that lt  gen  flynn was receiving classified briefings during the presidential campaign while his consulting firm  flynn intel group  inc   was being paid to lobby the u s  government on behalf of a foreign government s interests   cummings wrote  lt  gen  flynn s general counsel and principal  robert kelley  confirmed that they were hired by a foreign company to lobby for turkish interests  stating   they want to keep posted on what we all want to be informed of  the present situation  the transition between president obama and president elect trump   when asked whether the firm had been hired because of lt  gen  flynn s close ties to president elect trump  mr  kelley responded   i hope so   between august and november of last year  flynn s consulting firm was hired by turkish businessman ekim alptekin to lobby the u s  government for the extradition of  fetullah gulen   a turkish cleric living in pennsylvania who erdogan believes is responsible for planning last year s attempted coup and generally fomenting dissent inside turkey  flynn resigned as trump s national security adviser after he was busted in shady talks with russia  he claims he acted alone and it was all harmless  but that seems unlikely to anybody wth even the tiniest shred of common sense  now  he is at the center of yet another scandal with foreign powers cummings said that if pence had listened to him months ago the administration might have been able to avoid the problems that have occurred with lt  general flynn  in addition to being in the press  i warned the vice president directly three months ago about the conflicts created by lt  general flynn s company lobbying on behalf of turkish interests   cummings said  if the vice president had heeded my warnings  it s clear now he could have prevented the problems that occurred with lt  general flynn  republicans in congress are doing a disservice to the white house and our national security interests by not conducting rigorous and serious oversight of the administration  especially to help catch issues early and address them  featured image via alex wong getty images
