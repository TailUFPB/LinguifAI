congressman jason chaffetz s decision to leave congress means that bad things really are on the way for president trump  if his presidency lasts the year  i will be shocked  i will eat a hat if that happens chaffetz has been a real star in the gop  he is known for his ambition  last november  he won about  percent of the vote in his district  he s young  he s good looking  he knows how to get all the right press and do what he needs to do to get ahead  nothing in his actions in the past would indicate he wanted to leave washington  dc  at least not yet  rumors have been going around that he had his eyes on senator orrin hatch s  r ut  seat or possibly the governor s mansion in utah  no one expected him to leave congress so soon after winning reelection by such a large margin at the same time  the congressman has not been a true believer in trump  last fall  after the now infamous billy bush tape was released  he told abc news   i don t plan on voting for donald trump   this is quite the quandary what the nation s going to have to figure out  i m out  i can t support trump after his lewd comments   he went on to talk about his daughters and how he could not defend what trump said about women  he later went back on that and said that he hated what trump did but hillary clinton was just so much worse at the start of   things were looking good for the young utah politician  chaffetz was still the chairman of the powerful house committee on government oversight and reform  he had a fellow  republican  in the white house  his party had the house  the senate and the white house  i can imagine him dreaming of all of the legislation he could push through this way and then it all went wrong  trump is not a real republican  he has no real ideology  his only real allegiances are to his own ego and self interest  the things he says and promises he makes are valid only as long as he is voicing them  they then disappear into the proverbial ether  they have no meaning this wasn t the problem  however  since inauguration day  there have been more complaints and problems with the trump administration  trump s ties to russia are more than problematic  they could be treasonous  his financial dealings may not meet violations of law  he cannot have conflicts of interest legally  he can have them  he admitted in  that he had a  big conflict of interest with turkey because i have a hotel in istanbul   his frequent trips to mar a lago mean that the government is paying him every week to stay at his resort  he is still benefitting from all of his businesses and there is no reason to believe foreign leaders car a wit about the emolument clause  and these are just a few of the scandals that should be investigated by a committee like the one chaffetz now heads this has put chaffetz in a really tough spot  he has access to information we all do not  if all of what do do know is as bad as it is  one only can wonder what things he has seen  on one hand  he cannot just step down from this committee  he cannot start investigations of a president in his own party  especially if he knows they will blow it up  he also cannot be a party to trump s misdeeds this month  chaffetz found his exit strategy  quit congress  he has done it slowly  first  he announces he will not seek reelection  next  he hints that he may not serve out his term  his next move will be to quit all together  by august  he will be back in utah  he has already taken several web domains like www  com  he claimed he wanted to be with his wife and children and that was why he was leaving  keep in mind  his children have lived at home while he has been in congress  that s ten years away from his kids when they lived at his house in utah  by the summer  they will all be out of his house  so  this is when he goes back to see them more  just after they all leave his home  no chaffetz sees the writing on the wall and does not want to be taken down by the same scandal that will end the trump train wreck chaffetz isn t alone in this thinking  it was reported earlier this spring that michael steele  former chair of the rnc has been telling his clients to  start getting close to pence  former chairman of rnc steele told wwr at lunch that   realdonaldtrump will not finish his term  advises clients to bolster ties w vp pence  west wing reports   westwingreport  march    president mike pence has the same thought  his is a true believer evangelical christian  he once voted to take money away from hiv aids funding to give it to  pray away the gay  programs  he does not go to events with women when alcohol is served  unless his wife is there  he has said he is worried he will  be tempted   he made female staffers leave early so he would not be alone in the office with then  he could not have liked the comments that trump grabbed women  by the pussy  chaffetz had a bright future at the beginning of the year and the only way to make that still happen is to get the hell out of dodge  so that s what he s doing featured image via matt mcclain the washington post via getty images
