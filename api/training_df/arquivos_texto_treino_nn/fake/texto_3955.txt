donald trump s wife melania  who became infamous for copying first lady michelle obama s speech word for word at the republican national convention  recently gave yet another memorable speech this week  this time  she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying   a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on on thursday  trump deputy campaign manager david bossie got called out by cnn s jake tapper over melania s anti cyberbullying comments  which eventually turned into an insane conversation about trump s sexual assault allegations  tapper pointed out how aggressive trump is over the internet when he said  i don t know any major public figure in america who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than donald trump  if it s not okay for kids to do it  why is it okay for donald trump to do it  bossie defended his boss  and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that trump doesn t cyberbully  mr  trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media  that s not cyberbullying  cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things  mr  trump takes on those who take him on  the interview got even more insane when tapper grilled bossie on trump s misogyny and rape accusations  pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse trump of sexually assaulting them  bossie completely denied facts  leaving tapper stunned  as bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true  tapper fired back with several facts about what trump has been accused of over the last several weeks   which made bossie look like an absolute idiot  the last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for bossie  and it is awesome you can watch tapper handle the stupidity of the trump campaign below featured image via video screen capture
