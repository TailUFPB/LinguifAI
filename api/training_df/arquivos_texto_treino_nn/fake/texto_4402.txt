while trump is busy lying about an adult film in a sorry attempt to shame former miss universe  alicia machado  his own skeletons are coming out of the closet  and we don t mean about his extramarital affairs  it seems that  while he was married to his second wife  marla maples  he tried to force her to pose nude for playboy  as their centerfold he didn t even let her participate in the negotiations  really  he was on the phone to playboy negotiating her mega fee for her  as evidenced by all three of his wives  all trump has ever wanted his women to be are trophies  showpieces  ornaments  arm candy  having a wife in playboy would have been wonderful for his image as a ladykiller marla  though  didn t want to participate  from the original  sun sentinel story on the issue  donald doesn t want marla to look like she s against ivana   says trump s p r  guru chuck jones   donald wants picture approval  donald says to emphasize her early years  notably  she did resist trump s insistence that she accept playboy magazine s million dollar centerfold offer   trump himself was on the phone negotiating the fee   remembers a top playboy editor   he wanted her to do the nude layout  she didn t     i m thankful for my body  but i didn t want to exploit it   marla offers   how would i ever be taken seriously    here s an image of the original piece  lpdonovan nifty find  trump pressuring his future wife to pose for playboy  personally negotiated the fee  pic twitter com   jeff nichols   backwardsriver  october    wouldn t have wanted marla to be taken seriously   he didn t take her seriously himself  otherwise he wouldn t have done this to her  she was a sex object  nothing more  and he wanted to parade her around as proof of his manly virility this probably wasn t anything like the first time he did something like this  either  trump also allegedly tried to coerce female staffers into posing for playboy  too  how anybody could think that s okay in the context of the workplace is beyond us  he wanted a layout called   the girls of trump   and it would have featured the hottest women he had on his staff  more evidence of his manly virility while playboy has run similar spreads  none of the companies named in those spreads either requested or sanctioned the layouts  trump did  but the spread never happened  he has zero right to shame alicia machado  even if she had appeared in an adult film featured image by diane freed via getty images
