the latest results are in and things are looking pretty bleak for president trump   as of monday  practically every single poll had donald trump plummeting in the ratings  however  the support of his impeachment was steadily rising and has now actually overtaken the president s approval rating yes  even when the margin of error is factored in  more u s  voters are in support of trump s impeachment compared to those that simply support him as the president and it doesn t really come as much of a surprise when one considers the events of the past week  first  trump pulled the u s  out of the paris climate accord  then there was the way he responded to the london terror attacks  undermining london mayor sadiq khan with a twitter tirade that continually took one of khan s comments completely out of context  add to these the ongoing probe into russia possibly having a hand in helping him win the u s  presidential election and trump is not a particularly popular man at the moment according to a gallup poll published on monday  trump s approval rating dropped from almost   prior to the weekend down to    inching ever so closer back to his all time low of   back in march  on the other hand  a politico morning consult poll published the same day found that almost   of american voters are in favor of beginning the official procedure to have trump impeached despite there being no exact concrete number for where the president s approval rating stands  every poll reflected the exact same pattern over the course of the weekend following trump s decision on the paris agreement  that includes polling sites such as rasmussen reports  ones that lean more than just a little to the right  still showing that   disapprove of the president s tenure while trump might have achieved a personal high approval rating of   after his first official overseas trip as president  he is now rapidly approaching the territory of the lowest approval rating in the history of modern american politics featured image via win mcnamee getty images
