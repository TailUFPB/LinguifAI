rather than just wish america a happy easter and move on  donald trump spent sunday morning whining about the tax march protesters tax season gave americans across the country the perfect opportunity to target trump and his refusal to release his tax returns during the campaign  trump promised he would release his returns after the election but quickly rescinded that promise because it s clear his tax returns include many things he wants to hide  including his ties to russia so protests broke out over the weekend demanding that trump finally release his taxes his response was to complain about how he shouldn t have to release his taxes since he  won  the electoral college  of course  you won t hear trump talk about the popular vote since he lost that by  million votes i did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a republican easily won the electoral college  now tax returns are brought up again   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april    then accused the protesters of being paid to organize against him someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday  the election is over   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  april     trump will apparently say or do anything to ignore the fact that people really do hate him and want him impeached his constant response to people protesting him is to brag about the election even though he colluded with the russians to win at this point  it s surprising that the american people haven t marched to the white house and dragged trump kicking and screaming out of office but instead  they mocked him repeatedly on twitter  realdonaldtrump show them if it s no big deal  mike denison     april    realdonaldtrump did you win the popular vote lololol  mike denison     april    realdonaldtrump if you ve got nothing to hide  release them  what s the problem   emma kennedy   emmakennedy  april    realdonaldtrump winning the electoral college is not that difficult for a republican  winning the popular vote  on the other hand  is hard  as you well know  simon hedlin   simonhedlin  april    realdonaldtrump i don t think the constitution says that presidents who win in a landslide have the right to be less transparent with the american people   simon hedlin   simonhedlin  april    realdonaldtrump you mocked romney for not releasing his returns until late   what would candidate trump say to president trump  https   t co ywoxqfyurk  simon hedlin   simonhedlin  april    realdonaldtrump if your tax returns aren t a big deal  why are you avoiding protesters  release your returns  pic twitter com widvruprod  jordan uhl   jordanuhl  april    realdonaldtrump trump lost the popular vote by  million and barely won the electoral college  ranking  out of  elections hardly counts as  easily  pic twitter com   robert maguire   robertmaguire  april    trump is a coward and a liar  he refuses to release his taxes because he has something to hide that would surely get him impeached  frankly  he should be impeached now just for refusing to release them featured image  olivier douliery pool getty images
