these deplorable people are just incapable of taking personal responsibility for their own words and actions racism was one of the central themes of donald trump s campaign  so much so  that white supremacists and kkk members flocked to support him but  of course  conservatives are defending trump by blaming it all on president obama while walking through a diner interviewing white people to get their thoughts on the election  abby huntsman talked to a man named dan who claimed that racism didn t start until president obama first took office eight years ago  apparently  this jackass literally thinks racism didn t exist before  he began by claiming that the reason people are protesting donald trump is because they were indoctrinated in the schools as kids  it starts in the elementary schools where they re just brainwashing kids   dan claimed   our history is really not our history  but they re rewriting history  the only ones rewriting history in this country are racist conservatives who want to pretend that the civil war wasn t about slavery  that slavery was just some kind of worker exchange program  and that moses was a founding father  seriously when asked what he would say to the protesters  dan said   grow up  it s disrespect for the law  disrespect for authority  this is coming from a man who probably hoped conservatives would attempt a bloody coup if hillary clinton had won  i don t seem to remember any conservatives calling those threats  disrespect for the law   the hypocrisy is strong in this one then dan insisted that everything  started going downhill  in  when president obama was first elected  dan accused obama of being a racist and claimed that he defended  every  black person who broke the law  because he   he was himself a racist   dan told huntsman   and  i mean  that s harsh but he was  i mean  he defended every black person that caused a crime  no  he wasn t  president obama was merely calling out the documented excessive use of force some police officers have been using against people of color  that s not racist when huntsman expressed doubt about dan s accusation  he went even further by claiming that president obama s policies are racist  but that s not true either  president obama has taken a lot of flack for not focusing as much on specifically helping the black community  in fact  his policies  such as obamacare  helped people of all races  including dan  get health insurance that they couldn t previously afford that s just reality here s the video via youtube you have to wonder who conservatives are going to blame when they no longer have president obama to point their grubby little fingers at featured image  screenshot
