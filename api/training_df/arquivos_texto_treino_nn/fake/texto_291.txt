trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about puerto rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure  claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized  the response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this  this is an island surrounded by water  big water  ocean water  he also said  this is a thing called the atlantic ocean  this is tough stuff  gee  these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated  with this administration   it s really difficult  we re doing all we can   is code for   i don t really care about this at all unless i can find a way to make myself look good here  but are we really having problems because puerto rico is an island  making it different than florida and texas  which were also devastated by hurricanes  current evidence suggests otherwise  supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives  and too many blocked roads  one has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the puerto rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed  one person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms  that suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there  that would be a failure on our part  not puerto rico s but then there s how obama handled natural disasters on islands  in   haiti  which is practically next door to puerto rico in the caribbean  not the atlantic ocean   suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake  despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake  we had plenty of warning for maria   president obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war   according to the washington post  within two days  we had   troops on their way to the disaster stricken country in less than two weeks  we had   troops on the ground   military helicopters dropping supplies  and  navy ships aiding the relief effort  eight days after maria swept over puerto rico  we only had   troops working relief there  along with   members of the coast guard  only  choppers were working to deliver supplies the morning after haiti s quake  obama told the military that they were  going to respond in port au prince robustly and immediately  and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose   rajiv shah  who led usaid when the earthquake struck  said  we were able to move more quickly in a foreign country  and with no warning because it was an earthquake  than a better equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory  the posse comitatus act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory  and by contrast  haiti is a foreign country  our military response would be considerably different just because of that  but there were over   troops from  states on the ground in florida after irma  and the administration keeps saying that puerto rico isn t asking for very much  despite residents running out of food  drinkable water and other supplies  and san juan s mayor breaking down over the trump administration saying the response has been good there are complicating factors  it s true  but this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the white house when responding to disasters  particularly those where people are dying  obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming featured image via chip somodevilla and mark wilson getty images
