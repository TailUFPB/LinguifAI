conservative pundit erik erikson is weighing in on donald trump s decision to blab highly classified information to the russians during a closed door meeting at the white house and he is vouching for at least one of the sources in a blog post on his website  the resurgent  erikson said that usually  he takes  these stories about the president with a grain of salt   but this time  things are different because he knows that the information is coming from a credible source whom he knows personally  he notes that the source is actually very pro trump   or at least has been and was during campaign   erikson explains that since trump refuses to accept any advice or criticism  members of his administration  are left with no other option but to go to the media  leak the story  and hope that the intense blowback gives the president a swift kick in the butt  perhaps then he will recognize he screwed up  i am told that what the president did is actually far worse than what is being reported  the president does not seem to realize or appreciate that his bragging can undermine relationships with our allies and with human intelligence sources  he also does not seem to appreciate that his loose lips can get valuable assets in the field killed   erikson writes  you can call these sources disloyal  traitors  or whatever you want   he continues   but please ask yourself a question   if the president  through inexperience and ignorance  is jeopardizing our national security and will not take advice or corrective action  what other means are available to get the president to listen and recognize the error of his ways  erikson concludes by affirming his absolute belief that the information about trump sharing top secret info with russia is credible   this is a real problem and i treat this story very seriously because i know just how credible  competent  and serious   as well as seriously pro trump  at least one of the sources is  featured image via olivier douliery   pool getty images
