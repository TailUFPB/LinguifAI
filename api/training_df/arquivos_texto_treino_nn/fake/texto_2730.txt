many people have looked to donald trump s son in law  jared kushner  to be a moderating influence on the erratic behavior of his father in law  this is largely true  but there s just one problem  from sundown on friday until sundown on saturday  kushner observes shabat  as he and his wife and children are orthodox jews  that means that trump is left unattended with people like chief strategist stephen k  bannon and political operative stephen miller influencing his every move and appealing to his worst instincts this seems to be the reason that some of trump s biggest  most controversial and bumbling moves have happened on weekends   because these are things far right extremists like bannon and miller are all for  while kushner never would have allowed them to happen if he could help it  according to a source close to the situation  the timing of these blunders is no coincidence  here are just a few items that have occurred in kushner s absence and of course  we re less than two weeks into the trump presidency  so who the hell knows what is coming next  well  it seems that kushner is not happy with any of these developments at all  he is reportedly increasingly uneasy at the influence of far right extremists like miller and bannon on trump in his absence  further  it seems that there is an intense power struggle within the white house  and kushner seems to be losing  he is incensed at that development as well  he spent copious amounts of time setting up a call between trump and mexico s president  only to have trump blow the whole thing up by impulsively tweeting that he should not meet with president enrique pena nieto if there would be no wall payment  according to vanity fair  kushner was  quote   fucking furious  in short  trump is taking his marching orders from bannon and miller  and not kushner  and that isn t good for anyone  kushner might be a rich  slimy sell out  but at least he seems to be able to control trump s worst instincts  now that said control seems to be badly slipping  we should all be very afraid featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
