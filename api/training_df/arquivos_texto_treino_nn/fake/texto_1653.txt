what did he know and when did he know it  these iconic questions are swirling around president donald trump and his former national security advisor michael flynn  with the new revelations that received money from both the russian and turkish governments  it appears team trump is either about as incompetent as many critics believe or liked flynn enough to overlook clear violations of the u s  constitution and the law  the u s  constitution prohibits members of the military from taking any money from foreign governments  despite this  flynn registered as a foreign agent after he left the administration  no title of nobility shall be granted by the united states  and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them  shall  without the consent of the congress  accept of any present  emolument  office  or title  of any kind whatever  from any king  prince  or foreign state  even retired members of the military can be called back at any time so it is important that there be no conflict of interest  as a lobbyist for turkey  earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  it is hard to see how flynn could have anything but such a conflict  both the department of defense and the house committee on government reform and oversight are looking into flynn  the problem is that team trump is refusing to turn over the documents they used to vet the former general congressman elijah cummings  d md  was not happy with this situation  the ranking member on that committee said   i honestly do not understand why the white house is covering up for michael flynn  it makes the american people think the white house has something to hide  there is obviously a paper trail that the white house does not want our committee to follow  for its part  the department of defense s inspector general is looking into flynn s association with russia and turkey  he had been warned by the agency against taking these payments the white house has had several explanations for why it is not turning over what they used to vet flynn  they claim they do not have anything that was used before january   they then claim that the documents they have are  too sensitive  to turn over  when all of that didn t work  they fell back on an old standby  they blamed president obama  the obama administration fired flynn white house press secretary sean spicer said this   my only point is that when general flynn came into the white house he had an active security clearance issued during the obama administration with all of the information that s being discussed that occurred in   so  i guess my only point is to explain how the process works and who adjudicated that  after flynn was fired  trump stood by him calling flynn  a good man  and blaming the media for his departure from the administration  flynn says he told team trump of his dealings with turkey  it seems they knew about what flynn was doing and just didn t understand how serious it was and what the implications for our national security are  it will be impossible to know without a subpoena featured image via mark makela getty images
