representative devin nunes  chairman of the house intelligence committee  said on wednesday that the democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into russia s interference in the  presidential election  we re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the democrats aren t really serious about this investigation   he told reporters  according to politico this is the same nunes who snuck onto the white house grounds to meet an unnamed source last week  then switched cars and ditched aides  then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president donald trump  nunes  while refusing to name his source  said that he had seen evidence that trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election the top democrat on the committee  adam schiff  and other democrats  are calling for nunes to recuse himself from the russia probe  nunes has refused to do so nunes alleges that the democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies  according to politico  so  at the end of the day here  we re going to get to the truth  we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation   nunes said nunes  who literally went around the very committee he chairs  to bring trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the white house  claims that democrats aren t serious about a probe into russia s meddling of our election sure  accuse the other side of what you re guilty of  rep  nunes so far  only one republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for nunes to recuse himself from the investigation  hopefully  more republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future photo by win mcnamee getty images
