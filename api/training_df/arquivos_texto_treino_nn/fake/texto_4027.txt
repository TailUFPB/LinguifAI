jill stein  green party candidate for president of the united states  has made her case this election by painting herself as being the anti hillary clinton  she claims that clinton s ties to wall street and her more  cozy  feelings towards big corporations and polluters make her a faux progressive  so stein claims that she is the true outsider progressive who has the people s best interest at heart and that she will end the too big to fail mentality on wall street but her investment portfolio shows something completely different uncovered by the daily beast  stein has millions of dollars worth of investments in the very entities she rails against in her faltering presidential campaign according to the financial disclosure form she filed with the u s  office of government ethics on march     stein and her husband  richard rohrer  have investments  with the exception of real estate  valued at anywhere from     to       stein told the daily beast she inherited  over a half million dollars  from her parents   we don t know their exact net worth because filers are only required to provide a range of the value of their investments as opposed to exact values those investments  which but stein s net worth in the millions  what an outsider   are held in mutual funds or index funds which provide more consistent  safer returns than individually picked stocks stein is invested in stein also has       invested in a fund that represents raytheon  which is the fourth largest defense contractor in the world and relies heavily on military contracts so all of these entities  in which opposition to has been the cornerstone of stein s campaign  are also her biggest benefactors financially for years jill stein has made it her mission to paint hillary clinton and other democrats as backstabbing  two faced  corrupt shills while glorifying herself as a goddess in the progressive movement  meanwhile  she s been padding her net worth thanks to big oil  big pharma  wall street and defense contractors of course the stein campaign refused to take any shred of responsibility  telling the daily beast like many americans who hold retirement accounts  pension funds  or who invest in the american economy  my finances are largely held in index funds or mutual funds over which i have no control in management or decision making  sadly  most of these broad investments are as compromised as the american economy degraded as it is by the fossil fuel  defense and finance industries she also left out the part where she could  if she really was the principled candidate she says she is  forgo these investments and invest the money somewhere else while it s true that stein would not have control over the investments of the funds she invested in  she did have a choice of whether to invest in these funds to begin with  in the past  political candidates  in an effort to avoid a conflict of interest or have their judgment called into question  have invested their entire portfolios in u s  treasuries  cash cash equivalents  in socially responsible index funds  or clean energy funds  in her statement  stein said that she has  explored  more socially responsible funds but  found their investments in fracking and large scale biofuels not much better than the non green funds  i have not yet found the mutual funds that represent my goals of advancing the cause of people  planet  and peace  but apparently big pharma  oil and wall street investments do ladies and gentlemen  jill stein  america s hypocrite of the year featured image via drew angerer getty images
