if there is anyone who is a thorn in the side of the donald trump administration  it s msnbc host rachel maddow  she is relentless in her thorough and well thought out journalism  exposing trump for the fraud that he is in yet another report  while many think if trump is impeached or forced to resign mike pence will take over the role of president  maddow is letting america and the world know he may go down with the ship maddow reports  mike pence had been the head of the trump transition  as such  he would have been intimately involved with the selection and vetting process for a job as important as national security adviser  nevertheless  vice president mike pence has professed absolute ignorance of any of the scandals of any of the foreign payments  contacts and all the rest of it surrounding mike flynn  pence was the leader of the transition  as leader of the transition  he was notified in writing by members of congress about flynn s apparent financial ties to the government of turkey  the transition was also apparently notified twice by flynn s own lawyers about his financial relationship with the government of turkey  but nevertheless  vice president mike pence says he has no idea about any of that  further  vice president mike pence claims he had absolutely no idea about that despite him being notified about on the record multiple times and it being a matter of considerable public discussion  mike pence s role in the mike flynn scandal is flashing like a red beacon for anyone who sees him as the normal republican in this setting  maddow is absolutely correct  there is no way  with all this information coming out  that pence was left completely in the dark with no knowledge of what has been going on  if trump is going down  pence will undoubtedly go down with him   as he should watch maddow here featured photo by justin sullivan getty images   ht politicus
