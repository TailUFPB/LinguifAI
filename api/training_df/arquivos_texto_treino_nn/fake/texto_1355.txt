it was recently reported that someone within the highest ranks of the trump white house was being looked at in the trump russia investigation  now  nbc news is reporting that it is indeed donald trump s son in law and closest adviser  jared kushner  who the fbi suspects of having a hand in the potential collusion between the trump campaign and russia in an effort to fix the  presidential election it seems that the agents probing this incredibly complex and sprawling case believe that kushner knows more than he is letting on when it comes to what happened between the russians and the trump campaign in the efforts that very likely had a significant effect on the outcome of this election  and thus undermined our democracy and changed the course of history  despite all of this  it is important to note that the investigation does not put kushner on the same level as people like fired campaign chair paul manafort and disgraced national security adviser michael flynn  both of those former trump confidantes are actually targets in this investigation  in fact  flynn has even defied congress on the issue of subpoenaed documents  still  though  kushner is a senior adviser to trump  and has the highest security clearance  which allows him access to the nation s most sensitive secrets  if he is potentially compromised by the russians  this is a very serious situation indeed as is always the case in such situations  kushner s legal representative  jamie gorelick  has released the following statement  mr  kushner previously volunteered to share with congress what he knows about these meetings  he will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry  this is more than just an inquiry  someone in the highest levels of our government  in the inner circle of this alleged  president   inside our white house  is somehow possibly connected to the meddling in our democratic process by a foreign adversary jared kushner needs to be removed immediately  with his security clearance revoked  of course  with the gop controlling everything  that won t happen  because they put party before country  and they don t care how dangerous this is be very  very afraid  america featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
