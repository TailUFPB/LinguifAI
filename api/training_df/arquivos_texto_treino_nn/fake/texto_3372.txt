republicans who defend russia and vladimir putin are disgraces to our country ever since the cia and  other intelligence agencies concluded that russia interfered with our election to help donald trump become president  conservatives have been scrambling to defend our longtime enemy trump and his team want everyone to ignore the facts and just let trump become president even though he is illegitimate because russia swayed voters by hacking our institutions  even the fbi agrees with the cia  but republicans don t care because russia helped their candidate win  if russia had helped hillary clinton win  you can bet that republicans would be screaming bloody murder and threatening impeachment along with endless investigations because they are total hypocrites when it comes down to it during his final press conference of   president obama shamed republicans for abandoning american values by approving of what russia did and favoring vladimir putin  who will now have a puppet in the white house after january  unless the electoral college rejects trump on december   unless the american people genuinely think that the professionals in the cia  the fbi  our entire intelligence infrastructure  many of whom  by the way  served in previous administrations and are republicans  are less trustworthy than the russians  then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say   obama said  they can impact us if we lose track of who we are   obama continued about russia   they can impact us if we abandon our values  president obama explained that putin can weaken us if we  buy into notions that it s okay to intimidate the press  or persecute political opponents or discriminate against others  obama then slammed republicans for being so anti democrat that they ve started to view russia and putin favorably and then he invoked ronald reagan to demonstrate just how shameful republicans are acting today  there was a survey some of you saw where   now this is just one poll  but a pretty credible source     of republican voters approve of putin  over a third of republican voters approve of vladimir putin  the former head of the kgb  ronald reagan would roll over in his grave  and how did this happen  it happened in part because for too long everything that happens in this town  everything that s said is seen through the lens of does this help or hurt us relative to democrats or relative to president obama  obama concluded by predicting that we will continue to be  vulnerable to foreign influence  unless republicans change here s the video via youtube rather than admit that trump is an illegitimate president elect  republicans would rather defend russia so they can have power  that s really what this is about  they are absolutely okay with russia meddling in our elections as long as they are the ones who benefit from it  that undermines our democracy and damages the integrity of our elections  it also opens the door for foreign entities to meddle in our elections on behalf of both parties  because if republicans are allowed to get away with winning an election with support from russia  what stops democrats from getting help in  from china or a different nation  the answer is nothing  because if republicans whine about it they ll be nothing more than hypocrites if the election results are allowed to stand and trump is allowed to take office  the american people will have surrendered our political process to foreign powers  we will no longer control our own destiny and will instead be driven by propaganda from our enemies  that may be okay with republicans  but the american people as a whole should be outraged and should demand a new election immediately featured image via screenshot
