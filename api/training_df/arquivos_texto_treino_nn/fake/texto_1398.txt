the amount of corruption we have seen in donald trump s rise and presidency has been alarming  and it s not going to stop anytime soon even after suspiciously firing his fbi director during an explosive investigation and having several high profile personal lawsuits  scandals and conflicts of interest  the republican party still has yet to hold trump accountable for his faults  whenever the gop has had a chance to distance itself from trump and do the right thing  spineless republicans have failed to stand up and put their country first in a friday column in the new york times  columnist paul krugman brilliantly pointed out the republican party s failing during trump s presidency  krugman states that today s gop has become more about tax cuts for the rich than anything else  and conservatives will defend it at all costs  arguing that republicans no longer care about their country or its constitution  krugman wrote  this structure rewards  indeed insists on  absolute fealty  what this means is that nearly all republicans in today s congress are apparatchiks  political creatures with no higher principle beyond party loyalty  we ve certainly seen this play out in the way that speaker of the house paul ryan and other prominent republicans refuse to hold erratic trump accountable even as his scandals and behavior put the country at risk  but even if trump were to be impeached  krugman warns   the threat to the republic will be far from over   krugman states that trump s idiocy may have actually helped the country stay away from more sinister republican values  in a perverse way  we should count ourselves lucky that trump is as terrible as he is  the point is that given the character of the republican party  we d be well on the way to autocracy if the man in the white house had even slightly more self control  trump may have done himself in  but it can still happen here  we hate to say it  but he s probably right featured image via mark wilson   getty images
