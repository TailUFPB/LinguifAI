the drama just never ends for poor fox news  thanks to the shady shenanigans of roger ailes and rupert murdoch  it seems they re guilty of far more than rampant sexual harassment of female employees  ailes loved to find out where other organizations were getting their info on fox  to that end  he had private investigators get into the phone records of journalists  like those who work at media matters for america media matters  official mission is to act as a watchdog on u s  media  however  for a long time  it seemed their whole mission was to expose the dishonesty that spews forth from the lying monster that is fox news  one such reporter  joe strupp  would repeatedly name anonymous fox sources in his stories  and  well  of course ailes couldn t have that  he had to know who these sources were  probably to harass  threaten  and then fire them for good measure  fox news  legal minion  according to new york magazine  hired private investigators to obtain strupp s phone records in   these weren t just phone records from the office  though  they also got hold of records from his home phone and personal cell phone through what nymag is terming   legally questionable means  that probably means it was illegal  but brandi  the legal minion in question  denies that this ever happened  however  one fox executive told nymag anyway  this was the culture  getting phone records doesn t make anybody blink  even if  and when  it s illegal to do so  apparently bradley beychock  president of media matters  spoke to the daily beast about these allegations  it appears that strupp wasn t fox s only target  according to beychock  we know there are allegations of email and phone records being obtained  but do not know precisely how  it s part of our internal review now  he also said  we are not sure of how widespread the issue may be in regards to our employees  however  in addition to joe strupp there is at least one other current media matters colleague who we have reason to believe also had their phone records obtained  in most places  private investigators cannot obtain someone s phone records without their consent  and people rarely give their consent for that  they can also obtain a court order or a subpoena to do it  however  it s not likely media matters  employees even knew their communications had been hacked and given to fox fox would not have wanted to wait for the courts  because chances were they knew the courts would shoot them down  this smacks of a company that hopes they could do this without getting caught at this point  fox news and its parent   century fox  are in way too deep  their  ahem  questionable business practices are fireballing them right into hell  as crooks and liars asked at the end of their story  how far are murdoch   co  willing to go to clean this all up featured image by frederick m  brown getty images
