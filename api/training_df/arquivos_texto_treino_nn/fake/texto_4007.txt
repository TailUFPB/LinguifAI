with just ten days to go until the election  one would expect that donald trump and his campaign would be in a flurry of final pushes to win over undecided voters  and maybe  possibly a final push towards really reaching minorities  instead  his campaign is just as screwed up now as it was when it launched  according to an in depth look at the campaign courtesy of new york magazine  perhaps most damning is that trump has more or less told his own campaign manager how he really feels about people  even his own followers  i got really mad at him the other day  trump campaign manager kellyanne conway told me  he said   i think we ll win  and if not  that s okay too   and i said   it s not okay  you can t say that  your dry cleaning bill is like the annual salaries of the people who came to your rallies  and they believe in you   he shrugged off all his followers in that conversation  as well as conway  while a ton of his followers are pretty disgusting people  they re still his followers  and he really ought to give half a damn about them  honestly  though  why would a narcissist like trump care about anyone  the biggest reason the campaign has failed to reach various sectors of the population is  in large part  because trump thinks he can just do whatever he wants but that s not all  it s actually to be expected that trump wouldn t care about anyone but himself  however  he doesn t know what to do with all these followers  all he really knows how to do is keep them fired up in their righteous anger  in doing so  their blind devotion feeds his ego and helps keep him in the spotlight and instead of listening to guidance from his advisers  he s increasingly using the campaign just to bolster his brands  his style  which bugged the hell out of his former manager  paul manafort  continues to bug the hell out the rest of his staff  the only exception might be steve bannon  who may have his own plans for all those supporters whom trump is throwing under the bus some say that trump can t handle actually taking advice  including manafort s advice to keep a low profile and force the media to focus on hillary  his ego couldn t handle it   said one republican close to the campaign   hillary understood that trump needed to be the focus   as his poll numbers climbed  trump felt he didn t need to listen to manafort   the worst part about trump is when he was ahead   the prominent republican said   he d get into the lead and then he would veer off and start defending his interests and his honor and it had nothing to do with what people actually care about  he s not disciplined  and his ego is what fueled his feud with the khans  who are a gold star family that lost their son in iraq in   that was all about his ego   he didn t even know what a gold star family was before he decided the khans were his enemy  the election is about the american people  it s not about you   manafort told trump  according to a person briefed on the conversation  trump countered with breitbart s report on khan s purported belief in sharia   he s not running for president   manafort shot back   the clintons did this to us to waste our time getting off message  and it worked   it worked very well  everything anyone has ever done in this campaign to get trump off message and onto whatever just bruised his poor widdle ego again has worked trump might well be looking to the future   but it s very likely not a future in the white house that he sees  there have been rumors floating around that he s using this campaign to start his own media company  his son in law  jared kushner  is busy compiling  million email addresses and credit card numbers of loyal trumpkins  which new york magazine speculates could form the basis of a new trump media company while kushner denies all of this  a spokesman for a republican who declined to be named told the magazine  kushner has approached wall street bankers and pitched ideas for media start ups   how do we monetize this   he s asked   through a spokesperson  kushner denied having such meetings   whether it s his own media company  or promoting his own business interests and ego  or both  it s clearer now than ever that trump doesn t care what happens to his followers  let alone whether or not he wins  he wants the spotlight  how he gets it is of no consequence  and what he does with it is of even less consequence  this could be good news for us because it could solidify hillary s win  but it lays bare the sheer lack of character that exists within trump featured image by sara d  davis via getty images
