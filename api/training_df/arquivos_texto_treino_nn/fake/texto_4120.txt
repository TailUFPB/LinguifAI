we ve been drowning in the final stretch of this presidential election cycle since august  at three weeks out  both candidates should have their ground games well established  and even be working overtime in a lot of cases  to reach as many voters as possible  apparently  though  none of this is true for trump  like his outward campaign  his ground game has no cohesion or organization at all  and what few volunteers there are don t seem to care about the actual business of campaigning for a presidential candidate  hese people cared more about the reality show trump had created  then  the reality of the campaign itself  that s what scott david shapiro  who maintains a news blog on medium  said after he embarked on a suicide mission to see if trump s ground game was as  big league  as he was making it sound first things first   it took trump forever to open up local campaign offices a move especially perplexing in swing states where he needs a ground game and shapiro wanted to see just what was going on after he heard that such offices were finally opening his first stop was in mesa  arizona  not quite a swing state  but in play because trump is so awful  he immediately ran into problems when he got there  he had an address  but no phone number and the arizona republican party didn t have a number either  strange  shapiro soldiered on with the info he had  and this is what happened  hen i arrived at  s  power road  i found a large office complex  with no cars in the parking lot  this struck me as odd considering the office was supposed to be open  days a week  but i pressed on  finding myself standing in front of suite  this was supposed to be the trump victory office  but i stood there confused as there was nothing on door indicating it as such  then  i peered through the half drawn blinds  noticing a ceiling fan was spinning inside  so  i took a deep breath  reached for the handle and opened the door  walking right into a completely empty room  wtf  he went on to say that he finally found someone in there  but that one  single person could only say   i think you re in the wrong place  um  what anyway  strike one  and shapiro was off to find the next office  which had just opened up in long beach  ca  at the cambodian cultural center  hokay  then  that sounds like a really odd place for a presidential campaign s local office  but minority outreach  maybe shapiro had to go there twice to actually find the office  and when he did  here was no  big league  ground game to be found  this office was strictly the minors  neither of the tiny  two staff operation had ever run a campaign office before  and it showed  they were selling yard signs for  bucks a pop when they should be given out for free for fuck s sake i told them i had previous campaign experience  and they practically rolled out the red carpet for me  completely unvetted  they placed me at the front desk  where i sat by my lonesome for an hour  in this office  he was very quickly tapped to participate on a three person  debate the debate  panel when nobody even knew his name  he volunteered there for two weeks  astonished that all the bluster from trump supporters and campaign staff had amounted to a severe lack of anything resembling a ground game finally  a friend of shapiro s in tampa mentioned a trump victory office there  and oh my god  trump is opening these offices all over florida  right where they need to be  so shapiro packed his bags again and headed down to florida  hen i arrived at the trump victory south tampa office  i realized there was nothing to fear but fear itself  unbelievably  this office had even less going on in it then freaking long beach  sure  there were more staff members  but volunteers were few and far between day after day  the excuses for the lack of bodies started to pile up  ranging from republicans were too busy because they had jobs to hurricane matthew s imminent arrival  but the hurricane came and went with nary a raindrop in tampa  and then the  access hollywood  tape that proved trump is a sexual predator came out  and the office just ground to a halt  according to shapiro  excuses for why people weren t coming in to volunteer turned to great weather and sports  but the fact was that the  boots on the ground  that trump implied were everywhere just weren t anywhere it s not just shapiro s blog post  he tweeted about his progress throughout this project  and also found someone else who was trying to locate trump s  ground game  yet  when it came to debate parties  turnout was yuuuuge  showing shapiro that trump s supporters are  all talk and no action   this was true even for the second debate  which was after the  access hollywood  tape came out  they re there for the glitz and glamour  but when it comes to doing real work  they avoid it like the plague featured image by kena betancur via getty images
