ah  the ultimate trump fangirl  with the exception of sarah palin  gag   both of them are enamored of trump  and it s not hard to believe that they might even think they re in love with him  palin s just an idiot about it  though  ann coulter  though  she s a very cunning racist closed mind who wants trump to win so badly that she would make voting rights for every group of people here disappear entirely  except her own  of course  maybe last night s tweet about it was probably one of the most egregious of ideas for how to ensure that we crown king trump if only people with at least  grandparents born in america were voting  trump would win in a  state landslide   ann coulter   anncoulter  november     the funny thing is that if we went by that standard  trump s own kids couldn t vote for him  trump himself couldn t even vote   all his grandparents came from europe  as did his mother  which excludes tiffany  so even his grandkids  if they were of age  couldn t vote for him and then there s melania  who worked in this country illegally  for all we know  she stole a modeling job from an american model who badly needed the work  going by coulter s logic  she shouldn t be allowed to cast a vote for her husband  but then again  trump s logic about immigrants would send melania back to slovenia  since there s a chance she stole a job from a hardworking american then there are all the people with four grandparents that were born here who still think trump is a racist prick and would never vote for him  my family history here goes all the way back to before we were even a country  in fact  my family was here almost  years before the declaration of independence was signed  plenty of others like me feel the same  but of course a racist like coulter didn t think of that actually  it s very likely that all she thought of was eliminating the latino vote  because many latinos are first  or second generation  and tend to vote democratic  she didn t think of all the members of  her kind  who are likewise first  and second generation  who couldn t vote at all if her idea became law and what of her own family history  she considers herself  and her family   settlers  rather than  immigrants   they were immigrants   she would qualify to vote under her idea  so of course most other white conservatives would  she didn t think this through at all  or maybe she did  but she s so ignorant about the makeup of this country that she has no idea what she just said  she s gone from being an annoyance to being one hell of a joke featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images
