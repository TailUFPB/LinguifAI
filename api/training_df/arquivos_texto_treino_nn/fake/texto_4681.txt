september     was not only the day of the biggest terrorist attack to hit american soil  it was also a test of politicians  especially in the bush administration and those serving new york  hillary clinton was new york s junior senator at the time and in a newly uncovered video  she became livid at the bush administration s lies  particularly about air quality after the attacks first  a little background  the attacks of   had devastating affects for the country  it  after all  was the catalyst for two of the longest wars in america s history  nearly   people died as a direct result of the planes hitting the twin towers  but as of last year  nearly   people have filed eligibility reports claiming they became sick in the aftermath some of the victims weren t even in new york at the time of the attacks  but they felt a need to help  so they traveled to new york  it s understandable if those people felt it was safe  after all  the bush administration told us it was a week after two hijacked passenger jets were flown into the towers of the world trade center  killing   people    died in the pentagon in washington dc and  were killed when a united airlines plane came down in a field in pennsylvania    former bush environmental protection agency head  christine todd  whitman issued a statement  it said   i am glad to reassure the people of new york   that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink  three days after the attacks  whitman  who had previously been the republican governor of new jersey  told reporters   the good news continues to be that air samples we have taken have all been at levels that cause us no concern  source  the guardianwhitman hasn t exactly acknowledged that she lied to the american people  but she has admitted that she s very sorry  i m very sorry that people are sick   she said   i m very sorry that people are dying and if the epa and i in any way contributed to that  i m sorry  we did the very best we could at the time with the knowledge we had  she added   every time it comes around to the anniversary i cringe  because i know people will bring up my name  they blame me  they say that i lied and that people died because i lied   people have died because i made a mistake  i guess that s better than most members of the least introspective presidential administration in modern history hillary clinton saw through it and she was livid  but as cnn s guest  edward pilkington of the guardian  in the video below commented  she was also very well educated on the topic  he called her a  sponge for information  here s the video we know that hillary clinton is incredibly smart  that she does like to immerse herself in knowledge and in research  but this video shows her as incredibly passionate when it comes to her constituents  and isn t that we want in our leaders featured image via video screen capture
