donald trump is taking a lot of fire over the letter his alleged physician wrote about his health  but it got hilariously worse on thursday dr  jennifer gunter appeared on cnn with chris cuomo to discuss the letter  which was written in december by dr  harold bornstein in lieu of an actual medical report in her own examination of the letter  gunter questioned bornstein s terminology and picked apart how he diagnosed the republican nominee throughout  being able to unequivocally state that somebody would be the  healthiest individual  is just not a factual statement  right   gunter said   you would have had to examine every other president to be able to say that  so that s incorrect  and then gunter hilariously hammered how bornstein described trump s lab test results  lab results aren t reported as being  astonishingly excellent  or not   we give lab values of positive or negative  then there s the fact that he says all of mr  trump s results are positive   which  of course  would be a bad thing  when i tell someone they have gonorrhea  when they have a positive test for gonorrhea  they re not happy about that  that s not  astonishingly excellent  nope  i m guessing they would not be  doc   cuomo replied   interesting example you give there  so has donald trump ever had gonorrhea  it s definitely a question worth asking since trump brags about how many women he has slept with  in   trump told radio host howard stern that sleeping around was his  personal vietnam  and that he was  lucky  that he didn t contract any sexually transmitted diseases of course  trump would never admit it if he did contract an std  so who is to say he didn t lie when he talked to stern after all  all of his test results were apparently  positive  according to his physician  we don t know why donald trump lost  pounds   he says he likes to eat kfc a lot  so that s a concern   gunter continued   that s really important  you can t put a piece of medical information out there and not follow it up  gunter then called for bornstein to explain the inaccuracies stated in the letter  there s a lot of inaccuracies  and i think that the doctor should explain why he wrote it that way  if that s his letter and that s how he writes  what s the big deal about saying   this is me  and gosh  i made a mistake in saying which section that doesn t exist at lenox hospital that i thought i was in   so i think there s a lot of a inconsistencies  and you have a document that s this important   it should be accurate  i want my health information to be accurate  i want the information i write about someone else to be accurate  and i guess we all wonder  if this part s inaccurate  what else is inaccurate  too  here s the video via twitter doctor lays out problems with donald trump s health letter   there s a lot of inaccuracies  https   t co  https   t co   new day   newday  august    donald trump and his minions continue to spread false claims about hillary clinton s health  it s only fair to start asking questions about his own  and that means trump s doctor note is fair game the fact is  however  that hillary has released her own detailed medical report written by her doctor while trump continues to hide his own medical history from the voting public  he hoped that a bullshit letter would be enough  but going after hillary s health only brought up new questions about his own  voters deserve to see trump s real medical history  if he is as healthy as he brags he is then he should have nothing to fear  but just like his taxes  trump clearly doesn t want his medical history revealed because it could damage him even more than he has done to himself already featured image via screen capture
