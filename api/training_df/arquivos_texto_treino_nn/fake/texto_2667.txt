more than one major retail chain has decided to drop ivanka trump s fashion line  and while they don t cite specific politics in their reasons for doing so  many believe that falling sales were prompted by politics  which  in turn  prompted the chains to drop her  the brand  though  had yet to issue a statement on this until recently it s just slightly ridiculous  the ivanka trump brand continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support  leading us to experience significant year over year revenue growth in   we believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates  but the integrity it maintains  integrity   really  in any case  a company can t survive on integrity alone  if enough stores dump her brand  her fashion line goes under  end of but that wasn t all they said  they also used the statement to play up the diversity of the company and the professionalism of the women behind it  the women behind the brand represent a diverse group of professionals and we are proud to say that the ivanka trump brand continues to embody the principles upon which it was founded  it is a company built to inspire women with solution oriented offerings  created to celebrate and service the many aspects of their lives  that doesn t really address the brand getting dumped by high end retailers like nordstrom and neiman marcus  and it also doesn t address what the company is doing to mitigate this  even if they never specifically say they re working to mitigate it  where are they going with the brand  are they in talks with anyone else that could replace nordstrom and neiman marcus the statement is reminiscent of trump s spokespeople  and also could be suggesting that they have no idea what they re going to do if more chains drop them featured image by aaron p  bernstein via getty images
