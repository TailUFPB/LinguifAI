in a deeply disturbing moment during press secretary sean spicer s latest bonkers press briefing  he read verbatim a quote given to him by trump that admitted the sitting president of the united states only believes facts when they make him look good  everything else is  fake news  spicer was asked during the briefing about the latest jobs report which showed america gaining a very healthy number of jobs   there is no evidence to suggest this is due to donald trump  and in fact  it merely fits with the pattern of unrelenting job growth that came to define obama s presidency  trump has thus far done little to help the economy and nothing to help middle class workers  again suggesting this economic growth isn t the result of his presidency but merely his good fortune for having inherited a booming economy from his democratic predecessor  despite the fact that there is little evidence of trump s influence  his administration has been taking victory laps over the economic news  a reporter correctly noted that it s a bit odd that trump would be so willing to trust the jobs report this time when he has previously gone on record to suggest that jobs reports under obama were fabricated and false   a claim which  in   earned him a  pants on fire  politifact rating  why the sudden change the answer is so obvious that even trump had no problem admitting it  he only believes the news when it benefits him  they may have been phony in the past  but it s very real now  q  trump has said jobs rpts are  phony   what about now spicer   they may have been phony in the past  but it s very real now   via  msnbc pic twitter com   kyle griffin     march    than find that mindset pathological and terrifying  spicer thought it was hilarious  even more troubling  the reporters in the room burst into laughter too  everyone laughing should be ashamed  it wasn t a joke  trump is signaling the fact that his administration will be run on the premise that he defines what is  real  and what is  fake   if it s pro trump  it s legitimate  if it s inconvenient  it s  fake news  created by the  deep state  and the  liberal media  out to get him that s the kind of paranoid delusions that quickly spiral into fascism  and spicer is giggling about it featured image via twitter
