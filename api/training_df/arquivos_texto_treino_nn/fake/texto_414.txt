we recently reported on how the far right is waging war against a dying breed  congressional republicans who at least attempt to be compassionate and reasonable in their policy making  at the top of the list for these far right lunatics  antics has been rep  charlie dent  r pa   who is the co chair of the moderate tuesday group in the house republican conference  dent has obviously been feeling the pressure from his less reasonable comrades  as he will not seek re election in the  midterms this really isn t that surprising  increasingly  the ultra conservative freedom caucus has gained power in the house republican conference  and they and their followers have absolutely no problem ousting people who won t fall in line with their extreme far right agenda  it was this group that unseated former house speaker eric cantor  and forced the most recent former house speaker  john boehner  to resign  so  perhaps dent has the right idea here  he says of his decision  i ve worked to instill stability  certainty and predictability in washington  i ve fought to fulfill the basic functions of government  like keeping the lights on and preventing default  regrettably  that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction  disorder and chaos  this  of course  is likely a nod toward those who are directly attacking and threatening dent and other members of his tuesday group caucus  they see no way out when it comes to sustained political attacks by trump minions and other nationalist types with alarming far right views now  as for how this helps us on the left  den t district is a swing district  if we get our act together and run a good candidate in a good race  get your act together  democrats  as the gop eats their own  these so called  moderates  who aren t even bothering to run again out of fear of getting primaried by the far right can become democratic seats  they are in swing districts  not solid red ones  the best way to  resist is to make sure we have a democratic house of representatives featured image via chip somodevilla getty images
