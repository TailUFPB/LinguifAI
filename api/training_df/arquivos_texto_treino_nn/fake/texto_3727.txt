earlier this year  president obama joked that as soon as he was out of office he would set aside three to four months to sleep off the previous eight years  but those plans are officially canceled thanks to donald trump  months ago obama  like the rest of us  expected hillary clinton to win the election  past staying in washington  d c  while sasha finished school  the obamas  futures were not set in stone  now  out of a sense of duty to his country  the president says he will do what he must to save the democratic party in the november  edition of the new yorker  obama says that he d be done if hillary clinton was going to be our next president  but trump s  landslide victory  gives him no choice but to stay in politics for a while  i think that if hillary clinton had won the election then i d just turn over the keys   he said   we d make sure the briefing books were in order and out we go  i think now i have some responsibility to at least offer my counsel to those who will continue to be elected officials about how the d n c  can help rebuild  how state parties and progressive organizations can work together  but don t worry  republicans  the president made it clear that he won t be declaring himself emperor for life  no matter how many scary right wing conspiracy websites told you he would not long before the election  valerie jarrett  the senior aide with the closest relationship to the obamas  asked the president   don t you sometimes wish you could run for another term  i m sure you could win  and there s so much more to do  obama had no appetite for superseding the twenty second amendment   i said no  because  look  at some point you lose touch   he recounted   by being in this room  at some point  you get worn down  at some point  you start getting into bad habits  i told her   we re playing on house money here  we weren t supposed to be here  for us to have had this opportunity and to be able to make this much change  as much as we wish that we could have gotten everything done  it s remarkable  what will be obama s role in the trumpocalypse  that much is unclear   but the party will be much better off with him involved than otherwise featured image via getty images carsten koall
