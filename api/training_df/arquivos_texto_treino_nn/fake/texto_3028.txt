between trump s daily tantrums before i ve even had my goddamn coffee and white power barbie  tomi lahren s  surprisingly hilarious meltdown over someone finding her old tweets about the moisture levels of her vagina  something about drowning    one thing is for certain  while trump s america is going to more resemble a gasoline soaked kitten fire than a legitimate political regime  we re going to have plenty of laughs for the next four years   at least until our nation utter its final  agonized  mew  trump s  fake news  twitter tantrum stretched into yet another day on friday  it now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued    trump tweeted with his trademark extra long ellipsis indicating that part deux will be coming sometime in the next year or so it now turns out that the phony allegations against me were put together by my political opponents and a failed spy afraid of being sued    donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    has always been clear that the information came from a former british intelligence operative who currently does opposition research but this is apparently new information to trump  who  six minutes later  jumped to the  but daddy putin says  defense totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives  both democrats and republicans   fake news  russia says nothing exists  probably  donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    has  indeed  said they have nothing on the man for whom their leader ordered an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign as well as a far reaching hack of donald trump s political opponents in what seventeen intelligence agencies agree was part of a plot to install the donald in the white house  they also say that the kremlin does not engage in spying  so we totally know that is true five minutes later  he indicated that intelligence agencies knowingly released false information to attack him because he s a poor tortured widdle guy everyone s out to get and the world looks so unfair from the top of his golden tower released by  intelligence  even knowing there is no proof  and never will be  my people will have a full report on hacking within  days   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    minutes later  it was time for trump s favorite activity  questioning the legitimacy of political candidates what are hillary clinton s people complaining about with respect to the f b i  based on the information they had she should never     donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    been allowed to run   guilty as hell  they were very nice to her  she lost because she campaigned in the wrong states   no enthusiasm   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    what hillary clinton s people are complaining about  is that fbi director james comey broke precedent and used his position to interfere in the election in a clear effort to aid trump multiple times and then  having spewed a literal pile of garbage  trump decided it was over  he had won  our hero boldly declared that the  unaffordable  care act will soon be history   donald j  trump   realdonaldtrump  january    the crowd went wild   or at least that s the way it looks inside trump s rather deranged mind  the rest of the world just mocked him  realdonaldtrump speaking of phony allegations  remember when you said

kenklippenstein  january     realdonaldtrump she had a point pic twitter com   simon hedlin   simonhedlin  january    realdonaldtrump fyi you tweet like this woman has you waking up in a cold sweat every day at   maria mora   mariamelee  january    you re probably wondering what trump is distracting from  maybe it s an old howard stern recording in which someone reminds him that he says he likes to go to russia to have sex with women because they  have no morals  that s pretty interesting considering the current situation  but it s probably the recent bombshell report by a bbc correspondent that there are at least four sources for what trump is calling fake news  according to paul wood in a recent op ed claims about a russian blackmail tape were made in one of a series of reports written by a former british intelligence agent  as a member of   he had been posted to the uk s embassy in moscow and now runs a consultancy giving advice on doing business in russia  he spoke to a number of his old contacts in the fsb  the successor to the kgb  paying some of them for information   the former  agent is not the only source for the claim about russian kompromat on the president elect  back in august  a retired spy told me he had been informed of its existence by  the head of an east european intelligence agency  later  i used an intermediary to pass some questions to active duty cia officers dealing with the case file  they would not speak to me directly  i got a message back that there was  more than one tape    audio and video   on  more than one date   in  more than one place  in the ritz carlton in moscow and also in st petersburg  and that the material was  of a sexual nature   the claims of russian kompromat on mr trump were  credible   the cia believed   last april  the cia director was shown intelligence that worried him  it was  allegedly  a tape recording of a conversation about money from the kremlin going into the us presidential campaign it was passed to the us by an intelligence agency of one of the baltic states the cia cannot act domestically against american citizens so a joint counter intelligence taskforce was created  a lawyer  outside the department of justice but familiar with the case  told me that three of mr trump s associates were the subject of the inquiry   but it s clear this is about trump   he said audio  and  video trump spent well over a half hour attacking hillary clinton and screaming about how the kremlin is right  he did this a week before he officially becomes president  is this what it s going to be like for the next four
