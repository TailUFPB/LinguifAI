the majority of donald trump s campaign is built on xenophobia  but while his supporters are ranting non stop about immigrants  trump himself is taking full advantage of the flaws in our immigration system   at least according to a report in mother jones  in which trump is accused of human trafficking  my words  not theirs  are those words a little harsh  well  according to the report  trump model management has been using foreign models who arrived on tourist visas  not work visas  yes  that s a violation of federal law  it gets worse  though  the models are what could be considered indentured servants because much of what they make goes right back into the pockets of donald trump founded in   trump model management  has risen to the top of the fashion market   boasts the trump organization s website  and has a name  that symbolizes success   according to a financial disclosure filed by his campaign in may  donald trump earned nearly   million from the company  in which he holds an  percent stake  meanwhile  some former trump models say they barely made any money working for the agency because of the high fees for rent and other expenses that were charged by the company mother jones interviewed three of trump s former models  all of whom arrived in this country without proper documentation to be working at all  all of whom compared working for trump to  modern day slavery   two of those models make the claim that the agency urged them to lie two of the former trump models said trump s agency encouraged them to deceive customs officials about why they were visiting the united states and told them to lie on customs forms about where they intended to live  anna said she received a specific instruction from a trump agency representative   if they ask you any questions  you re just here for meetings  that s not all  the models complained that they were forced to share a two bedroom apartment with at least  other models  all at very inflated prices  most of the models are under age  it is like modern day slavery   canadian born model rachel  blais said  adding that  most of the girls in the apartment that were not american didn t have a work visa  we re hoarded into these small spaces   kate recalled   the apartment was like a sweatshop  i was by far the oldest in the house at the ripe old age of    anna added source  new york daily newsa few months ago  the daily mail reported on a former model who claims that she should have earned    a year working for trump s agency  but she took home less than    in three years  she s suing trump s agency it s even rumored that trump s wife melania came to the u s  illegally neither mother jones nor the daily mail used the words  human trafficking   but according to the united nations  the definition certainly applies while there s no evidence in the report of prostitution and definitely no evidence of removal of organs  there was almost certainly deception  fraud and exploitation  trump would never get away with paying american models so poorly  which is exactly why he imports them next time you hear trump and his supporters chant   lock her up   remember this story  not only is trump not fit to be president  he s not fit to be out of prison featured image via stephen lovekin getty images
